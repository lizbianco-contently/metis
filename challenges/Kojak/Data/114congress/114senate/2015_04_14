Mr. President, this week looks to be a busy one in the \nSenate. We have a lot of important legislation to consider. We are \nhoping our friends across the aisle will work with us to do so in an \nexpeditious manner. For instance, we will begin the process of \nfinishing our work on the balanced budget before the Senate, which the \nSenate passed just before Easter. Passing that balanced budget was a \nbig moment for the new Senate. For years, the budget process was \nignored almost entirely in this Chamber, and the idea of a balanced \nbudget passing was basically unthinkable. But now the Senate is under \nnew management. Things are changing. Soon we will conference with the \nHouse to work out a final budget that will be passed by the full \nCongress. That is just the latest example of Congress getting back to \nwork. I know a lot of Americans are happy to see that.\n  But the budget is far from the only item on the Senate's near-term \nagenda. The Senate will soon consider bipartisan legislation that is \ndesigned to ensure that seniors on Medicare don't lose access to their \ndoctors. It is a solution to a broken Medicare payment system that has \nvexed congressional leaders of both parties for years. It would mean an \nend to the annual exercise of Congress passing a temporary fix to the \nproblem one year and then coming right back to the very same cliff the \nnext year without actually solving the underlying problem.\n  So the fact that we have a bipartisan reform bill here is significant \nin itself. The fact that it passed the House overwhelmingly is even \nmore significant. It doesn't mean the legislation is perfect. It \ndoesn't mean we won't have some disagreements about it. But I do think \nthe bill deserves a vote, and it is my hope that the Senate will soon \ntake one.\n  We will also continue to work to pass the bipartisan Justice for \nVictims of Trafficking Act. It is legislation designed to prevent women \nand children from being sold into modern-day slavery. It was reported \nout of the Judiciary Committee with the support of every single \nDemocrat, and the Senate took up this bill with the consent of every \nsingle Democrat. There is no reason they should now turn around and \nfilibuster this antislavery bill at this point. As a victims advocate \nput it, Senate Democrats should stop choosing a phantom problem over \nreal victims.\n  A large, bipartisan majority of the Senate has voted repeatedly to \nend a very regrettable Democratic filibuster of this antislavery bill. \nIt will only take a few more votes from our friends across the aisle to \nbring hope to children in chains and women suffering in the shadows. So \nwe have been reaching out to our friends to work with them to end this \nDemocratic filibuster of human rights legislation. The Senate should \npass this bipartisan bill right away, and as soon as that happens, we \nwill turn to the Loretta Lynch nomination.\n  Committees in the new Senate are also working hard to advance more \nbipartisan legislation. We already saw the Intelligence Committee vote \n14 to 1 to approve bipartisan legislation aimed at protecting the \npersonal and financial information of middle-class Americans from cyber \ncriminals. Over in the Finance Committee, we see the top Republican and \nthe top Democrat continue to discuss the best way forward to increase \nAmerican exports with new trade legislation. Today, we will see another \nproduct of negotiations between a top committee Republican and a top \ncommittee Democrat--legislation aimed at reforming our education \nsystem--considered in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee. We hope to bring all of these issues to the Senate floor for \ndebate in the very near future.\n  Another important bipartisan bill that will be considered by \ncommittee today is the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. The Foreign \nRelations Committee is set to mark that up today. The legislation is \nsupported by a large number of Democrats, and it is no wonder why. The \nbill is aimed at giving Congress and the American people a say--a say--\nin reviewing and approving an international agreement\n\n[[Page S2142]]\n\nwith such wide-ranging consequences. And the American people should \nhave a say.\n  The interim agreement we saw from the administration would not only \nallow Iran to continue to enrich uranium and retain thousands of \ncentrifuges but also allow it to continue researching and developing \neven more advanced centrifuges. In other words, it seems more like an \nagreement built around Iran's terms rather than a plan to advance what \nshould be our national goal, which is ending Iran's nuclear program.\n  It is a matter of great concern not just to our country but to the \nentire world. The concerns of our allies and partners with regard to \nIran's aggressive behavior throughout the Middle East were made clear \nwhen I recently led a Senate delegation to Israel, Jordan, Iraq, and \nAfghanistan.\n  This is a gravely important matter, and the American people aren't \njust spectators here; they and the representatives they elect deserve a \nseat at the table too. Today's bipartisan action in the Foreign \nRelations Committee will help ensure they do.\n  As I mentioned earlier, there will be a lot of activity in the Senate \nthis week on a range of issues. It is good for the functioning of the \nSenate, but it also helps underline one clear point: The new Congress \nis back to work again on behalf of the American people.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/14/senate-section/article/S2142-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, people at home cannot see it, but every desk \nhere on the Senate floor has a name on it. Mine says ``Mr. Reid.'' \nRight behind me is one that says ``Mrs. Murray.'' To my right is one \nthat says ``Mr. McConnell.'' Why do I mention this? Today is National \nEqual Pay Day, a day that symbolizes how far into 2015 American women \nmust work to earn what their male counterparts earned in 2014. That day \nis today. Women basically worked for nothing until today. This pay \ndisparity between men and women doing the same work is known as the \nwage gap. Unlike the desks here in the Chamber, the wage gap does not \nbear a visible stamp of ownership, but make no mistake--Republicans in \nCongress absolutely own the wage gap. Their names are all over it. The \nRepublicans' refusal to address income disparities makes them \nresponsible for the additional 3 months and 14 days that American women \nwork to earn what their male counterparts earn doing the exact same \nwork at the exact same time.\n  Who are these working American women who are being forced to work for \nmonths just to catch up on wages? They are our daughters, our wives, \nour granddaughters, and our neighbors. Republicans' repeated \nfilibusters of equal pay legislation makes them responsible for working \nwomen in our families having to make due on 78 cents for every dollar \ntheir male counterparts make.\n  Democrats have tried repeatedly to pass Senator Mikulski's Paycheck \nFairness Act, which would take away the disparity. It is pretty simple: \nIf a man and a woman do the same work--no different--they should be \npaid the same amount of money. Very simple. We repeatedly tried to pass \nthis simple legislation. This legislation provides working American \nwomen with the tools they need to close the wage gap. Yet, time and \ntime again, Republicans have stonewalled this most basic issue of \nfairness. Five years ago, the Republicans filibustered the Paycheck \nFairness Act. Two years later, the Republicans did the same thing. Last \nyear, they blocked the bill two times. Just last month in the budget \ndebate, Senator Mikulski gave the Republicans another chance. Once \nagain, the Republicans blocked it. Five times in 5 years Republicans \nhave blocked equal pay for women. Five times in 5 years Republicans \nhave told their very own sisters, daughters, and wives, and, of course, \ntheir grandchildren that they are not interested in fixing this unfair \nincome disparity. That is why I say the Republicans own the wage gap. \nThey own it.\n  Today, as we recognize Equal Pay Day, I hope my Republican colleagues \ncome to their senses and address this injustice which is hurting \nmillions of American families.\n  American women deserve equal pay for equal work. My daughter deserves \nequal pay for equal work.\n  Would the Presiding Officer announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/14/senate-section/article/S2142-3", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week on Thursday, the evil forces of \nnature struck in Fairdale, IL. Since that moment of terrible loss--two \nlives and many injuries, terrible property destruction--we have seen \nthe better angels of our nature come forward.\n  This is an all-too-common picture in my part of the world in central \nIllinois and downstate Illinois. This is the devastation from a tornado \nof dramatic power and strength. Two twisters--one of them a category \nEF-4, with wind speeds of up to 200 miles an hour--tore through DeKalb \nand Ogle Counties and badly damaged the towns of Fairdale and Rochelle \nlast Thursday evening. That picture tells part of the story of the \ntornadoes' path, where giant trees were uprooted, homes ripped from \ntheir foundations. The damage is stunning.\n\n  Sadly, two women, neighbors who lived in Fairdale, lost their lives \nin the event. Geraldine Schultz and a close friend and neighbor, \nJacklyn Klosa, both fell victim to the tornado that struck their homes. \nNeighbors say the two friends were inseparable in life and both \ndeparted life at the same moment.\n  The tight-knit communities of Fairdale and Rochelle are pulling \ntogether today to help victims sort through the rubble. One tornado \ntracked a 25-mile continuous path from near Rochelle through Fairdale, \nto near Belvidere.\n  This is a photo of what was, until Thursday, a popular restaurant in \nthe town of Rochelle, IL, about 80 miles from Chicago. Twelve people, \nincluding diners and staff, were inside Grubsteakers Restaurant when \nthe tornado struck. It was a miracle. Everybody made it into the \nbasement just in time before the twister hit. They all survived, though \nthey were trapped in the basement for an hour and a half waiting for \nrescue crews to clear them.\n  A few people had to be treated for cuts and bruises. Everyone was \ncovered in thick dust that had blown from overhead, but they lived \nthrough it, a terrible, terrifying ordeal. On Friday I spoke and again \non Saturday with the director, the head of the Illinois Emergency \nManagement Agency, James Joseph. Governor Rauner was out at the scene \nthe next day after the tornado. We sent our staff there to monitor any \npossible Federal assistance that might be coordinated with the State \nand local effort.\n  We are continuing to gather the information together to see if there \nis a possibility of Federal help, but I have been very wary because of \ntwo recent experiences in Illinois--in Washington, IL, and Harrisburg--\nwhere tornado damage there looked so devastating and still did not meet \nthe threshold qualification for Federal assistance.\n  When I spoke with Rochelle Mayor Chet Olson, and DeKalb County board \nchairman Mark Pietrowski, I told them to do their homework and keep \ntrack of their expenses but that it was a long shot for Federal help. I \nmade it clear the delegation and I stand ready to help in any way we \ncan, particularly working with the Governor.\n\n[[Page S2143]]\n\n  As is so often the case when a disaster such as this strikes, the \nfirst responders, friends, and family members wasted no time rushing to \nthe aid of people whose homes and businesses were damaged. I have no \ndoubt the people in Fairdale, Rochelle, and all of the other areas that \nwere struck will clean up and rebuild. They will mourn the loss of \nlife, they will heal the wounds of those who were injured, and they \nwill start tomorrow to make another day.\n  For the families of the women who lost their lives and for everybody \nwho lost homes and property, our thoughts are with you.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, tomorrow is April 15. April 15 is a date \nthat causes a great deal of stress and anxiety for hard-working \nAmerican taxpayers. For millions of American families, this year is \ngoing to be worse than ever before. The Obama health care law, \nObamaCare, is making tax day harder for Americans.\n  American taxpayers who were forced into the ObamaCare system--well, \nthey are having to fill out even more forms this year than in the past, \nso many forms that the Internal Revenue Service can then enforce all of \nthe President's health care mandates. It is a complicated and \nburdensome process.\n  President Obama promised that buying health insurance through \nObamaCare was going to be as easy as buying a television on Amazon. \nWell, why didn't the President ever say it was going to be so difficult \nto satisfy the IRS? Why didn't the President say that hard-working \nAmerican taxpayers would have to fill out pages and pages of forms just \nto find out if they had actually paid the right amount for their health \ninsurance? Why didn't the President say that people who changed jobs \nduring the year might have to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars to \nthe IRS?\n  That doesn't happen when you buy a television on Amazon. Amazon tells \nyou the price, and that is what you pay. Amazon doesn't make you fill \nout the forms on April 15; Amazon doesn't demand more money from you \nafter the amount you paid. But that is what is happening to millions of \nAmericans across the country. Taxes were already too complicated. Now, \nbecause of ObamaCare, it is much worse.\n  For this year's tax filing season, the IRS released seven new forms \nthat people might have to fill out to comply with the new health care \nlaw. The instructions alone for these forms are 46 pages long.\n  A married couple with 2 children might have to enter numbers and \nother information into 133 individual boxes on just 1 of the new \nObamaCare tax forms. A family could spend more time filling out one of \nthese forms than they used to spend filling out their entire tax \nreturns in the past.\n  So for people who go through all of this effort, the results actually \nstill can be terrifying.\n  CNN ran a report earlier this year about the problem. The headline \nwas: ``I have to pay back my ObamaCare subsidy.'' They told the story \nof Janice Riddle from Los Angeles. She got an ObamaCare subsidy last \nyear. Then when she got a new job, she forgot to tell the IRS about the \nnew job. They sort of knew because she was getting paid from the new \njob and she was paying taxes, but she didn't actually alert the IRS \nabout it from the standpoint of ObamaCare. So when she was doing taxes \nthis year, she learned she has to pay back the entire amount of the \nsubsidy, more than $5,000.\n  She told CNN:\n\n       I'm in shock . . . but I have no choice. Do I want to argue \n     with the IRS or the Obama administration?\n\n  Well, Janice is not alone. The Obama administration says as many as \n7.5 million families in America will have to reconcile their ObamaCare \nsubsidies on their taxes for 2014 when they have the filing deadline \ntomorrow.\n  According to a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation, last month only \n4 percent of all the families who qualified for a subsidy got the right \namount. So the Kaiser Family Foundation did a study last month, and \nwhat they have come out with is only 4 percent of all the families \nacross the country who qualified for a subsidy got the right amount. \nThe study found that half of all U.S. households that were eligible for \na subsidy would have to pay back some of it with their taxes this year. \nThe average amount they are going to have to pay back is $794.\n  One of those people who just found out he owes the government so much \nmoney is Rob Tuck from Dublin, CA. According to an article last week by \nthe Associated Press, he said he had expected to actually get a refund \nfor his taxes--a refund of $400 for his taxes from his work last year. \nIt turns out his refund has been almost wiped out--wiped out--to repay \nsome of the subsidy he got to buy an expensive ObamaCare policy. He \nchanged jobs during the year. He got a little extra income. In America, \nthat should be a good thing, you get extra income. Well, not for him. \nIt came with a large pricetag from the government. He said he enrolled \nin the plan to avoid the tax penalties of being uninsured, and he says \nthat now he feels penalized by the Obama administration anyway.\n  Another person who is feeling penalized by the President's health \ncare law is Bill Preus of St. Petersburg, FL. He was quoted in the same \nAssociated Press article last week. This man was only on ObamaCare for \n3 months. After that time, he went onto Medicare. Well, there was poor \ncoordination between the ObamaCare Web site, healthcare.gov, and his \ninsurance company. Because of that, he may have to pay the IRS close to \n$4,000.\n  Now, the man used to own an insurance agency, and, according to the \narticle, he said he is used to complexity, but he said he never has \nseen anything like this. He told the Associated Press: ``It's a total \nmess.''\n  His tax preparer and the IRS both told him--his tax preparer and the \nIRS--that the best thing to do was to file an incomplete return so it \nwould trigger an audit and then they could sort things out.\n  Is that the President's idea of his health care plan being as easy to \nuse as buying a TV on Amazon? This man has to go through an IRS audit. \nThat is what they are hoping for, to get audited by the \nIRS. Apparently, that is the easiest way for Washington to figure out \nits own rules. It is outrageous.\n\n  When the President, in the past, has been asked about the health care \nlaw, he said it is actually working better than he expected. What did \nhe expect when people are telling stories such as these?\n  The President's health care law is more than 2,000 pages long. It \npaid for thousands of IRS agents--people to investigate American \ntaxpayers to make sure they comply with all the law's destructive and \nexpensive mandates. But all of that complexity has become a disaster. \nThis law has been bad for patients, it has been bad for providers, and \nas we reach the IRS filing deadline tomorrow, it is clear this law is \nterrible for taxpayers.\n  This isn't what Democrats promised, and it is not what the American \npeople wanted. People didn't want more redtape, more stress. They just \nwanted the care they need from a doctor they choose at lower costs. \nThat is what Republicans in the Senate are working to give them. We can \ndo it without more IRS audits. We can do it without a 2,000-page law. \nWe can do it without making tax day harder for Americans. We can do it \nwithout all the negative side effects of ObamaCare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2144]]\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, on April 2, President Obama unveiled a \nnuclear agreement with Iran. The purpose of the administration's \nnegotiations with Iran was simple: Prevent Iran from acquiring a \nnuclear weapon. But the agreement the Obama administration seems to \nhave arrived at cast doubts on whether the administration will be able \nto achieve that goal. The framework does not shut down a single nuclear \nfacility in Iran. It does not destroy a single centrifuge in Iran. It \ndoesn't stop research and development on Iran's centrifuges. And it \nallows Iran to keep a substantial part of its existing stockpile of \nenriched uranium.\n  It is not surprising that Members of both parties are concerned about \nthis agreement. Democrats and Republicans are worried because it \nappears the administration is not trying to stop Iran from acquiring a \nnuclear weapon but simply trying to manage when Iran will develop one. \nAgain and again during the process Secretary Kerry and the President \nseemed to forget that the goal of the negotiation was not a deal for \nits own sake but a deal that would actually stop Iran from developing \nnuclear weapons.\n  American priorities were sacrificed for the sake of getting an \nagreement. In the process, the administration may have ensured that the \ndeal they finally arrived at is too weak to achieve its goal.\n  The stakes on this one are very high. The deal we are talking about \nhere is not a trade agreement. It is not a land dispute. It is not a \nnegotiation over water rights. It is a question of whether a tyrannical \noppressive regime that has backed terrorists and announced its \nintention of taking the country of Israel off the map should get access \nto the most apocalyptic weapons known to man.\n  The deal we arrive at in the coming months will shape the Middle East \nfor decades to come, and the cost of failure will be nothing less than \na nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Imagine for a second what it \nwould be like to have a nuclear-armed Middle East.\n  Right now we are already witnessing a quasi-proxy war in Yemen with \nIran supporting the Houthis and a Saudi Arabia-led coalition bombing \nthe Houthis and supporting the ousted government. Imagine that same \nscenario if both major powers had nuclear weapons at their disposal. \nMake no mistake, that is the type of situation we could be facing if we \nfail to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, not to mention the \nthreat that our ally Israel would be facing.\n  Today the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is set to mark up a \nbipartisan Iran bill for consideration by the full Senate. The Iran \nNuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 would give Congress 60 days to \napprove or disapprove any final agreement. This legislation would \nensure the American people, through their representatives in Congress, \nhave a voice in any final agreement with Iran.\n  Given the fact the ramifications of this agreement will last well \nbeyond the Obama administration, it is essential the American people \nhave a voice in this process, which makes congressional review \nindispensable. This bill would also ensure Iran is held accountable for \nupholding its end of the agreement by requiring the President to \nevaluate Iran's compliance every 90 days.\n  This legislation has broad bipartisan support, and I believe it will \nquickly pass the Senate. I am hopeful the President will listen to the \nconcerns the American people have expressed and ensure they are \naddressed before any final agreement is reached.\n  Every Member of Congress would like to see the President successfully \nconclude a deal with Iran that would prevent Iran from developing a \nnuclear weapon, but the President needs to remember that a deal is only \nacceptable if it achieves that goal. If we can't secure a deal that \nwill prevent a nuclear-armed Iran, then we should step back from the \nnegotiating table and reimpose the sanctions that were so successful in \ndriving Iran to the table in the first place. Anything less than a \nverifiable, accountable, and enforceable deal with Iran is a failure.\n  One bright spot in this Iran debate has been the bipartisan \ncooperation I just mentioned that has characterized the Iran Nuclear \nAgreement Review Act. This is a trend we are seeing a lot more of in \nthe Republican-led Senate. There was the bipartisan Keystone bill, the \nbipartisan legislation to prevent suicide among veterans, the \nbipartisan legislation to reauthorize the Terrorism Risk Insurance \nProgram, the bipartisan legislation to increase penalties for \nperpetrators and provide restitution for victims of child pornography, \nand now there is the bipartisan Iran bill.\n  This week we have another bipartisan agreement. Today, Congress will \nvote to repeal the flawed sustainable growth rate formula that has been \nused to calculate doctors' Medicare reimbursements since its enactment \nin 1997. This formula was supposed to control spending, but it never \nworked effectively. Since 2003, Congress has had to patch the formula \nregularly to ensure that physicians are paid a reasonable amount for \ntheir services.\n  In all, there have been 17 patches or short-term fixes--Band-Aids, if \nyou will--enacted over the last 12 years. The bipartisan solution that \nis being considered on the Senate Floor today repeals this flawed \nformula permanently and replaces it with a payment system that focuses \non quality, not quantity. It also puts in place the first significant \nreforms in Medicare in a long time.\n  Without reforms, the Medicare trust fund will be insolvent as soon as \n2030, leaving seniors without access to the care they have been \npromised. The bipartisan agreement we are passing today starts the \nprocess of strengthening Medicare and putting it on a more sustainable \npath going forward so that the current generation of seniors as well as \nfuture generations can enjoy the benefits they have been promised.\n  With the return of bipartisanship and regular order we have had here \nover the first few months of the Republican-led Senate, I am \ndisappointed the Democrats are continuing to obstruct a bill that \nshould be the most obviously bipartisan bill we have taken up all year. \nThe Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act would provide law \nenforcement with additional resources to combat the scourge of human \ntrafficking and increase the resources available to trafficking \nvictims.\n  This bill was cosponsored by 12 Democrats, in addition to 21 \nRepublicans, and it appeared to have strong bipartisan support for \npassage. In fact, it was reported out of the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously.\n  Unfortunately, Members of the Democratic Party's most extreme wing \ndecided to fixate on a funding restriction in the bill that has been a \nroutine part of appropriations bills and spending bills around here for \ndecades. The Hyde amendment reflects the sentiments of a majority of \nAmericans. That is the funding restriction that I referred to. The \nsentiment of a majority of Americans is that the Federal Government \nshouldn't be using taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions. It has been \nthe consensus view around here literally since 1976.\n  It is unfortunate the leftwing of the Democratic Party has taken the \nextreme step of holding up relief for victims of human trafficking over \nlanguage that simply maintains a status quo--the status quo that has \nbeen in place around here since 1976.\n  Every year thousands of innocent victims--most frequently women and \nchildren--are trafficked within the borders of the United States. Many \nof these victims are children who are bought and sold to feed the \ntwisted desires of sexual predators. Others are forced into lives of \nslave labor, compelled to work in the shadows without the protection of \nthe law. Rescuing these innocent victims and ensuring their captors are \npunished must be a priority.\n  The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act has been endorsed by 200 \nadvocacy groups, including the NAACP, the National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children, Rights4Girls, the National Association to \nProtect Children, the Fraternal\n\n[[Page S2145]]\n\nOrder of Police, and the National Conference of State Legislatures. It \nprovides new tools for law enforcement and new help for trafficking \nvictims.\n  It is time for the Democrats to stop obstructing this legislation and \nto allow the Senate to pass this bill--a bipartisan achievement and \nsomething that is much needed and long overdue. There is a crisis in \nthis country that needs to be addressed. We can do something about it. \nWe ought to do it, and we ought to do it now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are here today because our Medicare status \nquo is not working and it hasn't been working for a long time.\n  For decades, Medicare has been on a path to insolvency. In 1997, \nCongress attempted to impose some fiscal discipline on the program by \ncreating the sustainable growth rate or SGR. This is a budget-enforcing \nmechanism that calls for annual adjustments to the amounts physicians \nare reimbursed for treating Medicare patients.\n  The SGR was originally billed as a permanent solution to Medicare's \nunsustainable fiscal trajectory. The idea was to restrain Medicare \nspending by linking physician reimbursements to a target amount based \non the general performance of the economy as a whole.\n  While this may have seemed like a good idea at the time--when the \neconomy was relatively strong and stable and growing--it quickly lost \nits appeal when we went into the 2001 recession just a few years later.\n  The plan also suffered from the central planners' fatal conceit that \ntrusts bureaucracies, rather than consumer preferences and real price \npressures, to determine the cost of a particular good or service. As it \nturns out, the actual cost of medical goods and services and the \npractice patterns of physicians do not necessarily align with the \nhealth of the economy or the predictions of government bureaucrats.\n  So each year since 2003, the SGR formula has called for cuts to \nphysician payments, and each year--often several times each year--\nCongress has passed legislation to temporarily prevent the \nreimbursement reductions from kicking in.\n  While these so-called doc fix bills have yielded some modest savings \nas new spending has traditionally been offset with cuts elsewhere in \nthe budget, they have not restrained the quickening pace of Medicare \nspending. While they have successfully avoided cuts to doctors' pay, \nthey have put the Medicare system in a near constant state of \nuncertainty and instability, leaving Medicare doctors and their \npatients hanging in the balance.\n  America's physicians and America's seniors deserve better than this, \nbut they also deserve better than the bill before us today--H.R. 2, the \nMedicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015.\n  Congress has long wanted to repeal the SGR--and with good reason--but \nthis is not the way to do it. Not only does the House bill double down \non Medicare's broken price control model, but it does so, according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office, while adding $141 billion to the \nFederal debt over the next decade.\n  Let's look first at the policy implications of the underlying bill.\n  The new payment scheme proposed in this bill is simply more of the \nsame inefficient form of central planning that further embeds \nWashington bureaucracy into every aspect of our health care system. It \ncontinues the role of the Federal Government as price setter, rather \nthan the price taker, in the free market. It also inflates the \nadministration's power as the regulator and compliance officer.\n  The principal change proposed by H.R. 2 is to move from a Medicare \npayment system based on volume to one based on bureaucratic measures of \nquality and value, but we already know this doesn't work because it is \nthe same policy introduced under ObamaCare that requires physicians to \ncomply with established government guidelines and stick to rigid, one-\nsize-fits-all best practices or pay a penalty.\n  Instead, we should be freeing the health care community from heavy-\nhanded regulation and constant intrusive bureaucratic scrutiny. Doing \nso is the only way to allow doctors to develop individualized quality \ntreatment plans for each of their patients and to unleash innovation in \nthe delivery of health care.\n  But with the current doc fix expiring tomorrow and Medicare \nphysicians facing a 21-percent pay cut, there is not enough time to \nreopen the bill and rewrite it with better policies. But there is--\nthere is--enough time to address the fiscal irresponsibility of this \nbill.\n  That is why I am offering an amendment to this bill that would simply \nrequire Congress to pay for that $141 billion under its normal pay-as-\nyou-go budget rules--rules that this bill explicitly exempts itself \nfrom in section 525 of the bill. The pay-as-you-go budgeting rules, \nwhich share bipartisan support in Congress and the White House, \nwouldn't force us to offset the new spending immediately. Rather, we \nwould have until the end of the year to find these savings and 10 years \nin which to achieve them.\n  My amendment would not delay or change anything else in the bill. \nDoctors and seniors wouldn't notice any difference. It would just \nrequire Congress to budget for the costs, just as we promised we would.\n  Indeed, just 2 weeks ago, the Senate passed a 10-year balanced \nbudget, stating specifically that any SGR patch or repeal would not add \nto the deficit. So passing this bill in its current form would not only \nbe irresponsible, it would be dishonest. It would be inconsistent with \nwhat we have just said with the budget.\n  We have known for a long time that Medicare cannot survive without \nstructural changes to its price control system, and we know this bill, \nH.R. 2, does not contain such reforms. They aren't there. According to \na report issued last week by Medicare's actuaries, ``Under the new \npayment system, most doctors will see cuts in 2025.''\n  The only way to put Medicare on a sound fiscal footing is to make it \nwork for America's doctors and for America's seniors. To do that, we \nneed to work toward replacing the centralized price-fixing system of \nthe status quo with a functional consumer market that empowers seniors' \naccess to the high-quality, individualized health care they deserve, \nand that enables doctors to do what they do best, which is provide the \nvery best medical treatment in the entire world.\n  This is my goal. I believe this is a goal widely shared within this \nChamber. But we can't deceive ourselves: To get there, we must be \nresponsible with the public trust and we must be honest with ourselves. \nTo that end, I implore my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  To put it very simply, paying for this new spending is the right \nthing to do, and we just passed a budget promising that we would do it. \nMy amendment does nothing more than hold us to that very promise.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE.

Mr. President, hopefully this afternoon we will take up a\n\n[[Page S2146]]\n\nvery important piece of legislation coming over from the House of \nRepresentatives that received an overwhelming vote of Republicans and \nDemocrats alike--a package negotiated at the highest levels of the \nHouse leadership between Speaker Boehner and his staff and Nancy Pelosi \nand her staff.\n  What could it be that brings the political parties and the leaders of \nthe parties in the House together to try to build a consensus and come \nup with a solution? Well, it is really to right a wrong or remedy a \nmistake Congress made back in 1997. Basically, at that time, Congress \ndecided, in order to save money on health care costs, it would begin \nperiodically to cut the amount of money that was reimbursed to health \ncare providers--primarily doctors and hospitals. That is how Congress \nthought way back then we were going to save money.\n  What has happened in 17 of the 18 times these cuts will have been \nimplemented? Well, Congress has realized it was a mistake. Here is the \nproblem. When you tell doctors in rural parts of Texas ``You are going \nto earn 20 percent less to treat a Medicare patient tomorrow than you \ndid today,'' well, what they are going to decide is ``Can I afford to \nkeep my doors open? Can I afford to pay the bills? And maybe I can't \nafford to see any more Medicare patients.'' When doctors simply refuse \nor are unable to afford to see Medicare patients, then our seniors lack \naccess to health care they need and they deserve.\n  So in very difficult, contentious times politically, I think this so-\ncalled sustainable growth rate--or doc fix--bill I am alluding to which \nis over here from the House and which I hope we will vote on this \nafternoon actually represents a commonsense solution to one of our big \nchallenges and certainly will get Congress out of this embarrassing \nposition of every 6 months to a year or so having to come back and \nbackfill and fix a problem we ourselves created back in 1997.\n  Hopefully, we will be able to pass this legislation and get it done \nand give physicians and health care providers the certainty they need \nabout the reimbursement rates under Medicare and thus will allow more \nof them to see more seniors and provide them health care benefits under \nMedicare.\n  Now, some people may say: Well, this bill is not perfect. They would \nbe right. It is not perfect. But actually there is no such thing as a \nperfect piece of legislation, particularly when it is the product of \nbipartisan negotiations where both sides had to give in a little in \norder to get to an agreement. But I do commend Speaker Boehner and \nLeader Pelosi for working in a bipartisan way and producing something \nthat has received resounding support from the House of Representatives.\n  As I said, this legislation provides our health care professionals \nwith a predictable expectation for reimbursement rates--an idea that \nhas, sadly, only been a dream for many physicians in Texas and across \nthe country and one that Congress can now and should make a reality.\n  But this legislation also does something else very significant. It \nnot only addresses the reimbursement rate of doctors, it also \nintroduces other changes to Medicare that will help reduce the deficit \nover the long term--not just for the next 10 years but 20 years out and \nbeyond.\n  Now some people might say: Well, if Congress passes this legislation \nnow, can't they come back and undo it next year? The pattern has \nactually been when there have been negotiated bipartisan agreements on \nthings as important as Medicare and Social Security that they tend to \nstick and they tend to stay in place. So I believe that while this \nnegotiation certainly was no easy task and while it is a modest first \nstep, the good news is it does represent real meaningful entitlement \nreform--something the President of the United States said he supports \nand something now that both parties here in Washington and Congress \nhave been able to support.\n  This bill does make important strides on a difficult issue. When I \nsaid a moment ago it is not perfect, let me explain exactly what I mean \nby that. Not all of this bill is paid for. Today I plan on offering an \namendment that would keep our country from growing into greater debt by \noffering a pay-for for this piece of legislation.\n  How would we do that? Well, my amendment--which I hope, again, we \nwill vote on this afternoon in a series of as many as eight votes and \nfinal passage of the bill--would repeal the individual mandate from \nObamaCare. That would, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \nfree up literally close to $400 billion that could then be used to \nsatisfy the deficit for this so-called doc fix.\n  Many have rightly demanded an offset for the bill. I am very \nsympathetic to that, and my amendment is designed to address it, \nbecause--as the Presiding Officer knows, given his long service not \nonly in the Bush administration, at OMB, and in the Congress as well as \nthe Senate--we have to do something about the long-term debt and \nunfunded liabilities of the Federal Government. I am amazed almost \ndaily about the lack of urgency. Perhaps that is because interest rates \nare relatively low and we are not feeling the drain of debt service \npayments to our country's creditors because they buy our debt and they \ndemand to be paid interest or debt service on that debt. When interest \nrates begin to creep back up again, as they invariably will, that is \ngoing to put a real dent in everything from national security to the \nsafety net programs that we all believe are important. So my amendment \nwill repeal the individual mandate in ObamaCare and help pay for this \nappropriate fix in doctor reimbursement rates in Medicare.\n  You may ask, well, isn't that a pretty dramatic or controversial \nthing to do, to repeal the individual mandate in ObamaCare? I asked my \nstaff to go back and get some quotes from a candidate running for \nPresident in 2008, who happens to be the current occupant of the White \nHouse. Here is what then-Senator Obama said on February 28, 2008, on \none TV show:\n\n       Here's the concern. If you haven't made it affordable, how \n     are you going to enforce a mandate. I mean, if a mandate was \n     the solution, we can try that to solve homelessness by \n     mandating everybody to buy a house.\n\n  Well, as the Presiding Officer knows, the President actually said \nwhen we passed ObamaCare--frankly, without my support and the support \nof this side of the aisle--the President claimed it would lower health \ncare premiums by $2,500 a year for a family of four. That has proven \nnot to be the case. But quite clearly, the President himself, when he \nwas running for office in 2008, opposed the individual mandate.\n  Here is another quote from CNN in 2008. This is Senator Obama running \nfor President. He said:\n\n       In some cases there are people who are paying fines and \n     they still can't afford it, so now they are worse off than \n     they were. They don't have health insurance and they are \n     paying a fine.\n\n  That is what the individual mandate is all about, as you know. I will \ngo on with the quote. ``And in order for you to force people to get \nhealth insurance, you've got to have a very harsh, stiff penalty.''\n  So President Obama, back when he was candidate Obama, back when he \nwas Senator Obama, opposed the individual mandate. All my amendment \nwould do would be to repeal the individual mandate and allow us to \nobtain a savings to pay for this legislation.\n  I will read one more quote, because I find the irony pretty rich. \nSenator Obama said--and this was when he was running against then-\nSenator Clinton, who apparently is now again running for President. \nSenator Obama said in 2008:\n\n       She believes that we have to force people who don't have \n     health insurance to buy it, otherwise there will be a lot of \n     people who don't get it. I don't see those folks, and I think \n     that it is important for us to recognize that if you're going \n     to mandate the purchase of insurance and it's not affordable, \n     then there's going to have to be some enforcement mechanism \n     that government uses. And they may charge people who already \n     don't have healthcare fines or have to take it out of their \n     paychecks. And that I don't think is helping those without \n     health insurance.\n\n  So my amendment that would offer to pay for this bill would repeal \nthe mandate that then-Senator Obama, candidate for President, was so \ncritical of. It would repeal a tax on the American people that coerces \nour citizens into purchasing health care they apparently don't want or \nthey wouldn't otherwise buy but for the threat of government coercion.\n  The better way to do it, in my view, is to make health care more \naffordable,\n\n[[Page S2147]]\n\nnot to make it more expensive and say if you don't buy the government-\napproved care--even if you don't want what it provides--then we are \ngoing to coerce you to do it. We are going to penalize you for it. This \nis bad for America and hurts people instead of giving them the helping \nhand they need when it comes to health care.\n  We are going to have a lot more to say about how we need to repeal \nand replace ObamaCare with more affordable health insurance that gives \npeople access to the doctors and services they want and need. But on \nthe present bill, no one denies the need for a long-term permanent \nsolution to the way we pay health care providers under Medicare. So for \nthe benefit of physicians, our seniors, and the American people, we \nneed to do this, but we also need to find a way to pay for it.\n  I am hoping we pass this legislation today. I believe the current \nprovision expires at midnight tonight. It is important that we stop \nkicking the can down the road and we allow our family doctors to do \nwhat we want them to do most, which is to focus on what they do best \nand what our families need the most. At the same time, it will ensure \nseniors access to the care they need. Such a meaningful solution is \nlong overdue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I think the American people deserve to \nsee the contrast between how nominees were treated in the last decade, \nduring the Bush administration, versus how they are treated in this \ndecade, during the Obama administration.\n  When former President Bush nominated John Ashcroft to be U.S. \nAttorney General, it was controversial. I was one of 42 Democrats who \nopposed the nomination. Yet it only took 42 days for John Ashcroft to \nget a vote on confirming his appointment because neither I nor other \nDemocrats stood in the way and blocked actually having a vote.\n  Now, I agree that was a different time, where filibusters were not \nused every single day on every single issue, unfortunately. But I \nremember that at that time our Republican colleagues came to the floor \nand said: Elections have consequences. When a President is elected, he \nor she has the opportunity to put forward their nominees and have a \nvote. Day after day people came to the floor and said: Just let us \nvote. Just let us vote. And we did let the vote happen.\n\n  As of today, President Obama's nominee for Attorney General, Loretta \nLynch, has waited 157 days and counting, and we intend to count the \ndays. In fact, since the Judiciary Committee reported Loretta Lynch's \nnomination out of committee, she has now waited longer for a vote on \nthe Senate floor than the last seven attorneys general combined--seven \nattorneys general combined. She has waited longer than seven attorneys \ngeneral combined.\n  The U.S. Senate has the constitutional responsibility to provide \nadvice and consent to the President as it relates to his appointments. \nThat is a serious responsibility and we are not asking that someone \nvote yes if they want to vote no. They have a right to vote no. We have \nhad enough Members now come forward that it is clear she actually has \nthe votes. We have had enough Members indicate they would support her \nthat we know we could get a vote on the floor and that she would, in \nfact, be confirmed as the Attorney General. But everyone has the right \nto state their piece, to vote as their conscience would have them vote. \nUnfortunately, our Republican colleagues have so far withheld the \nrespect given to other Presidents--to President Bush. They have \nwithheld that from this President.\n  If this is frustrating to me, I can only imagine how frustrating it \nis to Loretta Lynch, who I know is eager to get on with the work of our \nNation's top law enforcement official. I had the opportunity to meet \nwith Ms. Lynch in early December. She impressed me with her passion for \nupholding the rule of law and her belief that law enforcement could be \na partner in building stronger and more cohesive communities. I talked \nto her about how the Justice Department could play a role in supporting \nethnic diversity in communities such as Detroit and Flint and other \ncommunities across Michigan.\n  Loretta Lynch understands the devastating effect racial profiling has \nhad on the relationship between the police and the public, which is why \nI am pleased to learn of her support for police body cameras and so \nmany other policies that would help in that regard. In addition, she \nunderstands the threat posed by those who would intimidate Americans \nfrom participating in elections.\n  I regret Loretta Lynch has not yet been granted the opportunity to \nplay her role in promoting access to the polls and preventing groups \nfrom being disenfranchised. I regret our FBI, with all it must do for \nthe safety and security of Americans, does not have a permanent \nAttorney General to direct it. I regret there is not a permanent \nAttorney General to advise prosecutors about actions to take against \nbanks that commit fraud against homeowners. I regret our Republican \ncolleagues are continuing to perform the same stunts in the majority as \nthey did in the minority: to govern by holding government functions \nhostage.\n  Those who oppose the nomination have every right to vote no, every \nright to fight to defeat this nomination, but if they continue to \nrefuse to give the advice and counsel and perform the duty they are \nsworn to uphold under the Constitution and continue to block a simple \nvote on a nomination from the President of the United States for \nAttorney General of this country, they are doing a disservice, I \nbelieve, to our country.\n  We have heard so often from people they are so tired of Congress \nobstructing and not acting. I would urge colleagues to get on about the \nbusiness of a nomination that has been held on this floor for too \nlong--too long--and 157 days is too long. It does a disservice to all \nof us to see this continue. We need Loretta Lynch as our Attorney \nGeneral.\n  We have a lot of business to conduct in the Senate and a lot of very \nimportant topics coming up. We need to get about the business of \nallowing this vote. However it goes is how it goes. We have indicated, \nwe have the votes if we are allowed to vote, but everyone has a right \nto express themselves. Let us put in place a competent, strong Attorney \nGeneral for the country and then move on to other serious issues that \nwe have to address in the Senate. It is time to vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/14/senate-section/article/S2147-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2147-S2149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SGR LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have been a strong advocate and a \nbeliever that it is time for us to fix the physicians' payment method \nfor Medicare and Medicaid--for the providing of health care by \ndoctors--and put it on a permanent basis right now.\n  We have 17 times passed last-minute legislation to avoid what now \nwould be a 21-percent cut in doctors' reimbursement rates for doing \nMedicare work. That is not acceptable. We need to end that. They do not \nneed to be worried every year whether or not Congress is going to cut \ntheir pay. In fact, they cannot do the work with a 20-percent cut. They \nwill not do it, they can't do it financially, and it would be \ndevastating to Medicare. I believe that, and I think all of us believe \nin that.\n  The 17 different times when this issue has come up since 2003 we have \npaid for it. Republicans in particular have insisted that we will find \nthe money through some sort of other reduction in government spending \nand move that over to pay for this critical need, without which \nMedicare would collapse.\n  I thought now that we want to do it permanently, it should be done in \na way that is financially sound and does not add to the debt and has \ngood policy in it.\n  Some of my colleagues have already talked about the policy that would \nbe\n\n[[Page S2148]]\n\nin this legislation. I am not prepared to be a big critic of that. I am \nsure it could be done in different ways. My focus right now is just \nbased on my experience from the Committee on the Budget and the \nspending we are doing in Congress to try to get the thing done right. \nIt must be paid for.\n  The bill to be advanced today contains over 250 pages. It was rushed \nthrough the House of Representatives with the promises that ``it pays \nfor all new future spending'' and ``it offsets all new spending.'' \nWell, both of those statements are not true. That is just not true. The \nbill is not paid for and it does not offset the new spending.\n  Because of a desire to get this fixed, an attempt was made by the \nHouse so the Senate, on the night we completed work on the budget at 3 \na.m. before recess, would pass this bill without even having a good \nofficial score--at least not one we were able to examine over a period \nof time--and without any knowledge of what was in the bill. Senator \nMcConnell and Members of the Congress said: No, we are not going to \nrush this through--$200-something billion in expenditures over 10 \nyears--at 3 a.m. in the morning with nobody having had a chance to look \nat it.\n  We had some 700 amendments filed to the Budget Act so we didn't pass \nit that night. It has been moved forward now, and we have a deadline \ntonight. Presumably, if we don't fix something tonight, physicians will \nbegin to see cuts in their pay. Of course, too often that is what \nhappens around here. Too often a bill that is not sound financially is \nmoved at the very last minute and Members are told: If you don't pass \nit now, then something bad is going to happen. In this case, doctors, \nwhom we respect and admire and need, are not going to be able to get \nthe pay they deserve and have been receiving, and they are going to be \nhurt by these cuts.\n  Well, there are opportunities to extend this. We could pass \nlegislation this afternoon, tonight, that would extend this for a \nperiod of time, if need be, but the reason we are at the end, the last \nminute, is because it was designed that way.\n  Only days after passing the Senate budget, that we were proud to see \nbalanced with a $3 billion surplus, we are talking about passing new \nlegislation that would add $174 billion to the debt over the next 10 \nyears. Another estimate shows that over 20 years it is a $500 billion \naddition to the debt of the United States--one-half of a trillion \ndollars.\n  The bill violates the Budget Act. The Budget Control Act, which we \npassed in 2011, set a limit on how much spending could occur. There may \nbe as many as eight--let me repeat, eight--violations of budget rules \nthat are involved in this legislation. The Committee on the Budget is \nlooking at this, and these are the numbers it may violate.\n  One, it likely violates section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget \nAct by spending in excess of the budget allocation of the Committee on \nFinance for the next fiscal year, over the next 5 years, and over the \nnext 10 years.\n  Two, it may violate section 311(a)(2)(A) of the Congressional Budget \nAct by spending $7.4 billion in excess of the aggregate spending top \nline agreed to for fiscal year 2015--this year we are in.\n  Three, it likely violates the Senate pay-go rules. The bill increases \nthe on-budget deficit by $74 billion over both the 5- and 10-year \nbudget periods, thus exceeding the balance on the Senate pay-go \nscorecard.\n  Four, H.R. 2 increases short-term deficits. Over the 10-year budget \nwindow it would increase deficits by $141 billion.\n  Now, $141 billion and $174 billion, what is the difference? Well, \nwhen you spend $141 billion more than you are supposed to over 10 \nyears, financed by deficit spending, all of that money, every penny of \nit, is borrowed in order to be spent, which means you have to pay \ninterest on the money you borrow. So it is not $141 billion, it is $174 \nbillion. That includes the interest on the $141 billion over 10 years \nthat has been accumulated and will continue to accumulate in the next \ndecade and the decade after that.\n  Five, the bill increases long-term deficits.\n  Six, it may violate section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act by \nincluding language that falls within the jurisdiction of the Committee \non the Budget that has not been reported or discharged from the \nCommittee on the Budget.\n  Seven, it likely violates section 303(a) of the Budget Act by \ncreating new spending in a fiscal year without a budget resolution.\n  Eight, it may violate section 401 of the Budget Act by creating new \nentitlement spending during the fiscal year.\n  We tried to contain ourselves, and one of the things we rightly did \nwas to create a budget violation aimed to prevent the creation of new \nentitlement programs during the current fiscal year.\n  So these are not technical violations, as it might appear to some. \nThey are mechanisms by which the crafters of the Budget Act \ndeliberately tried to contain the Senate from figuring out ways to \ngimmick and get around spending limits. They created all these steps, \neach one based on history, for the most part in order to stop abuses. \nSo it violates these provisions because it spends more money than we \nare supposed to be able to spend and more than what we agreed to spend.\n  So H.R. 2 increases long-term deficits. According to the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office's letter to Speaker Boehner, enacting this \nbill in its current form would increase the Nation's long-term \ndeficits. Long-term deficits are those deficits created after the first \n10 years of the current budget window.\n  A lot of times they will write a bill so it looks as if it is OK for \n10 years, knowing that in the future it will add to the debt. But \nnobody cares about that. So we made a budget point of order to try to \nidentify long-term abuses--a good provision, I submit.\n  About a month or so ago we had before the Budget Committee, a \nprofessor from Boston University, I believe, who talked about the real \nthreat to America's financial condition. He said that we are on an \nunsustainable path, that we cannot continue on this path, and that it \nwill result in financial dislocation and damage to America. And the \nmost important thing to consider is this: What will a piece of \nlegislation do to the long-term liabilities of the United States? Does \nit add to our unfunded liabilities or not? We need to be reducing our \nunfunded liabilities because they are so great--hundreds of trillions \nof dollars--and those unfunded liabilities financially threaten the \nvery future of America.\n  This adds to that. We need to be figuring out ways to reduce the \nunfunded liabilities. I thought that is what our goal was. That is why \nwe passed a budget that balances.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office's analysis, ``taken as a \nwhole, H.R. 2 would raise federal costs relative to current law in the \nsecond decade after enactment.''\n  In other words, it increases the deficit in the second decade. Some \nhave tried to argue that in the second decade there is extra money \ncoming in, in some way, and it will all be paid for--not so.\n  So let me explain. In its report to Speaker Boehner, the report that \nwas used by the House as it proceeded to vote on this bill, the \nCongressional Budget Office indicated that not only would H.R. 2 \nincrease short-term deficits by $141 billion over the next 10 years but \nit would also increase long-term deficits over both, the first and \nsecond 10-year windows. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget \nestimates that this legislation would add a half trillion dollars to \nthe debt in the next 20 years.\n  Half a trillion is real money--$500 billion. We are struggling right \nnow to figure out how we can permanently fix our highway bill so we \nhave a long-term highway bill that is paid for. We need about $10 \nbillion, $15 billion a year to achieve that. We are seeing a reduction \nin gasoline revenues. Congress wants to spend more than that, and we \nare looking for that money. This is over $500 billion over 20 years, \nand $174 billion over 10. These are huge sums of money.\n  The Federal highway bill is now under $50 billion a year. Federal aid \nto education is about $100 billion a year. This is just indicative of \nhow much we are overspending.\n  The Office of the Actuary at CMS--the chief financial officer at the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services--is responsible for \nconducting and\n\n[[Page S2149]]\n\ndirecting the actuarial program for CMS and directing the development \nand analysis of health care financing issues.\n  On April 9, Mr. Spitalnic released a review of the estimated \nfinancial effects of this legislation. Analysis conducted by the \nHeritage Foundation actuaries indicates that the drafters of the bill \nactually double-counted funds. While the bill anticipates higher \npremiums for Medicare Parts B and D and cuts to Medicare Part A, those \nsavings would be $55 billion and $32 billion, respectively.\n  Medicare Part A is the trust fund American working people's money \ngoes into off their paychecks every week. So most Americans believe \nthey pay for Medicare. And they do, for the most part, although we are \nnow taking in less money than is going out to a significant degree.\n  So what did this bill do? This bill cuts the expenditures for \nMedicare Part A, the trust fund part, and it claims that money--$32 \nbillion and $55 billion, respectively--is now available to spend on the \nphysicians to pay for their fix. But the physicians' Medicare part--\nwhen you go to a doctor and Medicare pays for that--that is not trust \nfund money. That is general revenue Treasury money.\n  So what has happened? They are cutting the reimbursements of \nhospitals and doctors. They claim it won't affect the benefits accrued \nto people who need health care, but it probably will. To cut the cost \nof providers of health care services, in effect, reduces the benefits \nthat actually go to the patient.\n  So how does that money get from the trustees of Medicare--who are \nsupposed to manage this program and take the money in that comes off \nour paychecks and goes to Medicare--to paying for something outside of \nMedicare Part A?\n\n  They take an oath to be responsible and faithful to the trust as \ntrustees of Medicare. They don't give it to the U.S. Treasury. They \nloan it. There is a debt instrument. The money is loaned to them and \nthe Federal Government pays interest. That is where we get the 30-some \nodd billion dollars in interest over 10 years--part of it.\n  The money that is being used to fund the portion that they claim is \nactually paid for I say is not paid for. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has told us this technique is double counting. The money cannot \nbe used to benefit Medicare and, at the same time, fund a new \nexpenditure. We really have to watch this. It is something I have come \nto realize is one of the biggest gimmicks the Senate uses.\n  When ObamaCare was passed--on December 23, the night before it \npassed, we got a letter from the Congressional Budget Office at my \nrequest. I read it on the floor on December 24, the day the bill \npassed. It said, I think, there was $400 billion, $500 billion in \ndouble-counted money they said was available to fund the Affordable \nCare Act.\n  Colleagues, we have got to be careful. A country goes broke by \nmanaging money this way--huge sums of money.\n  Beyond this gimmick, CMS Actuary Spitalnic goes on to say that H.R. 2 \nraises ``important long-range concerns that would almost certainly need \nto be addressed by future legislation.''\n  When the bill's 5 percent annual bonuses in physician payments expire \nas scheduled in 2024--9 years from today--a major payment cut from most \nphysicians would follow the next year, according to his report. The \npayment structure would also be troublesome in years with high \ninflation. So, in essence, by 2024, another round of doc fixes would be \nneeded. In other words, not only does this bill add massively to the \ndebt and engage in--I hate to say this--improper accounting, but it \nalso fails to even provide the long-term solution it promises. It \npromises we are going to have a permanent fix of the payments of \nphysicians. But this bill is not a permanent fix, and within 9 years we \nare going to be back in a situation that is unacceptable and has to be \ndealt with again by spending more money. By making these cuts in the \noutyears, the real costs are hidden.\n  We have a proposal that provides increases for doctors for the next 9 \nyears and then begins to show reductions, and it claims, somehow, that \nthis is going to pay for it. But Congress is not going to allow those \nreductions to take place either, because we are not going to be cutting \ndoctors 5 percent a year for any 1 year, most likely.\n  It is not too late to make things right. The bill needs to go through \nregular order. It hasn't gone through our committee in the Senate. The \nHouse said the bill was going through the regular order. It hasn't gone \nthrough the regular order. It hasn't been through a committee where \nmembers have the chance to offer amendments. It is coming up on the \nfloor. We are hardly having any amendments. I understand maybe we will \nhave three amendments on each side. That is a pretty minuscule \ndiscussion when it supposedly has to be passed in a day. So the \ndiscussions will take place at midnight tonight.\n  Colleagues, we have to understand the importance of what we are \ndoing. This legislation adds almost $200 billion to the debt in the \nnext 10 years. It breaks our past commitment and the precedent we have \nestablished to pay for these doc fixes. In fact, I have been most \ninsistent that before we put the extra money for the physicians, we \nfind a pay-for--some responsible reduction in spending elsewhere--so we \ncan set priorities and pay for the doctors. This is substantially \nabandoned in this legislation. I think it disregards Congress's \ncommitment to honest accounting, the principles that we have \nestablished about how to accurately calculate the cost of legislation. \nIt breaks the budget we had agreed to in 2011--the spending reductions \nin the Budget Control Act--and it violates the budget the Senate just \npassed a couple of weeks ago.\n  We need to think this through. I hate to object because I truly \nbelieve we need to take care of physicians' payments. It is absolutely \nwrong, and Congress has been negligent in failing to address this for \nyears. It has been over a decade that we haven't dealt responsibly with \nthis.\n  So I salute the House colleagues for saying we are going to develop a \nbill that fixes this over time. Unfortunately, it is not a permanent \nfix, as I originally thought it would be, but, it is also not a \nresponsible fix, a grownup fix. The kind of action for which the \nAmerican people depend on Congress, and hope to see, is not occurring \nbecause this bill adds to the debt.\n  We want to do something. We want to fix the doctors' problem, but we \ndon't want to cut spending anywhere else.\n  Faced with that difficult choice, this legislation--at least to a \ntwo-thirds degree--does what we too often do: We just spend the money, \ncommit to spending the money, and then add it to our credit card. We \nadd it to the debt that is $18 trillion now and growing dramatically, \nproducing for us an annual interest payment of $220 billion and putting \nus on a path--according to the Congressional Budget Office--of an \nalmost $900 billion interest payment in 10 years. I believe that is not \ngood management of the people's business.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to share these grim remarks and to \nlament the difficult situation in which we find ourselves. I do believe \nthe Lee amendment will fix this. Maybe other amendments will, too. But \nwe certainly need to step forward and make sure we don't continue down \nthis path.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Madam President, it is my hope that soon the Senate will \nbe about to start voting on legislation that in one fell swoop will \nimprove health care for millions of Americans. This discussion should \nstart with a Medicare milestone. That milestone is abolishing once and \nfor all the outdated, inefficiency-rewarding, commonsense-defying \nsystem of paying physicians under the Medicare Program.\n\n[[Page S2150]]\n\n  As my colleague from New Hampshire knows, what I am talking about in \nthe technical lingo of health care is the SGR, the sustainable growth \nrate. It is a horrendously flawed formula for paying doctors and \nproviders who treat our Medicare patients. Yet despite this very sour \npedigree, it has dominated much of the discussion about Medicare since \n1997.\n  I wish we had put this flawed reimbursement system in the dustbin of \nhistory last year. As some of my colleagues know, I had sought to do \nthat, along with the support of others. But I think now we have reached \nthe point, on a bipartisan basis, where we have a chance for seniors \nand their providers to cross the victory line and be better off and \nhave a better system for all Americans.\n  I thought I would take a minute or two before discussing some of the \nother health care efforts that I hope will go forward today to describe \nhow this happens. A little over a year ago, there was not much reason \nto think we would not just keep passing this leaky boat. That is \nessentially what the Senate had been doing for years and years with \nthis flawed program.\n  In fact, I remember one of our younger Members of this body was where \nthe Presiding Officer of the Senate is sitting. I said: At this rate, \nwe are probably going to be on patch No. 70 or 80 by the time we get \naround to really fixing this. So people were not very optimistic a \nlittle over a year ago. Since then, however, since that 17th patch, we \nsaw Members on both sides of the aisle saying: It is time to start \ngetting serious and getting traction for a permanent repeal-and-replace \nof this flawed reimbursement system.\n  In January of this year, momentum finally began to grow. In other \nwords, we used that period in 2014 as a springboard. Discussions began \nwith Speaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi. Their discussions were really \nbased on the bipartisan, bicameral framework that was developed in 2014 \nwhen leaders in the other body and the Senate got together: Finance \nMembers, Ways and Means Members, the Energy and Commerce Members. The \ncombination of that work and Speaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi coming \ntogether leads us to where I hope we will be here before long, and that \nis, once and for all abolishing this flawed reimbursement system.\n  If we did not take this action--and in effect it really has to be \ndone now--without taking people through the root canal work of how the \nreimbursement system works at the Medicare center, what is called CMS, \nwe do know that if Congress does not intervene, we would see physicians \ncut 21 percent. That would, in my view, cast a very strong shadow over \nour ability to serve America's older people. I mean, particularly in \nthe rural areas of this country, we have a lot of those practices that \nserve older people walking on an economic tightrope right now. They are \ntrying to figure out how to pay the staff and pay for equipment and \nlighting and everything else. A 21-percent cut would be enough, in my \nview, to really put some of those small rural practices out of \nbusiness. So it was the judgment of this bicameral group that worked \nthrough 2014, that Leader Pelosi and Speaker Boehner picked up on this \nyear, to come up with a very different kind of model to replace the \nMedicare reimbursement system that was so flawed, the SGR, with a \nmerit-based incentive payment that rewards those who provide high-\nquality, high-value care. That, in my view, is how we get the best \nvalue for America's seniors who, of course, want to get the right \namount of care at the right time. They want it to be of high quality.\n  A major part of this legislation will, in my view, help to promote \nbetter coordination of care. American health care is so fragmented and \nso strewn, kind of hither and yon, very often a senior can be treated \nby a variety of providers. No one really rides point on it. The senior \nends up in the hospital emergency room.\n  At that point, when providers say: Who should we be in contact with? \nThe senior is not even sure of all of the people, particularly if that \nsenior has multiple chronic conditions--perhaps diabetes and a heart \nproblem--the senior will not even know the array of providers they have \nseen, let alone have someone coordinate their care.\n  The good thing about this reform is it promotes that kind of care \ncoordination. Also, physicians, as part of this, will have clear \nincentives to enter alternative payment models that are going to \npromote team services, services where there is a team of health care \nproviders. It will require more Medicare transparency, more information \nabout various services that are provided to older people so that there \nis some sunlight on this incredibly complicated system, particularly \nthe Medicare Program that takes over $500 billion a year and spends it \nin a way that has not been particularly transparent.\n  I want to thank Senator Grassley for working with me closely on this \nfor a number of years.\n  Finally, this legislation also makes permanent what is called the QI \nProgram, again fancy health care lingo for an important program that \npays the premiums, the outpatient premiums, for low-income older \npeople. I think that is especially important, because it says for older \npeople, particularly those of modest income, that there is going to be \nsome assistance for the outpatient services, what is called Part B, \nwhich are so critical in terms of keeping older people out of long-term \ncare facilities.\n  My guess would be in New Hampshire and Oregon--like in my home State \nof Oregon--having that kind of assistance for low-income people in the \ncommunity is really key to avoiding institutional care.\n  I do want to note that I think all of us are going to say this bill \ndoes not meet the test of perfection. I happen to believe the bill \nwould have been stronger had this body been involved in all of the \nnegotiations. But clearly to have a milestone for Medicare--and that is \nwhat I think you get when you eliminate what really pretty much is a \nfraud. The Medicare reimbursement system has been honored more in the \nbreach than in the observance. Every year it is waived, it is patched. \nI think to replace it with what I have described really is something \nthat when the history of Medicare is written, people are going to look \nback and say: This was an important day. These were sensible changes. \nImproving care coordination, putting a new focus on quality, data \ntransparency, coordination of health care teams, the kinds of things \nthat this proposal does, are very much in the interests of seniors, \nproviders, and taxpayers. I think this day will be remembered for \nmaking a very important contribution in the history of Medicare.\n  I do want to mention several other amendments that I hope will be \noffered. I also feel very strongly about the need for this legislation \nto reaffirm and strengthen health care in America for our most \nvulnerable children. There are more than 100,000 of these youngsters in \nmy home State alone. I am talking about the Children's Health Care \nInsurance Program, what is known as CHIP. My hope is we will have a \nchance here to vote to expand on what the other body has done and have \na children's health program that will be extended for 4 years and not \njust 2.\n  The CHIP program has the support of almost 40 Governors. They span \nthe philosophical spectrum. They have achieved such strong support \nbecause these Governors who are right on the front lines with a program \nthat involves very close coordination by the Federal Government and the \nState governments want some certainty and predictability. They don't \nwant vulnerable kids and their families to be in limbo.\n\n  So I am very hopeful that amendment will be offered and that it will \nget the support of our colleagues.\n  Third, I hope there will be an amendment to improve health care for \nwomen. I believe we have all followed this debate that I think is \nneedlessly divisive. There are so many Senators who want to find common \nground to improve health care.\n  We have gotten bogged down and somehow virtually all the bills now \nseem to be a magnet for a debate about abortion. My colleague, Senator \nMurray, wishes to offer a very important amendment to expand health \ncare services and the availability of reproductive health services for \nwomen, community-based care. I am very hopeful that will be offered as \nwell.\n  Finally, on a bipartisan basis, Senators Cardin and Collins wish to \noffer legislation to really set aside what are\n\n[[Page S2151]]\n\nvery outdated approaches with respect to how Medicare provides \nservices, therapy services, for our citizens. We are talking about \nphysical therapy, occupational therapy, services with respect to \nspeech.\n  Senators Cardin and Collins want to get rid of these arbitrary \ntherapy caps. I am very hopeful their amendment will be able to be \noffered as well.\n  One last point, on a matter that is not health care related, this \nlegislation carries an additional program that is particularly \nimportant to the people whom I represent, and that is the Secure Rural \nSchools Program would be extended for 2 years.\n  I wrote this law in 2000 with our former colleague, the Senator from \nIdaho, Mr. Craig, because in most of our States--States where the \nFederal Government owns much of the lands, heavily forested--as a \nresult of changes in environmental policy and other changes, a lot of \nthese rural communities didn't have the money they needed for schools, \nroads, law enforcement, and basic services.\n  We have extended it since 2000. We have had testimony indicating we \nare going to need that safety net for some time, even as you try to get \nthe harvest up in a sustainable way.\n  I am very pleased this program, an economic lifeline to rural \ncommunities across Oregon and other States, is going to be extended for \n2 years. I think that provides us an opportunity to come up with fresh \nstrategies, both with respect to the safety net.\n  I would like to--in the future, in the Senate Budget Committee--\nsupport it. I believe my colleague, the Presiding Officer, was \ninterested to link Secure Rural Schools with the Land and Water \nConservation Program and the PILT Program. We have bipartisan support \nfor that.\n  I would like to see us use these 2 years to strengthen the safety net \nand get the harvest up in a sustainable way.\n  I wanted to make mention of that before I wrap up.\n  In closing, I think the health legislation--that I hope will be voted \non shortly--represents one of those rare moments on a major issue.\n  I mean, I would go so far as to say--having worked with older people \nsince my days with the Gray Panthers--I think what we are doing with \nthe abolition of this outdated Medicare reimbursement system is laying \nthe foundation for what will be the future of Medicare. The future of \nMedicare is not going to be what it was about in the 1960s when it \nbegan--a senior in New Hampshire might need the hospital for a serious \ninjury, maybe they would see a physician, get Medicare Part B if they \nbroke their ankle. The future of Medicare is going to be about dealing \nwith chronic disease. It is going to be about diabetes, cancer, heart \ndisease, and stroke.\n  The reality is that Medicare has not kept up with the times. I think \nit is worth noting that in the big debate about the Affordable Care \nAct, chronic disease was hardly mentioned at all, not by anybody. That \nis going to be the foundation of Medicare for the future. More than 90 \npercent of the Medicare dollars in the future, based on the challenge \nof dealing with older people with these chronic conditions, is going to \nbe about chronic disease.\n  The reality is, when you abolish this flawed Medicare reimbursement \nsystem and start promoting coordinated care, what would happen in the \nState of New Hampshire is you would start seeing teams--perhaps a \nnurse, a physician, a pharmacist--a team in New Hampshire or in Oregon \ncome together, particularly where there aren't the Medicare Advantage \nplans, and say we can give, as our colleague from Georgia noted not \nlong ago, Senator Isakson, better care at lower cost and do it for what \nis likely to be the type of health care services that dominates \nMedicare in the future, which is chronic disease. We will be better \nable to tackle that with the abolition of SGR.\n  So my hope is shortly we will vote to take that action that I believe \nconstitutes a Medicare milestone, reaffirms our commitment to America's \nyoungsters, improves health care services for women--from one end of \nAmerica to another--and gets rid of this outdated system of therapy \ncaps that are restricting what those who need physical therapy, \noccupational therapy, and others could get.\n  This could finally be a punctuation mark in this, the 50th year of \nMedicare, and an opportunity for all Senators to see that they were \npart of adopting a fresh set of policies to provide a brighter and \nhealthier future for all our people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I want to mention what Speaker Boehner \nsaid about this bill we are about to look into--the CHIP bill and the \nSGR, the physicians' payment bill. Speaker Boehner said:\n\n       Unless the Senate passes the House-passed ``doc fix'' bill, \n     significant cuts to physicians' payments will begin tomorrow. \n     The House legislation passed with overwhelming bipartisan \n     support, and we do not plan to act again, so we urge the \n     Senate to approve the House-passed bill without delay.\n\n  He summed it up pretty well. The fact is this has been a long ordeal \nthat a lot of us have worked on for a long time, a lot of people on \nCapitol Hill. If we can pass this bill tonight, it will be a major \naccomplishment and we can go back to the child health insurance bill.\n  I remember standing here on the floor with Ted Kennedy on the other \nside passing a bill that brought a lot of angst to a lot of people but \nwhich has helped millions of children who were deprived of good health \ncare. So this is a very important bill and I hope we don't foul it up. \nI don't think we will.\n  Madam President, I stand today in support of H.R. 2, the Medicare \nAccess and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015. If enacted, this \nlegislation would repeal and replace the Medicare sustainable growth \nrate, or SGR. That is the formula called the sustainable growth rate. \nIt will extend the CHIP program for an additional 2 years--a program \nthat has worked very well--and will put in place much needed reforms to \nthe Medicare Program--something that hasn't happened in a long time.\n  This bill represents more than 2 years of hard work on both sides of \nthe Capitol. It passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives \nwith 392 votes. I expect it will also get broad bipartisan support here \nin the Senate. It certainly has to.\n  We have all grown tired of the seemingly endless cycle of passing \ntemporary SGR patches year after year after year. It is not a new \nproblem. It is one we have been dealing with for a long time.\n  A little over 2 years ago, a group of leaders from both the House and \nthe Senate set out to fix this problem once and for all. As I mentioned \nyesterday, I was part of this group, as was former chairman of the \nCommittee on Finance, Max Baucus. Together Senator Baucus and I worked \nwith the leaders on the relevant House committees to craft legislation \nthat would repeal and replace the SGR with an improved payment system \nthat rewards quality, efficiency, and innovation. That legislation, \nwhich we reported out of the Committee on Finance by voice vote in late \n2013, formed the basis of the legislation before us today.\n  I want to compliment the House for the great work they have done on \nthis bill. I have to give a lot of credit to them. It is my hope we \nwill act quickly to pass this bipartisan, bicameral legislation and \nsend it to the President's desk as soon as possible.\n  This legislation demonstrates what Congress is truly capable of when \nMembers work together. We all talk about the need for more \nbipartisanship in Washington. This bill can be a template for how \nthings should work around here.\n  It also represents a step forward in the effort to reform our \nNation's entitlement programs. As I mentioned, to go along with the \npermanent SGR fix, the bill includes a meaningful downpayment on \nMedicare reform. These reforms include a limitation on so-called \nMedigap first-dollar coverage, more robust means testing for Medicare \nParts B and D, and program integrity provisions that will strengthen \nMedicare's ability to fight fraud.\n  Clearly, these reforms by themselves won't fix all of Medicare's \nfiscal problems. Indeed, much more work needs to\n\n[[Page S2152]]\n\nbe done. But like many of my colleagues, I have been pushing for \nentitlement reform for years. During all that time I have seen politics \nand fear get in the way of progress. With this bill we have a chance \nto, at the very least, take a meaningful step forward--a bipartisan \nstep, no less--in the effort to secure the safety net for future \ngenerations. Any Senator who, like me, supports entitlement reforms \nwill welcome the changes we have made in this bill.\n  I am not here to say the bill is perfect. It is certainly not. But as \nthe saying goes, we should not make the perfect the enemy of the good. \nThis is a good bill. Once again, it passed in the House with a huge \nbipartisan majority and it is supported by groups across the health \ncare spectrum. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nlist of groups supporting this legislation at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  As it stands right now, in less than 12 hours doctors all over the \ncountry will face a 21-percent cut in Medicare reimbursements. In other \nwords, we are out of time. We need to pass this legislation and we need \nto do it now. In fact, it is encouraging to see that even Members on \nthe other side of the aisle support this good policy now, and I am \nproud of them for doing so.\n  Let's get this done. I hope all of my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting H.R. 2.\n  I repeat what Speaker Boehner said today:\n\n       Unless the Senate passes the House-passed ``doc fix'' bill, \n     significant cuts to physicians' payments will begin tomorrow. \n     The House legislation passed with overwhelming bipartisan \n     support, and we do not plan to act again, so we urge the \n     Senate to approve the House-passed bill without delay.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       H.R. 2, the Medicare and CHIP Reauthorization

Mr. President, the distinguished majority leader, the \nsenior Senator from Kentucky, is resolutely opposed to any serious \nconversation about climate change. Under his leadership, the Republican \nParty in the Senate has exactly zero legislation for addressing carbon \npollution in any serious way. The majority leader has even written to \nGovernors around the country urging defiance of the climate change \nregulations of the U.S. Government, namely, the Environmental \nProtection Agency's forthcoming clean power plan to cut presently \nunregulated carbon pollution from our powerplants.\n  I thought I should take a look at what Kentucky is doing about \nclimate change. It turns out that Kentucky is already crafting a plan \nfor complying with President Obama's clean power plan. Why are they \ndoing that? In a statement, the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet \nsaid it was because ``the overwhelming majority of our stakeholders are \ntelling us to make preparations to submit a plan.''\n  The overwhelming majority of Kentucky stakeholders are telling the \nState of Kentucky to submit a plan. Kentucky has an energy and \nenvironment secretary. His name is Dr. Len Peters. Dr. Peters does not \nmock or disparage the EPA. Indeed, he praised the EPA at a recent \nnational climate change conference for the flexibility and openness of \nits rulemaking process. Dr. Peters began his talk by saying, ``I'm from \nKentucky and I'm not a climate science denier.''\n  Setting aside compliance with the administration's clean power plan, \nKentucky actually had its own climate action plan, written all the way \nback in 2011. The Kentucky climate action plan sets forth more than 40 \nactions to address climate change. It would reduce Kentucky's \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 1.3 billion metric tons between 2011 and \n2030.\n  The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife within that climate \naction plan has its wildlife action plan. The wildlife action plan \nopens its chapter on climate change by quoting the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change. Around here a lot of fun is sometimes made of \nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, at\n\n[[Page S2153]]\n\nleast on the other side of the aisle. But Kentucky's Department of Fish \nand Wildlife quotes them as follows: ``[W]arming of the climate system \nis unequivocal.''\n  That is the Commonwealth of Kentucky, quoting the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change.\n  The Kentucky wildlife action plan goes on to report that--and I will \nquote it again--``Climate change has the potential to exacerbate \nexisting conservation threats . . . in Kentucky by altering both \nterrestrial and aquatic systems.''\n  As you know, I am from the Ocean State. I am very concerned about \nwhat climate change is doing to our oceans and what it is doing to our \ncoasts. Kentucky is landlocked. So imagine my surprise to read the \nKentucky wildlife action plan's discussion of sea level rise. Sure \nenough, it is in there. Here is what the Kentucky wildlife action plan \nsays about sea level rise: ``With the predicted increases in severity \nof hurricanes and tropical storms, coupled with potential shoreline \nlosses in Florida and throughout the eastern seaboard, people may begin \nmigrations inland,'' it says. It continues, ``If and when these events \noccur, Kentucky may experience human population growth unprecedented to \nthe Commonwealth.''\n  That is Kentucky's statement on this. I hope the majority leader will \nappreciate why I am so insistent that we tackle this climate change \nproblem when his own home State projects that people in our coastal \nStates will be so grievously affected by climate change that we may \nhave to flee to landlocked Kentucky.\n  The State government of Kentucky is not alone. Kentucky's cities--\nLexington, Louisville, Frankfurt, Bowling Green, and Villa Hills--have \nsigned the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement, quoting the city \nof Lexington, ``to act locally to reduce the impacts of climate change \nby lowering (manmade) greenhouse gas emissions.''\n  Lexington, KY, actually proudly notes that the Sierra Club has \ndesignated Lexington a cool city for signing the U.S. mayors agreement. \nMaybe in time the Sierra Club will designate Kentucky's senior Senator \na cool Senator. Here is hoping.\n  Even fossil fuel companies in Kentucky get it. Columbia Gas of \nKentucky has a climate change link on its Web site that says ``Meeting \nthe Climate Challenge.'' Columbia Gas of Kentucky pledges to ``address \nclimate change issues through business activities which promote \nsustained economic growth in a manner consistent with [our] \nenvironmental obligations.'' Columbia Gas of Kentucky also pledges to \n``promote adoption of reasonable policies addressing climate change,'' \nincluding ``appropriately crafted legislation on climate change.'' \nRegrettably, their Kentucky Senators have responded with exactly no \nlegislation on climate change, appropriate or otherwise.\n  Local Kentucky news station WFPL brought on a climate scientist from \nNASA not too long ago who said that scientists have exhaustively \nstudied the numerous signs of climate change--the warming oceans, the \nmelting glaciers, the changing temperatures--and narrowed it down, and \nthe only culprit to explain what is happening is increases in mankind's \ncarbon emissions. The NASA scientist on the Kentucky radio station \ncompared it to the TV show ``CSI.'' He said, ``We've looked at all the \ndifferent suspects . . . and there's only one suspect that's still in \nthe picture,'' and that is human carbon emissions.\n  Kentucky Woodlands Magazine reports that ``the world is changing \nright before our eyes. . . . our natural systems are changing as a \nresult of a warming climate.'' Indeed, the author says that ``we are \nexperiencing some of the `predicted' effects today.'' They include an \nobserved shift in Kentucky wildflower seasons. The article warns that \n``climate change is happening as you read this article,'' and it \ndescribes the result as ``global climate weirdness.''\n  One thing we know about Kentucky is that it is renowned for its \nhorses. So I turned to Horse & Rider magazine and found an article on \nclimate change and horses' health. The article noted climate change's \neffects, including ``more intense extreme weather events and the \naltered timing, intensity and distribution of precipitation.''\n  Horse & Rider magazine asked the question of ``how climate change \nmight affect our horses' health.'' For the answer to that question, \nHorse & Rider magazine turned to Dr. Craig Carter of--guess what--the \nUniversity of Kentucky, who said, ``It's a scary thing to watch.'' \nBecause ``climate change affects all forms of life,'' he said, \n``mosquitoes, ticks, flies and other insects are moving northward'' in \ndescribing how that move affects crops and trees and disease vectors \nsuch as West Nile virus. This University of Kentucky expert cited \nspecific concerns for equine health, but he also offered this reminder: \n``It's not just horses (and people) at risk; crops are being affected, \nas are trees, due to beetle infestations. Climate change affects all \nforms of life.''\n  Since so many of my Senate colleagues say they are not scientists, I \nconcluded my Kentucky review where scientists gather: at Kentucky's \nuniversities. Paul Vincelli is a professor at the University of \nKentucky Cooperative Extension Service. He says:\n\n       In the scientific community, it is widely accepted that the \n     global climate is changing and the human activities which \n     produce greenhouse gases are a principal cause. Greenhouse \n     gases have a strong capacity to trap heat in the lower \n     atmosphere, even though they are present at trace \n     concentrations.\n\n  Dr. Vincelli concludes:\n\n       This trapped heat is driving many of the recent changes in \n     the Earth's climate, including rising temperatures in the \n     oceans, on Earth's surface, and in the lower atmosphere.\n\n  Dr. Vincelli, University of Kentucky.\n  Another University of Kentucky summary produced by Vincelli and his \ncolleagues says this:\n\n       Scientific evidence that our global climate is warming is \n     abundant . . . Practicing scientists consider the evidence of \n     human-induced global warming to be extremely strong.\n\n  The University of Kentucky climate summary said:\n\n       In fact, 97 to 98 percent of the most knowledgeable \n     experts--scientists who actively publish research papers in \n     climate science--are convinced that global warming is \n     occurring and is caused primarily by human activities.\n\n  They go on to note that ``a consensus of 97 to 98 percent . . . is \nremarkable.''\n  That summary adds the following warning:\n\n       Regardless of what you may read on blogs or in the media, \n     there is almost no meaningful scientific controversy on these \n     points.\n\n  There is just the controversy here in Congress.\n  Let's now move on to Kentucky State University. Kentucky State \nUniversity is pleased to appoint a climate change fellowship to \n``engage college students in climate change education and action'' and \nto provide ``in-depth training on climate change, how to best teach the \nbasics of climate change.'' Maybe a little of that around here might be \nin order.\n  Over at Western Kentucky University, they host the Kentucky Climate \nCenter, which is the State climate office for Kentucky, on their campus \nin Bowling Green.\n  Eastern Kentucky University offers concentrations in environmental \nsustainability and stewardship, including courses on global climate \nchange, and its Environmental Research Institute's Web site on climate \nchange links you right to the IPCC work on climate change that is so \noften derided here in Congress. Obviously, Eastern Kentucky University \ndoesn't think the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is \nunreliable.\n  Northern Kentucky University does even better. Former Northern \nKentucky University president James Votruba signed the American College \nand University Presidents' Climate Commitment, pledging Northern \nKentucky University to ``an initiative in pursuit of climate \nneutrality,'' i.e., having ``no net greenhouse gas emissions,'' if \nnecessary by ``using carbon offsets or other measures to mitigate the \nremaining emissions.'' In 2010, Northern Kentucky University adopted an \naction plan calling on every department and all members of the Northern \nKentucky University community to do their part to help the university \nachieve carbon neutrality by 2050.\n  My tour of Kentucky's great centers of higher learning leads me to \none last Kentucky university--one that is unique in that its Web page \ndisplay of\n\n[[Page S2154]]\n\nnotable alumni includes none other than our distinguished majority \nleader, Senator McConnell. This is the University of Louisville.\n  The University of Louisville goes out of its way to expose its \nstudents to the reality of climate change. Professor Keith Mountain is \nchair of the University of Louisville Department of Geography and \nGeosciences. He has lectured on ``Stewardship in a Time of Global \nClimate Change,'' a talk about ``how climate change is a measurable \nreality and how people have contributed to the trends.'' That is the \nchair of the University of Louisville Department of Geography and \nGeosciences.\n  The University of Louisville has also brought in Lonnie Dupre, \n``mountain climber, polar explorer, and a climate change activist,'' to \ndescribe for University of Louisville students ``his personal witness \nof the detrimental effects of global climate change over 25 years of \npolar exploring.'' They brought in prize-winning ecologist Diana Wall \nfor a University of Louisville Biology Department lecture series to \ntalk about ``fragile soil systems and their role in climate change.''\n  University of Louisville students have been involved, too, in Climate \nChange Teach-Ins, where students, faculty, and staff join together ``to \ninform, inspire and educate others about the climate change crisis.'' \nOne student concluded, ``The university needs more events similar to \nthe teach-in to raise awareness about climate change.'' I hope they \nwill consider raising awareness among their alumni as well.\n  Let me close this discussion with two slides that were prepared for \nKentucky's Governor's Conference on Energy and the Environment for a \npresentation on ``Kentucky and the President's Climate Action Plan.'' \nThis is a depiction of our country's energy mix broken out by \nrenewables, natural gas, coal, petroleum, hydroelectric, and nuclear. \nWe can see there are a lot of layers in the cake. This layer represents \ncoal in the U.S. energy mix as of 2012. This is Kentucky's energy mix. \nAs we can see, it is a black wall of coal. Even Wyoming, which produces \nmore than four times as much coal as Kentucky, has a more diverse \nenergy mix than this. Could they do better? I think so.\n  There is a song called ``Warm Kentucky Sunshine.'' Kentucky has a \ntown named Sunshine. There is even a cocktail called a Kentucky \nSunshine. But we would never know it from their energy mix. That is one \nof the reasons that Kentucky's efforts to prepare for the Clean Power \nPlan are so promising.\n  So before our distinguished majority leader, the senior Senator from \nKentucky, asks all of the other States to throw in the towel on \nconforming to the U.S. Government's plan for dealing with carbon \npollution, I would ask that he acknowledge that his own State \nrecognizes climate change as a problem and as an opportunity and that \nKentucky is trying to do something about it.\n  As to the possibilities, ask Senator Grassley, whose State has 28 \npercent wind energy. Look at Kentucky's mix. Iowa has 28 percent wind \nenergy.\n  As to the possibilities, the distinguished majority leader could ask \nhis deputy majority leader, Senator Cornyn of Texas, whose home State \nhas more than 10 percent wind energy and a solar industry providing \nmore than 330 megawatts, more than 7,000 jobs, and rapid growth.\n  I hope Kentucky doesn't decide to change its present course and to \nthrow in the towel without even trying. We can do this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/14/senate-section/article/S2154-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2154-S2155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SGR LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am hopeful--and most of us are--that \nsoon we will be able to consider Medicare legislation that has passed \nthe House of Representatives. It is probably best known as the SGR \npermanent fix.\n  The SGR, which is a payment system that affects physicians under the \nMedicare system, is badly broken. On 17 previous occasions we have \nextended the current policy in order to make sure that physicians don't \nget an automatic cut that would deny many Medicare beneficiaries access \nto their physicians. These are pretty extreme measures.\n  We all understand that it is time to permanently fix this--not just \nto eliminate the problem but to substitute a payment system that \nencourages physicians to provide high quality care and to deal with \nincentives that reduce the volume of care. And that is what the \nlegislation that passed the House of Representatives does.\n  It fixes the problem on a permanent basis. I am certainly hopeful we \ncan get that enacted shortly because it already passed the deadline in \nregard to when the current patch expired. The bill also provides for an \nextension for the Children's Health Insurance Program. I do hope we can \nprovide a longer extension than the 2 years that is provided in the \nHouse bill. I know there will be amendments offered to deal with that.\n  I want to talk about an amendment I will be offering. I am not sure \nhow much time will be available when a consent arrangement is entered \ninto--which I hope will be soon--to consider this. It is an amendment I \nam offering with Senator Vitter. It is a bipartisan amendment. In \nprevious Congresses, we have had many of my Republican colleagues who \nhave joined me, we have had many of my Democratic colleagues. This \nshould be, I hope, a noncontroversial amendment we can adopt.\n  What it does is provide a permanent fix, as we do for physicians, for \nthe physical therapy cap. I was in the House of Representatives in 1997 \nwhen we passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I was on the Ways and \nMeans Committee. I remember a chairman's mark coming to us. For the \nfirst time there was a cap placed on physical therapy services.\n  I asked the chairman of the committee why was this being done. There \nwas absolutely no policy reason whatsoever for imposing an arbitrary \ncap on the amount of physical therapy services. When you think about \nit, what it does is discriminate against those who have the greatest \nneeds, those who have severe needs, those who have a stroke or \ntraumatic brain injury or a spinal cord injury or managing Parkinson's \ndisease, multiple sclerosis, arthritis.\n  These are the individuals who run up against the cap and therefore \ncould be denied the ability to deal with their needs, causing them, in \nmany cases, to incur much greater costs. It makes no sense whatsoever, \nthe therapy cap.\n  For that reason, on a pretty regular basis, we have extended the \nrevised policy. Twelve times we have done it to prevent the \nimplementation of the therapy cap. We have acknowledged the negative \nconsequences that would result from the imposition of such limits. In \n2009, a report issued by the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee, \nMEDPAC, it was estimated that the therapy cap, if enforced without an \nexception process, could harm 931,000 Medicare beneficiaries.\n  So we have an identical situation on the therapy cap as we do with \nthe SGR physician reimbursement issue. That is why historically these \ntwo measures have always been moved together in tandem. What my \namendment will do, cosponsored by Senator Vitter, is permanently fix \nthe therapy cap issue by replacing the arbitrary limits on outpatient \nrehab therapy services with a more rational system which will require \nprior authorizations in certain circumstances.\n  So we fix it permanently, as we do the physicians' reimbursement \nissue. I do not need to tell the Presiding Officer that we do not \nalways have an opportunity to get legislation done here. I do think we \nhave a chance--an excellent chance--that this bill we will be taking up \nis going to be signed by the President in the next few days.\n  This is our opportunity to get several matters taken care of. The \ntherapy cap cries out for that type of attention. So I would urge my \ncolleagues, when this amendment comes up--it is cosponsored by a large \nnumber of my colleagues. As I already mentioned, Senator Vitter, who is \nmy cosponsor. On the Democratic side, we have both Senator Reid and \nSenator Reed, Senator Whitehouse, Senator Hirono, Senator Casey, \nSenator Shaheen, Senator Menendez, Senator Mikulski, Senator Brown, \nSenator Stabenow, Senator Leahy, Senator Cantwell, Senator Bennet, \nSenator Booker.\n  I could mention many of my Republican colleagues who have joined me \nin the past in the repeal of the therapy\n\n[[Page S2155]]\n\ncap that are expressing an interest to help in this regard. I hope I \nwill have their support on this amendment. Let's get it done. I think \nit is important for Medicare beneficiaries to know they are not at risk \nof losing the opportunity for their physician to treat them under the \nMedicare system.\n  If we do not take care of the SGR problem, that is a real, real \nconcern of Medicare beneficiaries, as to whether their physicians will \nbe available for them. The same thing is true with the therapy cap. \nLet's remove this uncertainty. Let's get it fixed. We have the \nopportunity to do that. So I would urge my colleagues to support my \nefforts that are supported by AARP and many of the outside groups.\n  Let's vote for the SGR bill but also vote for the amendment I will \noffer with Senator Vitter that will permanently fix the therapy cap. We \nwill have a chance to do that I hope either later tonight or tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/14/senate-section/article/S2155-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2155-S2156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO FEDERAL EMPLOYEE MATTHEW O'NEILL\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I do not know if I am going to be able to \nhave time to get into this. For the last several months this year, I \nhave been taking time 1 day a month to talk a bit about an employee in \nthe Department of Homeland Security. Of all the Departments in the \nFederal Government--the largest Department--it has the lowest morale. \nWe have been working hard with them to do something about that.\n  We are doing small things that nonetheless is to remind everybody \nthat folks in the Department of Homeland Security, in some cases, risk \ntheir lives, invest their lives in trying to make sure we have a life \nand a good life and a safe life. They are worthy of our praise. What I \nam going to do tonight--unless I get run off the floor because of other \nbusiness--I want to talk about one of them.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, the Department was recently the \ncenter of a budget battle on Capitol Hill. For weeks, it was unclear if \nthe Department was going to face a shutdown, another short-term \ncontinuing resolution or receive the full-year funding they needed. \nFortunately, Congress did its job and sent a clean funding bill for the \nrest of the fiscal year to the President's desk.\n  The employees are grateful for that and certainly I am as well. While \nthe Department's employees and leadership can now return to their focus \non keeping America safe from threats our country faces, we should not \nignore the harm the latest debate inflicted on the already low morale \nof employees at the Department.\n  More than 200,000 men and women work for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, really just to do one mission; that is, to create a safe, \nsecure, and resilient place where the American way of life can thrive. \nMany of those employees, again as I said earlier, put their lives on \nthe line every single day.\n  Whether these employees are securing our borders, securing our skies, \nresponding to natural disasters or bolstering our defenses in the cyber \nworld, few other Federal agencies and employees touch the lives of so \nmany Americans on a daily basis more than do the employees of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. There is no question that they deserve \nto be treated better than the way Congress has been treating them \nlately.\n  That is one of the reasons why over the past few months I have been \ncoming to the floor to recognize the work of at least a few of the many \nexemplary Department of Homeland Security employees.\n  In February, I spoke about Ramiro Garza, Jr., a Border Patrol agent \nat U.S. Customs and Border Protection. I had the opportunity to meet \nMr. Garza early in February in McAllen, TX, while on a visit to the \nMexican border in South Texas with Senators Ron Johnson and Ben Sasse. \nIn the past summer, Mr. Garza played an instrumental role in quickly \nsetting up an emergency operations center and processing facility, \nwhich he now runs, to help Customs and Border Protection better manage \nunaccompanied minors and families apprehended along the southern \nborder.\n  Today, I rise to speak about another dedicated and outstanding \nemployee of the Department of Homeland Security. His name is Matthew \nO'Neill. Matthew is employed as a special agent within the U.S. Secret \nService.\n  Over the past several months, there have been incidents, including \nsome as recently as this month, that have again raised serious \nquestions about the Agency and its ability to fulfill its \nresponsibilities. The Agency's leadership is still addressing these \nincidents and taking steps to implement reforms to improve the Agency \nfrom the inside out.\n  So while it is important for us to usher in a new chapter for the \nU.S. Secret Service, it is important also that we shine some light on \nsome brave men and women at the Agency who continue to serve our \ncountry and carry out their missions with distinction. Special Agent \nMatthew O'Neill is one of the many hard-working public servants whose \nday-to-day work deserves special recognition.\n  We live in a world that has become increasingly digitized. Nearly all \nAmericans, including Members of this Chamber and me, are spending more \nand more of our time online, whether it is to do our banking, our \nshopping, communicating with loved ones or simply getting our work done \non a day-to-day basis.\n  Americans' ability to go online in a safe and secure environment is \nat the core of Special Agent O'Neill's work. You see, agents in the \nU.S. Secret Service are not only responsible for protecting the \nPresident, the First Family, and other dignitaries as well, some \nagents, such as Special Agent O'Neill, do their work in cyber space--\nnot outer space but cyber space. And there in that cyber space are \ncriminals who are elusive, and the threats they pose to us are \nsophisticated and many.\n  Put simply, Agent O'Neill's job is to target cyber criminals taking \naim at the American consumer, businesses, and our national community \nonline.\n  Financial crime has evolved dramatically in the nearly 20 years since \nSpecial Agent O'Neill began his career with the Secret Service. Not \nthat long ago, criminals would go to a bank, perhaps maybe a jewelry \nstore or a convenience store, to steal money and maybe some other \nvaluables.\n  Today, they don't even need to go outside to steal items of great \nvalue from businesses, from the Federal Government or from the rest of \nus consumers and regular citizens. Criminals just need access to the \nInternet. These data breaches are disruptive to our economy. They cause \nworry and confusion for millions of American consumers and for \nbusinesses. But thanks to his dedication and expertise, Special Agent \nO'Neill has helped the Federal Government to try to stay ahead of the \ncurve and keep our most sensitive information and our property secure.\n  Special Agent O'Neill is originally from Dumfries, VA. He graduated \nfrom James Madison University in Harrisonburg, VA--that makes him a \nDuke--before joining his career with the Secret Service in 1998 in the \nNew Haven, CT, office. From 2003 to 2007, he served in the Vice \nPresidential and Special Services Division in Washington, DC.\n  However, it is while serving in his current role, one primarily \nperformed in cyber space, that Special Agent O'Neill has become one of \nthe top cyber warriors defending our security online. In this position, \nhe has helped to lead a number of complex transnational cyber crime \ninvestigations. These investigations have focused on crimes ranging \nfrom hacks into check-out lanes at brick-and-mortar stores to the \nonline sale of stolen, personally identifiable information, such as \nSocial Security numbers.\n  In one investigation, Special Agent O'Neill identified Web site \nportals that sold the personal information of approximately 30 million \nAmericans to other cyber criminals, potentially putting victims at risk \nfor identity theft or credit card fraud or worse.\n  To uncover the criminals running and participating in this scheme, \nSpecial Agent O'Neill sought and executed\n\n[[Page S2156]]\n\nover a dozen Federal search warrants, made numerous undercover \npurchases, and painstakingly examined nearly 40,000 emails.\n  As a result of an extensive investigation, Special Agent O'Neill was \nable to trace the source of the stolen data to an individual in South \nVietnam. In 2013, the culprit was arrested for his crimes. Since the \ninvestigation, Special Agent O'Neill has been able to identify and \narrest over 20 other criminals who worked in conjunction with the \nculprit by illicitly purchasing the stolen data.\n  In addition to breaking up that complex network, Special Agent \nO'Neill's work has also thwarted attacks involving everyday \ntransactions, saving businesses and saving consumers from financial \nharm. For example, he played a critical role in identifying, tracking, \nand identifying three Romanian nationals who were planning to hack into \nthe computer system of a major fast food franchise with more than \n25,000 restaurants in the United States.\n  Time and again, Special Agent O'Neill's supervisors and colleagues \nhave noted his commitment and dedication to duty, including his \nwillingness to work at all hours of the day and night to track \ncriminals who use the Internet with malicious intent.\n  In 2012, he was recognized as the Investigator of the Year by the \nInternational Association of Financial Crimes Investigators. In 2013, \nhe was honored by the Secret Service as its Special Agent of the Year \nfor his efforts, and in 2014, he received the Department of Homeland \nSecurity Secretary's Meritorious Service Award.\n  But Special Agent O'Neill's service doesn't end with his work at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. When he is not combatting cyber crime, \nhe is serving his neighbors and community by volunteering for a local \ncharity that provides financial assistance to families dealing with \ncancer. The charity also provides scholarship money for the continuing \neducation of oncology nurses.\n  I thank Special Agent O'Neill's family for sharing him with his \ncommunity and his Nation. We are a safer country because of him.\n  In closing, the actions taken by Special Agent Matthew O'Neill attest \nto this critically important work done by thousands of individuals \nacross the Department of Homeland Security every single day. These men \nand women are courageous, dedicated, and exemplary Federal employees \nwho selflessly serve our country year in and year out.\n  Like Special Agent Matthew O'Neill, these unsung heroes and heroines \nwalk among us every day, protecting us from the unknown or from the \nunexpected. And more often than not, the good work they do goes \nunnoticed--but not today.\n  Special Agent O'Neill, thank you. Thank you for your dedication to \nthis country. Thank you for your tireless service to all of us.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that at 7:10 p.m., the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 2, which was received from the \nHouse, and that the only amendments in order be the following: Cornyn \namendment No. 1114, repeal individual mandate; Democratic amendment No. \n1115, extend SCHIP; Lee amendment No. 1116, motion to strike; \nDemocratic amendment No. 1117, women's health; Cotton amendment No. \n1118, fee schedule; Democratic amendment No. 1119, therapy; that \nfollowing the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote in relation \nto the amendments in the order listed, that all amendments except the \nCotton and Lee amendments be subject to a 60-vote affirmative threshold \nfor adoption, the bill then be read a third time and the Senate vote on \npassage of the bill, as amended, if amended; further, that there be 2 \nminutes equally divided between the votes and that the votes after the \nfirst be 10 minutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the reason we \nare not moving forward more quickly is we first had to get some of the \nholds lifted, and we were able to do that on both sides, and we wanted \nto make sure there would be no cuts in the physicians payments.\n  We thought if we finished this by early sometime tomorrow, noon or \nthereabouts, that the payments would not be cut but we don't have that \nassurance yet. So we are going to have to go ahead. If something comes \nfrom the Office of Management and Budget or the White House that that \nwould not happen, we can allow people to go to the events they have \naround town.\n  In the meantime, I agree with the Republican leader, we should go \nforward. If something happens during some of these votes so we can \nfinish them tomorrow, fine. But in the meantime, to protect not only \nthe physicians but their patients, we should move forward on this \nlegislation now.\n  I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, just briefly, the point to remember \nhere is that at midnight, roughly 5 hours from now, CMS will begin to \ncut payments to doctors who treat Medicare patients. If we do not act \ntonight, these cuts of 21 percent will be real.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/14/senate-section/article/S2156-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2156-S2161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MEDICARE ACCESS AND CHIP REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1114.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n              (Purpose: To repeal the individual mandate)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. RESTORING INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY.\n\n       Sections 1501 and 1502 and subsections (a), (b), (c), and \n     (d) of section 10106 of the Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act (and the amendments made by such sections and \n     subsections) are repealed and the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 shall be applied and administered as if such provisions \n     and amendments had never been enacted.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 1114, offered by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, Speaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi have \nnegotiated a package which enjoyed broad bipartisan support in the \nHouse. The one missing element is a pay-for for the so-called doc fix, \nfor the sustainable growth rate fix. What my amendment does is offer \nthat pay-for so that this is a deficit-neutral bill if it is adopted.\n  In order to find that pay-for, we would repeal the individual \nmandate. The latest CBO score shows it would save as much as $400 \nbillion. It hasn't been scored this year, so the number may be off a \nlittle bit, but there is more than an adequate amount of money to \noffset the deficit caused by this permanent doc fix.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me, along with then-Senator Barack Obama \nin 2008 in his campaign against Hillary Clinton, who when he was \nrunning for the Democratic nomination campaigned against the individual \nmandate.\n  Let's make that reality.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I urge colleagues to oppose this amendment. \nWhat Senator Cornyn seeks to do is to strike an idea that originally \ncame\n\n[[Page S2157]]\n\nfrom the Heritage Foundation. If it is adopted, sick people will \ndefinitely sign up, healthy people will stay on the sidelines, premiums \nwill skyrocket, according to the Congressional Budget Office, by as \nmuch as 20 percent, and start then what amounts to a death spiral for \nthe affordability of American health care.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time remains.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Cornyn amendment No. 1114.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1115.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Bennet], for himself, Mr. \n     Brown, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Casey, Mr. Reid, Ms. \n     Warren, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Shaheen, and Mr. \n     Whitehouse, proposes an amendment numbered 1115.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, this amendment provides an additional 2 \nyears of funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. \nI wish to especially thank Senators Brown, Wyden, Stabenow, Casey, and \nReid for their leadership on this amendment.\n  We have made great strides in recent years to ensure that Americans \nof all ages have access to quality health care, but a huge part of this \nsuccess in increasing access for quality health care comes from CHIP, \nwhich provides insurance to low- and moderate-income children and \npregnant women. We know CHIP works. The CHIP program serves more than 8 \nmillion children, including more than 115,000 in Colorado. This is \nhealth care they might not otherwise have.\n  Unfortunately, the House failed to take full advantage of this moment \nand this momentum for compromise and only extended funding for 2 years. \nCHIP is authorized through 2019. This amendment would extend it for 2 \nadditional years.\n  The very physicians who would be helped by fixing the SGR would also \nsee increased reimbursement when they treat these children instead of \nseeing millions of them lose access to affordable, comprehensive \ncoverage.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, remember that 212 Republicans and 180 \nDemocrats supported H.R. 2. The decision to extend CHIP for 2 years \nwith the current payment rate was part of the House bipartisan \nagreement. This amendment seeks to rewrite that amendment.\n  This amendment is not a vote to show who really cares more about \nchildren's health because H.R. 2 extends the CHIP program for 2 years. \nEveryone who supports the underlying bill is supporting children's \nhealth. If my colleagues oppose this amendment, they are no less a \nsupporter of children's health than the 392 Members of the House who \nsupported H.R. 2, including 180 Democrats and Leader Pelosi. Are my \ncolleagues really saying that Leader Pelosi didn't care enough about \nkids in forging this agreement?\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  I am a supporter of the Children's Health Insurance Program having \nparticipated in the initial creation of CHIP in 1997 and the \nreauthorization started in 2007. And while I am a supporter of \nchildren's health, this is not a CHIP vote in a vacuum. This vote is in \nthe context of the underlying bill and cannot be ignored.\n  An overwhelming majority of the House supported H.R. 2. 392 Members \nof the House vote for H.R. 2; 212 Republicans and 180 Democrats \nsupported the bill. That is a sign of bipartisanship that is, on a \nmajor issue, extremely rare in the House.\n  The decision to extend CHIP for 2 years with the current payment rate \nwas a part of the House bipartisan agreement. It is an agreement \nbetween House Republicans and House Democrats. This amendment seeks to \nrewrite that agreement.\n  So let's talk for a moment about what this amendment is not. This \namendment is not a vote to show who cares more about children's health. \nH.R. 2 extends the CHIP program for 2 years. Everyone who supports the \nunderlying bill is supporting children's health. Mr. President, 392 \nmembers of the House voted for this bill which extends CHIP for 2 \nyears.\n  If you oppose this amendment, you are no less a supporter of \nchildren's health than the 392 Members of the House who supported H.R. \n2 including 180 Democrats and Leader Pelosi. Are you really saying \nLeader Pelosi didn't care enough about kids in forging this agreement? \nAgain, no one should accuse anyone who votes against this amendment as \nbeing insufficiently supportive of children's health.\n  I have also heard it said that Congress only authorizes 2 years now, \nthere is little chance Congress will authorize two more years in 2017. \nThat is a prediction, and as we all know, Congress can be hard to \npredict some times.\n  In two years, we will be back to consider CHIP. We will also be back \nto consider therapy caps, rural hospital programs, home visiting, the \nspecial diabetes program, and community health center funding, to name \na few programs extended in this bill. The House agreement intentionally \naligned these programs to be considered in tandem in 2017.\n  This amendment pulls one very specific provision out of that \ncompromise. I have no concerns that CHIP can stand without the SGR. \nWhat we need to do is spend the next two years thinking about the \nfuture of health care coverage for children.\n  MAC-PAC has done some very good work examining what CHIP provides for \nchildren that is different than the private market. The pediatricians \nare in town this week for a conference, and as they will tell you, kids \nare not just little adults. Benefits and services need to be tailored \nto make sure that kids grow into healthy productive adults. This is \nsomething we need to settle in the next two years. It is something we \ncan and should do. Voting against this amendment does nothing to \njeopardize that process.\n  We have a choice here. We can pass the House bill without changes or \nwe\n\n[[Page S2158]]\n\ncan amend its bill and send it back to the House. I urge Senators to \nsupport the agreement and vote against this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the pending amendment, No. 1115, offered by \nSenator Bennet, would violate the Senate pay-go rule and increase the \non-budget deficit over the 10-year period of fiscal years 2015 to 2024. \nTherefore, I raise a point of order against this measure pursuant to \nsection 201(a) of S.

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, just 2 weeks after the Senate passed a 10-\nyear balanced budget, we find ourselves on the very brink of passing a \nbill that would promptly unbalance it. We find ourselves on the brink \nof passing a bill that would promptly unbalance the balanced budget we \njust passed to the tune of $141 billion over the next decade. This is \nexactly the kind of bait-and-switch behavior that has eroded the \npublic's trust in Congress in recent years.\n  To honor the promises we made to each other and that we made to the \nAmerican people, my amendment would simply subject H.R. 2 to the same \npay-as-you-go budget rules that cover other spending bills in Congress. \nPaying for the new spending in this bill is the right thing to do, and \nwe just passed a budget promising we would do exactly that. My \namendment does nothing more than hold us to this very promise.\n  I implore my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Lee amendment.\n  Colleagues, the Lee amendment is the bluntest possible instrument \nthat would cut spending across government on every possible program. \nThe SGR, the doctors reimbursement formula, has always been a fake. The \n$140 billion in this bill eliminates the budget fakery that Democrats \nand Republicans believe has gotten out of hand. The underlying bill \ngets rid of the budget fakery.\n  I urge colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject the amendment, \nand I yield back.\n  Mr. LEE.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1117 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, many of us have been working for years to \nprotect Medicare access for seniors, invest in our community health \ncenters, and expand access to health care for our children. So I am \nglad Democrats and Republicans in the House were able to come together \non these issues. But it is disappointing that in a bill which takes so \nmany good bipartisan steps forward, Republicans have insisted on trying \nto score political points with their base on women's health.\n  The House SGR bill includes language that is just one more example of \nusing women's health as a political football. It is redundant, and it \nis unnecessary.\n\n  I am offering an amendment tonight that shows we are making sure \nwomen have comprehensive access to health\n\n[[Page S2159]]\n\ncare. It focuses on moving women's health care forward by providing a \nclean extension of community health care funding for 4 years, not 2, to \nprovide certainty. It will invest $2 billion in safety net providers \nfor women and their families through title X clinics. Finally, it will \ninvest in strengthening the women's health care workforce to make sure \nwomen have access through their providers.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as has been mentioned repeatedly regarding \nthe 10-day CMS hold, this 10-day CMS hold period will expire tonight. \nDoctors who serve our seniors will be facing a 21-percent cut.\n  Senator Murray's bill costs $21.1 billion over 10 years, and it is \nnot offset. Therefore, the pending amendment, No. 1117, offered by \nSenator Murray, would violate the Senate pay-go rule and increase the \non-budget deficit over the 10-year period of fiscal years 2015 to 2024. \nTherefore, I raise a point of order against this measure pursuant to \nsection 201(a) of S.

Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1118.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Cotton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1118.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide steady updates of payment rates under the Medicare \n                        physician fee schedule)\n\n       Beginning on page 5, strike line 22 and all that follows \n     through page 127, line 6, and insert the following:\n       (2) Update of rates for 2015 and subsequent years.--\n     Subsection (d) of section 1848 of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395w-4) is amended by striking paragraph (16) and \n     inserting the following new paragraphs:\n       ``(16) Update for january through june of 2015.--Subject to \n     paragraphs (7)(B), (8)(B), (9)(B), (10)(B), (11)(B), (12)(B), \n     (13)(B), (14)(B), and (15)(B), in lieu of the update to the \n     single conversion factor established in paragraph (1)(C) that \n     would otherwise apply for 2015 for the period beginning on \n     January 1, 2015, and ending on June 30, 2015, the update to \n     the single conversion factor shall be 0.0 percent.\n       ``(17) Update for july through december of 2015.--The \n     update to the single conversion factor established in \n     paragraph (1)(C) for the period beginning on July 1, 2015, \n     and ending on December 31, 2015, shall be 0.5 percent.\n       ``(18) Update for 2016 and subsequent years.--The update to \n     the single conversion factor established in paragraph (1)(C) \n     for 2016 and each subsequent year shall be 0.5 percent.''.\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I want to replace the SGR permanently, but \nI also want to do it correctly. This bill has two payment models in the \nfuture. The first 4 years would give physicians a half-percent \nincrease. In future years, though, CMS would be empowered to issue \nqualitative, subjective rules purporting to evaluate physician \nperformance and patient outcomes.\n  My amendment would simply extend the half-percent increase \nindefinitely. I think there are many reasons to vote for this \namendment. CMS has not effectively used a blunt bureaucratic tool, such \nas SGR, so we shouldn't give them a nuance tool; second, CMS itself \npredicts we are going to have future doc fixes, which is going to \nundermine the stability doctors and patients need; third, the \ncomplexity of the outyear model is going to further drive \nconsolidation, especially for rural and independent doctors; and, \nfinally, CBO estimates this bill saves $10 billion.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote. Let us have a permanent doc fix that works for \nall doctors and patients.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. \nToday, the Medicare Program is a fee-for-volume system. The underlying \nbill junks this and turns out the lights on millions of users.\n  The underlying bill before the Senate says the future will be about \nrewarding value and good quality care for our Medicare patients. The \nCotton amendment embraces the outdated status quo and says there is no \nneed to coordinate care, no need to pay for value, no need to pay for \nquality for our Medicare patients. I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. COTTON. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1119.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I have explained this amendment a little \nearlier.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Klobuchar be added as a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. This deals with the therapy cap on which we now have had \n12 patches. It is almost the identical problem we have with the SGR, \nwhich is the underlying bill. It deals with seniors, Medicare \nbeneficiaries, having access to therapy services, those who have had \nstrokes, those who have serious issues and need rehab therapy.\n  The cap never made sense in 1997 when it was put into effect. It was \nnot the right policy. We have had bipartisan support to correct this as \nwe have the SGR, and my underlying amendment does that.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this bill is far from perfect, but we \ncannot let perfect be the enemy of the good on this bipartisan \ncompromise that passed the House with almost 400 votes.\n  The House leadership has made it clear to us, they will not pass \nanother package, and I don't blame them. Time is of the essence.\n  The therapy caps provision may not be the best policy, but it is in \nplace to ensure there is a governor on unnecessary utilization and \nspending in the Medicare Program.\n  Congress should use the next 2 years to find a solution to this \nproblem and work to pay for that solution, and I intend to do that. But \nto have that on this bill would be a catastrophe at the end of what has \nbeen a really, really very, very tough-fought bill all the way through.\n  The pending amendment, No. 1119, offered by Senator Cardin would \nviolate the Senate pay-go rule and increase the on-budget deficit over \nthe 10-year period of fiscal years 2015 to 2024. Therefore, I raise a \npoint of order against this measure pursuant to section 201(a) of S. \nCon. Res. 21, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year \n2008.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 58, the nays are \n42.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  The bill was ordered to a third reading and was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate prior to a \nvote on final passage.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to see that after 12 years of \ntemporary patches to delay cuts under the Sustainable Growth Rate, \nCongress is finally acting to reform the Medicare physician payment \nsystem for the long term. In so doing, we not only ensure access to \ncare for seniors but also help improve the quality of care they receive \nthrough Medicare.\n  However, I am disappointed that the same certainty is not provided to \nchildren and families impacted by the Children's Health Insurance \nprogram, CHIP. This legislation extends funding for CHIP for 2 years \nand continues policies that encourage enrollment in the program. But it \ndoes not extend this critical funding for a much longer period of time, \nlike the 4 years my colleagues and I have been urging for months. We \nare missing a crucial opportunity to ensure that children and pregnant \nwomen have access to comprehensive, affordable health insurance \ncoverage for years to come. Currently, more than 10 million children \nbenefit from this program. In 2 years, funding for this program will \nexpire, putting children at risk of becoming uninsured once again. \nMoreover, the bill takes the same temporary approach with respect to \nthe Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting, MIECHV, \nprogram, Community Health Centers, and other initiatives.\n  I am also concerned that Medicare beneficiaries will see increases in \nout-of-pocket costs to help pay for the legislation. Faced with the \nthreat of looming cuts to health care providers and the resulting risk \nof disruption of services should doctors withdraw from Medicare, we are \nbeing forced to instead choose to increase costs on seniors, rather \nthan any number of offsets that could have asked the wealthiest \nAmericans or corporations to pay a little more to ensure that Medicare \nis protected for everyone. Indeed, the majority in the other body \ninsisted on paying for this bill, at least in part, by increasing these \nout-of-pocket costs. For a bill designed to protect access to health \ncare for seniors, it should not turn around and then demand they pay \nmore. We should be reaffirming our commitment to protecting Medicare \nbeneficiaries and these cuts do just the opposite. With these \nprovisions not taking effect until 5 years from now, I hope that gives \nus ample time to revisit this.\n  After years of disagreements on health care issues, it is good to see \nthat we can move on this bill on a bipartisan basis. So while I have \nthe reservations I have outlined, and will support amendments to \naddress these issues, I will vote for this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this legislation has not gone through \nthe regular order in the Senate. It will add $174 billion to the debt. \nIt is subject to seven different budget points of order. We have had a \nseries of budget point of order votes where we have affirmed the budget \nand the responsibility we have to adhere to it. Let's do the right \nthing. Let's tell the House, which tried to send this bill over at 3:30 \nin the morning for us to pass right before we recessed after the budget \nvotes, that, yes, we are absolutely committed to fixing the doctors' \npayments and in a responsible, long-term way, but it\n\n[[Page S2161]]\n\nneeds to be paid for in a responsible, long-term way. Upholding the \nbudget point of order does not kill the bill; it sends it back to \ncommittee to make sure it is fully paid for.\n  So let's not be afraid tonight. Let's say to our House colleagues: \nColleagues, we agree with you on your vote, but we must pay for this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I need to make a budget point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is still time remaining in favor of the \nbill.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the pending measure, H.R. 2, the \nMedicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, violates section \n311(b) of the fiscal year 2009 budget resolution by causing a net \nincrease in the long-term deficit in excess of $5 billion in the 10-\nyear period of fiscal years 2025 through 2034. Therefore, I raise a \npoint of order against this measure pursuant to section 311(b) of S. \nCon. Res. 70, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year \n2009, and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to waive all applicable sections of the Budget Act, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The point of order is not \nsustained, and the motion is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we will soon be voting on final passage of \nH.R. 2, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015.\n  As I mentioned earlier, this bill represents more than 2 years of \nhard work on both sides of the Capitol. And, it represents a real step \nforward for bipartisan health care policy. I am proud to have been one \nof the authors of this legislation and I look forward to what I believe \nwe will see--the bill pass with bipartisan support.\n  I want to commend everyone who worked on this legislation. I \nparticularly want to thank Senator Max Baucus who worked with me from \nthe beginning on this effort here in the Senate. In addition, I would \nlike to thank the current ranking member of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Wyden for all his work. I also want to thank our colleagues on \nthe House Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means Committees who also \nworked very hard in crafting this SGR fix.\n  As with any major legislative effort, there are a number of \nstaffers--both current and former--who also deserve our thanks. From my \nown Finance Committee staff, I want to thank Dan Todd, Kristin Welsh, \nErin Dempsey, Katie Simeon, Kim Brandt, and Becky Shipp for all of \ntheir hard work. I also want to thank my senior team--Jay Khosla, Chris \nCampbell, and Mark Prater. On the Democratic side of the committee, I \nwant to thank Karen Fisher, David Schwartz, Matt Kazan, Juan Machado, \nScott Levy, and Colin Goldfinch.\n  I also want to commend the efforts of Scott Raab and Monica Popp from \nthe Senate Republican leadership offices.\n  In addition, from the House side, I specifically want to thank \nCharlotte Ivancic and Wendell Primus.\n  We have also gotten quite a bit of help from CBO in this effort. For \nthat, I want to thank Lori Housman, Tom Bradley, and Holly Harvey.\n  CMS also provided vital technical assistance as we put this \nlegislation together. For that, I'd like to thank Jennifer Druckman, \nIra Burney, and Anne Scott.\n  And, of course, we couldn't have done without the help of the \nLegislative Counsels' offices, particularly John Goetcheus, Kelly \nMalone, Ruth Ernst, and Phil Lynch on the Senate side and Jessica \nShapiro and Jessica Cross over in the House.\n  I wish to once again urge my colleagues to support this bill. It is a \nmonumental achievement. It is legislation that has been long in the \noffing. I wish to thank everybody on both sides for the cooperation we \nhave had. I just want to personally express my gratitude for being able \nto pass this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I think tonight is a \nmilestone for the Medicare Program--a lifeline for millions of older \npeople. That is because tonight the Senate is voting to retire the \noutdated, inefficiency-rewarding, commonsense-defying Medicare \nreimbursement system.\n  As Senator Hatch noted, it has been bipartisan; it has long been \nbipartisan. I think this is an important night for the Senate and it is \ngoing to be long remembered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Cornyn \n     amendment No. 1120 to S. 178, a bill to provide justice for \n     the victims of trafficking.\n         Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, Roy Blunt, Johnny Isakson, \n           John Barrasso, Pat Roberts, Mike Crapo, Roger F. \n           Wicker, Tom Cotton, James M.

Mr. President, like every Member of this body, I am \nfrustrated we haven't been able to reach an agreement to pass the \nbipartisan Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act.\n  So today--just now--we have offered a compromise amendment that \nprovides a path forward on this important legislation. I want to \nexpress my gratitude to the majority leader for teeing up this \namendment and this vote and helping us move forward to resolve this \nproblem.\n  Briefly, this proposal would completely strike a provision in the \nunderlying bill that Members on the other side have objected to \nregarding the application of the Hyde amendment. The proposal would \nreplace this language with a provision negotiated by Leader Pelosi from \nH.R. 2, the so-called doc fix bill that we just passed overwhelmingly \nand that passed the House a few weeks ago 392 to 37--180 House \nDemocrats supported this language in the House bill. The Pelosi \nlanguage from this bill is similar to my proposal, in that it simply \nsays that any funds used to provide services to human trafficking \nvictims would be subject to the same requirements as funds under the \nPublic Health Services Act. This would clarify that all money in the \nDomestic Trafficking Victims' Fund must be derived from the General \nTreasury, the routine and ordinary source of all Federal funding.\n\n[[Page S2163]]\n\n  In other words, requirements placed upon funds under my bill would \nnot be placed on money derived from criminal fees or penalties, \nsomething our Democratic friends seem to have some objection to, but \nthey would only be placed upon money drawn from the General Treasury. \nThis is exactly what Members on the other side have asked for.\n  Finally, as an additional measure of good faith, my proposal would \nalso include an amendment drafted by Senator Leahy, the ranking member \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee, that has been supported by every \nDemocratic Member of that committee. This amendment would authorize the \nappropriation of additional funds into the Domestic Trafficking \nVictims' Fund.\n  Some Members on the other side of the aisle have filibustered this \nimportant legislation because they say they objected to language I \nincluded that references the Hyde amendment. I have now agreed to \nstrike that language. They are also filibustering because they objected \nto attaching routine Hyde restrictions that have been the law of the \nland for nearly 40 years--the money that is outside of the General \nTreasury process. Now, I have agreed to change the language of my bill \nso the Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund only includes money drawn \nfrom the General Treasury. I have also agreed to accept the amendment \nfrom Senator Leahy that I previously opposed in the interest of trying \nto get to ``yes.''\n  I plan to speak more on this tomorrow, but I am hopeful that by \nfinally making these changes, we can be met at least halfway by our \nfriends across the aisle. I feel like we have continued to try to make \nchanges in this legislation in an interest of giving them an \nopportunity to vote for a bill they said they all support but which \nthey ultimately filibustered because of the objections I just \naddressed, and both of the major objections are addressed by this \namendment and this legislation.\n  So I hope we can get to a resolution on this bill. The victims of \nhuman trafficking are typically young girls between the ages of 12 and \n14 years old. This is justly called modern-day slavery, because these \nvictims of human trafficking are literally enslaved and sold for sex or \nheld for involuntary servitude against their will. Many of them come \nfrom other countries, but the vast majority of them come from right \nhere in the United States of America.\n  We need to do something about this. This legislation does that \n``something,'' and I think we have more than demonstrated good faith in \ntrying to meet our colleagues' objections across the aisle by proposing \nlanguage that works, that accomplishes the result but removes the \nobjectionable language our colleagues across the aisle have seen fit to \nfilibuster on.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n              Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, while my colleague is on the floor, I want \nto commend Senator Cantwell for her superb work on this legislation. \nSenator Cantwell has really been the leader in the effort to get the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to look at alternative payment \nmodels in the Medicare Advantage Program. This is a hugely important \nprogram for us in the Northwest. It is also, by the way, very \nextensively used in Minnesota. I think my colleague from Washington \nState has done particularly important work in also looking, as part of \nthis discussion, at what is called a value-based modifier.\n  Mr. President, I have some thank-yous to make--and I will be very \nbrief--but before I do that, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with Senator Cantwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I rise to talk about a provision in this legislation \nintended to move the health care payment system toward better outcomes \nand efficiency.\n  Physicians in my State and others are innovating by partnering with \nhigh-performing Medicare Advantage plans. This model can grant the \nhealth care provider significant accountability and ownership of a \npatient's health, with the result of achieving impressive health \noutcomes, reducing overlap and duplication, and saving money for \neveryone involved.\n  I was successful in including a provision in the bill requiring the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to study integrating alternative \npayment models in the Medicare Advantage payment system. This study \nwill also assess feasibility of including a value-based modifier.\n  I look forward to working with my Finance Committee colleagues in the \nfuture to promote the innovation and efficiency taking place in \nMedicare Advantage.\n  I ask that the distinguished ranking member of the Finance Committee \nwork with me in the future toward these goals.\n  Mr. WYDEN. H.R. 2 moves the physician payment system from one that \nrewards volume to one that rewards value. I look forward to extending \nvalue-based policies across the entire spectrum of Medicare. I agree, \nit is important to reward all providers and all Medicare Advantage \nplans that provide high value and high quality care. I look forward to \nworking with the Senator and the entire Finance Committee to achieve \nthese goals.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Just a couple of quick thank-yous, and then I want to let \nmy colleague wrap up for our side.\n  It is pretty clear, Mr. President, that a bill of this magnitude does \nnot happen by osmosis. It comes about because of scores of hearings, \nroundtables, briefings, and countless hours of staff time. I am just \ngoing to take a couple of minutes to thank some people who did so much \nto make this possible.\n  First, I thank Leader Reid and his very capable health care staffer \nKate Leone. When there is a big health care issue before the Senate, \nKate Leone is the person you want to have in the trenches with you. I \nwant to thank Senator Reid, because during the short tenure in which I \nwas the chair of the Senate Finance Committee, we started working \nclosely together on reforming the Medicare reimbursement system, and \nhis leadership is very much a part of the success of this evening.\n  Second, there was staff at the various congressional support agencies \nwho provided technical assistance. We are talking about CMS, the \nCongressional Budget Office, the Congressional Research Service, \nlegislative counsel, and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. I \nwould also like to note the efforts made by Ira Burney, Anne Scott, and \nJennifer Druckman in the CMS Office of Legislation and Tom Bradley and \nLori Housman of the Congressional Budget Office.\n  I would also like to recognize Chairman Hatch and his very capable \nand dedicated staff. They worked many, many months on this issue, \nconstantly reaching across the aisle--and former Hatch staffer, Dan \nTodd, current Hatch staffers Kristin Welsh and Erin Dempsey \nparticularly deserve recognition.\n  I want to close by thanking my staff, our finance staff and personal \nstaff, affectionately known as the health team. Some, such as Karen \nFisher, Matt Kazan, Juan Machado, and former staffer David Schwartz \nhave survived two Democratic chairmen and more doc fixes than they \ncould possibly wish to remember. So this is an especially significant \nmoment for them. Others, like Anne Dwyer, Hannah Hawkins, and Jennifer \nPhillips, provided invaluable insight and counsel along the way.\n  One last point, if I might. Having tried for years to specialize in \nhealth care, going back to the days when I was codirector of the Oregon \nGray Panthers, I thought that over the years that I picked up a little \nbit with respect to health care policy and came to really understand \nthe issues--not so much, particularly when I think about the \nextraordinary work of two very talented individuals in our office who \nhave really been the leaders, in my view, on this SGR reform cause. One \nwas our health chief Liz Jurinka. She deserves special notice for her \npersistent leadership, creativity, and focus and, secondly, her \ncolleague, Jocelyn Moore, whom we had the good fortune--who came to us \nfrom Senator Rockefeller. She brings great expertise and years of \nexperience to the field. Certainly, what I have learned from them, \nafter a career of trying to specialize in these issues, has done so \nmuch to assist the committee, assist\n\n[[Page S2164]]\n\nme, and I want to express my gratitude to them.\n  The work of the bipartisan Finance Committee staff--through all its \nfits and starts--is what got us here today. I want to thank all of \nthem, and I think it is very appropriate that my colleague from \nWashington State, Senator Cantwell, who has done so much good work on \nthese issues, is going to close today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for his \nleadership on this legislation and on health care in general. I will \nalways think of him as a Senator who has been an advocate for reforming \nour health care system and oftentimes wanting to move faster than \neverybody here.\n  I am with him and the Northwest is with him, and that is why tonight \nis really a very proud moment for him as the ranking member of this \ncommittee to see the monumental shift in the way we have been dealing \nwith the payment system and the Medicare access system and the \nchildren's health care program. So tonight, hopefully, we will put \nbehind us a long-debated issue of how physicians are paid, but it will \nalso start us on a new path to make sure people in America are \nguaranteed better outcomes and a process by which we will help reduce \nthe costs of health care by focusing on both the cost of health care \nand the outcomes. So my colleague entered into the Record tonight--and \nI want to thank him for that--a colloquy that addresses the issue of \nhow those who are part of accountable care organizations who will be \ngiven the resources to focus on high-performing health care systems \nwill be able to under this study equate exactly how well they can do \nand how well they should be rewarded in reducing costs and giving \nbetter outcomes.\n  My colleague from Oregon speaks of this because he and I come from a \npart of the country that literally delivers better outcomes in health \ncare at lower costs than many other States in the United States of \nAmerica. Our residents want to know why the rest of the country can't \npractice medicine the same way. We want those savings that you get from \nthe health care system to be plugged in or used for other purposes. \nThey could be part of tax reform even. But we also want the citizens of \nour State to get better health care. We want them to have better \noutcomes, and we think that moving off a fee-for-service system and \nonto a system that focuses on the outcome of patients is the best way \nfor our country to move forward.\n  So this legislation before us today builds on that process we started \nin the Affordable Care Act, something that is called the value-based \nmodifier that basically takes the fee-for-service system--when you \nthink about it, fee for service is about volume, about ordering more \ntests--and we are saying we want physicians to be rewarded for the \noutcome and the good performance and the focus on whether the patient \nactually gets well or is given the best health care delivery.\n  In essence, the value modifier seeks to emulate the success \nWashington and Oregon have had and give us better, healthy outcomes for \npatients and lower costs. This year the value-based modifier is the \nbeginning which physicians for the first time will see an adjustment. \nAnd building on that progress, Sylvia Burwell, the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services recently announced that Medicare would aim to tie 90 \npercent of their Medicare fee-for-service payments to quality or value \ninitiatives by 2018. So this is tying half of all Medicare fee-for-\nservice payments to an alternative payment model and helping us move \nforward on, again, focusing on outcomes.\n  I thank my colleague for entering into the colloquy the ongoing \nanalysis that we need to do to continue to make changes on the health \ncare system and congratulate him on the significant success of getting \nthis bill done. It means we can spend more time focusing on efficiency, \non quality, on the best way to compensate physicians but also keeping \nthe focus on the patients and making sure they get better outcomes.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/14/senate-section/article/S2164-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, I wish to state my opposition to S. \n650 in its current form. This legislation would extend the deadline for \ninstallation of Positive Train Control, PTC, by 5 years. I cannot agree \nwith allowing such an extension without addressing so many other \ncritical rail safety matters.\n  As Joe Boardman, the head of Amtrak and former FRA Administrator has \nsaid, ``PTC is the most important rail safety advancement of our \ntime.'' The need for this technology was first brought to our attention \nover 45 years ago, sparked by a head-on train collision in Darien, CT \nin 1969. There have been many other horrible crashes since, and within \nthe past decade alone, the National Transportation Safety Board has \ncompleted more than two dozen train accident investigations that took \n65 lives and injured over 1,100 people--all of this, according to the \nNTSB, could have been prevented by PTC.\n  One of those horrific crashes occurred in 2008 in Southern \nCalifornia, and 25 lives were lost. PTC could have saved those lives. \nAccordingly, soon after that tragedy, Congress took real, thoughtful, \nsubstantive action and gave railroads more than 7 years to implement \nthe life-saving technology of PTC. Since then, there have been other \nmajor accidents, such as the horrific crash of a Metro-North train in \nthe Bronx in 2013 in which four lives were lost. Metro-North did not \nhave PTC, and the NTSB has said the technology could have prevented \nthose four deaths. Now, as we near the end of the 7 years, S. 650 gives \nrailroads an extension of 5 more years--and then an option for 2 more \nafter that. So, again, we must wait and risk continued loss of life as \nwe further put off proven, life-saving technology.\n  There may be issues with the deadline, and we should have a \ndiscussion about those issues. We should also have a discussion about \nthe many other issues with PTC. These include the need for resources \nfor commuter railroads, the need for greater transparency for all \nrailroads and the need for dedicated spectrum to ensure commuter \nrailroads have bandwidth to operate PTC. S. 650 doesn't address these \nother issues. Rather, the bill just focuses on the deadline. I want to \nmake sure the bill solves all the other problems.\n  In the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, I filed \namendments that actually address these other outstanding issues. I want \nto make sure funding is available for cash-strapped passenger railroads \nand commuter lines. I want to bolster transparency and make sure we \nknow where railroads truly are in the implementation process. I want to \nmake sure commuter railroads have the frequency they need to build out \nPTC, and I do not want any bill to move to the floor that ignores these \nneeds and shortchanges our commuter railroads.\n  Another issue I hold with S. 650 is the bill's lack of attention to \nother serious safety concerns that should be addressed hand-in-hand \nwith the shortcomings PTC works to resolve. Over the past few years, we \nhave witnessed an onslaught of other rail safety issues spurred by far \ntoo many preventable accidents. Many of these accidents have happened \non Metro-North, the commuter railroad serving Connecticut, the State I \nproudly represent. From mid-2013 into early 2014, we witnessed five \nmajor incidents on our commuter railroad. Then, again in February 2015, \nwe witnessed another horrific incident in which six lives were\n\n[[Page S2165]]\n\nlost. These accidents have raised a host of other needs: cameras on \ntrains, sufficient crew size, improved rail inspections, close-call \nreporting systems, redundant signal protection, alerters on rail cabs, \nspeed restrictions, better Federal oversight, and safer highway-rail \ngrade crossings.\n  In the committee, I filed amendments that also advance these reforms. \nThose reforms must be a part of any real rail safety discussion. If we \nare even to consider a PTC deadline extension, it is imperative we take \nup other well-known measures that can improve safety while we work \ntoward full PTC implementation. I appreciate the commitment from the \nchairman and ranking member of the Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee to work with me to advance these reforms. I \nalso appreciate the committee including a modified version of one of my \namendments in the bill that passed out of the committee. Although I \nwithdrew my other amendments in the committee, I look forward to \nworking with all of my colleagues to improve this bill further. I am \nconfident that together we can achieve important reforms and truly \nadvance safety for all who depend on rail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/14/senate-section/article/S2165-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2165-S2166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EVERY CHILD ACHIEVES ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a copy of my opening remarks at the markup of the Every \nChild Achieves Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Every Child Achieves Act of 2015\n\n       We are meeting today to write legislation that will fix the \n     problems with ``No Child Left Behind,'' the federal law \n     causing confusion and anxiety in our country's 100,000 public \n     schools.\n       Working together the last few months, Senator Murray and I \n     have found a consensus about the urgent need to fix these \n     problems as well as a remarkable consensus about how to fix \n     them.\n       That consensus is this: Continue the law's important \n     measurements of academic progress of students but restore to \n     states, school districts, classroom teachers and parents the \n     responsibility for deciding what to do about improving \n     student achievement. This change should produce fewer tests \n     and more appropriate ways to measure student achievement. It \n     is the most effective path to advance higher state standards, \n     better teaching, and real accountability.\n       We have drafted a bill based upon this consensus which we \n     will offer as a starting point for our deliberations.\n       The problems with No Child Left Behind have been created by \n     a combination of presidential action and congressional \n     inaction. In 2001, President Bush and Congress enacted ``No \n     Child Left Behind,'' requiring a total of 17 tests between \n     reading, math and science during a child's elementary and \n     secondary education. The results of these tests must be \n     disaggregated and reported according to race, ethnicity, \n     gender, disability and other measures so parents, teachers \n     and the community could see which children are being left \n     behind. The law also created federal standards for whether a \n     school is succeeding or failing, what a state or school \n     district must do about that failure, and whether a teacher \n     was highly qualified to teach in a classroom.\n       If fixing No Child Left Behind were a standardized test, \n     Congress would have earned a failing grade for each of the \n     last seven years. ``No Child Left Behind'' expired in 2007 \n     but Congress has been unable to agree on how to reauthorize \n     it. As a result, the law's original requirements have stayed \n     in place and gradually became unworkable. This has caused \n     almost all of America's public schools to be classified as \n     failing under the terms of the law. To avoid this bizarre \n     result, President Obama's Education Secretary offered waivers \n     from the terms of the law. But the Secretary required each of \n     the 42 states currently operating under waivers to adopt \n     certain academic standards, take prescribed steps to help \n     failing schools, and to evaluate teachers in a defined way.\n       So much new federal control of local schools has produced a \n     backlash against ``Common Core'' academic standards, teacher \n     evaluation, and against tests in general. Governors and chief \n     state school officers complain about federal overreach. \n     Infuriated teachers say that the U.S. Department of Education \n     has become a ``National Human Resources Department or, in \n     effect, a national school board.''\n       In each of the last two Congresses, this Committee produced \n     bills to fix No Child Left Behind. Basically, these bills \n     divided our committee along party lines. Even so, two \n     Congresses ago, Sens. Enzi, Kirk and I voted with the \n     Democratic majority to report a bill out of committee so that \n     the full senate could act. In the last Congress, the \n     committee majority passed a partisan bill without any \n     Republican votes, but I committed to support Chairman Harkin \n     in taking the bill to the floor if there would be an open \n     amendment process. Unfortunately, these bills never reached \n     the senate floor.\n       In January, Sen. Murray suggested that the two of us work \n     together to try to bridge the partisan divide and to \n     recommend to the full committee a solution. I accepted her \n     suggestion and I want to thank her for it. We have listened \n     carefully to our senate colleagues, to teachers, principals, \n     governors, chief state school officers, students and parents \n     and the business and civil rights communities--and to each \n     other.\n       I especially want to thank our staffs--Evan Schatz \n     (pronounced SHOTS), Sarah Bolton, and Amanda Beaumont on Sen. \n     Murray's staff, and David Cleary, Peter Oppenheim, and \n     Lindsay Fryer on my staff--for their hard work and the way \n     that they worked, trying to strip aside the rhetoric and look \n     for real solutions. I believe they, and we, have succeeded in \n     that.\n       We found that no issue stirred as much controversy as \n     testing. Our proposal maintains the reading, math and science \n     tests and disaggregated reporting requirements established in \n     2001. The more we studied the problem; the issue seems not to \n     be the 17 federal tests. A third grader, for example, is \n     required to take only one test in math and one in reading \n     during one year. Denver Public Schools superintendent Tom \n     Boasberg testified before the committee that he'd like to \n     keep math and reading tests to a total of 4 hours a year--\n     that's about what they are right now in Denver, according to \n     our calculations.\n       Instead, the problem is the federal government's \n     accountability system for what to do about the results of \n     these tests. This federal accountability system has greatly \n     contributed to the exploding number of state and local tests.\n       Because of this, our proposal would end federal test-based \n     accountability and restore state and local responsibility for \n     creating systems holding schools and teachers accountable. \n     State accountability systems must meet limited federal \n     guidelines, including challenging academic standards for all \n     students, but the federal government is prohibited from \n     determining or approving state standards or even \n     incentivizing states into adopting specific standards. In \n     other words, whether a state adopts Common Core is entirely \n     that state's decision. This transfer of responsibility is why \n     we believe our proposal will result in fewer and more \n     appropriate tests.\n       Our proposal allows, but does not require, states to \n     develop and implement teacher evaluation systems that link \n     student achievement to teacher performance. States will be \n     allowed to use federal funds to implement evaluations the way \n     they see fit.\n       States will determine their lowest-performing schools and \n     receive federal funds to assist those schools but the federal \n     government will not mandate specific steps to fix those \n     schools.\n       Sens. Murray and Isakson will propose and I will support an \n     amendment for competitive planning grants to help states \n     expand quality early childhood education by addressing the \n     fragmentation of current early childhood federal, state, \n     local, public and private programs.\n       In conclusion, I have this request for members of the \n     committee: please exercise restraint and help us get to a \n     result.\n       If we senators were students in a classroom, none of us \n     would expect to receive a passing grade for unfinished work. \n     Seven years is long enough to consider how to fix No Child \n     Left Behind. The members of this committee are thoroughly \n     familiar with the issues. Twenty of our 22 members were on \n     the committee during the last Congress when we considered and \n     reported a bill. Sixteen of our members were here in the \n     previous Congress. Over the last 6 years and 3 months we have \n     had 27 hearings on elementary and secondary education.\n       Knowing this, Sen. Murray and I have exercised restraint. \n     Neither of us insisted on putting into our base bill every \n     proposal about which we feel strongly, although we will offer \n     some of these as amendments when we reach the senate floor. \n     We know that to get a result we have to achieve consensus, \n     which means more than sixty votes. We also know that in \n     conference we will need to agree with the House of \n     Representatives, which is of one political party, and then \n     with the President, who is of another.\n       During our committee discussions, any germane amendment \n     will be in order to the bipartisan agreement Sen. Murray and \n     I will offer. Any amendment related to K-12 education will be \n     in order on the senate floor. Nevertheless, I would ask each \n     member of this committee to exercise restraint in search of a \n     result. If we can agree on most things, let's put aside the \n     other things until another debate and another day.\n       And I would ask one other thing: in offering your \n     amendments, please keep in mind the advice we received \n     earlier this year from Carol Burris, New York's 2013 High \n     School principal of the Year:\n       ``I ask that your committee remember that the American \n     public school system was built on the belief that local \n     communities cherish their children and have the right and \n     responsibility, within sensible limits, to determine how they \n     are schooled.\n       While the federal government has a very special role in \n     ensuring that our students do not experience discrimination \n     based on who they are or what their disability may be, \n     Congress is not a National School Board.\n\n[[Page S2166]]\n\n       Although our locally elected school boards may not be \n     perfect, they represent one of the purest forms of democracy \n     we have. Bad ideas in the small do damage in the small and \n     are easily corrected. Bad ideas at the federal level result \n     in massive failure and are far harder to fix.''\n       In other words, our well-intended guidance from Washington \n     is usually not as effective as a decision made in the home, \n     classroom, and community by those closest to the children.\n       What we heard over and over again from Democrats as well as \n     Republicans was that while continuing measurements of \n     academic progress are important in holding schools and \n     teachers accountable, we should respect the judgments of \n     those closest to the children and leave to them most \n     decisions about how to help 3.4 million teachers help 50 \n     million children in 100,000 public schools improve student \n     achievement.\n       Fifty years ago on Palm Sunday, President Lyndon B. Johnson \n     signed the first Elementary and Secondary Education Act. A \n     good way to celebrate that anniversary is to fix the problems \n     with the most recent version of the act so that all our \n     children can have the best possible opportunity to learn what \n     they need to know and be able to do in an increasingly \n     complex world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/14/senate-section/article/S2166-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 TRIBUTE TO BISHOP WALTER SCOTT THOMAS\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this Sunday, I will be honored and \npleased to participate in a celebration of Bishop Walter Scott Thomas' \n40th anniversary as pastor of the New Psalmist Baptist Church in \nBaltimore, MD. Bishop Thomas is one of the great leaders of the faith \ncommunity in Baltimore. When he became pastor of New Psalmist Baptist \nChurch in 1975, the congregation numbered 200 or so people. Today, the \nchurch has over 7,000 active members. There are Bible study classes \nheld every day of the week, a 3-year discipleship program, leadership \nclasses, and a school for future ministers. New Psalmist has a \nnationally televised broadcast, ``Empowering Disciples,'' that can be \nviewed locally on WJZ TV and on the Word Network. There are three \nworship services on Sundays and one on Wednesday. New Psalmist is \ncommitted to caring for community and for God's creation. Classes are \nheld to teach members how to Go Green and conserve God's creation. \nEvery year, the church helps over 500 families at Christmas, and feeds \n100 disadvantaged families each month.\n  Bishop Thomas is known as a pastor's pastor. He makes himself \navailable as a mentor and source of strength for other pastors. Ten \nyears ago, 28 sons and daughters of the New Psalmist Baptist Church who \npastor churches across the Nation gathered and voted unanimously to \nelect Bishop Thomas as president of Kingdom Association of Covenant \nPastors and to the office of bishop. Later that year, Bishop Thomas was \nelevated to the office of bishop and presiding prelate of The Kingdom \nAssociation of Covenant Pastors. That historic occasion was held at the \nFirst Mariner Arena in front of over 10,000 people. The Kingdom \nAssociation of Covenant Pastors is a newly established association \nconsisting of men and women who have been influenced by the ministry of \nNew Psalmist Baptist Church and Bishop Thomas.\n  Bishop Thomas isn't content just to lead New Psalmist Baptist Church. \nHe served as the president of the Hampton University Minister's \nConference from 1999 to 2002. Under his leadership, conference \nattendance doubled. Bishop Thomas is also an inspirational author of \nbooks such as ``Spiritual Navigation for the 21st Century'' and ``Good \nMeat Makes Its Own Gravy''. He is the editor of ``Outstanding Black \nSermons, Volume 4''. Bishop Thomas received his bachelor of science \ndegree from the University of Maryland in economics. He earned his \nmaster of divinity degree from the Howard University School of Religion \nin Washington, DC and a doctor of ministry degree from Saint Mary's \nSeminary & University in Baltimore. In addition to his earned degrees, \nBishop Thomas was bestowed with an honorary doctor of divinity degree \nfrom Virginia Seminary and Bethune Cookman College. Bishop Thomas and \nhis wife and committed partner in ministry, Patricia, have three \nchildren, Joi, Walter Jr., and Joshua.\n  New Psalmist Baptist Church has a rich history that spans over 100 \nyears. The church was founded by Rev. Junius Gray in 1899 as the Right \nIndependent Freewill Baptist Church. The first members--fewer than 20 \npeople--met in the basement of a house on Russell Terrace. In 1901, the \nchurch purchased and moved to a two-story building at 1102 Parrish \nAlley. In 1911, the church, renamed Psalmist Baptist Church, purchased \nand remodeled property at Riggs Avenue and Woodyear Street. Reverend \nGray pastored Psalmist Baptist Church for 47 years.\n  Rev. Frederick C. Atkins was called to pastor Psalmist Baptist Church \nin June 1948. Under his leadership, membership grew and, because of \nthat growth, the church purchased and moved to a new building at Druid \nHill and North Avenues in 1954. The $56,000 mortgage was paid in full \nand burned in 1960 and the church was renamed the New Psalmist Baptist \nChurch. Reverend Atkins served as pastor until his sudden death on \nMarch 16, 1974. Bishop Thomas, who was called to proclaim the Word of \nGod in 1973 under the anointed leadership of Dr. Harold Carter, pastor \nof the New Shiloh Baptist Church in Baltimore, took over in 1975. In \n1978, New Psalmist moved from Druid Hill and North Avenues to Cathedral \nand Franklin Streets. While in downtown Baltimore, New Psalmist grew \ntremendously. In 1994, New Psalmist broke ground and 2 years later, \nmoved from Franklin and Cathedral Street to Old Frederick Road, a \nmulti-million dollar worship center and ministry complex on 19 acres of \nland. The church continued to grow and in the fall of 2010, it moved \ninto a brand new 4,000-seat worship facility.\n  New Psalmist Baptist Church is a vibrant and welcoming place. Past \nattendees have included the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., the \nReverend Jesse Jackson, the Reverend T.D. Jakes, former President Bill \nClinton in 1998, and then-Senator Barack Obama in 2007. New Psalmist \nBaptist Church members walk in faith and work together for the common \ngood. The church provides job training and a fitness and health \nministry; donates school supplies to children; ministers to the deaf, \nhomeless, and prisoners and their families; hosts blood drives; \npartners with 12 schools across Maryland to help students, parents, and \nschool staff members succeed in their educational mission; and is an \naccredited organization under the United Nations Environment Program, \nwhich seeks to create global policies that will protect our planet.\n  I encourage my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating Bishop \nThomas and his family and friends on his 40th pastoral anniversary at \nNew Psalmist Baptist Church and sending along best wishes to all the \nmembers of New Psalmist who know, as President John F. Kennedy said at \nhis inauguration 54 years ago, ``that here on earth God's work must \ntruly be our own.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/14/senate-section/article/S2166-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2166-S2167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. GLENN STEELE\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the career of \nDr. Glenn Steele upon his retirement from Geisinger Health System. \nTeddy Roosevelt once said, ``Far and away the best prize that life has \nto offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.'' In his 14 \nyears as CEO of Geisinger, Glenn Steele has been the embodiment of that \nidea.\n  Geisinger is located in Dansville, PA, and is the largest rural \nhealth services organization in the country, serving more than 3 \nmillion residents throughout 48 counties. Annually, Geisinger provides \nover $400 million in community support, helping to meet the needs of \nall Pennsylvanians in the area, regardless of their ability to pay. \nUnder Dr. Steele, Geisinger has been a leader in delivery system \nreform, improving quality of care and population health while reducing \ncost.\n  Dr. Steele is a trailblazer in the health care field. With a medical \ndegree from New York University School of Medicine and a doctorate in \nmicrobiology from Lund University in Sweden, Dr. Steele brings a unique \nperspective to managing a health care system. He has authored and \ncoauthored over 460 scientific and professional articles and has been \nwidely recognized for his investigations into the treatment of liver \ncancer and colorectal cancer surgery. He is also a visionary in the \narea of health care delivery and financing, one of the achievements for \nwhich Geisinger is most well-known. Since\n\n[[Page S2167]]\n\n2012, Dr. Steele has served on the U.S. Congressional Budget Office's \npanel of health advisors, cementing his reputation as a national \nleader.\n  Dr. Steele has earned numerous awards over the years. He was named to \nModern Health Care's list of the 50 Most Influential Physician \nExecutives five times and the list of the 100 Most Influential People \nin Health care five times. He received the CEO IT Achievement Award in \n2006, American Hospital Association's Grassroots Champion Award in \n2007, the American Hospitals Association's Health Research & Education \nTrust Award and the HFMA Board of Directors' Award in 2011. Most \nrecently, he was named to the Becker's Hospital Review's list of ``40 \nof the Smartest People in Health care'' for his work in health care \nreform. He also received the 2014 Gail L. Warden Leadership Excellence \nAward, which recognizes people for innovative approaches to bringing \nhigh-value and accessible health care to their communities, permanently \ntransforming and improving the field. That final award is a testament \nto Geisinger's legacy and sums up Dr. Steele's vision of health care.\n  On behalf of the people of Pennsylvania, I wish Glenn Steele well in \nthis new chapter. I have no doubt he will continue transforming health \ncare and changing and improving the lives of people and the communities \nwhere they live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/14/senate-section/article/S2167-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING JILL LISTI DANCE STUDIO\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, among the best ways to introduce \nthe arts into our local communities is through small businesses.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently extend and expand the charitable deduction for \ncontributions of food inventory; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, millions of Americans are racing against \nthe clock to meet tomorrow's midnight deadline to file their taxes. In \nthe closing hours of the 113th Congress, we came together to approve \nlegislation to extend for 1 year, just 1 year, several tax credits that \nare essential to small businesses and middleclass families. A 1 year \nextension of these tax credits was surely welcomed by many, but such a \nshort extension leaves in place the uncertainty needed by so many \nfamilies and small businesses as they look ahead to the coming year to \nplan large purchases, expansions, new home purchases, or even a family \nvacation. I hope that Congress will tackle meaningful tax reform \nlegislation this year, so that we can protect hardworking families, \nhold corporations accountable, incentivize environmental protections, \nand encourage charitable giving.\n  So today, ahead of Tax Day, I am introducing three commonsense \nproposals, S. 930, S. 931, and S. 932, that will provide reasonable tax \ncredits for such things as surplus food donations, art donations, and \npreservation of our historic buildings in communities and villages \nacross the country.\n  The bipartisan Good Samaritan Hunger Relief Tax Incentive Extension \nAct expands upon a proven and effective tax incentive to encourage \nbusinesses and farms to donate surplus food to their local food banks. \nA 2011 study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that demand on \nfood banks across the country has risen dramatically during and since \nthe recent economic recession, with more than 50 million Americans \nliving in food insecure households. Despite this, as much as 40 percent \nof the food that is produced, grown and transported in the United \nStates goes unused as some businesses find it too costly to donate the \nexcess food, amounting to 70 billion pounds of wasted food each year.\n  The Good Samaritan Hunger Relief Tax Incentive Act addresses this by \npermanently extending the same tax incentives to donate food now \navailable to corporations to all businesses, including small \nbusinesses, farmers, ranchers and restaurant owners--many of whom often \nhave large amounts of fresh food to donate. Since the most recent \nextension of this tax incentive through 2013, the restaurant industry \nalone experienced a 137 percent increase in the pounds of food donated. \nThis bill--cosponsored by Senators Cochran, Stabenow, McCain, Casey, \nand Blunt, is supported by many organizations including Feeding \nAmerica, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the Food Marketing \nInstitute, Grocery Manufacturers Association, the National Restaurant \nAssociation, Hunger Free Vermont, and the Vermont Food Bank.\n  The Artist-Museum Partnership Act was first introduced in 2000. This \nlegislation would preserve cherished art works for the public by \nallowing artists to take a fair market deduction for works they donate \nto museums, libraries, colleges and other public institutions. Under \ncurrent law, artists that donate their created work may only deduct the \ncost of supplies, while a collector of the same work that donates it\n\n[[Page S2175]]\n\nto qualified charitable institutions is allowed to take a tax deduction \nequal to the fair market value of the donated work.\n  Prior to 1969, artists and collectors alike were able to take a \ndeduction equivalent to the fair market value of a work. Congress \nchanged the law for artists more than 30 years ago in response to the \nperception that some taxpayers were taking advantage of the law by \ninflating the market value of self-created works. Since the law was \nchanged with respect to artists, fewer and fewer of them have donated \ntheir works to museums and cultural institutions, while the government \nhas cut down significantly on the abuse of fair market value \ndeterminations. The Artist-Museum Partnership Act would restore the law \nto pre-1969 and allow artists who donate their own paintings, \nmanuscripts, compositions, or scholarly compositions to be subject to \nthe same new rules that all taxpayers or collectors who donate such \nworks follow.\n  The Artist-Museum Partnership Act is supported by such organizations \nas the Association of Art Museum Directors, American Alliance of \nMuseums, Americans for the Arts, League of American Orchestras, OPERA \nAmerica, Dance/USA, National Assembly of State Arts Agencies, the \nVermont Arts Counsel, and the Shelburne Museum.\n  Finally, the Historic Downtown and Preservation and Access Act would \ncreate a refundable tax credit for the installation of fire sprinklers \nand elevators in older, multi-use buildings in historic downtowns. Each \nyear fire destroys hundreds of vulnerable historic buildings that serve \nas the anchors of America's vibrant villages and downtowns, in many \ncases resulting in injury or loss of life. The Historic Downtown and \nPreservation and Access Act creates a 50 percent refundable tax credit \ncapped at $50,000 to encourage the installation of upfront but costly \nsprinkler systems in order to help prevent the loss of life, reduce \nproperty damage, and decrease Federal expenditures on rebuilding \nefforts after these fires.\n  This bill also incentivizes the installation of elevators in order to \nencourage the use of upper story office, retail, and housing space in \nhistoric downtown buildings that would otherwise go unused due to \ninaccessibility. The new refundable tax credit, modeled after the State \nof Vermont's highly successful downtown historic tax credit, would \nallow private entities with little tax liability and nonprofits alike \nto install these important property and life-saving devices in historic \nbuildings.\n  Congress must have a meaningful debate about how we can best reform, \nsimplify, and streamline our complicated tax system. These are just a \nfew of the proposals I hope Congress will consider in this debate. It \nis time we start working to incentivize programs that stand to best \nhelp our communities, rather than protect the wealthiest among us from \npaying their fair share.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nthe Good Samaritan Hunger Relief Act of 2015, which was introduced \ntoday by Senator Patrick Leahy and cosponsored by Senators Bob Casey, \nThad Cochran, Debbie Stabenow, and Roy Blunt.\n  This bipartisan bill would benefit food banks and hunger charities \naround the nation. At its core, the bill would provide tax incentives \nfor small and medium business who donate food or resources to food \nbanks. This means restaurants, farms, and other food providers can do \neven more in their local communities to help fight hunger.\n  Speaking for my state, I can tell you that hunger is a very real \nproblem in Arizona. Currently about one in five Arizonans live below \nthe poverty line. In some parts of the State, one-in-four children and \none-in-seven seniors live in poverty--particularly on Indian \nreservations where unemployment rates approach 75 percent, and in \nminority communities. Often these individuals are left to wonder where \ntheir next meal will come from.\n  I am proud that Phoenix, Arizona is home to the world's first food \nbank, the St. Mary's Food Bank. Since its founding in 1967, St. Mary's \nhas grown into a leading hunger organization and has distributed more \nthan 700 million pounds of food to people all over Arizona.\n  I believe this bill's projected cost to the Treasury can be offset by \nreducing unnecessary and wasteful agriculture subsidies. I would \nencourage my colleagues to look at the most recent Farm Bill that was \nsigned into law in 2013 and is projected to cost over $996 billion over \nthe next 10 years. It is fraught with special interest farm subsidies \nthat we could instead reduce or terminate and use the savings to pay \nfor the important tax incentive programs provided by this bill.\n  For example, the Farm Bill includes crop insurance subsidies for \ntobacco products, which are estimated to cost taxpayers $33 million \neach year. It also provides for the USDA Market Access Program, which \nhas long been criticized by taxpayer watchdogs as a form of corporate \nwelfare because it spends roughly $200 million annually to subsidize \nadvertising, market research and trade shows for large corporations \noverseas. The Farm Bill also includes an obscure set of USDA grants \nthat subsidizes scientific research for large agriculture operations, \nsuch as $25 million earmarked for the study of the health benefits of \nlima beans and peas, and $1.3 million set-aside for genome sequencing \nof Christmas trees. Further, it calls for the creation of a USDA \nCatfish Office, which I have long criticized along with the Government \nAccountability Office and the Obama administration for being wasteful \nand duplicative of FDA's catfish inspection program and will ultimately \ncost the American taxpayer $14 million a year. These are just a few of \nthe many wasteful Farm Bill programs that could be eliminated to offset \nthe estimated costs of our proposed tax incentive legislation.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation and consider \nthese and other Farm Bill spending offsets as the bill moves through \nthe legislative process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/14/senate-section/article/S2175-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 135--MAKING MINORITY PARTY APPOINTMENTS FOR THE 114TH \n                                CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. Reid of Nevada submitted the following resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
