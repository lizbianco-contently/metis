We await the \nbeginning of a comprehensive review process premised on a simple \nquestion: Can the agreement meet its essential test of leaving our \ncountry and our allies safer?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/senate-section/article/S5091-7", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5091-S5092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EVERY CHILD ACHIEVES ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Finally, Mr. President, turning to the business \ncurrently before the Senate, the bipartisan education debate we are \nhaving in the new Senate is good for our country and it was long \noverdue.\n  For too long, bureaucrats in Washington tried to dictate top-down, \none-size-fits-all education policies to millions of students and \nfamilies across our country. It was hurting our kids, and it needed to \nchange. So a new Senate that is back to work for the American people \ndecided to work together to do something about it. We thought it was \npast time to place more education decisionmaking power where it truly \nbelongs--with parents, with teachers, with States, and with school \nboards, not with a distant Federal bureaucracy.\n  The pundits said Washington could never address these challenges, but \nthe bipartisan Every Child Achieves Act actually received unanimous \nsupport from every Democrat and every Republican in committee. Just \nthink about that for a moment. It is an impressive achievement, and it \nwouldn't have been possible without a functioning Senate and a lot of \ndedication and determination from the bill's primary sponsors, the \nRepublican Senator from Tennessee and the Democratic Senator from \nWashington.\n  This debate may be years overdue, but Republicans and Democrats are \ncertainly having their voices heard today. They are working across the \naisle, they are representing the views of their constituents, and they \nare offering amendments. The new Senate has processed over two dozen \namendments to this bill already, and we have adopted quite a few of \nthem. In fact, we have now taken more rollcall amendment votes this \nyear in the new Congress than throughout the entirety of the last \nCongress combined. That is an achievement both parties can celebrate. \nIt represents progress for our country. And this afternoon we have a \nchance to make more because, with cooperation from our friends across \nthe\n\n[[Page S5092]]\n\naisle, we can continue to advance the Every Child Achieves Act later \ntoday and set up final passage soon. That would mean another bipartisan \nachievement for our country and a long-overdue win for our kids.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/senate-section/article/S5092-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my heart goes out to the people in Eastern \nKentucky, with the devastating floods. The issue before our entire \ncountry is that we have storms like this appearing from nowhere, storms \nlike we have never had before. I don't know the history of Kentucky, \nbut I have watched and been briefed on what is going on around the rest \nof the Nation, and these storms are coming all the time--untoward.\n  It is too bad that my Republican colleagues have denied climate \nchange. We have to do something, and we have to do something very soon.\n  There was a meeting a few days ago at the White House where the \nPresident announced that with regard to climate change we have to do \nsomething now. He said that by the year 2100, scientists say, the seas \nwill have risen 16 feet. What does that mean? It means that much of \nFlorida will be underwater.\n  We have things happening that have never been recorded before. In the \nSierras, some bears are not hibernating. We have an average rainfall \nand snowpack in upper Colorado, and none of it gets into the river. So \nI would hope my friends would join with us in doing something positive \nwith regard to climate change.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/senate-section/article/S5092-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE HIGHWAY BILL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, more than 62 million vehicles were recalled \nlast year in our country--twice the previous record. The number of \nsafety complaints to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \ndoubled. Over the past year, for example, faulty ignition switches led \nto the recall of 2.6 million cars. At least 124 people died and almost \n300 were injured by this ignition switch problem, which did many \ndifferent things, one of which was to stall a car in traffic and during \nthe process disable the airbags. The manufacturer was aware of the \ndefect for more than a decade and did nothing about it. Exploding \nairbags--another problem--claimed the lives of at least 8 people and \nled to the recall of 34 million vehicles--the largest recall of any \nconsumer product in the United States ever. Once again, it appears the \nmanufacturer knew of the defect years before notifying Federal \nregulators.\n  Given the number of recalls, Congress should be investing the \nresources to improve public safety and give regulators the tools to \nkeep us safe. But it appears Senate Republicans have learned nothing \nfrom the many recalls just this year. The Republican highway safety \nbill, which is being considered in the committee on commerce today, \ndoes not increase funding for Federal traffic programs. In fact, it \ncuts them back. Why? The bill does not provide any new resources to \naddress the record level of safety recalls and consumer complaints. \nUnder the Republican bill that is being considered, automakers that \ncover up defects will continue to face the same very limited penalties. \nTheir executives will be able to continue to escape accountability.\n  But that isn't all of it. The highway bill the Republicans are \npushing forward is loaded with harmful provisions that roll back \nefforts to strengthen public safety. The bill would allow 18-year-old \nyoung men and women--18 years old--to drive commercial 18-wheelers \nacross State lines. Think about that. Despite studies which show that \nthese young drivers have a fatal crash rate almost 70 percent higher \nthan older drivers, the Republican safety plan would allow these \ninexperienced teenagers to drive the largest trucks that appear on the \nroad.\n  If this odyssey of the Republicans in the commerce committee is \nsigned into law, it will lead to more crashes and, sadly, more injuries \nand more deaths.\n  Every day, 30 people in our great country are killed by drunk \ndrivers--30 people killed by drunk drivers. I just learned a couple of \ndays ago of a person who worked for me, who was a tremendously great \nemployee of the Senate--their brother-in-law was killed by a drunk \ndriver. It is so sad that we are not doing more to not only stop drunk \ndriving but to punish drunk drivers. The policy Republicans propose \ntoday hurts our efforts to combat drunk driving.\n  Listen to this one. The Republicans' bill would lessen incentives for \nStates that develop programs to prevent people who have been convicted \nof drunk driving from starting their cars if they have been drinking--\nfor example, just a simple, inexpensive device on a car. If someone has \nbeen drinking too much, the car won't start. But Republicans are going \nto take care of this and get rid of it. No longer will States have the \nability to do that. The Federal Government should not be involved in \nprograms like that.\n  The Republicans' plan also undermines safety measures that protect \npassengers and trains and, of course, the safety of all of us because \nof the problems we have with freight trains. There is a program that \nwas designed by science--it has been available for a long time--called \npositive train control which overrides operator error. A perfect \nexample of this is what happened in Philadelphia. If that had been in \neffect, that accident would not have occurred. But the Republicans \nfixed this--they are going to stop the program for 3 years.\n  Under the present law, these programs had to be implemented by the \nend of this year--not with the Republicans in the commerce committee, \nwhich will be part of any highway bill we have. They will just stop it \nfor 3 years, and that will lead to more deaths, more injuries, and more \nterror.\n  I can't understand why the Republicans would propose doing that--\ndelaying the deadline for positive train control by more than 3 years. \nI said 3 years, but it is actually more than that. There is no reason \nto roll back deadlines for important safety measures for our passenger \ntrains. Is this the best Republicans can do? I ask that.\n  For Americans who live near rail lines, trains are increasingly \ncarrying more and more flammable materials--oil, ethanol, and other \nexplosive products. In February of this year, a train carrying oil \nderailed in West Virginia, sending exploding fireballs into the air and \ncausing large necessary evacuations.\n  This and other crashes led the Department of Transportation to \nrequire the installation of new electronic brakes for any train moving \nflammable materials. Requiring better brakes when carrying these \nmaterials seems like a commonsense safety measure.\n  What do the Republicans do? Their bill repeals an important freight \nrail provision, jeopardizing communities across the country with tragic \nspills. We don't need more accidents. We need fewer accidents. We need \nto move forward and to continue the minimal programs we have, not roll \nthem back. It is clear the Republicans have not learned anything from \nthe auto recalls or the train crashes. The Senate can do better than \nadopting the Republican's attack on public safety. If the Republicans \nchoose to put those measures in the highway bill that I am told is \ncoming forward, it will not survive the Senate. We can't have stuff \nlike that. It would be just untoward and wrong.\n  Mr. President, there is no one on the floor, and I ask that the Chair \nannounce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/senate-section/article/S5092-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to address an amendment I am \nproposing to the bill, the Every Child Achieves Act. I am not going to \nask to call up the amendment at this time, but I certainly would like \nto do so at a later point in the day. I hope this amendment will be \npart of any effort to wrap-up debate on this bill because it addresses \nan important component that is being left out of discussion on the \nEvery Child Achieves Act.\n  The Every Child Achieves Act is the authorization act, but it leaves \nout the vision for school policy. This is a bipartisan bill. It is a \nbill that would give a lot more flexibility to our States, and it has \nbeen an important effort to address many shortcomings in the former \nact, the No Child Left Behind Act, that in fact left a lot of children \nbehind. In my discussions with educators throughout the State of \nOregon, with parents, administrators, and teachers, they found a great \nnumber of difficulties and problems with an act that was undermining \nthe success of our public schools, leaving a huge number of children \nbehind, and focusing on what these educators referred to as ``the \nbubble''--that is, those children who are close enough to the testing \nline to get them over the top, while decreasing attention paid to those \nchildren who could already meet the testing line or those they think \nwere not able to get to that line. That is not a holistic, \ncomprehensive education system addressing the needs of all our \nchildren. So I am delighted to see this reform on the floor of the \nSenate. The focus on assisting every child in achieving is appropriate.\n  But we cannot achieve a world-class education system that responds to \na world knowledge economy, preparing our children to be fully \nsuccessful members of that world knowledge economy, if we do not \nprovide the resources necessary for our schools to thrive. It strikes \nme as a real failure of our legislative process that a generation after \nI went through elementary and secondary education, we are a far richer \nnation, but our schools have far fewer resources.\n  My children have been attending public schools in the same blue-\ncollar school district I grew up in. I have a firsthand view of the \ndifference between what the school provided when I was there and what \nhas been provided while my children are there. The short conclusion is \nthat our classrooms are more crowded and our schools are unable to \nprovide the same range of options that benefited my generation.\n  How is it that we are a much richer nation, but we are undervaluing \nand underfunding our elementary and secondary education system in this \nNation? Well, we can tie that back to a lot that has transpired, \nincluding a huge growth in inequality in our Nation. But here is the \nkey point: While we sit here on the floor debating better education \npolicy, shouldn't we also be recognizing explicitly this huge failure \nto provide basic resources to the elementary and secondary education \nsystem?\n  The funding cuts that are currently anticipated under the sequester \nwould bring Federal investments and programs under the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act to their lowest levels since fiscal year \n2002. Let me repeat that: the lowest level since fiscal year 2002. Of \nthe lowest achieving 5 percent of schools that receive funds under part \nA of title I of such act, about two-thirds of students are not meeting \ntheir grade-level standards. It is certainly a more difficult task for \nteachers to enable students to meet those standards when our classrooms \nare more crowded.\n\n  The proposed appropriations act cuts funding for part A of title I of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 by $850 million as \ncompared to the President's budget and the Democratic funding \nalternative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time for debate has expired.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to extend the \ntime allotted to complete my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, research shows that high-quality early \neducation is critical to the educational development of every child. \nThere, too, we are underfunding the effort. The proposed appropriations \nact provides no funding for preschool development grants and a cut of \n$750 million as compared to the President's budget and the Democratic \nalternative.\n  Now, this is happening--this underfunding of education--within the \nconstruct known as the sequester. The sequester was partially \nalleviated 2 years ago by a budget deal known as Ryan-Murray. That \nRyan-Murray agreement led to saying that according to the sequester \nprinciple defense spending and nondefense spending would be treated \nequally. If one is capped, the other is capped. If one is raised, the \nother is raised.\n  That fundamental understanding led to an improvement over the last 2 \nyears. But that improvement is gone. So at the very moment, we are \ntalking about better education policy, and we are talking about worse \neducation funding. That is simply wrong--wrong for our children, wrong \nfor the next generation and the success of America. So let's embrace \nthat second half of the conversation and through my amendment--\namendment No. 2203--call for an intense negotiation to occur, \nessentially to restore appropriate funding on the nondefense programs.\n  This is a rational counterpart to the debate over the bill that we \nhave before us right now. It is certainly important for America to \nrecognize that you cannot, on the one hand, call for better education \npolicy and on the other hand devastate the funding for early childhood \neducation and devastate the funding for K-12 education and feel like \nyou have done something to make American education work better, because \nyou have not.\n  If you have underfunded education, you have undervalued our children, \nand you have undermined the future success of our Nation. I hope that \namendment No. 2203, which calls upon the House and Senate to come \ntogether and address this failure of funding, will be a significant \npart of our conversation as we work to wrap up debate on the Every \nChild Achieves Act.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Maine be allowed to speak for 5 minutes following my \ncomments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. For the information of Senators, within a few minutes \nwe hope to have a cloture vote. We are still working out an agreement, \nbut we hope to have that done within a very few minutes and may begin \nto move on\n\n[[Page S5094]]\n\nthat shortly after the Senator from Maine finishes his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. KING. ``Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this \nCongress and this administration, will be remembered in spite of \nourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance, can spare one \nor another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass, will light us \ndown, in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation.'' That was \nAbraham Lincoln in a message to Congress on December 1, 1862. I think \nhis words echo today as we talk about the serious and solemn issues \nbefore us and the one that will be coming up within 60 days, the \nconsideration of the agreement with Iran.\n  We are embarked on a historic process, a process that will result in \none of the most important votes that any of us will ever take in this \nbody, a vote that entails risks of war and peace, of life and death, of \nrelationships in the Middle East and throughout the world.\n  I have been thinking in the last 24 hours about how to approach this \ndecision, and I would like to share that today. This is a solemn \nresponsibility. The first step for this Senator is to read the \nagreement word for word and to note in the margins the questions, data, \nand analysis that we think we need in order to make this decision. That \nis No. 1.\n  No. 2 is to seek expertise, to reach outside of this body to people \nin the nuclear field--one literally needs to be a nuclear physicist to \nunderstand some parts of this agreement--to arms inspection people, to \neconomists, to foreign policy experts. I hope and expect this will \nhappen in hearings before the Foreign Relations Committee and other \ncommittees of this Senate, but it is also incumbent upon us as \nindividuals to reach out and to try to gain as much knowledge and \nexpertise in the facts of this agreement as we possibly can.\n  Then I think we need to debate--to really debate with the Senators \nhere in the Chamber, face to face. Our legal system is based upon the \nprinciple of an adversarial system where truth emerges from the fire of \nargument. And I believe that is something we owe the American people, \nnot the strange debate we have where one person comes and speaks to an \nempty Chamber and then another person comes and speaks to an empty \nChamber. I think this is an occasion where Senators should confront one \nanother with their best arguments, their best facts, and listen to one \nanother and make their decisions based upon what they learn and what \nthey hear.\n  Of course, the context of the decision is important. We must consider \nthe alternatives. What happens if we don't accept this agreement? What \nhappens if we do? No agreement like this can be judged solely in \nisolation; it has to be viewed in terms of what are the alternatives. \nWhat if nothing happens? What does Iran do then? What are the \nrelationships in the Middle East? What is Iran's path to a bomb if this \nagreement is not approved?\n  Mr. President, I did not plan to come to the floor today, but I am \nhere because I have been shocked and, frankly, surprised at the \noutpouring of reaction from people who haven't read the agreement, who \nhaven't studied the implications, who haven't gained the facts. To \ndenounce an agreement or a deal before the ink is even dry strikes me \nas an abdication of our responsibility.\n  My message today is, let's slow down and take a deep breath. Let's \nlisten to one another. Let's gain the facts.\n  I have not yet made my decision. And I commend that position to my \ncolleagues. This is too important to become just another political \nissue. Even though we are headed into a Presidential year, even though \nthere are partisan differences, even though there are differences with \nthis President, this is a historic vote and it is a solemn \nresponsibility. We owe our constituents, we owe the people of our \nStates and America a close reading of the facts, a balanced weighing of \nthe alternatives, and our best judgment. That is what the people of \nMaine expect of this Senator, and I believe that is what the people of \nAmerica expect of us.\n  The Senate has an extraordinary opportunity to regain its place in \nthis country as the world's greatest deliberative body, and that means \nwe have to deliberate and listen and learn the facts, and that is how \nwe should approach this momentous decision.\n  History will judge us. History will judge us not only on our ultimate \ndecision but how we reached it, how we wrestled with the facts and the \nalternatives and the consequences, and how we made this decision that \nwill have long-term implications for this country, for the Middle East, \nfor our allies, and for the world.\n  Mr. President, I have confidence in this institution. I have \nconfidence that we can make this decision in a thoughtful, \ndeliberative, and consciously deliberate way to reach a conclusion that \nis in the best interests of the people of America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that, \nnotwithstanding rule XXII, there be 10 minutes of debate equally \ndivided before the vote to invoke cloture on the Alexander-Murray \nsubstitute amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, for the information of Senators, we \nhave an agreement on the amendments to our legislation to fix No Child \nLeft Behind.\n  The agreement represents all of the amendments that we will be \ndealing with. The exact time of the final passage will be determined by \nthe Republican and Democratic leaders.\n  This is how we will proceed. First, we will propose and hopefully \nadopt by consent a managers' package of 21 amendments. Second, we will \nlock in an agreement by consent to vote on 24 more amendments. That \nvoting will begin this afternoon, perhaps, at 2:30 p.m. or 3 p.m. There \nare slightly more Democratic amendments than Republican amendments in \nthat group of 45 amendments.\n  Following the reading of that, Senator Murray and I will each have 3 \nor 4 minutes of remarks that we would like to make, and then we will \nhave a cloture vote, and that will be all we will do before lunch.\n  Following lunch, as I said, at about 2:30 p.m. or 3 p.m., we will \nmove to vote.\n  I am now going to move to the managers' package, a list of 21 \namendments that have been cleared by both the Republican and Democratic \nsides.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 2111; 2141; 2145; 2149; 2150; 2151, as Modified; 2154; \n2155; 2157; 2234; 2170; 2178; 2181; 2185; 2195; 2216; 2199; 2201; 2225; \n                  2224; and 2227 to Amendment No. 2089\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \namendments be called up and agreed to en bloc: McCain-Reid No. 2111; \nBennet-Ayotte No. 2141; Ayotte No. 2145; Udall No. 2149; Feinstein-\nCornyn-Gardner No. 2150; Carper-Ayotte No. 2151, as modified with the \nchanges at the desk; King-Capito No. 2154; Thune No. 2155; Flake No. \n2157; Lee No. 2234; Booker No. 2170; Coons-Reed-Blunt No. 2178; McCain \nNo. 2181; Whitehouse No. 2185; Blunt-Cardin-Mikulski-Collins No. 2195; \nGillibrand No. 2216; Graham No. 2199; Alexander No. 2201; Bennet No. \n2225; Booker No. 2224; and Cornyn No. 2227.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

POSTHUMOUS PARDON.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) John Arthur ``Jack'' Johnson was a flamboyant, defiant, \n     and controversial figure in the history of the United States \n     who challenged racial biases.\n       (2) Jack Johnson was born in Galveston, Texas, in 1878 to \n     parents who were former slaves.\n       (3) Jack Johnson became a professional boxer and traveled \n     throughout the United States, fighting White and African-\n     American heavyweights.\n       (4) After being denied (on purely racial grounds) the \n     opportunity to fight 2 White champions, in 1908, Jack Johnson \n     was granted an opportunity by an Australian promoter to fight \n     the reigning White title-holder, Tommy Burns.\n       (5) Jack Johnson defeated Tommy Burns to become the first \n     African-American to hold the title of Heavyweight Champion of \n     the World.\n       (6) The victory by Jack Johnson over Tommy Burns prompted a \n     search for a White boxer who could beat Jack Johnson, a \n     recruitment effort that was dubbed the search for the ``great \n     white hope''.\n       (7) In 1910, a White former champion named Jim Jeffries \n     left retirement to fight Jack Johnson in Reno, Nevada.\n       (8) Jim Jeffries lost to Jack Johnson in what was deemed \n     the ``Battle of the Century''.\n       (9) The defeat of Jim Jeffries by Jack Johnson led to \n     rioting, aggression against African-Americans, and the \n     racially-motivated murder of African-Americans throughout the \n     United States.\n       (10) The relationships of Jack Johnson with White women \n     compounded the resentment felt toward him by many Whites.\n       (11) Between 1901 and 1910, 754 African-Americans were \n     lynched, some simply for being ``too familiar'' with White \n     women.\n       (12) In 1910, Congress passed the Act of June 25, 1910 \n     (commonly known as the ``White Slave Traffic Act'' or the \n     ``Mann Act'') (18 U.S.C. 2421 et seq.), which outlawed the \n     transportation of women in interstate or foreign commerce \n     ``for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any \n     other immoral purpose''.\n       (13) In October 1912, Jack Johnson became involved with a \n     White woman whose mother disapproved of their relationship \n     and sought action from the Department of Justice, claiming \n     that Jack Johnson had abducted her daughter.\n       (14) Jack Johnson was arrested by Federal marshals on \n     October 18, 1912, for transporting the woman across State \n     lines for an ``immoral purpose'' in violation of the Mann \n     Act.\n       (15) The Mann Act charges against Jack Johnson were dropped \n     when the woman refused to cooperate with Federal authorities, \n     and then married Jack Johnson.\n       (16) Federal authorities persisted and summoned a White \n     woman named Belle Schreiber, who testified that Jack Johnson \n     had transported her across States lines for the purpose of \n     ``prostitution and debauchery''.\n       (17) In 1913, Jack Johnson was convicted of violating the \n     Mann Act and sentenced to 1 year and 1 day in Federal prison.\n       (18) Jack Johnson fled the United States to Canada and \n     various European and South American countries.\n       (19) Jack Johnson lost the Heavyweight Championship title \n     to Jess Willard in Cuba in 1915.\n       (20) Jack Johnson returned to the United States in July \n     1920, surrendered to authorities, and served nearly a year in \n     the Federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas.\n       (21) Jack Johnson subsequently fought in boxing matches, \n     but never regained the Heavyweight Championship title.\n       (22) Jack Johnson served the United States during World War \n     II by encouraging citizens to buy war bonds and participating \n     in exhibition boxing matches to promote the war bond cause.\n       (23) Jack Johnson died in an automobile accident in 1946.\n       (24) In 1954, Jack Johnson was inducted into the Boxing \n     Hall of Fame.\n       (25) Senate Concurrent Resolution 29, 111th Congress, \n     agreed to July 29, 2009, expressed the sense of the 111th \n     Congress that Jack Johnson should receive a posthumous pardon \n     for his racially-motivated 1913 conviction.\n       (b) Recommendations.--It remains the sense of Congress that \n     Jack Johnson should receive a posthumous pardon--\n       (1) to expunge a racially-motivated abuse of the \n     prosecutorial authority of the Federal Government from the \n     annals of criminal justice in the United States; and\n       (2) in recognition of the athletic and cultural \n     contributions of Jack Johnson to society.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2141\n\n    (Purpose: To provide for shared services strategies and models)\n\n       On page 622, line 18, insert ``such as through entities \n     administering shared services,'' after ``strategies,''.\n       On page 624, line 9, insert ``which may include the use of \n     shared services models'' after ``time in program''.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2145\n\n (Purpose: To allow States to use State activity funds provided under \n  part A of title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n   1965 for certain evidence-based mental health awareness programs)\n\n       On page 430, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n       ``(ix) designing and implementing evidence-based mental \n     health awareness training programs for the purposes of--\n\n       ``(I) recognizing the signs and symptoms of mental illness;\n       ``(II) providing education to school personnel regarding \n     resources available in the community for students with mental \n     illnesses and other relevant resources relating to mental \n     health;

Is there objection.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, in just a few minutes, after brief \ncomments by Senator Murray and me, we will proceed to a cloture vote \nand then our next votes will be at 2:30.\n  I think, from the reading of the amendments, that the Senators can \nsee that we have had a fair and open amendment process. Just to give \nyou an example, in our committee consideration to fix No Child Left \nBehind, we adopted 29 amendments, and the committee was pleased enough \nwith the process that they reported the bill unanimously.\n  The substitute amendment, one of the amendments I just listed, adopts \nthe priorities of 52 Members into that substitute amendment.\n  On the Senate floor already since last week, we have adopted 27 \namendments, and I just read the two consent requests. The manager's \npackage has 21 amendments in it, and those have been adopted. Then \nthere are the 21 more votes that we just secured approval to vote on \neither by voice or in fact.\n  So the vote we are about to have is a vote on whether to end debate \non our bill to fix No Child Left Behind. I think the question before \nthe Senators is this: Do you think there has been a fair process? Do \nyou think it is open enough? Do you think the bill is worthy of having \nthese votes and going toward final passage? I hope every single Senator \nwill agree that yes, it has been.\n  This is the way the Senate is supposed to work. Basically, we are \nconcluding the bill by a unanimous consent agreement, which is to say \nthat virtually every Senator who wants an amendment has had that \namendment considered, and we are going to dispose of it one way or \nanother. We are going to adopt it or vote on it, whatever the Senate \nlikes.\n  That is important for the country to see. This a bill that Newsweek \nmagazine said is the education bill everyone wants fixed.\n  There is a remarkable consensus that we need to do it. After 7 years, \nthis bill is overdue and a ``yes'' vote today on cloture says: We \nrecognize that Governors, teachers, school board members, and school \nsuperintendents have united in a remarkable coalition to support the \nway we propose to fix it. So we have a consensus that it needs to be \nfixed, and we have a consensus on how to fix it. This is a vote about \nwhether we are ready to do that--to do our job.\n  I thank Senator Murray principally for her leadership in this \nrespect, making it possible to create this environment in which we have \nbeen able to have such a good process.\n\n[[Page S5098]]\n\n  I thank the majority leader for putting the bill on the floor and \ngiving us a week of time--more than a week--to deal with it.\n  I thank the majority whip for his efforts, especially in helping to \nbring this to a conclusion.\n  I thank the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, as well as Senators \nSchumer, Durbin and Patty Murray, who is also part of that leadership, \nfor creating the kind of working environment to give Senators on both \nsides of the aisle a chance to go home and say: We fixed No Child Left \nBehind. I had my say in it, and we are going to restore responsibility. \nWe are going to keep the important measurements of student achievement, \nbut restore to the classroom teachers, the Governors, the legislatures, \nthe school boards, and to the parents the responsibility for student \nachievement.\n  I thank the Chair, and I urge my colleagues to vote yes on cloture so \nwe can move toward these remaining 21 amendments on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise again to encourage all of our \ncolleagues to support this vote to move us to a negotiated conclusion \nto this very important bill.\n  I thank the senior Senator from Tennessee, as well as the majority \nleader, for working with us to get this agreement so we can continue \nmoving forward in a bipartisan way to get this done.\n  Across the country, students, parents, teachers, and communities are \nreally counting on us to fix No Child Left Behind. I have been very \npleased to work with Chairman Alexander on this bipartisan bill called \nthe Every Child Achieves Act.\n  This bill will give our States more flexibility, but it will also \ninclude some Federal guardrails to make sure all of our students do \nhave access to quality education. It passed through our committee \nunanimously and, for the past week or so, we have made good progress on \nthe Senate floor.\n  There is still some work to be done. There are a number of amendments \nthat we will be voting on this afternoon and into tomorrow. The senior \nSenator from Pennsylvania is offering a very important amendment I \nsupport to expand high-quality early childhood education.\n  We have an amendment that we will be voting on to strengthen the \nFederal guardrails. It is the accountability amendment from Senators \nMurphy, Booker, Warren, and Coons to help make sure all of our kids, \nespecially our most vulnerable students, have what they need.\n  There are many more amendments, as you know, from Democrats and \nRepublicans, to finish this bill, but I urge our colleagues to vote yes \non cloture. We are finishing this bill and working to make sure that we \ncan fix a broken law.\n  I will have more to say about the amendments as we go through the \nprocess. But at this moment, I urge all of our colleagues to support \nthis vote, continue this bipartisan process, and let's work to get this \nbill done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Alexander \n     amendment No. 2089 to S. 1177, an original bill to \n     reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965 to ensure that every child achieves.\n         Mitch McConnell, Orrin G.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5105]]\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, needless to say, yesterday's announcement \nabout our ongoing stature and status with Iran is, in my view, a \ndangerous step forward in advancing not only the illicit nuclear \nprogram that they have had up until now but the clear nuclear weapons \ncapability they would have under this agreement.\n  I think the agreement confirms that the President was too willing to \nget a deal with Iran at any price. The concessions made by the \nadministration, based on the starting point of these discussions, I \nbelieve to be stunning. All we have to do is go back and review a \nlittle bit of recent history to see that today Iran's advancement of \ninstability, terrorism, and violence in the world continues unabated \nand not hampered by the agreement that has just been announced. \nTomorrow, we will see all of those things still continue unabated, and \nunfortunately they are much better positioned and much better funded \nthan they are right now.\n  Supported by Iran, Assad in Syria has been massacring his own people, \nresulting in the deaths of at least 191,000 people in Syria. That is \naccording to the U.N., and those numbers were reported a year ago. \nAssad, by the way, stepped forward immediately to praise this \nagreement.\n  Supported by Iran, Shiite militias are continuing to support Assad \nand promote division and violence throughout the country of Iraq. \nSupported by Iran, Houthi rebels have seized key territory in Yemen and \ncontinue to work to destabilize that country. Supported by Iran, \nHezbollah in Lebanon wages terrorism and calls for the annihilation. \nSupported by Iran, Palestinian terrorist groups in Gaza continue to lob \nmortars and rockets into Israel.\n  Last April, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy stopped a \nMarshall Islands-flagged ship as it tried to go into the Strait of \nHormuz. This is at a time when Iran is trying to get major countries in \nthe world to negotiate with them.\n  Iran continues to hold hostages without any reasonable way of \ndefining hostages and without any reasonable charge. They currently \nhave three Americans held as hostages: Pastor Saeed Abedini, former \nU.S. Marine Amir Hekmati, and Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian. \nThey also remain totally uncooperative in helping to locate former FBI \nofficial Robert Levinson. When the Secretary of State was asked about \nwhy these people weren't part of the negotiations, he said: Well, this \nwas a negotiation about nuclear weapons but not about people unlawfully \nand wrongly detained.\n  Well, it quickly became a negotiation about not just nuclear weapons \nbut all kinds of other weapons that we have prevented the Iranians from \nhaving access to in a worldwide marketplace. That was quickly added to \nthe topic, but we couldn't get three Americans released and find out \nmore about one American than we know now.\n  The concessions laid out by yesterday's announcement were also, I \nthought, pretty stunning. Concerning uranium enrichment, the Obama \nadministration said a year and a half ago Iran didn't have the right to \nenrich.\n  In November of 2013, the Secretary of State told ABC News:\n\n       We do not recognize the right to enrich. It is clear . . . \n     in the nonproliferation treaty, it's very, very [clear] that \n     there is no right to enrich.\n\n  Under the agreement, Iran is allowed to continue to enrich.\n  As far as inspections, the President said we would have to be able to \nverify Iran's compliance or Iran's cheating through anywhere, anytime \ninspections. It is widely understood that any good deal must allow \ninspections--trust but verify. The President may say that is in there, \nbut it is clearly not in there.\n  In fact, last April the President's Deputy National Security Advisor \nproudly proclaimed that ``under this deal'' we ``will have anywhere, \nanytime 24/7 access'' to Iran's nuclear facilities. As it turns out \nunder this deal, inspectors will be forced to wait up to 24 days for \naccess to suspicious sites once they ask for access to suspicious \nsites. That is a brand-new definition of ``anywhere, anytime.'' You can \npossibly have access in 24 days, and obviously lots of things can and \nwould change in 24 days.\n  Militarily, the President said we would disclose and define the \npossible military dimensions of the research and where Iran's illegal \nnuclear program was headed. The President said this information is \ncritical to knowing what Iran's true breakout potential and their true \nintentions would be. Under this agreement, however, the option of \nexamining the possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program is \noff the table.\n  As far as sanctions, the administration said that removing all \nsanctions was a nonstarter until Iran demonstrated that it is complying \nwith the agreement. A little over a year ago, in March of 2014, \nSecretary Kerry said: ``Iran is not open for business until Iran is \nclosed for nuclear bombs.'' However, we know now that Iran will, in \nfact, be open for business much sooner than that. This deal will not \nonly allow them to be open for business, but they will be rewarded with \nhundreds of millions of dollars' worth of sanctions relief and return \nof assets that didn't have to be returned. And under this agreement all \nsanctions, even those related to arms, missiles, and proliferation, \nwill be removed--not suspended. These will be removed. We have some of \nthe most aggressive arms suppliers in the world, and Iran is now being \ngiven access to all kinds of arms that they couldn't get legally or \neasily up until now.\n  All economic and banking sections, as well as those imposed on \ntransport, insurance, petrochemical industries, and valuable materials \nwill be removed.\n  As far as dismantling, the President said Iran would have to \ndismantle its illegal nuclear program. In December of 2013, the chief \nnegotiator, Wendy Sherman, told PBS that a final agreement should \ninclude ``a lot of dismantling of their infrastructure.'' Yet under \nthis deal we are seeing that Iran's program will, in fact, almost all \nbe preserved, not dismantled.\n  The length of the agreement--the P5+1 initially stipulated that Iran \nmust accept restrictions on its nuclear program for 20 years plus \nanother 25 years, and then later they said 20 years plus another 10 \nyears, and finally their last offer was just 20 years, which in the end \nwas reduced to 10 years. I think over the next 60 days, as people read \nthe fine print of the agreement, they might find out that it is even \nless than 10 years, but they certainly know now it is not 20 years plus \n25 years.\n  This is a bad deal for the United States and one that will embolden \nour enemies, jeopardize the security of our allies, and further lead \nour friends to not believe they can trust us and our enemies not to be \nafraid of us. In a dangerous world, what worse place could we be in \nthan that.\n  The stated goal of the negotiations was to ensure that Iran never \ndeveloped the capability of producing a nuclear weapon. Yet the \nPresident agreed to a deal that does just the opposite. By allowing \nIran to become nuclear weapons capable and failing to provide for \nanytime, anywhere inspections, this deal gives Iran a free pass to \ncheat at its military sites with no access to U.S. inspectors.\n\n  Meanwhile, just last week Iran continued its calls for the \ndestruction of Israel. These are the people we are allowing, through \nthis process, to have access to more weapons and to become nuclear \nweapons capable. Just last week, Iran called, as it has for decades, \nfor the destruction of Israel and ``death to America.'' In fact, Iran's \nSupreme Leader stood by, calling for the need to fight the United \nStates even if there is an agreement. I don't know that we have ever \nbefore entered into an agreement with another country that, while we \nare in the agreement, says: And by the way, no matter if there is an \nagreement or not, we want to continue to see the United States as an \nenemy we need to fight.\n  This deal undermines the security of our friends and allies. It \nlegitimizes Iran's unapologetic sponsorship of terrorism throughout the \nMiddle East.\n  It is interesting what could be included, by the way, and what \ncouldn't be included.\n  Iran has repeatedly refused to abide by international agreements that \nrequire inspection of nuclear facilities, details of facility designs, \nacquisition and production of nuclear materials. What makes us think \nIran is going to change that behavior now? The negotiations themselves \nshould lead us to believe the new Iran is still the old Iran.\n  This is a bad deal. It is a deal that just hopes that in the next 8 \nor 10 years\n\n[[Page S5106]]\n\nthe Iranian Government totally changes, the Iranian attitude totally \nchanges, our relationship with them totally changes, and it just hopes \nthat in the interim--during the time we have that hoped-for change--the \nIranians don't cheat. This is a hope, not a strategy, and it is a hope, \nnot a strategy, wherein we would let the world become much more \ndestabilized as a result.\n  After months of negotiations, Iran hasn't released a single American \nprisoner, nor have they announced any intentions to do so.\n  The Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese, the Syrians--or at least the \nSyrians who are still controlled by Assad--may like this deal, but this \nis a bad deal for the United States of America, it is a bad deal for \nworld stability, and it is a bad deal for our friends.\n  Frankly, I think the law that Congress passed that now gives the \nCongress of the United States 60 days to look at it will turn out to be \n60 days that the President himself is about to find out what is in the \ndeal he and the administration signed.\n  This is a serious matter for every Member of the Senate.\n  I was asked earlier today: Are you going to lobby Members of the \nSenate as to how they should vote on this agreement when it comes up?\n  I said: I am going to do everything I can to talk about the real \nshortcomings of this agreement, the destabilizing effects of this \nagreement, but every Member of the Senate is going to have to answer \nfor this agreement and this vote for a long time.\n  Members of the Senate on their own are going to have to decide what \nside of this to wind up on. I predict that a majority--and maybe a \nsubstantial majority--of the Senate will wind up understanding that \nthis is a bad deal for America and a bad deal for the future of the \nworld's security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2241\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, as we wait for colleagues to arrive to the \nfloor, I thought I would take a few minutes to speak a little bit about \naccountability in this bill.\n  As we know, the No Child Left Behind legislation and now this new \nversion of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act require annual \ntests. They are not popular.\n  I believe we are overtesting kids in this country. It is not the \nFederal requirement that is causing that; it is the relationship of the \nFederal requirement to State and local tests that are administered, so \nthat by the time we get to the classroom inhabited by one of my three \ndaughters who go to Denver's public schools, for example, kids end up \nspending too much time being tested. Part of that is because we haven't \ndone a good job, I don't think, of distinguishing between tests that \nare used for accountability purposes--how is the school doing growing \nkids--and tests that are used for teaching and learning purposes, which \nare assessments that have to happen all the time during the school \nyear. When I was in school, we called those quizzes, and we dreaded \nthem, just as people dread them today. That was the way teachers were \nable to keep an eye on how students were doing in their classroom \nthroughout the year so they could course correct, so they could make \nchanges based on the individual needs of the kids in their classroom.\n  Teaching and learning and accountability aren't the same things, and \nI think we put too much freight on some of these assessments. I hope \nwhat we are going to see as we come out of this new reauthorization is \nan understanding about the importance of the accountability--why we \nhave it--and better implementation of tests at the State and local \nlevel.\n  There is no reason for the Federal Government to be involved in \neducation, really--only 9 percent of what we spend is Federal money, \nand the rest of it is State and local money--except for one reason. The \ncivil rights imperative in this bill and that is at the heart of this \nbill has said to us that we just can't look the other way when it comes \nto kids of color and kids living in poverty in this country, which we \ndid for decades--for decades--without knowing where we were headed.\n  The one great benefit of No Child Left Behind is that it required \nthat data about kids living in poverty, kids of color, kids with \nspecial needs, and English language learners as well be published so we \ncould see the huge gaps that exist all across this country in \neducational attainment. We can't go backward on that. I agree that \nallowing States to have more flexibility in the design of these systems \nis important. It is an important step forward in this bill.\n  As I mentioned yesterday, when I was the superintendent of the Denver \nPublic Schools--the best job I ever had; I had that honor--I used to \nwonder all the time why people in Washington were so mean to our \nteachers and to our kids. I got here and I realized they weren't mean, \nthey just have absolutely no idea what is going on in our schools and \nour classrooms. Where the Presiding Officer is right now, right here, \nin this place--and I mean this literally--is as far away as one can get \nfrom a school or a classroom in this country and still be in this \nuniverse. We are very distant. We may think we know what is going on \nthere, but we don't know. This institution doesn't know.\n  While I, as that superintendent, have developed a very strong view \nthat I didn't want to be told how we should do things by Washington, \nand I didn't want Washington telling my teachers how to do things, our \nprincipals how to do things, kids and families how to do things, I \nthink it is important and imperative that we have a national \nexpectation for what kids ought to be able to do at certain grade \nlevels and that we have a national imperative around the achievement \ngap in this country.\n  We also have a national imperative--people may not like to know \nthis--to figure out how we are going to replace the 1.5 million \nteachers we are going to require in this country over the next several \nyears.\n  Those are all issues of national concern, but our federalist system \ntells us there are certain responsibilities assumed by the States and \ncertain responsibilities assumed by the Federal Government, and we have \ngotten that twisted up when it comes to education. So I think that is \nan important step forward, that we are not going to be telling people \nhow to do it, but we need to remind people that they need to do it.\n  It is not OK that we live in a country where if you are unlucky \nenough to be born poor, your chances of getting a college degree or its \nequivalent are roughly 9 in 100. That is not OK. That is a matter of \nnational concern. That is why the accountability provisions in this \nbill are so important. To be honest, that is why the annual testing is \nso important, if it is done wisely and well and if the data is used in \na thoughtful way to measure student growth.\n  No Child Left Behind not only was a huge overreach by the Federal \nGovernment, it also asked and answered the profoundly wrong question. \nIt asked: How did this year's group of fourth graders do compared to \nlast year's fourth graders? That is how we evaluated schools, on that \nbasis. That is crazy. They are not the same kids. The question we \nshould be asking and the question we are asking now in many States and \nin many communities across the country is this: How did this group of \nsixth graders do compared to how they did as fifth graders compared to \nhow they did as fourth graders and then compared to all the kids in the \nState--this is the way we do it in Colorado--who had a statistically \nsimilar test history. That reveals a lot of information.\n  For No Child Left Behind, we used to have a matrix in Denver, and it \nwas four squares, and in the upper right-hand corner was--well, there \nare two measures; one is growth and one is status. How much did you \ngrow this year? It would be like saying, how much weight did you gain \nor lose this year, versus status, which is, how much did you weigh? \nWhat is your achievement level? Those are two different ideas.\n  In those four boxes I mentioned earlier, in the upper right we had \nhigh growth, high status schools, and in this corner we had high status \nbut low growth schools. Those are schools we\n\n[[Page S5107]]\n\ncalled excellent schools under No Child Left Behind. Those were blue \nribbon schools even though kids were losing ground in those schools. \nThey arguably shouldn't have been because those schools didn't have the \nstruggles schools have with kids living in poverty. Those were blue \nribbon schools. Those are schools where we were telling moms and dads \nand kids that everything is fine, even though kids were losing ground \nwhen they showed up at the schoolhouse door.\n  The reverse was also true. The reverse was also true because we were \nsaying to schools that were below the threshold of high status--low \nstatus schools--that they were failing schools even though they might \nhave been schools where what we were seeing was 2 years of growth for \nkids who had started out way behind because they had come to \nkindergarten with that stubborn word gap, that 30 million word gap that \nkids have who are living in poverty and are showing up in kindergarten. \nBy the way, we are not doing anything, almost, as a country to deal \nwith that problem.\n  As I mentioned yesterday, we are having a debate in Washington about \nincome redistribution sometimes. We have a discussion about what the \nTax Code should be, and there are people here who believe that it \nshouldn't do anything. That is a principled position, but if that is a \nperson's position, they better be working day and night to make sure \nevery single kid in America has access to high-quality early childhood \neducation. We better make sure every kid in America has access and a \nchoice to go to a high-performing K-12 school. And we better make sure \nwe are doing everything we can to make it easier, not harder, to go to \ncollege to get a higher education degree because this unforgiving \ninternational economy is not going to change its mind about whether a \nhigh school degree is enough or dropping out of high school is enough.\n  We need to be focused on education in this country. It is the single \nmost important public good we provide domestically. If a person asks me \nas a parent what I would take a risk on for my kids, the No. 1 thing I \nwouldn't take a risk on is their education. That is how we ought to be \nfeeling about all of the kids in the United States of America. We \nshould stop treating America's children as though they are someone \nelse's kids. They are not someone else's kids; they are our kids. And \nif we extrapolate the academic outcomes that we are seeing in this \ncountry, the college graduation rates we are seeing, the high school \ngraduation rates--if we extrapolate those against the changing \ndemographics in the United States, we are not going to recognize \nourselves in the 21st century.\n  When we constrain a child, a human being, an American citizen to the \nmargin of this economy or the margin of the democracy simply because \nthey are born into poverty and we can't do the work to provide a high-\nquality education, that is all the evidence we need that we are \ntreating people as though they are someone else's kids. That is why, by \nthe way, there is more we need to do on accountability.\n  I feel as though we have made good progress with a lot of this bill, \nand I am extremely grateful for the leadership of Chairman Alexander \nfrom Tennessee and the ranking member of the committee, Senator Patty \nMurray, and I am pleased to see that the bill passed out of committee \nunanimously. Remember, ESEA is fundamentally a civil rights law. We \nshould measure growth. We should identify the bottom 5 percent of \nschools in this country. We need to ensure that subgroups and high-\nperforming schools are not left behind. And that is the power of the \ndata that is collected, and that is the power of what is called the \ndisaggregation of that data so that we can see outcomes.\n  I see my colleague from New Jersey is here. Through the Chair, I \nwould ask if he wishes to speak, and if so, I will stop. I was filling \ntime. I do want to talk about the comparability loophole, but I will \ncome back to that and yield to my colleague from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I am grateful to Senator Bennet. Senator \nBennet and I met around education issues. Senator Bennet led the \nlargest public school system in the State of Colorado. Senator Bennet \nhas been in the weeds of education for years, if not decades.\n  I am grateful that Senator Bennet began his remarks by saying all of \nthe things that have been wrong with No Child Left Behind. That was a \nbad piece of legislation. We saw the aspects of it that were causing \nproblems and that have created a bipartisan push to fix them.\n  I want to give credit to Senator Lamar Alexander and Senator Patty \nMurray for joining together and doing the things necessary to improve \nthe bill. The culture of education has shifted in this country, from \nhigh-stakes testing to looking at measures that made no sense to \ncreating artificial deadlines that could not be met or even doing \nthings that undermined the very goals and aspirations that we have for \nour country, which is to lead the globe in educational excellence.\n  So, I am encouraged by Senator Bennet and myself and the majority of \nthis body who agree that this legislation needs to be changed. It is a \nleft-right coalition that is encouraging to me.\n  But I want to echo Senator Bennet's concerns about a problem that is \nnot being addressed--that as the pendulum swings away from the problems \nof No Child Left Behind, we not create new ones that cut against the \nvery ideals with which this legislation was put in place by Lyndon \nJohnson. Lyndon Johnson said clearly that this was a bill to bridge the \ngap in this country between help and the helpless, for those children \nwho are suffering on the educational margins of our society, drowning \nin the eddies of educational lack of opportunity, caught in the \nquicksand of poverty and race, and with challenges that undermine and \ncontribute to the dysfunction and inequality in our Nation. This was to \nbe the bridge. It is why this body acted under President Johnson.\n  So now, Senator Bennet, I have a distressed heart, because what this \namendment we are trying to put forward does is to allow us to get to a \npoint where we are now not even putting a spotlight on where we are \nfailing to live up to our values. This amendment calls for us to at \nleast acknowledge that there are children in our country who are stuck \nin so-called dropout factories, children who are perpetually \nunderachieving, and schools that are failing the genius of our \nchildren. What this amendment was seeking to do was to say that we \ncannot ignore our children, we cannot turn our backs on these children, \nwe cannot turn over and say it doesn't exist, because we do have a \nproblem in our Nation. What anguishes me about this problem is that the \nchildren we are turning our backs on and not focusing on are children \nthat are poor and children that are disproportionately minority.\n  To paraphrase Martin Luther King, he said that what we will have to \nrepent for in this day and age is not the vitriolic words and actions \nof the bad people but the appalling silence and inaction of the good \npeople.\n  I hear time and again that we love our children in America. Well, if \nwe love them, we should do something about the challenges that are \nafflicting a small percentage of our kids who do not get the \neducational environment they deserve. This is a peculiar form of \nAmerican insanity--insanity being defined as doing the same thing over \nand over again and expecting different results. We are not going to \nchange this problem of perpetual failure in too many of our schools \nthat affect poor and minorities by not having some attention to that \nproblem.\n  Let's be clear. We have learned lessons. This amendment No. 2241, the \nESEA accountability amendment, does not do the things that this body in \nits majority thinks should no longer be done by the Federal Government.\n  Let me be clear. This amendment does not reinstate any type of \nadequate yearly progress, or AYP. In fact, the underlying bill is \nrepealed. AYP is repealed. It does not establish artificial deadlines \nsuch as No Child Left Behind did, saying that all children will be \nproficient by 2014. It does not establish Federal goals for our \nstudents. States will have the prerogative to set their own. It does \nnot impose test-based accountability on States. States must include a \nrange of factors in their State-designed accountability systems. It\n\n[[Page S5108]]\n\ndoes not require schools to implement a one-size-fits-all intervention. \nLocal districts will design the intervention for underperforming \nschools.\n  This legislation is not prescriptive. This legislation is not \nWashington telling local districts what to do. This amendment does not \ndesign programs. It simply says that there must be a commitment made \nwhen there are these dropout factories and when there are these \npopulations that are not being served to ensure that States identify \ncertain low-performing schools so that students in these schools \nreceive the support they need.\n  It would require locally designed, evidence-based interventions to \nschools identified in the following categories: the lowest performing 5 \npercent of our schools; high schools where less than two-thirds of \nstudents graduate; and schools where subgroups, including low-income \nstudents, students of color, students with disabilities, and English \nlearners miss State-established goals on multiple measures for 2 \nconsecutive years. This amendment says that we cannot ignore those \nchildren whom we are failing to serve, and that we can't turn our back \non these kids.\n  We salute this flag and say ``liberty and justice for all.'' Well, \nevery issue that I hear discussed in this august body cannot be dealt \nwith unless we deal with all children. The achievement gap in America \nwill not be addressed unless we focus on all children. The poverty gap \nin America will not be addressed unless we focus on all children. The \nopportunity gap in America will not be addressed unless we deal with \nall children. Issues that I am passionate about such as mass \nincarceration will not be addressed unless we focus on all children. \nAnd the competitive economy--the productivity of our Nation--will not \nreach its full strength unless we focus on all children.\n  So I am distressed today that this body will put into place a piece \nof educational legislation that ignores the very children to whom this \noriginal legislation was dedicated to serving years ago. We cannot be a \ngreat nation if we have parts of our country--be they neighborhoods or \nschools--that fail to experience what should be the bedrock of our \ncountry: equal opportunity, a great education, and the opportunity to \nsucceed through one's grit, sweat, and hard work. We don't have that \nnow.\n  If we in this body create legislation that pours millions of dollars \ninto the States and then say that if States choose to ignore these \nkids, if States choose to turn their backs on the children who need \nthem most, if States don't even want to put forward an idea of how to \naddress this persistent problem, and we are OK, then to me we belie the \noath we took, the pledge we gave to bring justice to all children.\n  We speak of accountability in this country. Well, we should be \naccountable to the government dollars that we spend for America. We \nshould be accountable for the ideals of this Nation.\n  So I hope I can get my colleagues to support this bill that Senator \nMurphy and Senator Bennet are leading so well. I hope we can stand up \nin a chorus of conviction in this body, saying that every single \nchild--no matter what station in life, no matter how poor your parents \nare, no matter what your background, color, creed or religion--can have \nhope and opportunity in our public schools.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I thank Senator Booker.\n  I see the Senator from Pennsylvania is here. The Senator from \nConnecticut is here, and I want to thank him for his leadership and how \nhe has stuck with it week after week after week.\n  I want to say to my friend from New Jersey, through the Chair, how \nmuch I appreciate his words and his aspirations for our country, \nbecause we are falling down on the job.\n  We have issue after issue after issue that comes here to the Senate \nfloor--sometimes resolved, sometimes not. Education almost never is in \nfront of us.\n  I sometimes hear people say this, and it rattles me when I hear them \nsay it. Sometimes people say: Michael, don't you know that not \neverybody is going to go to college? Don't you know that not everybody \nis going to go to college?\n  That is OK with me as long as it is their decision that they are \nmaking and that they are an educated 12th grader but they are deciding \nnot going to go to college. That is the decision they are making.\n  But the reality is that it is not that we are sort of, kind of \ngetting it right when it comes to kids in this country. Let's do the \nmath. If you are born poor in the United States, because of the way our \nK-12 system works in access to higher education, you stand a 9-in-100 \nchance of getting a college degree--not an 80 percent chance, not a 75 \npercent chance, but 9 in 100.\n  If we were poor kids in this place instead of Senators, it would be \nthose desks in the front row, the desks in the row behind them, and \nthree desks in the next row. The entire rest of this Senate would be a \nsea of people without a college degree. That is the condition for poor \nkids living in the United States of America. That is the circumstance \nthey face. We have to start believing there are kids--they are not \nsomeone else's kids. We learned for the first time a month ago--this is \nnot a measure of poverty in the same sense that I was just using the \nword, but for the first time in this country's history, over half our \npublic school children are poor enough that they qualify for free and \nreduced lunch.\n\n  We did not change the standard for free and reduced lunch. That is \nthe effect of 20 years of an economy that is not driving middle-class \nwages up and the worst recession since the Great Depression. So at \nevery level from the schoolhouse door to the floor of the Senate, this \nought to be our No. 1 priority. Because as the Senator from New Jersey \nsaid, all the other stuff that we want to fix--he mentioned what we \nneed to do with sentencing reform.\n  Eighty-five percent of the people in our prisons are high school \ndropouts. That tells you something about what you might do to cure that \nproblem. This ought to be our No. 1 issue. It ought to be our No. 1 \nhere, and it ought to be our No. 1 issue at home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Before our leader on this amendment speaks, Senator \nMurphy, I do want to echo what Senator Bennet said. He has been leading \nthis charge in a bipartisan manner, pulling people together trying to \nget this across. I just want to echo that last point that Senator \nBennet made. We as a nation have this ideal that America is the best \ncountry if you are poor to be born into; that you can make it here. \nThis is the country--Statue of Liberty, give us your tired, your \nhungry, the wretched refuse of your teeming shores. This is the country \nyou can make it in.\n  Well, unfortunately, in social mobility, which is a measurable \nindex--the ability for somebody to make it out of poverty into the \nmiddle class--we have fallen. We have fallen on that list compared to \nour peers from other nations. If you just have the simple goal of \nmaking it out of poverty, America is no longer the No. 1 country to do \nthat.\n  The principle reason for this is that the tried and true pathway to \nthe middle class must be the schoolhouse door. That path must lead \nthrough educational systems. If our children don't have that access or \nif we leave some children behind, we shut those doors to quality \neducation. Then it is an affront to the very ideal of the American \ndream, and we are failing the purpose, the greatness, the glory that is \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2247, as modified\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on an amendment that is \noffered by the senior Senator from North Carolina. It is an amendment \nthat would change the formula for how title I funds are allocated among \nthe States. So first by way of background, title I is the largest \ncategory of Federal financial assistance for K-through-12 education. So \nwe are talking about a large pot of money. This is the biggest single \nsource of Federal funding for primary and secondary education.\n  Under current law, the formula for how that money is allocated to the \nschool districts is based on two things. It is based on the number of \nchildren who live in poverty in these respective districts, but it is \nalso related to the average amount that the various States spend on \neducation. So let me\n\n[[Page S5109]]\n\nbe very clear. It is not a single, uniform amount per student. It was \nnever meant to be. It still is not.\n  There is a reason for that. The reason is it is meant--this \ncorrelation to not only the number of kids in poverty but also the \namount of money States spend on education is designed that way in order \nto reflect the fact that there are different costs of living in \ndifferent States. Nobody would dispute that, I don't think. In some \nStates, the real estate on which you build the school is more \nexpensive. Some States have a higher general wage level, so teachers \nget paid more. States just have different expenses.\n  In addition, there is an incentive element. The incentive is, for \nStates that are willing to commit more resources--that means taxing \ntheir residents more to fund education--then there is that little bit \nmore that comes from the Federal Government. So this is a finite amount \nof money. What this amendment goes to is the question of how does this \nget allocated? The amendment originally offered by the senior Senator \nfrom North Carolina was very troubling to me because it would \nprofoundly change the formula effective immediately. This is a zero-sum \ngame. So some States would win a lot, other States would lose a lot. \nPennsylvania stood to lose a lot of funding under the formulation that \nwas originally constructed for this amendment--the gist of it being to \nconvert the funding to an almost uniform amount per student.\n  I can assure you, I was hearing loudly and clearly from the folks who \nrun especially the large school districts in Pennsylvania about how \nconcerned they were because it was a multimillion-dollar-per-year hit \nthat they were going to take. I spoke with Dr. Hite, who is the \nsuperintendent of Philadelphia schools, and Dr. Lane from Pittsburgh \nschool district, as they would have been hit the hardest in the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n  In total, had the original amendment become law, it would have cost \nPennsylvania over $120 million per year. Every one of Pennsylvania's \n500 school districts, except one, would have lost money. So 499 school \ndistricts would have had to do with less and one would have had a \nlittle more. Many of them would have lost huge amounts of their \nfunding.\n  I first want to say I appreciate the fact that the Senator from North \nCarolina and other Senators worked with my office and other offices \nacross the aisle to take a different approach. So the original \namendment is no longer under consideration. My understanding is the \nunanimous consent agreement which was struck earlier abandons that \napproach, but it does still have an element of that direction that does \nconcern me.\n  I want to touch on that. So here is my understanding: Under the form \nthat the amendment now takes, and which we will be voting on maybe \nlater today, the current levels of funding will continue under the \ncurrent formula. In fact, that funding level, as it naturally tends to \ngrow each year because the Federal Government increases funding in \nthis--for a while, that growth will also occur according to the current \nformulation. But at some point in the not-too-distant future, the total \nspending on title I funding will reach about $17 billion--now it is \nabout 14.5. When it gets to $17 billion, from that point forward, \nprospectively, the increments each year will then be allocated \naccording to the new formula, which is, by the design, the same design \nas the original amendment, which is nearly uniform spending per child, \ndisregarding, in my view, the important consideration of the different \ncosts of living in the various States.\n  So this is a huge improvement, from my point of view, over what we \nwere looking at before. Pennsylvania will not have a dime cut from its \nspending. The formula does not change next year or the year after. I am \nnot sure exactly when we will reach that $17 billion figure. But at \nsome point, if this amendment passes, this reformulated amendment from \nthe senior Senator from North Carolina, if it does pass, then at some \npoint we start to move incremental funding into this sort of uniform \nformulation, rather than the current formulation where we take into \naccount the varying costs of education. So while this is a huge \nimprovement over the original version of this amendment, it is still \nsomething that I think is very problematic and so I will be voting no \non this.\n  I would just summarize by saying that I think the amendment is \nmistaken in two respects: One, it fundamentally fails to recognize the \nvarying costs of living in varying States. That is a very big \ndifference. Secondly, it penalizes those States that are willing to ask \ntheir citizens to invest more in education by eliminating the current \nmechanism. So I would urge my colleagues to vote no on that amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank my great friends Senator Booker \nand Senator Bennet for their passionate and moving remarks about the \ntask ahead of us, to make sure that as we reauthorize No Child Left \nBehind, as we reorder our priorities, that we remember that this law is \nan education reform law, but it has to be a civil rights law as well. \nIt has to make sure that in the best traditions of this country, we are \nrequiring that every single child gets a quality education.\n  I want to talk about my amendment that is cosponsored by Senators \nBooker and Warren, Coons, Durbin, Mikulski, and others. I want to start \nby telling a story that is, unfortunately, not unfamiliar in probably \nevery corner of this country. I am going to talk about a 16-year-old \nAfrican-American boy, an eighth grader in an urban middle school in \nConnecticut. I will call him James for today's purposes.\n  James had a habit of walking out of class in the middle of \ninstruction. He walked out of class and he would wander the hallways \nuntil he would eventually run into a teacher, an administrator, a \nschool resource officer, who would haul him down to the principal's \noffice. His grandmother, who was his primary care giver, would get a \nphone call. She would come pick him up and then the suspension \nproceedings would start.\n  James would get suspended for a few days. He would come back, and the \nwhole cycle would play out again, such that by the middle of his first \nsemester of his eighth grade year, he had been out of school--\nsuspended--more days than he had been in school. One day he was so \nfrustrated when an assistant principal stopped him, once again, as he \nwas wandering the halls that he had an argument. He was a big kid for \nhis age, but he was a total teddy bear. He never hurt anybody. But that \nday when he talked back to that assistant principal, they called the \npolice and James got arrested. Now he has a criminal record. But the \nreason he was walking out of class day after day, week after week, was \npretty simple: James was an eighth grader who could not read--he could \nnot read. He could barely read. So he had this toxic mixture of \nfrustration and embarrassment every day that he sat in class such that \nit had no relevance to him and he walked out.\n  The worst of it is that the school knew he could not read because he \nhad an identified learning disability. It was not a mystery. Yet James \ngot promoted year after year because it was easier to pass him along, \neasier to push him out, as the suspensions and eventual arrest were on \ntheir way to doing, rather than actually give James an education. Now, \nI only know this story because my wife, who was then a legal aid lawyer \nin Connecticut, represented James. His grandmother, who just wanted \nJames to get a decent education, would call my wife in tears every time \nJames was found in the hallway and suspended again and again.\n  My wife actually got the services James needed. But James' story is \nnot unique. Most kids do not have legal aid lawyers fighting on their \nbehalf. Most kids in James' situation have the deck stacked against \nthem: disabled kids who are hard to teach, poor kids who are warehoused \nin failing schools, Black and Hispanic kids struggling to overcome \ngenerations of discrimination.\n  They do not all have lawyers. They have us in the Congress. This \nplace, Washington, DC, has had its finest moments when it stands up for \neducational civil rights: the idea that a child in this country should \nget a quality education no matter their race or their address or their \ndisability. Whether we like it or not, there are these political \npressures in America that cause minority kids and disabled kids and \npoor kids to get an education\n\n[[Page S5110]]\n\nthat is not equal to that of their White or nondisabled or more \naffluent peers.\n  The facts are just very stubborn. I can't say them any better than \nSenator Bennet did earlier today. Today, half of African-American and \nLatino fourth grade students score below the basic level of reading \nthat we expect of our students. Just one out of every seven African-\nAmerican eighth grade students scores at a basic proficiency level in \nmath. Nationally, 70 percent of students who attend high school with \nlow graduation rates come from low-income families. These statistics, \nthey represent a stain on the conscience of our Nation.\n  If this body wants to stay true to its history of standing up for \neducational civil rights, then we have to make a stand this week to \nmake sure this Every Child Achieves Act ensures that minority and poor \nand disabled kids get a fair shot at a good education.\n  Now, right now this bill does not meet this test. That is why the \nNation's leading civil rights organizations, from the NAACP to La Raza, \nto the Urban League oppose this bill in its current form. It is why \nthey have joined together with business groups who want to make sure \nour educational system stays competitive for everyone, to propose a \nfairly simple solution to a problem that is also fairly simple.\n  So this bill requires that schools continue to assess student \nperformance while getting rid of those annual high-stakes tests that \nwere unquestionably bad for schools and for students. No Child Left \nBehind was a bad bill for my State and for the Nation. So I am glad \nSenators Murray and Alexander have come together to create something \nbetter for our kids.\n  The bill requires that States track results by what we call \nsubgroups: minority students, disabled students, poor students, and \nnon-English-speaking students. But the problem is that when the schools \nare failing or when minority or disabled students are falling way \nbehind their peers, the bill doesn't require or even ask States or \nschool districts to do anything to fix it--nothing. As a civil rights \nmatter, that is unacceptable.\n\n  No Child Left Behind said a lot on this issue, and most of it wasn't \nhelpful or productive. NCLB made the measurement of schools and \nsubgroups a test and only a test. NCLB prescribed in a detailed way \nwhat schools had to do to turn around student outcomes, and NCLB \npunished schools that didn't turn around those outcomes quickly enough.\n  We have learned a lot from that backwards approach, from this \n``Washington knows best'' attitude. That is why the amendment we are \noffering today takes a very different approach to accountability for \nvulnerable kids. Under our amendment, States are required to identify \nthe bottom 5 percent of performing schools according to their \nmeasurement of performance; they have to identify the dropout \nfactories--the high schools where fewer than two-thirds of the students \nare graduating; and then they have to identify, again according to \ntheir own measurement, schools where subgroups of students--low-income \nstudents, students of color, students with disabilities, English \nlearners--aren't meeting their own set of criteria.\n  This amendment ensures that schools are identified based on a \nmeasurement that is set by the State, not by Washington, and it has to \ninclude multiple measures, not just test scores alone. Let me say that \nagain. The measurement is determined by the State, and it cannot be \nbased on test scores alone.\n  Then the amendment says that once you have identified those schools \nor those student groups who are in need of improvement according to \nyour own measurements, then the State needs to come up with a plan to \nimprove outcomes. Period. Stop. Identify your achievement gaps \naccording to your own comprehensive measurements and come up with a \nplan to fix the gaps. There is no federally dictated measurement, no \nfederally set intervention, no Federal penalty if you don't succeed. \nJust identify your problems and come up with a plan to make the \nproblems better. The accountability will then happen naturally, as \nstudents and parents and community members have input into that plan \nand the ability to watch to see if it is working--local solutions, \nlocal oversight, local accountability.\n  In 2006, as a candidate for Congress, I excoriated No Child Left \nBehind wherever I went. I come from a family of teachers, and I married \na former teacher. Now I have two kids, one in the public school system \nand one on his way there. And I watched firsthand as NCLB failed \nteachers, parents, and students.\n  But about a month or so after I was sworn in to the House of \nRepresentatives in 2007, I received a visit from the Children's Defense \nFund. They had heard how vocal I was in my criticism of the law, and \nthey just wanted me to know that not every State was like Connecticut. \nThey told me stories of places where prior to NCLB kids with \ndisabilities were sent for half a day of ``vocational training'' with \nthe janitor. Nothing was expected of those kids, and more often than \nnot those kids lived up to the low expectations that were set for them.\n  So maybe the only redeeming quality of No Child Left Behind was that \nit did expose these inexcusable gaps in performance between disabled \nand non-disabled kids. It forced States to talk about why Black \nstudents year after year were 30 percent behind their White peer \nstudents in achievement tests. It caused embarrassment for school \nsystems with schools where the majority of kids got so little out of \nschool that they dropped out before graduation. And it put pressure on \nall of us to do better.\n  This is an education bill, but it is not a worthwhile bill unless it \nis also a civil rights bill. Every single child, no matter their race \nor their geography, their income or their disability, deserves a first-\nrate education.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this vital amendment \nthat continues our march away from the stringent, inflexible \nrequirements of No Child Left Behind, while ensuring that all of our \nstudents receive the support they need to be successful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a couple aspects \nof the legislation. I will do it in summary form. I will submit a \nlonger statement for the Record.\n  First, I wish to say how much I appreciate the work that has been \ndone not only this week but over many weeks and months that led up to \ntoday. We were working a number of months ago on the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee to get a bill out of the committee. After \nit was completed, of course it looked easy, but I know how hard Senator \nAlexander, the chairman of the committee, and Senator Murray, the \nranking member, worked to reach this point. The vote that day was 22 to \n0, and now we are considering the bill on the floor. So that is \nsignificant and noteworthy, especially in these times in the Senate.\n  I just wanted to talk about a couple of aspects of this legislation.\n  For far too long, States have had to deal with the uncertainty of \nFederal waivers. One aspect of the legislation we are focused on is \nthat we need one law that provides States and districts with more \nflexibility.\n  We hear all across the country--I certainly heard it in \nPennsylvania--that among the concerns people had was a lack of \nflexibility, sometimes a one-size-fits-all regimen that came from \nWashington. So that flexibility is important. We also want to make sure \nwe are recapturing the original intent of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act--to protect our most vulnerable students.\n  The bill acknowledges the anxiety students, parents, and teachers \noften feel about testing, but it also realizes and contemplates that we \nmust at the same time have a way to determine what students are \nlearning each year. So I am pleased to see that the legislation strikes \nthe balance by maintaining annual testing while taking significant \nsteps to reduce the high-stakes nature of the testing.\n  So while there is more work to be done to ensure that all our \nchildren have access to high-quality early childhood education, I am \nencouraged that the bill builds on decades of research on early \nlearning by requiring that States align their early learning guidelines \nwith their kindergarten through 12th grade standards. So this change \nwill help educators from Head Start, childcare, and other early \nchildhood\n\n[[Page S5111]]\n\neducation programs in elementary schools work together so young \nchildren have a successful continuity of learning over time that sets a \nstrong foundation throughout the kindergarten through 12th grade years \nand beyond. That is something I pushed for over many years in the so-\ncalled Continuum of Learning Act, and I am pleased it has been included \nin the bill.\n  Mr. President, I wish to move to two other topics. I know we may have \nlimited time. The first is on the question of bullying, which we have \nbegun to address in the debates we have had leading up to this \nlegislation. We had a vote yesterday on Senator Franken's Student Non-\nDiscrimination Act. I supported that, and I commend him for his work, \nbut even with that vote, we have a long way to go on this issue.\n  Bullying, of course, is not what my generation understood it to be. \nIt is a much worse problem today. It is more severe, it is more \ndamaging, and it is destroying lives all across the country.\n  More students than ever are not in school every day for one reason--\nbullying, because of the impact bullying has on their lives. If a child \nis gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender, they are often and \ndisproportionately the victims of bullying. If a student has a \ndisability, he or she is often the victim of bullying, and again it is \ndisproportionate. So students are more likely to be bullied if they are \ndisabled, if they have a disability, or if they are gay, lesbian, \nbisexual, or transgender. That is an abomination. That is an insult to \nour country. Unless we begin to do something about this, we will still \nsee those numbers soaring.\n  Bullying, of course, is the ultimate betrayal. It is a betrayal by \nadults with regard to children, and it is a betrayal of everything we \nclaim to stand for in America because we say to our children, ``If you \ngo to school every day and study hard and go to class and do your \nhomework and study hard for tests and quizzes, you will succeed,'' but, \nof course, often children are betrayed because in between there, they \nare bullied. When they go home, they are bullied. When dinner is over \nat night, they are bullied. All throughout the night they are bullied \noften because of technology and because of vicious students who go \nafter one student and use social media or other tools to harass and \nbully that person. We have to do something about this. We have to do \nmore than just debate it and talk about it. We need to do something.\n  I am hoping that some of the efforts I have undertaken in my \nlegislation will be the subject of not just more debate but more \naction, progress, and results when we get through the conference \ncommittee because I think this overall legislation should reach the \npoint of getting to conference.\n  I am going to conclude because I see our chairman, who wants some \ntime before we start.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I am fine.\n  Mr. CASEY. Thank you.\n  I wish to give one example of a particular individual--a real-life \nexample of what bullying means, and I will have some comments as well \nabout prekindergarten education.\n  This is a real-life story. Brandon Bitner, 14 years old, of Mount \nPleasant Mills, PA, walked 13 miles from his home on an early Friday \nmorning in November of 2010 to a busy intersection and threw himself in \nfront of an oncoming tractor trailer after leaving a suicide note at \nhis home. That is what happened to a 14-year-old Pennsylvanian. I \ncannot even imagine the horror of that, what led to that action he took \nwhen he took his own life. It is, unfortunately, not an isolated \nexample. There are too many of these today. There would be too many if \nthere were one, but unfortunately there are many more than one.\n  So there seems to be little doubt in our minds and certainly in the \nminds of those who knew Brandon why he did what he did on that day in \nNovember of 2010. I am going to quote a friend, Takara Jo Folk. Here is \nwhat Takara said: ``It was because of bullying.'' That was written in a \nletter to the Daily Item, a newspaper in central Pennsylvania.\n  Quoting again from that letter:\n\n       ``It was not about race or gender, but they bullied him for \n     his sexual preferences and the way he dressed. Which,'' she \n     said, ``they wrongly accused him of.''\n\n  Brandon's suicide note reportedly explained that he was constantly \nbullied at Midwest High School in Middleburg, where he was a freshman. \nBullies at that school allegedly called Brandon names--names which I \nwill not repeat on the floor of the Senate. He stated in the note that \na humiliating event in school this past week was the ``straw that broke \nthe camel's back.''\n  Brandon was an accomplished violinist, having been a member of the \nSusquehanna Youth Orchestra in 2009, the year before he took his own \nlife.\n  That story, unfortunately and tragically, is emblematic of the \nproblem. We read these stories all the time. They may not be every \nsingle day and in every single newspaper, but not more than a week can \ngo by in the United States of America where you don't read something \nlike that.\n  I have others I could read as well, but I think folks within the \nsound of my voice know this. We all know this. So what are we going to \ndo about it? Well, we all have a role to play. Parents have to do a lot \nmore. Parents haven't done enough. Public officials haven't done \nenough. Schools haven't done enough. You could go down the list. At a \nminimum--and that is why I introduced legislation that we want to get \nback to; we want to be able to reach consensus--at a minimum, we should \nsay to school districts: Look, if you are getting Federal money and you \ndon't have a policy in place that deals with bullying and harassment \nand you don't specifically define or list or enumerate what is unlawful \nconduct, what is prohibited, then there should be a consequence for \nthat. You should have to prescribe what is wrong by way of a set of \nrules, a code of conduct. You should enforce it. And you should keep \ndata. If we take those kinds of steps, at least we can say that in a \nschool or a school district, there is a heightened consciousness about \nthis problem and that it is everybody's problem. This isn't just the \nproblem of the person being bullied and the person engaging in \nbullying; it is the problem of all of us, whether we are parents, \ntaxpayers, public officials, or whatever. We all have an obligation.\n\n  So I hope we can get back to this, in addition to continuing the good \nwork Senator Franken and others have started, because this is a \nbetrayal. It is a betrayal of our children. And we are all diminished \nby our allowing this problem to persist.\n  The only good news here--and it is significant--is that in a lot of \nplaces we have parents who are taking responsibility, teachers, school \nadministrators, school board directors, and of course students \nthemselves taking on the responsibility of making sure in their school \nthere will be zero tolerance for bullying, the best that they can \nimplement that kind of a policy. So we have students who are working \nwith other students to resolve disputes, to help someone who might be a \nvictim before something goes wrong and someone becomes a tragedy after \nbeing a victim of bullying. So we have a ways to go on this issue, and \nwe have more to do.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2242\n\n  Let me conclude with some thoughts about what we will likely be \nvoting on tomorrow, which is prekindergarten education. It is a very \nrare vote on the floor of the Senate where the entire Senate will cast \na vote on a very basic program--a program to make sure that if a State \nwants to join together in partnership with the Federal Government to \nbuild upon, expand, enlarge, or even start from scratch an early \nlearning, prekindergarten program for 4-year-olds, this legislation \nwill give them that opportunity. This is paid for. We have an offset \nfor the cost of it.\n  This is the right thing to do for 3 million American children, \nmeaning that if this prekindergarten education program were enacted and \nif every State took advantage and implemented this program, 3 million \nchildren in the country would have prekindergarten education, 93,930 in \nPennsylvania alone. The State of Texas, for example, upon passage of \nthis kind of a program into law, will have the opportunity to have \n300,000 children get the benefit of early learning.\n  Let me say finally that this is not just any program; we want high-\nquality early learning. All the experts know, have known for years, and \nhave told us for years what works. If there is a high-quality program, \na child will learn more now and he or she will earn\n\n[[Page S5112]]\n\nmore later. It is not just a rhyme, it is the truth. We have 50 years \nof data making that direct linkage between learning and earning, and \nall we need to do is give States the opportunity to work with us to \ndevelop a nationwide strategy so that the United States can say we are \npreparing not just our children for that bright future we hope they \nhave but that we are preparing our workforce and our economy. When you \nmake that linkage between learning and earning, you are literally not \njust improving the life of that child, but you are improving our \neconomic prosperity as well. I think our economic destiny is tied to \nthese kinds of strategies.\n  So we have a long way to go to get there, but tomorrow we should have \na vote, and I am looking forward to that.\n  I also again commend Senators Alexander and Murray for their work on \nthe legislation overall.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Of course.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, for Senators' information, I will be \ntalking to Senator Murray in the next few minutes, and there is a good \npossibility we will have votes beginning at about 3 o'clock. But I will \nhave more to report, hopefully, after the Senator from Vermont makes \nhis remarks.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2177\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, one of the amendments that will be \noffered is an amendment I have submitted regarding a major crisis in \nthis country that we don't talk about enough, and that is the \nfrighteningly high rate of youth unemployment in America.\n  I am delighted that the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is on \nthe floor for debate today, and I thank Senator Alexander and Senator \nMurray for their hard and constructive work on this important piece of \nlegislation. In my State of Vermont, we have held town meetings on No \nChild Left Behind, and the people of Vermont want to leave No Child \nLeft Behind very far behind. They want to get rid of it. They feel it \nhas not been productive for our kids, and I think that sentiment exists \nall over the country. If we go forward on this legislation, I think we \nwill be taking a very important step forward for the children of \nAmerica.\n  When we talk about the needs of our young people, it is not just a \ndysfunctional child care system we talk about and the need to make sure \nworking families all over this country have good-quality, affordable \nchildcare; it is not simply that college is increasingly unaffordable \nfor millions of working-class families; it is not just that the United \nStates, tragically and embarrassingly, has the highest rate by far of \nchildhood poverty of any major industrialized country on Earth. We talk \nabout the future. We talk about family values. But the truth is that we \nhave significantly ignored the needs of our children, and that is not \nwhat a great nation does--not a nation that looks forward to the \nfuture.\n  This country has to come to grips with the reality that we have not \njust a high rate of youth unemployment but a tragically high rate of \nyouth unemployment in this country. This is an issue we don't discuss. \nIt is literally swept under the rug. We have to bring it out in the \nopen, we have to discuss it, and we have to address this issue.\n  Last month, the Economic Policy Institute released a new study about \nthe level of youth unemployment in this country. This study took a \nclose look at census data on unemployment among young people between 17 \nand 20 who are jobless, those who are working part time when they need \na full-time job, and those who have given up looking for work \naltogether. The results of this study should concern everybody in our \ncountry and every Member of the Congress.\n  By the way, I have mentioned these facts in the past. PolitiFact, \nwhich seems to check every statement I make, checked it out, and they \nsaid these facts are basically accurate.\n  Here is what the Economic Policy Institute found. From April of 2014 \nto March of 2015, the average real unemployment rate for young White \nhigh school graduates between the ages of 17 and 20 was 33.8 percent. \nHigh school graduates, high school dropouts, White, 17 to 20--33.8 \npercent. The jobless figures for Hispanic kids in the same age group \nwas 36.1 percent. And incredibly, the average real unemployment rate \nfor African-American high school graduates was 51.3 percent. High \nschool graduates or dropouts between the ages of 17 and 20, African \nAmerican, over 50 percent unemployed or underemployed.\n  Today in America, over 5.5 million young people have either dropped \nout of high school or have graduated high school and do not have jobs. \nIt is no great secret--not to any parent, not to any Member of the \nSenate--that when kids are not in school, when kids have no jobs, that \nis when kids get into trouble, when they get into drugs, when they get \ninto self-destructive activity.\n  The result of kids not being in school and kids not having jobs is \nthat tragically, today, we in this country have more people in jail \nthan any other country on Earth, including China--a Communist \nauthoritarian country with a population four times our size. We have \nmore people in jail than China does. Incredibly, over 3 percent of our \ncountry's population is under some form of correctional control.\n  According to the NAACP, from 1980 to 2012, the number of people \nincarcerated in America quadrupled--quadrupled--from roughly 500,000 to \n2.2 million people.\n  A January 2014 study published in the journal Crime & Delinquency \nfound that almost half of Black males in the United States are arrested \nby the age of 23. That is an unbelievable statistic and a tragic \nstatistic. If this current trend continues, one in four Black males \nborn today can expect to spend time in prison during his lifetime. What \na tragedy this is. We cannot ignore it. We have to deal with this \nreality.\n  But this crisis is not just a destruction of human life and of \npotential, it is also very costly to the taxpayers of our country. In \nAmerica, we now spend nearly $200 billion on public safety, including \n$70 billion on correctional facilities each and every year.\n  It is beyond comprehension that we as a nation have not focused \nattention on the fact that millions of young people are unable to find \nwork and begin their careers in a productive economy. That is what \nyoung people want to do. They want to get out, they want to get a job, \nthey want to earn some money, they want to become independent from \ntheir parents, and they want to begin a career ladder, but for millions \nof these young people, that is not taking place today.\n  Let me be as clear as I can be. It makes a lot more sense for us to \ninvest in jobs and education rather than in more and more incarceration \nand more and more jails. The time is long overdue for us to start \ninvesting in our young people, to help them get the jobs they need, to \nhelp them get the education they need.\n  This is not only saving human life; it is saving dollars. It is a \nvery expensive proposition to put people into jail. Many people who go \nto jail come out of jail and go back to jail. They don't get jobs, and \nthey don't pay taxes. Their lives are destroyed. Their families' lives \nare destroyed. It is high time we understood that. We have to invest in \njobs, and we have to invest in education--not more jails, not more \nincarceration.\n  I have offered an amendment that will be voted upon, either today or \ntomorrow, that is pretty simple and pretty straight forward. It says to \nus that now is the time to keep kids out of jail, to get them jobs, and \nto get them an education. This amendment would simply provide $5.5 \nbillion in immediate funding to States and cities throughout the \ncountry to create 1 million jobs for young Americans between the ages \nof 16 and 24. This amendment would also provide job opportunities for \nhundreds of thousands of young adults.\n  Frankly, this amendment doesn't go far enough, but it is an important \nstart in trying to save the lives of countless numbers of young people \nwho, if we do not address their needs, are going to end up in jail or \nwith destroyed lives.\n  Specifically, under this amendment the U.S. Department of Labor would \nprovide $4 billion in grants to States and local governments to provide \nsummer and year-round employment opportunities for economically \ndisadvantaged youth, with direct links to academic and occupational \nlearning. This\n\n[[Page S5113]]\n\namendment would also make sure that young Americans have access to \ntransportation and childcare services they may need in order to \nparticipate in job opportunities all over this country. This amendment \nwould also provide $1.5 billion in competitive grants to local areas to \nprovide work-based job training to low- and moderate-income youth and \ndisadvantaged young adults.\n  I hope very much we can have bipartisan support for this amendment, \nbecause what we are talking about is not just saving countless numbers \nof lives and not just saving taxpayers a substantial sum of money. It \nis much more cost effective to invest in kids so they have productive \nlives rather than seeing them go into jail and into jail and into jail \nand see their families being destroyed. It is high time we addressed \nthis issue. This amendment is an important first step. I look forward \nto seeing bipartisan support for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yesterday President Obama announced a deal \nwith Iran, one that will send billions of dollars to a regime with a \nlong history of violently opposing the United States and its allies.\n  I come to the floor to express again my deep skepticism about how the \nObama administration has approached these talks and my great concerns \nabout what has been revealed about the deal so far--recognizing that we \nshould all, perhaps, reserve our judgment for the process that will \nunfold over the next couple of months, by which we will actually be \nable to read the text of the deal and then to show to the American \npeople what it contains and express our concerns publicly and debate \nthose. That is going to unfold over the next couple of months.\n  But I think we can all agree that bringing Iran to the negotiating \ntable and securing an agreement that prohibits 100 percent of their \nability to gain the capacity to create a nuclear weapon would be a \ntremendous legacy for any President to accomplish.\n  Preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear power would have been a \nlegacy item for President Obama or any President. But these \nnegotiations have been particularly concerning because, in spite of the \nfact that the Iranian regime has given us no reason to trust it, the \nPresident has been operating under the assumption that any deal is \nbetter than no deal.\n  I am afraid the President has demonstrated the old adage that if you \nwant a deal bad enough, that is exactly what you are going to get--a \nbad deal.\n  In so doing, the President has abandoned longstanding U.S. policy. \nOur policy has always been to prevent Iran from getting nuclear \nweapons. Instead, the administration has said: Well, it is OK. We will \nallow you a plan forward, and--in the words of Prime Minister \nNetanyahu--pave the way toward your acquisition of nuclear weapons.\n  This is an outcome that is irresponsible, unacceptable, and \nexceedingly dangerous.\n  I found it interesting that during his announcement the President \nsaid U.S. engagement in Iran was built upon ``mutual interests and \nmutual respect.'' The theocratic Iranian regime is a government that \njust last week encouraged its citizens to shout slogans often heard on \nthe streets of Tehran. ``Death to America,'' they say. ``Death to \nIsrael.'' I don't see how the President can consider such actions a \nsign of ``mutual respect.'' It is just the opposite.\n  But I should be fair to the President. He is of course not the only \nperson who supports this deal. We hear that Russia's President Vladimir \nPutin has endorsed it. So has Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, who \ncalled the agreement a ``major turning point.'' Our enemies think this \nis a great deal, and they strongly support it.\n  But I hope the administration is aware that the optimism they have \nsurrounding Iran and this deal is not universal. Our staunchest ally in \nthe Middle East, the nation of Israel, has stated its clear opposition \nyesterday.\n  President Netanyahu, as he did in a joint session of Congress just a \nfew short months ago, said in crystal clear language that this \nagreement represents a ``historic mistake'' for the world. That is \nlikely because the Iranian regime has regularly--even throughout the \nongoing negotiations--called for the destruction of Israel.\n  So while our enemies such as Bashar al-Assad of Syria called the deal \na major turning point, our greatest ally called it a ``historic \nmistake.'' That should give all of us pause. What other warning signs \ndo we need? Can a deal that is wholeheartedly endorsed by our \nadversaries and simultaneously disdained by one of our closest allies \npossibly be in the best interest of the United States of America? I am \ninterested in hearing the answer to that question during the course of \nour review and debates because that is the question we will have the \nchance to answer for ourselves at the end of this next 60-day period of \ntime.\n\n  Although I have seen several headlines talking about Republican \nopposition to the agreement, I would like to point out that there are a \nnumber of Democratic colleagues who have been quick to voice their \nconcerns as well. This should not, and I pray will not, become a \npartisan disagreement. What we ought to be doing, in the best interest \nof the United States of America and our national security and those of \nour allies, is getting to the bottom of this agreement, raising \nconcerns, and asking questions. Perhaps the President would like for \nthis to become a partisan debate because then he wins, and in so doing \nAmerica and our allies lose.\n  Yesterday, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee said that ``there is no trust when it comes to Iran.'' That \nstatement was made by the distinguished Senator from Maryland, Mr. \nCardin. Similarly, another Democratic colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom New Jersey and former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nsaid that ``the deal doesn't end Iran's nuclear program,'' but instead \nit ``preserves it.''\n  This deal cements many of the longstanding concerns that I and many \nof my colleagues have had. Instead of ridding the world of an Iranian \nnuclear weapon once and for all, this simply kicks the deal down the \nroad--when, by the way, President Obama will no longer be in office--\nbut it completely preserves the nuclear infrastructure required to \ncreate a nuclear weapon in as little as 1 year. We can't afford to sit \nback, cross our fingers, and wait for the regime to resurrect its \nnuclear program after their main obligations under the deal have \nexpired.\n  Let me just be clear. The American people are not so desperate to cut \nthis deal with the Iranian regime, and I think they will be even less \nsupportive than they have been so far once the details of this deal \ngets vetted.\n  I wholeheartedly reject the suggestion the President has made on \nnumerous occasions that there are two alternatives: There is this deal \nor there is war. That is ridiculous. That is a false choice. What it \nshould be is a choice between this deal and something better--something \nthat actually denies Iran nuclear weapons and doesn't unleash billions \nof dollars for them to fight their proxy war against the United States \nand our allies.\n  Again, the No. 1 state sponsor of international terrorism is Iran, \nand we are going to unleash the sanctions on the oil that they will now \nbe able to sell in global markets and reap windfall profits perhaps, \nalong with released funds that have been sequestered in American banks \nand other institutions, so they can now prop up their economy and again \npay for the war they are fighting against Israel and the United States \nand other allies.\n  The bipartisan sanctions regime that Congress has put in place over \ndecades should not and cannot be undone through an Executive agreement \nbetween President Obama and the head of the world's leader in state-\nsponsored terrorism. As elected representatives of the American people, \nwe, all of us, in addition to the President, are committed to securing \na good deal for the people who sent us here, and that means making sure \nIran will never have the ability to build a nuclear\n\n[[Page S5114]]\n\nweapon, protecting our interests and our allies against a threatening \nregional power and, first and foremost, ensuring that the American \npeople are safer tomorrow than they were yesterday.\n  Now that the White House has submitted the first 109 pages of this \ndeal to Congress, we are in the process of reviewing it, but there is \nmore to come--classified annexes and all. I look forward to reading \nthis agreement word-for-word, understanding it better, and asking many \nof the similar-type questions which I posed here today, which need good \nand solid and reliability answers. We can't base this on a policy of \nhope or even trust in the rogue regime in Tehran. We need answers to \nthese questions and, even more importantly, so do the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2241\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, our Nation has always held the ideal of \nproviding education for all, but a half century ago we put that ideal \ninto action with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act or ESEA. \nThat law aimed to close education gaps between rich and poor, Black and \nWhite, kids from rural areas, and kids from big cities.\n  Today, we are debating an amendment to strengthen accountability in \nour bill to reauthorize ESEA to do even more by making sure schools are \ndelivering on the promise of quality and equality to every student in \nAmerica.\n  Across the country, too many schools today have failed too many of \nour children for too long, and that has to change. Now our bipartisan \nbill removes the unrealistic goals and one-size-fits-all mandates of No \nChild Left Behind. But we can still have strong accountability without \ngoing back to those requirements.\n  Senator Murphy's amendment, which we will be voting on shortly, will \nshine a light on the persistent inequality and achievement gap that \nstill exists and do something about it, and it would ensure that we \nmake sure children from low-income backgrounds, the kids of color, the \nstudents who are still learning English, and students with disabilities \nhave access to a high-quality education.\n  Under his amendment, States would identify the bottom 5 percent of \nschools, States would identify the high schools that are failing to \ngraduate one-third or more of their students, and States would identify \nschools that have failed to help subgroups of students make progress.\n  Now, of course, accountability is about more than just identifying \nthe schools and districts that need help. We have to make sure those \nschools get the resources they need. The Every Child Achieves Act \nallows districts to design interventions tailored to the individual \nneeds of low-performing schools. This amendment doesn't change that, \nbut this amendment would give parents, teachers, and communities \nimportant measures to hold schools accountable for delivering a quality \neducation to every child.\n  I will also note that in our bipartisan bill, we have done a lot to \nhelp the adults in this school get the support they need from \nprofessional development to easing the burden on school administrators. \nI was very proud to work on all of those provisions. But this amendment \nisn't about the adults. It is about the children in our schools. So I \nurge my colleagues to vote yes on the Murphy amendment so we can do \neven more to make sure all of our students learn, no matter where they \nlive or how they learn or how much money their parents make.\n  Let's fix No Child Left Behind. Let's continue to improve this bill \nby strengthening accountability, and let's reaffirm our Nation's \ncommitment to providing a quality education to every student in \nAmerica.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Every Child Achieves \nAct, S. 1177, which replaces the education law better known as No Child \nLeft Behind. I wish to thank the HELP Committee Chairman Alexander and \nranking member Patty Murray for their hard work on today's bipartisan \ncompromise bill.\n  Today's Every Child Achieves Act isn't perfect, but it makes good \nprogress. For years, I have heard from Hawaii's teachers, parents, and \nadministrators that No Child Left Behind, or NCLB, is broken. It is \ntime to leave NCLB behind.\n  I have been working to fix this broken law, first as a member of the \nHouse of Representatives' Education and Labor Committee in 2007 and now \nas a Senator. I also began to work on education reform when I was \nLieutenant Governor of the State of Hawaii.\n  I will start with one of the biggest problems with NCLB, which is the \ntesting requirements. I heard from teachers in Hawaii loud and clear \nthat NCLB brought us too much testing. Teachers and students in some \nschools spent so much time on testing and test prep that they didn't \nhave enough time for teaching and learning.\n  Today's bill includes Senator Baldwin's SMART Act legislation, which \nI cosponsored, to cut redundant State and local tests, and it also \nincludes Senator Bennet's amendment that sets a cap on the percent of \ntime spent on testing.\n  I also strongly support the early education parts of this program as \nnegotiated by Senator Murray, herself a former preschool teacher. I \nurge my colleagues to expand on this work by also supporting the Strong \nStart for America's Children amendment led by Senators Casey, Murray, \nmyself, and others.\n  The Strong Start amendment would invest significant resources in \nhigh-quality preschool grant programs, which would serve some 16,000 \nHawaii children in my State alone. It would expand early Head Start \nchildcare partnerships, such as Hawaii's Parents And Children Together \nand Kama'aina Kids, and would strengthen the Maternal, Infant, and \nEarly Childhood Home Visiting Program, supporting programs like the \nHawaii Home Visiting Network.\n  Quality early education helps kids enter kindergarten ready to learn, \na recipe for success in school and in life. Studies show that by age 3, \nthere is a 30-million word gap, basically a 2-to-1 gap, between low-\nincome children and their wealthier peers with regard to their language \nskills. Quality early education can help close this gap early. Kids \nthen are more likely to succeed in school, avoid crime or teen \npregnancy, graduate from high school and college, earn more income, pay \nmore taxes, and need fewer public services. Why?\n  First, they have the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in a \nchanging economy. Business and financial leaders in Hawaii--Hawaii's \nBusiness Roundtable executive director Gary Kai is a huge supporter of \nquality early education, and former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke \nalso agrees that early childhood education is a key investment in U.S. \ncompetitiveness.\n  Second, military leaders have also stressed the importance of quality \nearly education as a national security issue. The Department of Defense \nhas estimated that 75 percent of Americans age 17 to 24 are ineligible \nfor military service due to poor education, physical unfitness or \ncriminal records. Hundreds of retired admirals and generals know that \nquality early learning can reverse this trend.\n  Third, early education investments make financial sense for \ntaxpayers. A study by the University of Hawaii and Good Beginnings \nAlliance estimated a return of more than $4 for every $1 invested in \nearly education. National studies are even higher. Some show a return \nas high as $17 for every $1 invested in quality early education. That \ndepends, of course, on the quality of the program and particularly if \nwe target the highest need students.\n  Finally, parents themselves are demanding quality, affordable \npreschool for their children. In April of this year, I visited Kauai \nCommunity College\n\n[[Page S5115]]\n\nwhose Early Childhood Development Center reopened after a few years of \nrenovations.\n  This center trains early childhood educators while providing high-\nquality early learning services to children of faculty, staff, and the \ncommunity. Their lead teacher and coordinator, Gina Medrano, said, ``So \nfar, no one has cried since we opened. They only cry when it is time to \ngo home.'' That is evidence of how important early education is to our \nkids themselves.\n  Currently, the KCC Center can only serve 20 children. There are wait-\nlists for this program and for quality early learning programs in \nKauai, all across Hawaii, and nationwide. We can and should do much \nbetter.\n  The Strong Start for America's children amendment would help make \nearly learning the national priority it deserves to be. The amendment \nwould provide quality preschool to over 3 million children nationwide. \nI urge my colleagues to vote yes on this amendment when it comes to the \nfloor.\n  So many of us recognize that education is a continuum which starts \nearly and continues throughout life; therefore, coordination of effort \nis important. So I am pleased that this bill before us includes \nprovisions to foster coordination between existing early childhood \nprograms and their local elementary school. In 2011, Senator Casey and \nI introduced the Continuum of Learning Act, and today's bill on the \nfloor includes many pieces from that legislation.\n  On balance, the Every Child Achieves Act before us means good \nprogress for our keiki--our children--and I hope we can continue moving \nforward and pass the bill before us in a bipartisan way.\n  Our country is at its best when all students have access to high-\nquality education from birth to college and career. Improving our \neducation system through evidence-based reforms will help every child \nachieve so that our next generation can compete and lead in the 21st-\ncentury global economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Murray from \nWashington and myself, I ask unanimous consent that at 3:15 p.m. today, \nthe Senate vote on the following amendments in the order listed: Markey \namendment No. 2176, 60-vote threshold; Heitkamp amendment No. 2171, 60-\nvote threshold; Kirk amendment No. 2161, 60-vote threshold; and Murphy \namendment No. 2241, 60-vote threshold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2144 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I further ask unanimous consent that the Wicker \namendment No. 2144 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, amendment No. 2144 is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2176\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 2 minutes on \nmy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, my amendment is very simple. It would \ncreate a competitive grant program to support the development and \nimprovement of educational materials and teacher training on climate \nchange science and solutions.\n  The scientific evidence of climate change is longstanding and wide-\nranging. The National Academy of Sciences and numerous science \nprofessional organizations all recognize the reality of climate change \nand the influence of human activities upon it. The children of our \ncountry deserve the best scientific education they can get on this \ntopic. They are the future leaders of our country and the world. They \nmust be equipped for this generational challenge.\n  This is without question one of the overarching issues of our 21st \ncentury. We must ensure that we provide the best science training \navailable for this next generation--the green generation. They are \ngoing to have to confront this problem. They should have the best \nscientific evidence available.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, we will have a vote on the Markey amendment. I would \nurge a ``no'' vote for the following reasons: If you love Washington \ngetting involved in Common Core, you will love this amendment, because \nit gets the Federal Government involved in creating a curriculum for \nclimate change in your local high schools and other schools.\n  Based upon what we know about the U.S. Department of Education, as \nsoon as we authorize this, it will begin to write regulations defining \nwhat we mean by climate change, and we would have to change textbooks \nin 100,000 public schools every time we have a Presidential election. \nJust imagine what the curriculum on climate change would be if we \nshifted from President Obama to President Cruz and then back to \nPresident Sanders and then to President Trump. There would be a lot of \nwasted paper, writing and rewriting textbooks.\n  The Every Child Achieves Act prohibits officials of the Federal \nGovernment from getting involved with the instructional material in \nclassrooms. If we want to have better climate science, the appeal \nshould not be to a national school board that gets Washington involved \nin climate change. It should be to the local school board or the State \nschool board. I say that as a Republican who believes that climate \nchange is a problem and that human activity is a major contributor to \nthat problem. But I do not want the Federal Government involved in \nlocal high school and elementary school curricula for climate science \nor anything else.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support \nmy amendment. As you have been talking to your school districts and as \nyou have been talking to the school personnel, if they don't mention \nthe challenges they have dealing with children in their schools who \nneed services beyond education services, who come unready to learn \nbecause of behavior and mental health problems, we have a program that \nhas existed for a number of years. I understand it has been \nunderutilized. But if there has ever been a time, as we talk about the \nbehavior and mental health challenges that we have in our communities \nand in our schools, and if there has ever been a challenge for a grant \nprogram that develops best practices, it is today.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and integrate these \nbehavior and mental health programs into the schools and into the \neducation system so that we can better address the concerns, so that we \ncan, in fact, begin to challenge our society to deal with these issues \nat the school level. Schools should not be in this alone. We need to \nintegrate the behavioral health and mental health systems into our \nschools.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I urge a ``no'' vote. Of course, we \nshould help and care about the mental health of children, but the \nFederal Government already funds at least 16 programs related to mental \nhealth.\n  A new program isn't needed, and the Department of Education is not \nthe best suited agency to administer it. It ought to be in the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n  It is unnecessary. The district may use funds already under the \neducation bill and other health programs for this purpose.\n  One of the problems we have as a Congress is we have a good idea and \nwe appropriate and create a new program without realizing there are \nalready 16 other programs there. We should stop that and focus our \nefforts on existing programs and giving States more flexibility to use \nthat money.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP.

Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues to vote yes on the \nKirk-Reed-Baldwin-Brown amendment.\n  Essentially, in this legislation--and I commend the chairman and the \nranking member for all the work they have done--they have established \nlofty goals, but without adequate resources, all of our students cannot \nsucceed. This amendment encourages the States to develop and report on \nmeasures of access to critical education resources; identify \ndisparities in districts' access to those resources; develop plans with \nschool districts to address these disparities; and include the \nOpportunity Dashboard of Core Resources on the State report card.\n  Again, it is a very simple concept. Lofty goals without adequate \nresources will not give opportunities to American students. We hope \nthis will help provide equitable access to critical resources.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I urge a ``no'' vote. This bipartisan \nbill on the floor is about reversing the trend toward a national school \nboard. This amendment is about making the national school board bigger \nand more powerful. It would result in the Federal Government deciding \nfor States which educational resources are critical. That would have \nthe Federal Government deciding about licensing teachers, teachers' \nsalaries, library books, wellness programs, school facilities, and it \nwould produce new lawsuits.\n  We need to go in the other direction. We need to keep the \nmeasurements of how children are doing but restore to States and local \nschool boards the responsibility for making these decisions.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, arguably the only good thing that the \nexisting education law did was expose these unconscionable gaps in this \ncountry between the performance of minority kids and nonminority kids, \nbetween disabled kids and nondisabled kids.\n  Frankly, this body is at its best when it says that, no matter your \nrace, geography, disability or income, you deserve access to a quality \neducation. If we can't guarantee that, then the question is this: What \ngood is a Federal education law in the first place?\n  So this amendment learns from the mistakes of No Child Left Behind, \nand it simply says two things. States have to identify when they have \nthese unjustifiable yawning gaps between the performance of disabled \nkids or minority kids and the rest of the school, and then they have to \ncome up with a plan through a community conversation as to how to fix \nthat--period, stop. Identify your problem, your achievements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me quickly say that this vote will \nbe the last vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. All this amendment says is that just simply on a State by \nState basis, identify your achievement gap and then come up with a plan \nto fix it--no Federal intervention, no Federal prescription of how you \nfix the problem.\n  It is a big, big problem in this country that has a very simple \nsolution in this amendment, and it deserves our support.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, yesterday the Senator from Montana, Mr. \nTester, came on the floor and said he supported this bill because it \ngot rid of adequate yearly progress. This is adequate yearly progress \nthrough the back door. Instead of fixing No Child Left Behind, it keeps \nthe worst parts of it and restores those kinds of parts with new \nmandates.\n  If you don't believe me, here is a letter dated yesterday from the \nNational Educational Association on behalf of its 3 million members:\n\n       After 13 years of witnessing firsthand the negative \n     consequences [of] No Child Left Behind's one-size-fits-all \n     approach to accountability . . . our members strongly oppose \n     more of the same. . . . we believe the Murphy amendment would \n     continue the narrow and punitive focus of NCLB.\n       Our members are deeply concerned the amendment would mark \n     an entire school for intervention if a single subgroup misses \n     goals for two consecutive years--precisely the approach that \n     misidentified schools under the Adequate Yearly Progress \n     (AYP) provision of [No Child Left Behind].\n\n  We are reversing the trend toward a national school board, not \nestablishing more of a school board.

Mr. President, I rise to speak regarding the Burr \namendment, which has been offered to the underlying education bill. \nThis is an amendment that I understand has been modified recently, but \nit still has some of the flaws it has had all along; that is, it tells \nStates that if they invest in their kids, they are penalized, which I \nthink is the wrong message. I hope this amendment can be defeated on \nthat basis alone.\n  It also happens to be bad for some States because, for instance, in \nmy home State of Ohio, we would lose an estimated $70 million because \nwe do invest in our children who are poor, who are vulnerable. \nTherefore, because of formula changes, we get less money in Ohio.\n  I hope States that are affected one way or another, though, will look \nat this from a policy perspective and understand that certainly in this \nFederal K-12 education bill, we ought not to be telling the States, \nsuch as my home State of Ohio, that because they invest more in their \nkids, somehow they are penalized.\n  I know the Burr amendment was changed to reach a different level \nbefore this formula change would occur. I think it is $17 billion; \nright now it is $14.4 billion. This means that this change will not \noccur for a few years, as I understand it, but the same problem \nremains.\n  We hope this authorization will last through that period and we will \nnot be back revisiting this on the floor of the Senate. Therefore, I \nurge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--and I know there is \nopposition on both sides of the aisle to this amendment--to stand tall \nand to say let's not tell the States that if they invest in kids who \ncome from some of the lowest income school jurisdictions in our \ncountry, that somehow they are going to be penalized under a new \nformula.\n  This amendment is a mistake because it fails to take into account \nthat the cost of education in different parts of the country differs, \nand again it penalizes States that invest more in education.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Burr amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Remembering Dr. Elson Floyd\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, every once in a while you meet an \nindividual who thinks bigger than themselves, rises above challenges \nwith grace, is driven by a passion to better the world\n\n[[Page S5118]]\n\naround them and, most importantly, is a truly wonderful human being. I \nhave come across many advocates and community leaders in my career, but \nDr. Elson Floyd was exceptional. He was a giant in Washington State's \nhigher education community. He inspired countless students and teachers \nand many across the State as Washington State University's president. I \ncan only imagine what else he would have accomplished had his life not \nbeen cut painfully short.\n  For 8 years, I have had the privilege to work with Dr. Floyd in his \nrole as the beloved president of my alma mater, Washington State \nUniversity. He was one of our Nation's most successful advocates for \naffordable and accessible higher education. I always admired his \ndedication to his students, his passion for education, and his desire \nto make a great university even better.\n  The last time I spoke with Dr. Floyd a few months ago, he spoke of \nthe bright future of Washington State University and the innovative \nsteps the institution was taking to provide high-quality education to \nits students.\n  As we look back now on the life and legacy of Dr. Elson Floyd, we \nwill remember how he led WSU through a trying economic recession by \ntirelessly advocating for investments in higher education as a path to \nthe middle class and how he doubled the enrollment of students of \ncolor. We will remember how he skillfully convinced our State \nlegislature to allow the university to begin building the State's \nsecond medical school at Washington State University-Spokane. And, most \nimportantly, we will remember how, through a warm handshake to visiting \nalumni or a comforting hug to a student, he always had a way of making \nthose around him feel welcome.\n  I hope to honor Dr. Floyd's memory by striving every day to better \nour higher education system with the enthusiasm and the warmth he \nemanated as a tireless advocate for Washington State students.\n  There is so much we can all learn from his work, and I know his \nlegacy will continue to live on in Washington State and across the \nhigher education community.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for such time as I shall consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, the \njunior Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Lankford, be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               DRIVE Act\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, right now probably the most significant \nthing we will be facing as soon as we get through with the education \nbill that Senator Lamar Alexander has done such a great job on is the \ntransportation reauthorization bill. I found out the House just passed \na few minutes ago a 5-month extension to the highway reauthorization \nbill.\n  I would suggest to the people who may think there is some type of \nadversarial relationship between our bill in the Senate and the House \nbill that there isn't. We are working together and we both want to \naccomplish a long-term bill, and I anticipate that we will actually \nhave passed in the next few days a long-term--maybe a 6-year--highway \nreauthorization bill, at which time we will go to conference with the \nHouse and it will be business as usual. I want to make sure, in case \nthere is a fire looming out there, that we put it out early.\n  Passing the long-term transportation bill has been my top priority \nsince I returned as chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. Ironically, the ranking member of that committee, Senator \nBoxer of California, feels just as strongly that it is her top priority \nalso. So I consider this to be the second most significant bill of the \nyear, the first one being of course the Defense reauthorization, which \nwe have already addressed here. But we felt strongly enough about this \nbeing a top priority that we had our first full committee hearing on \nthe need to reauthorize what at that time was MAP-21. We had Anthony \nFoxx, the Secretary of Transportation, as well as a lot of government \nleaders so they could share the importance of an ongoing Federal and \nState partnership in building and maintaining a modern surface \ninfrastructure system.\n  Since that hearing, my committee has put forward a bold bipartisan \nsolution called the DRIVE Act that will put our Nation on the path to \nhaving a world-class transportation system. I have often said there is \nno such thing as a Republican or a Democratic road or bridge. This is \nsomething that is bipartisan. By the way, I have to say when the DRIVE \nAct passed through my committee, it passed unanimously--every Democrat \nand every Republican voted for the bill.\n  The Transcontinental Railroad, I am proud to say, the Republicans \nhave historically been leading the way in transportation going all the \nway back to the Lincoln days. We passed the Transcontinental Railroad. \nThe Panama Canal was done by Teddy Roosevelt.\n  Of course, the Interstate Highway System was done by Eisenhower. \nEisenhower said the transportation system is a dynamic element in the \nvery name we bear, United States. Without it, we would be a mere \nalliance of many separate parts. What he also said--let's remember that \nEisenhower was a President. He was a star. He was concerned, and he \nstarted the first highway bill by addressing the problems of defense. \nThe fact is that if you don't have a highway system within the United \nStates, you can't adequately supply the necessary means to fight and \nwin wars. So that was the very first motivation for it. In laying out \nthe full interstate system, Eisenhower envisioned it to be the physical \nbackbone of the economy, fueling the growth of our GDP, our cities, and \nthe competitiveness of our exports.\n  Now, this vision and certainty maximized the economic and mobility \nbenefits of the system. Businesses and individuals knew that if they \ncould locate somewhere on a future interstate system, they would be \nconnected not just with the Nation but with the world.\n  I am afraid this legacy system, which was built with a 50-year design \nlife, is now more than 50 years old. So we are out of warranty now, and \nwe need to address that. That is the sense of urgency that we have. We \nare in serious danger of eroding a half century of investments without \nproper maintenance, modernization, and reconstruction. We are on \nborrowed time with a system that is in full need of restoration.\n  Our national interstate system currently has a maintenance backlog of \n$185 billion. Now that national interstate system is actually 47,000 \nmiles in length, and just to bring back the system to the original 1956 \ndesign, it would be that expensive.\n  Maintaining Eisenhower's vision of economic opportunity and strength \nin defense requires a continued partnership between the Federal \nGovernment and the States, which is the hallmark of the DRIVE Act. Yet \ndue to 33 short-term passages since 2005, the highway construction now \nconsists of maintenance patchwork.\n  This is what happened. We had a transportation reauthorization bill \nthat was a 5-year bill. This was in 2005. I am very familiar with it. I \nwas the author of the bill at that time. In 2005, we passed this long-\nterm bill. Since that time, we have been unable to pass a long-term \nreauthorization bill. So we have been operating on extensions--short-\nterm extensions.\n  It is interesting that we are now looking at something that has both \na liberal and a conservative perspective. The conservative position is \na long-term bill because the only alternative is short-term extensions. \nShort-term extensions--I don't think anyone has ever challenged this--\ncosts about 30 percent more because you can't get big projects, which \nwe are talking about in a minute. So we are now to the point where we \nare going to be able to do something with a long-term bill.\n  Passing a long-term bill is crucial in many aspects of day-to-day \nlife in America. More than 250 million vehicles and 18 billion tons \nvalued at $17 trillion in goods traverse across the country every year. \nYet every day 2,000 miles of our highways slow below the posted speed \nlimits because of the stop-and-go conditions of overcongestion.\n  The National Highway System--this is kind of interesting. Not many \npeople\n\n[[Page S5119]]\n\nare aware of this. Our whole National Highway System is 5.5 percent of \nthe total Nation's roads, but it carries 55 percent of all vehicles \ntraveling and 97 percent of the truck-borne freight. So 5.5 percent of \nthe Nation's roads account for the transportation of 97 percent of the \nfreight crossing this country. This type of congestion has a huge \nnegative impact on our businesses throughout America.\n  Congress just passed a 2-month extension, and we now have a \nresponsibility to pass a long-term solution. As I mentioned, they did \npass something over in the House that we are in agreement that will get \nthem to conference with us, and I think most of them are going to be--\nfrom the ones I talked to over there--very excited about the fact that \nwe are going to have funding for a 6-year bill.\n  The highway trust fund needs $15 billion a year to maintain current \nspending. What we are saying there is, if you take proceeds of the gas \ntax that is out there in order to do what we are currently doing, it \ntakes an additional $15 billion each year just to do that, but we need \nto do more than just maintain the system. We need to improve it for the \nfuture of America's growing economy. Fortunately, my committee just \npassed this bill unanimously with what we call the DRIVE Act.\n  The DRIVE Act will put America back on the map as the best place to \ndo business. The DRIVE Act has several key components to position \nAmerica's transportation system to support our growing economy.\n  First of all, it prioritizes funding for core transportation formula \nprograms to provide States and local governments with strong Federal \npartners. In other words, the States have needs. They articulate those \nneeds to the Federal Government. The Federal Government goes in and \nmakes sure that is going to be a reality. Let's keep in mind, there are \nsome States--suggesting Wyoming as an example--it would take three \ntimes as much money actually to take care of the roads in Wyoming than \ncould be produced by the sparse population of that State. So that is \none of the major initial reasons for the program.\n  Secondly, it prioritizes the interstate system, the National Highway \nSystem, and the bridges at risk system. Well, as I said, the interstate \nsystem is 47,000 miles, but the National Highway System is 220,000 \nmiles, which does encompass the 47,000 miles of the interstate system.\n  Thirdly, it creates a new multibillion-dollar-per-year freight \nprogram to help the States deliver projects that promote the safe, \nefficient, and reliable transportation of consumer goods and products \nacross the United States.\n  The fourth thing is--and this is something a lot of people are not \naware of--a lot of people think that we in Washington have this \ninfinite wisdom that we know what is best for the States. We don't \nbelieve that. We believe the States should set their own priorities. In \nmy State of Oklahoma, I don't even get involved in what projects are \ngoing to be there. We have a State system, where the State does \nevaluate, and certainly they know more about our needs in Oklahoma than \nthe Federal Government does. Don't you agree? That is right. Well, that \nis where we are on that. We let the States determine what projects we \nare going to be doing.\n  The fifth thing is to provide greater efficiency in the project \ndelivery process through reforms that put DOT in the driver's seat \nduring the NEPA process by requiring other agents to bring in their \nissues. Here is what happens. We have a lot of good rules in the NEPA \nProgram, in the environmental programs, but there are some things where \nwe feel that should not slow down the construction of roads, highways, \nand bridges, both new bridges and repairs. To do that, we have to write \nthat into the law, so that streamlines the system. If you have nothing \nbut short-term extensions, that doesn't happen. They don't get \nstreamlined.\n  Let me compliment my partner in this, the ranking member Senator \nBoxer from California. It is interesting. I am among one of the most \nconservative Members of the U.S. Senate. She is a very proud liberal. \nYet we both agree on what our priorities should be, and that makes this \nprocess more important. She has been willing to do things she didn't \nreally want to do because it does short-circuit some of the NEPA \nrequirements, and as a general rule she would not want to do that. But \nthis has been a give-and-take, and that is why we have a bill that \npassed our committee unanimously.\n  The sixth or seventh thing is eliminating duplicative reviews and \nexpanding categorical exclusions. To give an example of that, we have \nbridge projects that are given special considerations with new \nexemptions from section 4(f), the historic property reviews. Now, to be \na historic property, it has to be over 50 years old. For them to \ncontinue to be able to do it, it takes these exemptions from what other \nhistoric things have to go through because we are in the business of \nbuilding bridges.\n  Secondly, we have the Migratory Bird Treaty Act on the books, and it \nallows us to go ahead and start working on projects even though \nswallows nests--I know it sounds kind of insignificant, but it is not, \nbecause swallows go in there, and while they are not protected or \nlisted as an endangered species, they still are protected by the \nMigratory Bird Treaty Act, and they have caused us to stop construction \non many of the bridges around the country.\n  This is kind of a brief overview of the bill. As the DRIVE Act \nprogresses on the floor, I intend to address the significance of each \nprogram in a lot more detail. Most importantly, the DRIVE Act sets up \nfunding levels for the next 6 years. This is at the very best what the \nFederal Government should provide so States and local officials in the \nconstruction industry can gear up for large projects--the $500 million \nto $2 billion projects. These are things you can't do with extensions, \nbut you can do with a bill such as the bill we have successfully \npassed.\n  We have thousands of projects around the Nation that are currently in \njeopardy, and construction will come to a halt unless this legislation \nbecomes a reality.\n  As shown in this picture I have in the Chamber, this is the Brent \nSpence Bridge. This goes from Kentucky to Ohio. Right now it is in dire \nneed. One can see actually the problems with this antiquated bridge. \nThere are chunks of it dropping off into the river below and it has \nbecome very dangerous.\n  We saw not long ago in another adjoining State what can happen if a \nbridge goes down. Here in DC we had the Memorial Bridge. It is \nliterally crumbling. You can go right down and you can see the pieces \nof the bridge dropping into the Potomac River. It was built in 1932. It \nhas only received patchwork ever since that time. It is estimated that \nnearly $250 million will be required to keep the bridge operational. \nThat is not a new bridge. That is to make that into an operational \nbridge.\n  You recognize this. You drive by it, many of you, every day. But you \ndon't see--you have to get down there and you can see concrete dropping \ninto the Potomac. We have many more like this. What else do we have \nhere? The Mobile River Bridge. This is in Alabama. This is what it will \nlook like later. That is not a current picture. This is what it is \nright now.\n  These are the types of projects that we can do now which we could not \ndo with just extensions, as we have been doing since 2009. I believe \nmore than just a small part of the economic success enjoyed by the \nUnited States over the past 50 years has been the interstate system \nstarted by President Eisenhower. But today we literally sit in a \nsituation where we would have to do something to carry this forward.\n  That is why Senator Boxer and I are bringing the DRIVE Act to the \nSenate floor. It will ensure that States have the tools and certainty \nto make the necessary new investments to rebuild Eisenhower's vision, \nfight growing congestion and maintain the mobility of goods and \nservices across our country. So we are going to have this up. I think \nthis will be on the floor, probably the next thing after we finish with \nthe education bill.\n  Again, no one can argue that this is the second most significant bill \nthat we address each year. We have not addressed this one in the right \nway since 2005. So it is very significant. We are looking forward it \nto. Anyway, we are going to be coming forth with this, I'm going to be \ncoming to the floor and\n\n[[Page S5120]]\n\ntalking about it in a lot more detail. We have got to get the roads and \nthe bridges taken care of. We intend to do it. The product to do that \nis the DRIVE Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, in the 1960s the Johnson administration \nled Congress to start allotting a small amount of money--of Federal \nfunding from the Federal taxpayers to target schools and reach out to \nthe poorest of the poor in America and try to help beat back poverty. \nFive decades later, we have an education policy in America that reaches \nout to every single school district in America--millions of kids--that \ncontinues to fail them, to fail their parents, and that still has not \nsolved the poverty issue.\n  What we have is an ever-increasing Federal bureaucracy that has \nreached well beyond what it was designed for in the 1960s and, I would \nassure you, reaches well beyond what it was originally designed for--\nsomething that would help the poorest of the poor or take care of kids \non military bases and those on Indian tribal lands.\n  No Child Left Behind passed in 2001, authorizing education policy \nthat was even more expansive. The goal was good--make sure that every \nchild in America has the opportunity for success, that every teacher \nhas teaching qualifications, and that every school has accountability. \nIt was approved through 2008, and it still continues today.\n  Math, reading, and science are now measured in adequate yearly \nprogress for each school, and it has become the slow-rolling disaster. \nThe problem was the source and the goal. Parents, local districts, and \nStates should set education policy--I would think that is something we \nshould agree on--not a massive, centralized, controlled bureaucracy--\nthe bureaucracy that is here, made up of a lot of nice folks who do \ncare about kids; it is just that most of the folks who are here in this \nbureaucracy dealing with education have never been to Oklahoma, and the \nfolks in Oklahoma don't know their names and don't know why they are \nmanaging their district.\n  The goal should be progress for each student, not each school, but \nthe annual yearly progress demanded by No Child Left Behind really \nmanaged the progress of the school, not the child. I can assure you \nthat the parents at home are not trying to figure out if the school is \nbetter; they are trying to figure out if their child is better in a \nparticular subject.\n  Annual yearly progress and the Federal mandates have put my State in \nthe untenable position of playing ``Mother, may I'' with the Federal \nGovernment and asking for a waiver every single year and having the \nnational education board determine what our schools in Oklahoma can and \ncannot do. That has to change.\n  We want our students in Oklahoma to be college- and career-ready. We \nwant accountability to the parents and the community. We want less \nburden on the educators who give their lives and their time to the task \nof helping parents and their children. We want that. As surprising as \nit may be to some in Washington, DC, we actually do care about our \nkids. We want the best for them. So we ask a simple thing. Allow \nOklahomans to manage education for Oklahomans and just take this \nassumption: We do love our kids. We are going to work hard to make sure \nthey are taken well care of.\n  My mom was an educator for decades. She started teaching elementary \nschool and then went into a library and was an elementary school \nlibrarian and then a high school librarian and then moved into the \nblack hole of education that is the administration building downtown, \nwhere she worked in a burnt-out position in school administration for a \ndistrict for years. She is passionate about kids. She passed that on to \nme.\n  I started out my first year in college as a business major. I \nthoroughly enjoyed it for probably a week and then shifted the next \nyear to secondary education--the thing that I fought against because my \nmom was in education, so surely I should not do the same thing, but I \nloved being with students. I spent 22 years of my life serving students \nafter college. It is a passion in my family. There are multiple \neducators in my family, both at the college level and in the schools. \nWe believe in education.\n  I will never forget the student teaching time that I had in college, \ninteracting with those kids for the first time, stepping out of a \ncollege setting of being the student to now suddenly being the student \nteacher and having a classroom and understanding for the first time \nthat it is my responsibility to help those parents educate their \nchildren; that I am not now the parent for this child--this child has a \nparent, and that parent has the responsibility to be able to raise \ntheir child well, but I have a responsibility to come alongside that \nparent and help. Allow us to have that.\n  This is what I want. I want greater flexibility for States. I want \ngreater authority and responsibility to be placed on parents in \neducation. The people in Oklahoma want the freedom to be able to make \ndecisions about their own children, their own families. That is why I \nvoted for the A PLUS Act. I tried to add that as an amendment to this \nbill. Steve Daines from Montana and I and multiple others supported the \nability for States to have even more control if they choose to, to have \nboth the responsibility and the authority for all areas of all parts of \neducation. We did not win that amendment, but it was a blanket ``We \nwant everything to go back to the States if they choose to have it.'' \nWe will continue to have that fight in the days ahead.\n  Lamar Alexander brought out an amendment that would have been great \nto have. It allowed parents to choose their school regardless of \nwhether it is public or private.\n  Education union leaders had kittens about that, saying: The public \nschools are getting better, and so we don't want to take funds away \nfrom those public schools; we want to keep all of the funds in the \npublic schools.\n  The parents are saying: I understand that school is going to get \nbetter someday, but my child is there right now.\n  Certain leaders in schools will say: We cannot have Federal funds \nmoved to follow the child.\n  I would say: Would you allow the parent to help that child have the \none shot they are going to get to get an education and allow them to \nchoose where they want to go?\n  That is why I am also a supporter of things such as the DC \nopportunity scholarships that will allow children in Washington, DC, to \nbe able to choose the school they attend. The President has fought \nadamantly against that. So have the education unions. Quite frankly, \nthe parents here in DC want to have the option to send their child \nanywhere they choose to send them.\n  I would like to see more reductions in duplication of education \nprograms. There is real reduction in that in this particular bill, but \nI would like to see even more. We have education programs in the \nDepartments of Defense and Ag and Health and Human Services and \nmultiple other places scattered around the bureaucracy. We need to be \nable to shrink all of those different programs and to be able to make \nsure that we are not feeding the bureaucracy but that we are actually \nhelping kids.\n\n  I would actually like to see more in this bill dealing with options \nfor those who are homeless. This bill helps us get a better count and \nbetter insight on the educational quality and the graduation rate for \nhomeless and foster children. But I would like to have greater \nflexibility built into this bill, which I did not get. I would like the \nparents and the people in the local district to be able to have better \ndecisionmaking capability.\n  What did I get? There are some things we won in this bill. There are \nno common core mandates. I can assure you, in my State of Oklahoma, \nmost every person in my State stands and cheers when they find out one \nthing: that there are no common core mandates in this. There are no \nFederal tests at all. States--my State in particular--will have \nabsolute control over standardized testing and the results of those \ntests and how they apply the information gained from those tests. The \nleaders in my State will manage that, control that, and make sure that \nis accurate for us.\n  There are no Federal education standards. There is no Federal \ncurriculum. There are reductions in some of the education programs. I \nam glad to\n\n[[Page S5121]]\n\nsee that, although, as I have already mentioned, I would like to see \nmore of that.\n  It breaks down some of the funding silos. Do you realize right now \nthat if there is money available in one silo dealing with kitchens, for \ninstance, and nutrition for school, they may allot Federal dollars and \nsay, ``You can have those Federal dollars if you want to buy a new \noven.'' But if a district says, ``We don't need more money for ovens; \nwe need money for special education,'' the Federal Government currently \nsays, ``No, you can't do that. You have to buy a new oven.'' That is \ndumb. Why don't we allow the districts to make that decision? This bill \nbegins to break down some of those funding silos, and it gives them the \nopportunity to be able to make decisions on that.\n  What I would like to see and what I did get was more local control of \neducation, dramatically increased local control, in fact, local \nauthority and additional local responsibility. That is the way it \nshould be. Inhofe and I even had a bill on local school board \nflexibility. We got good downpayment on that bill. There is more to go \non that. We need to get a chance to see additional things, but those \nare things we were able to win.\n  Can I tell you the one big thing we really won? It is that my State, \nafter this bill passes--if we can get this bill done, my State will no \nlonger have to crawl back to Washington, DC, every year and beg for a \nwaiver in education to maintain the education funding--which, by the \nway, came out of our State. Literally, the Federal taxpayers pay in \nwith their tax dollars, and the State of Oklahoma has to come crawling \nto Washington, DC, saying: Can I please have those dollars back to our \nState? Right now, we have to do that every year.\n  My State actually lost Federal control because we chose not to do \ncommon core. The Department of Education said: If you don't do this, \nthen you are going to lose your funding. For months we lost control of \nthat funding, but that was our choice because we were setting our own \nstandards. We have now won that waiver back. In fact, just a few weeks \nago, that waiver was renewed again.\n  I am already sick to death of our State having to come beg for the \nFederal dollars that we put into the system and to get permission from \nsomeone in DC. This bill finally fixes that. Does it go as far as I \nwant to go? No. I have been pretty clear about that. But it is the \nfirst step taking in our long journey towards taking us back in the \ndirection where we need to be--our schools, our parents making \ndecisions for our kids.\n  Again, I remind you, Oklahoma parents do love their kids, and \nOklahoma legislators are doing a great job of trying to turn some \nthings around in a very hard situation. Let's give them the ability to \nbe able to do that. I encourage this body to pass this education bill, \nand let's get going again towards educating our students and doing the \nright thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 20 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as folks around here know by now, I \ncome to the floor once a week to say as clearly as I can that it is \ntime to wake up to the mounting hazard of climate change. Today is the \n106th consecutive time.\n  Why do I do it? Why do I care so much? Because I know the harm we are \ncausing through carbon pollution spells trouble for my home State of \nRhode Island. I see it already. We are the Ocean State.\n  Here is a recent headline from the Washington Post: ``Human impact on \nthe oceans is growing--and climate change is the biggest culprit.''\n  But I don't have to read the Washington Post to know that. With the \nchanges from carbon pollution, our Rhode Island fishermen see strange \ncatches coming up in their nets. Our homeowners and business owners \nalong the coast see rising sea levels, worsening erosion, and extreme \nweather. It is no longer rare for extreme weather to claw people's \nhomes into the sea. Sandy took several.\n  Rhode Islanders get all of this. But unless and until the men and \nwomen in this Chamber decide to heed the warnings of all of our best \nscientists--not to mention America's insurance companies, faith \nleaders, our military leaders, virtually every big American company not \nassociated with the fossil fuel industry, and, of course, the American \npublic--Rhode Island and all States will continue to risk even worse \neffects.\n  For the fossil fuel industry, we are the best Congress money can buy. \nFor everyone else, we are a disaster.\n  Last year I went to New Hampshire to talk with people about the \nchanges they see there. I met climate scientist Dr. Cameron Wake of the \nUniversity of New Hampshire. He showed me a detailed analysis on \nclimate change in New Hampshire--what scientists have already measured \nand what projections indicate the future may hold. We had a good talk \nand after my visit he ran for me a similar analysis of climate change \nin Rhode Island.\n  This is what he found. This chart shows measurements of the average \nannual maximum temperature for three weather-monitoring stations in \nRhode Island. Block Island is in blue, Kingston is in red, and \nProvidence is in orange. It measures the highest daily temperature for \neach day, averaged over the whole year from 1895 to 2012. Let me remind \neveryone that these are measurements. This is not theory. These are \nmeasurements. This is climate change on the march in Rhode Island. What \ndoes it show? Warming. The trend is indisputable.\n  Dr. Wake's analysis shows that the average annual maximum temperature \nhas increased at a rate of 3.6 Fahrenheit per century in Block Island, \n2.8 degrees per century in Kingston, and 3.1 degrees per century in \nProvidence.\n  Dr. Wake then looked to the future of Rhode Island. This chart shows \nthe same thing we were looking at on the last chart--the average annual \nmaximum temperature. But while that one just looks backward, this one \nlooks forward. It shows two scenarios: business as usual in red or \nreduced carbon emissions in blue. It shows us, in effect, the \ndifference that cutting back on carbon pollution could make for future \ngenerations of Rhode Islanders.\n  If we do nothing to curb our carbon pollution here, the annual \naverage goes up toward 68 degrees, some years close to 70 degrees \nFahrenheit by year's end.\n  Remember the last chart, which ended around here in 2010? The \nhistorical record there ended at around 60 degrees. Carry on this flood \nof carbon pollution and here is where you end, around 8 degrees warmer \non average.\n  Between 1980 and 2010, the average annual maximum temperature of \nWashington, DC, was 68 degrees. That is the 8-degree difference. The \ndifference that this flood of carbon pollution portends is Providence \nfeeling like steamy, sweltering, Washington, DC. But if we take action \nto dial back our pollution, the warming is about half as much and less \nsevere.\n  This is not the only measure of what carbon pollution will bring to \nRhode Island. Winter temperatures going up mean fewer snow-covered \ndays. Extreme precipitation will likely increase, and as the average \nannual maximum temperature increases, there will also be more very hot \ndays in the summer.\n  This chart shows the increase in the number of days with a maximum \ntemperature above 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Hot days such as that are \ncommon here in sweltering Washington, but historically Rhode Island \nmight see maybe three 90-degree days a year. People come from all over \nto our cool, beautiful shores to swim in our cool, beautiful Atlantic.\n  This chart shows that even in the best case, Rhode Island can expect \nto see 18 such sweltering 90-degree days per year and, in the worst \ncase, that number could rise to over 50 90-degree days every year, with \nthe mercury soaring over 95 degrees Fahrenheit for 16 of those days.\n  Well, if you want to sit inside watching TV, cranking up your air \nconditioner, that may be fine, but Rhode Islanders like to go outside. \nWe enjoy the beach, and we enjoy the bay. We are not looking forward to \nwhat these temperature consequences mean for our health.\n\n[[Page S5122]]\n\n  Earlier this year, the Rhode Island Department of Health produced an \nin-depth report on heat and health in Rhode Island, concluding this: \n``The destabilizing effects of climate change on our environment are \namong the most significant potential health threats faced by \nindividuals and Rhode Island communities today.''\n  That is the official word of the Rhode Island Health Department. So \ndon't expect me to ignore this issue here because it is uncomfortable \nfor someone. Rising temperatures and extreme heat cause serious human \nhealth effects, such as dehydration, heat exhaustion. Hospitalizations \nresult and even death. The department of health projected that the \ncalculated temperature increases in Rhode Island will result in almost \n400 additional emergency room visits in the year 2022 alone and nearly \n1,400 more in 2084.\n  Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health just published a \nstudy showing that death rates among seniors in New England increased \nwhen summer temperatures rose significantly. The risk, they believe, \ncomes not only from the hotter temperatures but also from variability \nin temperatures as climate change makes the weather weirder and more \nunpredictable.\n  There is a documentary series, ``Years of Living Dangerously,'' which \nlooked at how this works, as has the Rhode Island Department of Health, \nworking with Brown University. Both found that a pronounced increase in \nemergency room visits and deaths as temperatures rise was statistically \nrelated to heat.\n  In many cases, it was not specifically indicated in the chart as \nrelated to heat. This suggests that heat-related deaths and illness may \nbe underdiagnosed if you just look at medical charts. So this is a \nsignificant health issue that we face.\n  Then there are the storms. Climate change will increase the frequency \nand intensity of extreme weather events in Rhode Island, such as \nHurricane Sandy, to the tune of $2 billion to $6 billion in Rhode \nIsland, according to one report. In a State of 1 million people, that \nis a lot of damage. The heavy rains that brought on our floods in 2010 \nwill become more frequent as well.\n  This is what our health director wrote: ``In Rhode Island, where our \neconomy, culture, and identity are all so closely tied to the ocean and \nto Narragansett Bay, the effects of climate change will be particularly \nacute.'' Again, that is the official word of our health department.\n  Climate change threatens our water systems as temperatures increase \nand as we see more intense rain events. Stormwater and sewer overflows \ncan contaminate Rhode Island coastal waters. Warmer waters can foster \nbacterial growth that can be harmful. Swimming in or consuming polluted \nwater obviously can cause illness.\n  Then there is vibrio. The world-renowned shellfish of Narragansett \nBay are becoming susceptible to a group of marine bacteria known as \nvibrio. If vibrio gets into seafood, it can be very unpleasant. \nSymptoms can be especially severe in people with compromised immune \nsystems. Rhode Island health officials now have to work with the \nState's shellfish industry, with the University of Rhode Island, and \nothers to monitor water quality and shellfish growing and harvesting \nconditions to protect this important resource.\n  These are just a few of the health threats laid out in the report. \nThe department of health is just one of many agencies and organizations \nin our State that have had to put climate action and clean energy at \nthe heart of their work as we in Congress pretend this problem does not \nexist.\n  Dozens of the most dedicated and innovative minds in our State \nrecently came to Washington for my sixth annual Rhode Island Energy and \nEnvironmental Leaders Day. Our attendees represent some of the best \nwork being done in Rhode Island to stave off the devastating effects of \nclimate change.\n  Janet Coit, our director of environmental management chairs the \nExecutive Climate Change Coordinating Council, created by our Governor \nto coordinate State agencies to address threats from climate change, \nthreats to the State's environment, the State's economy, and the \nState's people.\n  The council was established by the Resilient Rhode Island Act, passed \nby our general assembly in 2014. That law also set specific greenhouse \ngas reduction targets and incorporates consideration of climate change \neffects into the powers and duties of all State agencies. The bill's \nauthor, Representative Art Handy, also came down and joined us for the \nRhode Island Energy and Environmental Leaders Day, along with his \ncolleague Representative Carlos Tobon, a member of the Rhode Island \nHouse Committee on the Environment and Natural Resources.\n  Dennis Nixon was there. He heads Rhode Island Sea Grant at the \nUniversity of Rhode Island School of Oceanography. Sea Grant works with \nthe Rhode Island government agencies and coastal communities to support \nclimate resiliency and to protect vibrant waterfronts.\n  Marion Gold, our commissioner of the office of energy resources, was \nthere. She has advanced incentives for large and small renewable energy \ndevelopment in our State, and she has helped Rhode Island become the \nthird most energy-efficient State in the Nation.\n  Recently, we saw this report: ``Study shows Northeast states benefit \nfrom carbon cap program.'' We are a part of RGGI. Marion Gold helps \nsupervise that. It has created jobs, it has saved money. It is proving \nthat solving the carbon pollution problem is not actually a burden on \nthe economy. It is a boost to the economy.\n  One of the special breakout sessions at the Energy and Environmental \nLeaders Day focused on corporate sustainability efforts to spur \ninnovation, save money, and reduce emissions.\n  Representatives from Microsoft, Mars--the company--FedEx, and \nSchneider Electric shared their sustainability success stories. For \nthese companies, efforts to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon \nemissions are more than good intentions; they are good business.\n  Another breakout session looked at faith perspectives on \nenvironmental stewardship. Rev. Anita Schell of Rhode Island Interfaith \nPower & Light came. She works with local faith-based institutions to \nraise awareness about climate change and about safeguarding the poor of \nthe world, who are least responsible for and most vulnerable to climate \nchange. As Pope Francis gives his voice to this moral calling, these \nfaith perspectives were especially welcome.\n  Dozens of other smart, hard-working Rhode Islanders attended--too \nmany to mention them all. But I am always proud of the important work \ngoing on in Rhode Island to combat climate change. It is my inspiration \nto continue fighting for responsible action in Washington.\n  As our senior Senator Jack Reed told the group, ``Rhode Island is one \nof the leaders in the country in smart policies . . . and it's is the \nresult of the culmination of lots of individual activities.''\n  Rhode Island gets it, and we are pulling together in one direction. \nOur homes, our shores, and our way of life are at stake. We need every \nState in the Nation to join us to take this issue seriously, and we \nneed every Senator to pay attention. It is truly time to wake up.\n  I ask my colleagues here today, if this were you, if something this \nthreatening were happening to your State, would you really expect me to \nstand down because it was uncomfortable for big powerful industries and \nbig aggressive donors? You would not. You would go to war to protect \nUtah and to protect Iowa from a threat such as this.\n  So forgive me if I am impatient, but this is serious in our Ocean \nState. If your department of health projected these kinds of threats \nfor your home State people, you would be up in arms. So forgive me for \nbeing a little bit up in arms.\n  I will close with this. Look at this picture. Do you know what that \nis? That is a picture of Pluto. That is a picture of the dwarf planet \nPluto. Do you know how we got that? We got that off of NASA's New \nHorizons spacecraft. It made it to Pluto after crossing the solar \nsystem for 9\\1/2\\ years. It traveled 3 billion miles from Earth and \ncame within 8,000 miles of the surface of Pluto. It was traveling at \nmore than 31,000 miles per hour, and it took 3 minutes to cross the \nface of Pluto, where it took innumerable images and samples for our \nscientists.\n  Let me quote one of the lead scientists, whose name is Bowman, who\n\n[[Page S5123]]\n\nmanaged 1 hour of sleep in her office Monday night. She said:\n\n       I have to pinch myself. Look what we accomplished. It's \n     truly amazing humankind can go out and explore these worlds, \n     and see Pluto revealed just before our eyes. It's just \n     fantastic.\n\n  And it really is. These are American scientists who are able to run \nan American craft 3 billion miles to cross within 8,000 miles of Pluto \ntraveling 31,000 miles an hour. When those scientists from NASA tell us \nthat climate change is real, what do we have to say to them? We say \nthat they are part of a hoax.\n  Really? Is that going to be the position of Members in this body--\nthat the people driving a rover around on the surface of Mars and the \npeople who flew this New Horizons craft by Pluto don't know what they \nare talking about when they say that climate change is real?\n  We have people trying to unfund their satellites so that we don't \nhave the information to prove what is happening on climate change. Is \nthat responsible with respect to NASA?\n  A day of reckoning is going to come on this, and we had better start \ngetting this right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in 1965, Congress passed the original \nElementary and Secondary Education Act as part of President Lyndon \nJohnson's War on Poverty. The centerpiece of that law, then as now, is \ntitle I funding provided as a block grant to local school districts to \nserve children in poverty.\n\n  The assumption in 1965 was that simply providing an infusion of \nFederal cash to schools with more disadvantaged children would correct \neducational inequities compared to more affluent schools. As it turned \nout, simply providing more money didn't result in improved educational \noutcomes for disadvantaged children.\n  So every time this law came back up for reauthorization, Congress \nadded more stipulations on the use of the funds and additional programs \nthat well-meaning Members of Congress hoped would help students.\n  Meanwhile, Congress kept raising the level of funding. Over time, \nthere began to be a bipartisan realization that all this funding and \nall these programs were not resulting in improved student achievement, \nso something needed to change.\n  In this context, President Bush proposed what became the No Child \nLeft Behind Act. His original proposal promised to fundamentally change \nthe old Washington-knows-best approach to improving teaching and \nlearning.\n  The theory was that we would cut the Federal strings that tied the \nhands of local administrators and teachers, allowing them to focus on \nteaching kids. In return, the law would require greater accountability \nin terms of student achievement outcomes.\n  However, the final compromise that passed Congress included a very \ndetailed one-size-fits-all assessment and accountability system, but \nnot the degree of local freedom that many had hoped for.\n  In retrospect, I think most people believe the focus on achievement \nfor all students was positive. But like with many Federal laws, how it \nworked in practice didn't live up to the good intentions.\n  The reality is that the new federally mandated accountability system \nincluded required interventions that were cooked up in Washington and \ndesigned for big city failing school districts. These were not a good \nfit for communities in Iowa and many other States. Moreover, they set a \nnew precedent for Federal intervention into how local schools are run.\n  Secretary Duncan took this a step further through the Race to the Top \nprogram and his abuse of the Federal waiver authority by adding \nconditions found nowhere in law. He used these tools to coerce States \ninto adopting his preferred policies. These included new, even more \nheavy-handed mandates regarding reorganizing local schools, specific \nmethods for schools to evaluate their teachers, and most infamously, \npushing States to adopt the common core standards.\n  I believe these actions go well beyond any authority Congress gave \nthe Secretary of Education, and I told him so in a letter when he \ndenied Iowa's waiver. This should be a warning to Congress that if you \ngive an inch, Federal officials might just take a mile.\n  The high-stakes system in No Child Left Behind also created negative \nincentives for schools to focus on getting passing test scores rather \nthan meeting the individual learning needs of each student.\n  For instance, I have had a concern for a long time in how Federal \neducation policy affects gifted and talented students. The exclusive \nfocus on bringing struggling students up to some minimum level means \nthat we are setting our sights on mediocrity.\n  Left out of this equation are gifted students, including those from \ndisadvantaged backgrounds, who have enormous potential but need to be \nchallenged to reach that potential.\n  At the end of the day, the goal of making sure all students are \nreceiving a quality education is a good one, but the record of \nWashington's intervention in this issue has not been a success. It is \ntime for Congress to take a step back and have a little humility. We \ndon't know what's best for every child in every school. We can't design \na single national education system that can meet the individual needs \nof children we will never meet.\n  Our Founding Fathers designed a federal system of government for a \nreason. The principle of federalism is that decisions should be made at \nthe level of government as close as practicable to the people those \ndecisions impact.\n  When it comes to education, no one has a greater stake in educational \ndecisions, or knows better what is right for a specific child, then \nthat child's parents. As a result, parents should have maximum control \nover their child's education. When governments make decisions that \nimpact education, it should be at a level of government as close as \npossible to the parents and children who are affected.\n  The Every Child Achieves Act is a step in that direction. It \neliminates the very specific mandates on States requiring that they \nevaluate schools based on test scores and apply federally designed \ninterventions. States will be free to design their own assessment and \naccountability systems.\n  The bill retains the requirement that States test annually in grades \n3-8, which I understand was necessary to get a bipartisan agreement. \nHowever, States will have wide discretion in how they design their \nassessments. And, the elimination of the federally mandated school \ninterventions that raise the stakes on the test results will reduce \nteaching to the test.\n  This bill also consolidates Federal funding in a way that provides \nmore latitude to local school districts to better meet their individual \nneeds, although less so than in the House- passed bill. By contrast, \nthe Obama administration's blueprint for reauthorizing the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act called for replacing the current set of \nFederal mandates with a new set of Federal mandates. What the President \nproposes would include even more intrusive, mandatory Federal \ninterventions for certain schools.\n  It also proposed a series of new Federal competitive grants with \nbroad purposes, which puts smaller rural schools at a disadvantage and \ngives the Secretary of Education an inappropriate degree of control \nover which schools get funding for which purposes. Moreover, the \nPresident's blueprint proposes tying Federal education funds to the \nadoption of State content standards that are ``college and career \nready,'' which is code for common core.\n  In short, the Obama blueprint would have essentially ratified this \nadministration's heavy-handed intrusions into how and what students are \ntaught and enabled further Federal overreach.\n  The Every Child Achieves Act represents a rejection of that approach \nand an admission that the model of Federal control of local schools has \nnot worked. As a result, President Obama has said he cannot support the \nbill as it stands unless it adds back more power for the Secretary. \nThat position flies in the face of what I hear from Iowa educators and \nparents.\n  In fact, this bill quite intentionally tightens up some of the \nlanguage in current law to prevent future overreach by the Secretary of \nEducation. For instance, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act has \nalways required States to develop a State plan to show how it will \ncomply with the law in order to get Federal funding.\n\n[[Page S5124]]\n\n  Under current law, the Secretary of Education is charged with \napproving the plan unless it does not meet the requirements of the law. \nThat should be sufficient to tell the Secretary that he must approve a \nplan so long as it complies with the law.\n  However, given the current Secretary's track record, the language in \nthis bill is more explicit. It requires the Secretary to deem a State \nplan approved within 90 days of its submission unless he can provide a \ndetailed description of the specific requirements in law that the State \ndid not comply with. It then lists three pages of explicit limitations \non the Secretary's authority describing what he cannot consider in \nevaluating a State plan. That is then followed by a rule reemphasizing \nthat the Secretary cannot require anything at all from States beyond \nwhat is in the law.\n  This bill also voids any conditions attached to waivers already \ngranted by the Secretary of Education and prohibits the attaching of \nany new ones in the future.\n  I am also glad that this bill includes very comprehensive language I \nworked on with Senator Roberts to explicitly shut off all the avenues \nthis administration has used to coerce States to adopt the common core \nstandards. This will free States to adopt whatever content standards \nthey choose based on the input from their citizens without Federal \ncoercion or fear of Federal repercussions.\n  Too often, Congress passes vague laws that delegate excessive \ndiscretion to Federal agencies to fill in the blanks. This bill is an \nimprovement over the standard practice. It makes congressional intent \nmore clear and fills in many gaps to ensure that the Department \nimplements the law as intended rather than based on the whims of the \nSecretary.\n  Some bipartisan compromise is necessary for any bill to pass the \nSenate, and like any compromise, most people can find some things they \ndon't like in this bill. Some Senators feel this bill goes too far in \nreducing the Federal role in education and some Senators feel it \ndoesn't go far enough. I am one of those Senators who would prefer to \nsee a maximum degree of State and local control and I voted for \namendments to that effect.\n  However, the Every Child Achieves Act is a step in the direction of \nreducing Federal control on local schools so teachers can teach and \nparents know who to hold accountable for decisions that affect their \nchildren. Given the current mess with an unworkable law on the books, \nmany States ceding control over major policies to Washington in return \nfor a waiver, and an unprecedented degree of Federal intervention into \nwhat happens in neighborhood schools, it is overdue for Congress to \nact. Local schools can do more when Washington does less. Let's give \nthem that chance.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/senate-section/article/S5124-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5124-S5125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to talk about our education \nsystem--why it is not working and what we can do to fix it.\n  Ensuring every child in this country gets a high-quality education is \ncritical to our country's future. Education remains the primary tool to \nobtaining a good-paying job and building a middle-class life. But too \nmany children are not getting the education they need to succeed in the \n21st century workforce.\n  Nearly 20 percent of students don't graduate from high school. For \nHispanic and African-American students, the dropout rate is nearly 25 \nand 30 percent, respectively.\n  Hundreds of thousands of high-skilled jobs remain unfilled, and too \nmany Americans find themselves stuck in low-wage jobs that can't \nsupport their families. Simply put, our education system is failing our \nchildren.\n  There are a number of reasons for this. Our education system is one-\nsize-fits-all. Teachers are forced to teach to the test and our schools \nare not equipped with support services to address the many issues that \nprevent children from learning.\n  In my view, the main reason we are falling short is that our \neducation system is one-size-fits-all, which doesn't work in education. \nStudents learn differently. Some flourish in large settings and others \nin small settings with more teacher attention.\n  Students have varied needs based on where they live. Do they live in \na rural area, suburb or city? What is their economic status? Is their \nfamily living in poverty? How is their home life? Are they raised in a \nsingle parent household? What are their individual interests? Do they \nlike art and music? Or are they more interested in science and \ntechnology?\n  A child who comes from an affluent home in the suburbs learns \ndifferently from a child living in poverty in a city. Both children can \nlearn--if the right approach for each child is taken. We need to give \nStates and local school districts more flexibility to do what is right \nfor their students.\n  Teaching to the test is another problem that plagues our education \nsystem. When the emphasis is placed on memorization rather than \ncomprehension, or answering essay questions with a formula rather than \nreasoning and critical thinking, students are not actively engaged in \nlearning.\n  Students fail to gain the comprehension and critical thinking skills \nneeded in college and to be successful in the workplace. That is a big \nreason why up to 60 percent of students who enroll in college need to \ntake remedial English and math classes. Schools need to be places where \nchildren learn, not where children memorize.\n  A child's life outside of school has a tremendous effect on his or \nher ability to succeed in school. Does a child get enough to eat at \nhome? Are a child's parents working multiple jobs to pay the bills? Is \nthere violence in the home? Is a child homeless?\n  Our schools are not equipped with the support services they need, \nsuch as mental health professionals and basic health care services that \nhelp to address the issues that prevent children from learning.\n  The good news is that we have solutions to these problems. They are \nin place, and they need to be implemented on a larger scale.\n  During the 2013-2014 school year, California implemented its local \ncontrol funding formula, which targets State funding for poor students, \nstudents of color, students with disabilities, foster youth, and \nEnglish learners.\n  Under this new formula, local districts can use that funding to teach \nthese students in the way that best works for them. It has made a \ndifference. For example, San Diego Unified School District plans to \nreduce class sizes from a 25-to-1 to a 22-to-1 student teacher ratio in \n29 of the most disadvantaged schools.\n  The district also plans to look at resource equity and provide \nexpanded access to counseling services and additional services for \nEnglish learners and students with disabilities.\n  We also need to expand charter schools and provide continued support \nto existing, high-quality charter schools. Charter schools tailor \ninstruction to each student and are not bound by traditional school \ndistrict requirements.\n  Every child deserves a quality education, and many children who \nstruggle in underperforming schools go on to flourish in charter \nschools. Here are just a couple of examples from California:\n  Nolan from East Los Angeles was reading below grade level when he \nenrolled in a charter school. Within 6 months, he had advanced two \ngrade levels.\n  Trina, a seventh grader in the Bay area, stated:\n\n       I think KIPP teachers are extremely important because they \n     teach us everything we need to know to reach our goal of \n     climbing the mountain to college. I can remember back to my \n     very first day as a KIPPster. We learned that we would need \n     to ``work hard'' and ``be nice.'' Working hard meant that in \n     our English classes we would be reading and writing every \n     day. When I came to KIPP, I found out that I was at a second \n     grade reading level in the fifth grade! I was shocked, so I \n     worked hard and got to the sixth grade reading level by the \n     end of the year.\n\n  Parents desperately want opportunities for their children, and \nunfortunately the demand for charter schools remains much higher than \nthe supply. Currently in California, approximately 150,000 students are \non waiting lists. We need to continue to invest in the expansion and \ndevelopment of charter schools so more children receive the education \nthey deserve now.\n  Providing support services to at-risk students has also proven to be \nsuccessful. If students are less worried about\n\n[[Page S5125]]\n\nmeeting their basic needs and everything that goes on in their lives \noutside of school, they can learn.\n  The Monarch School for homeless students in San Diego is a great \nexample of this. It provides food, clothing, counseling, health care, \nand transportation to its students. And more than 90 percent of \ngraduates go to college or pursue vocational training. We need to fund \nthese kinds of support services in schools where children need them the \nmost. We know that they work.\n  Education remains the great equalizer in this country, but we have \nfailed in giving all of our children access to the quality education \nthey deserve. By directing extra resources where they are needed most \nand giving schools the ability to do what is right for their students, \nwe can turn things around--for our children and our country.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, today I recognize the life and \nlegacy of Arkansas outdoorsman, tourism advocate, and business owner \nJim Gaston.\n  Jim spent his life as a champion of the Arkansas outdoors--sharing \nhis passion of Mother Nature's landscape, wildlife and recreation, and \nhelped paved the path for the Arkansas tourism industry.\n  Jim inherited the family business, Gaston's White River Resort, in \nhis early 20s when his dad passed away. He saved the property from \nforeclosure and turned the six cottages and six boats into the premier \ndestination for anglers and tourists that it is known as today. Under \nJim's leadership, the resort grew into a 400-acre property with 79 \ncottages along 2 miles of river frontage in addition to a restaurant, \nconference center and other amenities.\n  As a regular fixture on the White River for more than seven decades, \nhe saw a lot of improvements, often because of his own contributions. \nHis advocacy of minimum flow helped provide a steady stream of water in \nthe river and create the habitat trout need to survive--boosting \nArkansas's trout fishing and tourism industry.\n  Jim was a strong voice for Arkansas tourism locally, regionally, and \nstatewide. He was a lifetime member of the Arkansas Department of Parks \nand Tourism Commission. He served in numerous leadership positions to \npromote tourism throughout the State including president of the \nArkansas Tourism Development Foundation and Arkansas Hospitality \nAssociation. In 2010, Jim Gaston was named the Arkansas Business \nExecutive of the Year and will be awarded the Legacy Award at this \nyear's Arkansas Game & Fish Foundation Outdoor Hall of Fame Awards.\n  Jim truly transformed Arkansas. His contribution is commemorated in \nthe James A. Gaston Visitor Center, a multi-million dollar facility \nthat teaches about the rivers he loved his entire life.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to Jim's wife Jill and the entire \nGaston family. I humbly offer my appreciation and gratitude for his \ncontributions to the State of Arkansas, his friendship, and many great \nmemories that I will cherish forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/senate-section/article/S5125-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING ARKANSAS FARM BUREAU FARM FAMILIES\n\n Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I would like to recognize six \nArkansas families who recently were named finalists for the Arkansas \nFarm Bureau Farm Family of the Year. Their hard work, dedication, and \npassion have been instrumental not only in the success of their \nindividual farms but our State's agriculture industry as a whole, the \nlargest industry in Arkansas.\n  The Arkansas Farm Family of the Year program is the longest running \nprogram of its kind in the country. Each year a panel of judges selects \nfamilies who demonstrate outstanding efforts in production, \nconservation of energy and resources, and leadership in agricultural \nand family affairs. This year's finalists are John and Mikki Hamilton \nof Searcy, Allen and Melissa Glidewell of St. Joe, the Wildy Family \nFarms in Manila, Brent and Ronda Butler of Siloam Springs, the Fueller \nfamily of Poplar Grove, Phil and Lesia Hamaker of Junction City, Billy \nand Charlotte Wilchman of Cleveland, and Roy and Carolyn Ham of \nArkadelphia.\n  These eight families farm a wide variety of crops, including cotton, \ncorn, soybeans, tomatoes, strawberries, peanuts, rice, poultry, and \ncattle. Growing up on our family farm in Dardanelle, I learned it takes \nthe whole family to make a farm successful. I want to thank not only \nthese couples but also their children for the sacrifices they have made \nand the importance they place on the agriculture industry in the \ncommunity and State. Congratulations on this well-deserved \nrecognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/senate-section/article/S5125-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING DARYLE HOLLOWAY\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to honor the memory of \nOfficer Daryle Holloway, a 22-year veteran of the New Orleans Police \nDepartment who was killed in the line of duty Saturday, June 20, 2015.\n  In 1992, Officer Holloway joined the New Orleans Police Department \nafter graduating from St. Augustine High School. Throughout his career, \nhe asked to remain a patrol officer in order to better interact with \nthe residents of district 5 of New Orleans. Known for his sunny \ndisposition, sincerity, and good nature, Officer Holloway truly cared \nabout the neighborhoods he protected.\n  Following the levee breaches after Hurricane Katrina, Officer \nHolloway remained in the city providing security at Charity Hospital. \nLater he performed water rescue missions, bravely rescuing numerous \npeople trapped in their homes or on their rooftops.\n  Besides his duty as a police officer, Officer Holloway remained an \nardent supporter of his high school alma mater, St. Augustine, where he \nvolunteered as a mentor to troubled students and continued to be a \nvaluable part of the all-boys Catholic high school.\n  For the past 22 years, Officer Holloway served the citizens of New \nOrleans, LA, with his professionalism, skill, enthusiasm, and \nleadership. He selflessly served his community as a guardian, mentor, \nand father of three children, Kalia, Cydni, and Dillion. It is with a \nheavy heart that I honor the esteemed life and career of Officer Daryle \nHolloway. I thank him for his years of service to our State and country \nand pray for his family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/senate-section/article/S5125-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/senate-section/article/S5125-5", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5125-S5126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting nominations \nwhich were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S5126]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/senate-section/article/S5126-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:28 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 251.

A bill to enhance tribal road safety, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about legislation \nI introduced that will improve safety on roads across Indian Country. \nRoads and bridges in Indian Country are in desperate need of \nimprovement.\n  According to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, only 17 percent of the \nroads are considered to be in acceptable condition. The remainder are \nconsidered to be in poor and unacceptable condition and many are simply \nunpaved. According to the National Congress of American Indians, \n``These roads are among the most underdeveloped and unsafe road \nnetworks in the Nation, even though they are the primary means of \naccess'' throughout these tribal communities. The Centers for Disease \nControl lists motor vehicle crashes as the leading cause of death for \nNative American children. Meanwhile, Indian infants, under the age of 1 \nyear old, are eight times more likely to die in a vehicle-related crash \nthan other children.\n  That is why I am introducing the Tribal Infrastructure and Roads \nEnhancement and Safety Act, or TIRES Act for short. The TIRES Act \nsupports increasing the safety of roads throughout Indian Country by: \nstreamlining the process to start and complete safety projects, \nincreasing available funding for tribal road programs, and reinstating \nthe tribal facility bridge program. This legislation will reduce the \nadministrative fees that the Bureau of Indian Affairs charges tribes \nfor road work and will speed up the time such projects take to get \napproved.\n  The TIRES Act also commissions two important road safety studies. In \none study, the Department of Interior, in consultation with the \nDepartment of Transportation and other relevant Federal agencies, will \nexamine the quality of transportation safety data collected. Such a \nstudy can benefit tribes by finding ways to prevent future car crashes \nand recover damages caused by motorists on roads on Indian \nreservations. The second study will examine and identify ways to \nimprove safety on all public roads on Indian reservations.\n  The number of lives lost on roads in Indian Country is far too high. \nSomething needs to be done and this bill is a good first step towards \nimproving safety on the roads in tribal communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/15/senate-section/article/S5131-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2256.
