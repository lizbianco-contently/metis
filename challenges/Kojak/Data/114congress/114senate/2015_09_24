Mr. President, today Members of Congress from both Houses \nwere honored to attend a joint meeting of Congress and receive an \naddress from His Holiness Pope Francis, the 266th Pope of the Catholic \nChurch.\n  The Holy Father's visit to address a joint meeting was made possible \nby the foresight and efforts of Speaker John Boehner, as well as the \nhard work and dedication of the House and the Senate Sergeant at Arms \nand the entire congressional community. Everything worked out just \nfine. Pope Francis captured the heart and consciousness of the world \nwith his message of love, compassion, respect, and good will to all.\n  Sitting and listening to the speaker of the day, His Holiness Pope \nFrancis, I am told this is the longest he has ever spoken at one time \nin English. He spoke slowly, and we had to listen very closely. So I \nwent back and got a copy of the speech so I could read in my own slow \nway what he had said. A few things he said were really stunning. ``You \nare called''--he is talking to us--``to defend and preserve the dignity \nof your fellow citizens in the tireless and demanding pursuit of the \ncommon good, for this is the chief aim of all politics.'' Gee, that is \ngood.\n  He said that he wanted to enter into a dialogue with the many \n``elderly persons who are a storehouse of wisdom forged by \nexperience.''\n  He said:\n\n       A delicate balance is required to combat violence \n     perpetrated in the name of religion, an ideology or an \n     economic system, while also safeguarding religious freedom, \n     intellectual freedom and individual freedoms. . . . We know \n     that in the attempt to be freed of the enemy without, we can \n     be tempted to feed the enemy within.\n\n  These are visionary words.\n  He said that ``the voice of faith'' needs to ``continue to be heard, \nfor it is a voice of fraternity and love,'' which brings out the best \nin each society. We need more people speaking out just as he did about \nthe importance of faith.\n  He said:\n\n       If politics must truly be at the service of the human \n     person, it follows that it cannot be a slave to the economy \n     and finance. . . . We, the people of this continent, are not \n     fearful of foreigners, because most of us were once \n     foreigners.\n\n  Now, I am not taking this line by line. I am just skipping through \nsome things that stuck out in my mind.\n\n       If we want security, let us give security; if we want life, \n     let us give life; if we want opportunities, let us provide \n     opportunities. . . . Why are deadly weapons being sold to \n     those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and \n     society.\n\n  He said, ``Fundamental relationships are being called into question, \nas is the very basis of . . . the family.''\n  I was so impressed with the intent of his remarks. I thought he did \nan extremely good job, and I am very happy that I had the opportunity \nto be there and listen. I admire the conviction and heart of His \nHoliness because it brings every effort of what we do, I think, to the \nforefront of what we try to do, to live up to what he suggests we \nshould do. He inspired me, I hope all of us, with his commitment to \ncompassion and consideration for the less fortunate.\n  I am certain this should come as a shock to no one, given his humble \nbeginnings. He was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to immigrant \nparents. Pope Francis worked as a janitor, a bouncer, a lab assistant \nfor a chemist before he started his seminary education. Since the \nbeginning of his papacy, Pope Francis has committed to addressing the \nneeds of the poor, extending mercy to those in need, and restoring joy \nto the world.\n  Pope Francis was once asked about his view of the church. He said \nthat he viewed the church as ``a field hospital after battle.'' His \nunique approach to leading the world's 1.2 billion Catholics has \ncaptured the attention of billions, Catholic and non-Catholic alike, \ninspiring us all to live up to our highest values.\n  I was forced to remember today my mentor from my high school days to \nmy time in Congress, who became the\n\n[[Page S6910]]\n\nGovernor of Nevada. We ran independent of one another. We wound up \nbeing Governor and Lieutenant Governor. He was a devout Catholic. The \nvalues he instilled in me stemmed from his faith. He was the most \nhonest man I ever met. He was a devout Catholic, as I indicated. He \nwent to mass virtually every day.\n  He died--every place he went, it was early. He got to morning mass, 7 \no'clock mass, early. It had not started. The priest had not come out \nyet. He put his head on his shoulder and died. He was such a good man. \nThose of us who knew him--and so many people knew him--know that he \nwould have enjoyed living in a time where His Holiness is known not \njust for his influence, knowledge, and righteousness but for his good \ndeeds and kindness to those in need. My friend Mike O'Callaghan had a \nlot of those same traits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/senate-section/article/S6910-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GOVERNMENT FUNDING\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in just 6 days, the government will shut \ndown unless we figure out some way to fund it. We know how it should be \nfunded. But instead of voting today on a bipartisan way forward, we \nwill still have another failed vote, even though the Senate has already \nspoken on this issue. Instead of using the Senate's precious time to \navoid a shutdown, Republicans are causing us to move forward on another \nsquandered vote.\n  Republicans should abandon their commitment to fruitless votes and \npass a clean funding bill to keep the government open. As reported in \nthe press, there is a conversation going on now with the White House \nand with the House and Senate leaders to have funding until the end of \nthe year, not for a few weeks, not for a few months. I think we have \ndone our part over on this side of the aisle. We communicated our \npriorities and tried to sit down at the negotiating table, ready to \nkeep the government open.\n  Inserting into this debate a meaningless, losing attack on women is \njust a waste of time, but they have decided--they the Republicans have \ndecided--once again to place partisan, ideological agendas over the \nwell-being of the Nation. To drag this partisan attack on any further \nwhen we are facing a government shutdown is not responsible. The \nRepublicans should change their tactics. When Republicans gained \ncontrol of the Senate, we were told that there would be no government \nshutdowns. But do we need the fear of a government shutdown? Shutting \ndown is bad, the threat of a shutdown is not good, but here we stand, \ndays before funding for the government expires, wasting time on \npublicity stunts.\n  Every moment Republicans squander on pointless votes brings us closer \nto an unfunded Federal Government. Wasting time also leads to a void \nfor shutdown advocates. Just last night, all over the news, it was \nreported that the junior Senator from Texas is going to extreme lengths \nto undermine the complete funding of our government. He is circulating \na letter seeking support for a failed strategy that can only have one \noutcome: a government shutdown.\n  I would hope my Republican colleagues will not join in that, not for \na minute, not for any period of time. I say to my friends from the \nother side of the aisle: Stop this brinksmanship. Instead, work with \nDemocrats to ensure we have an open, funded government serving the \nAmerican people.\n  I see there are Senators on the floor.

Scott\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Elder Richard \nG. Scott, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church \nof Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who passed away September 22, \n2015, at the age of 86.\n  Richard G. Scott had the razor-sharp mind of an engineer, fused with \nthe tender softness of a disciple's soul.\n  A graduate of George Washington University in mechanical engineering, \nwho did post-graduate training in nuclear engineering, he had a \nbrilliant mind with an uncanny capacity for formulas, projections, and \ncalculations. Yet he became known throughout the world for an enormous \nheart with an equally uncanny capacity to love and to have empathy for \npeople from every walk of life.\n  Elder Scott's gentle voice invited all who had lost their way, who \nhad given up hope or had wandered far to come home, home to the faith, \nfamily, and community that would bring them real peace and lasting, \ngenuine joy.\n  Countless individuals around the world heard his invitation to come \nhome and rightly felt that he was talking directly to them. Ever in \nsearch of the one who was lost--Elder Scott's words and witness of \nJesus Christ served as the lower lights upon the shore to gently guide \nmany a wanderer home.\n\n  Elder Scott had an extraordinary depth of empathy, particularly for \nthose who silently suffered and anxiously sought for relief, \nredemption, and renewal in the midst of life's storms. He, himself, was \na man acquainted with grief, having lost two young children and later \nhis wife Jeanene to untimely deaths. He also seemed to intimately \nunderstand the feelings of deep discouragement, overwhelming \nuncertainty, as well as the crushing avalanche of personal inadequacy \nthat can descend upon the human soul during difficult days and trying \ntimes. Yet he continually stood as a beacon of hope to those who \nstruggled because he knew with an absolute certainty to what source we \nshould look for strength and security during such days and at such \ntimes.\n  His complete love for and belief in the divine potential of each and \nevery soul led him to speak plainly, powerfully, and often with tender, \nheartfelt, personal feelings. He urged the struggling as well as the \nfaithful to cast aside any behavior, habit or belief that weighed them \ndown or kept them from living up to their full potential. Members of \nthe LDS Church all around the world often felt, as they watched him \nspeak, that he was not only speaking specifically to them but also that \nhe was looking straight into their souls. In truth, he was just \nspeaking with such love, empathy, and genuine compassion that he \nempowered his listeners to look into their own hearts and see what \ntheir Savior saw in them.\n  Elder Scott saw people not for where they were currently positioned \non the road of life but for the potential each person had to do, be, \nand become more. He once declared: ``We become what we want to be by \nconsistently being what we want to become each day.''\n  Elder Scott's vision extended far beyond the struggles of mortality; \nhe focused on raising our sights to higher things, grander places, and \nmore noble thoughts.\n\n[[Page S6911]]\n\n  The role of the family as the bulwark of society was paramount in his \nlife and teachings. Elder Scott often expressed his belief in the \nunparalleled power and influence that a man and a woman, equally yoked \nas husband and wife, could have on children and communities. He taught \nthat in marriage oneness is not sameness and of the vital importance of \nvaluing our differences. To illustrate, he once declared: ``I may not \nknow what it means to be a woman, but I do know what it means to be \ntaught by one and to love one with all my heart and all my soul.'' His \nlove for his wife Jeanene was legendary and was forever sprinkled into \nhis sermons. I take comfort in knowing that after nearly 20 years, \nElder Scott has gone to that Heavenly home he so often pointed to and \nis once again united with Jeanene.\n  One of Elder Scott's colleagues described him as a clever teacher. \nHis formula for teaching was not of the engineering variety but rather \nfollowed a pattern described in a hymn by Lorin Wheelwright entitled \n``Help Me Teach with Inspiration,'' which says:\n\n       Help me teach with inspiration; Grant this blessing, Lord, \n     I pray.\n       Help me lift a soul's ambition To a higher, nobler way.\n       Help me reach a friend in darkness; Help me guide him thru \n     the night.\n       Help me show thy path to glory By the Spirit's holy light.\n       Help me find thy lambs who wander; Help me bring them to \n     thy keep.\n       Teach me, Lord, to be a shepherd; Father, help me feed thy \n     sheep.\n\n  Elder Richard G. Scott was indeed an inspired teacher, a leader, and \nlifter of people. His amazing mind and compassionate soul enabled him \nto help engineer a path for all of us to return home.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEE. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I just wish to second what has been said \nabout Elder Scott and appreciate the Senator from Arizona--or Utah, \ntaking the time to say it.\n  One of my fondest memories of being in Congress was at one point \nshowing Elder Scott around a bit of the Capitol. He knew it well. He \nhad been here before, but it was my privilege and honor to be with him \nat that time. It has been my privilege and honor over many years to \nhear him at general conference and other venues exhorting people to \nfollow the example of Christ and to love their families, love their \nwives. To see him pass now after such dedicated service for so long, it \nis truly wonderful for him to be reunited with his wife and for his \nfamily to reflect on a life of service.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments and wished to add my own.\n  I yield back.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nArizona for his kind remarks regarding Elder Scott. I would also \nremark, just briefly, that my late father, himself an Arizonan, would \nbe pleased to hear me referred to as a Senator from Arizona, given that \nI was born there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I think many of us today have been struck \nwith a serious case of deja vu because once again, with a government \nshutdown looming, some Republicans continue to pander to their base \nwith a political show vote instead of working with Democrats to prevent \na budget crisis. Once again, it is women's health that is being used as \na tea party political football, with Republicans attempting to cut off \nwomen's access to care, and once again workers and families across our \ncountry are watching Congress and wondering whether their elected \nofficials can do the absolute bare minimum.\n  The government shutdown that Republicans pushed us into in 2013 did \nnothing to help them repeal the Affordable Care Act, but it did have \nreal consequences for families and communities we represent. Workers \ndidn't know when they would get their next paycheck. Businesses felt \nthe sting of fewer customers. Families across the country lost even \nmore trust that elected officials in Washington, DC, could get anything \ndone.\n  In my home State of Washington, thousands of employees at Joint Base \nLewis-McChord were sent home with no return in sight. Startups couldn't \nget small business loans, national parks such as Mount Rainier shut \ndown. It kept families away from true national treasures and customers \naway from small businesses that rely on their tourism.\n  After all of that, I had hoped Republicans would learn their lesson, \nespecially because once that economy-rattling exercise in futility came \nto an end, I was proud to work with the Republican budget chairman, \nPaul Ryan, to do what we shouldn't have needed a shutdown to get done--\nnegotiate a 2-year bipartisan deal that prevented another government \nshutdown. It restored critical investments in priorities such as \neducation, research, and defense jobs and showed our families that \ngovernment can get something done when both sides are willing to come \nto the table and compromise.\n  That deal was an important reminder that governing by crisis simply \ndoes not work. Unfortunately, now it seems that some of my Republican \ncolleagues have forgotten that, because instead of working across the \naisle on another bipartisan budget deal, as Democrats have pushed them \nto do for months, some Republicans are once again using a looming \nfiscal deadline as an opportunity to pander to their base, no matter \nwhat that means for our workers and families who are wondering whether \ngovernment will still be running in a few days.\n  Since they clearly need another reminder, attacking women's health \ndoes not keep the government open and these shutdown threats will not \nwork. It didn't work in 2011, when House Republicans tried to defund \nPlanned Parenthood in the budget at the very last minute. It didn't \nwork in 2013, when extreme Members of the GOP were dead set on \nrepealing ObamaCare, and they will not work today.\n  I am going to be proud to vote against this partisan attempt to \ndefund Planned Parenthood and take critical health care services away \nfrom millions of people.\n  Then I hope that finally Republicans will remember what they should \nhave learned last Congress: accept that enough is enough and make sure \nthat women, workers, families, and our economy are protected from a \ncompletely unnecessary crisis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, since February I have been coming to the \nSenate floor every week to talk about the waste of the week.\n  Back in 2010, when I made the decision to answer a call to run for \nthe Senate again, one of the primary reasons for my decision to go \nforward was my alarm over the plunge into debt and rising deficit that \nwas taking place. At the time, the national debt of this country was a \nlittle over $10 trillion. It is alarming to note that as I stand here 5 \nyears later, our debt has nearly doubled. It's over $18 trillion in \njust the 5 years I have been here.\n  There were alarm bells ringing in 2010, and those alarm bells were \nsaying that we cannot stay on this course, that it is going to come \nback to haunt us someday, that it will affect our economy, that it will \naffect our credit rating. Someday the bill collector will be at the \ndoor of the taxpayer saying: You have to pay up big time or we are \ngoing to go into default.\n  What took place going forward from that was a series of efforts--some \nof them very equally bipartisan by both Republicans and Democrats who \nwere alarmed at where we were and wishing to come together to persuade \nthe President to work with us and put us on a path toward fiscal \nresponsibility. That work involved any number of proposals and \niterations. We all remember the so-called Gang of 6, the Committee of \n12, the Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction, and various others who \nhad plans. It was the dominating issue of our time during the first \ncouple of years of my return here in 2011 and 2012.\n  After the election of 2012, when the President was reelected, at his \nown initiative he reached out to a few Republicans--I was one of them--\nand said: I am willing to sit down and work together to deal with this. \nThis is a\n\n[[Page S6912]]\n\nmajor issue affecting the future of our country, affecting our economy.\n  I was encouraged that after the election and when no longer seeking \nany further office, the President would be willing to seriously work \nwith us. We did serious work for several months. The President's top \nthree appointees--the head of the Office of Management and Budget, his \nChief of Staff, and his political director--met with eight of us on a \nregular basis, both here in the Capitol and at the White House. We had \nagreed we would not have any public meetings. We would not have staff. \nIt would just be Members and the President's designated individuals. We \ndid not broadcast what we were doing because we knew it would become \npublic and then political and therefore perhaps end up with the same \nfate all the other efforts had resulted in.\n  We got to the end of that, and in the end, even though we made an \nextraordinary number of concessions to the President, even though we \nessentially had put together a package of items he himself had \nsuggested in his budget plans that we could accomplish in slowing down \nthe growth of government, the spending, and the deficits every year \nthat were rolling out and plunging us into debt, we came up short.\n  At that point, it became very clear to me that we were not going to \nbe able to achieve a long-term plan for putting us on the road to good \nfiscal health. So I thought: OK, I am hearing from a lot of colleagues \nhere in the Senate but also from other outside sources saying that \nunder sequester we just can't cut any more. We need more revenue to \nexpand necessary spending projects in government. And while some \nessential functions that only government can do might need that type of \nattention, there is a range of things that you really have to question \nwhy they are on the books in the first place.\n  A number of my colleagues--particularly former Senator Coburn--took \nthis floor often--as I did, as well as others--to point out areas where \nnot the Republican Party had decided, where not individuals \nrepresenting our party had decided, but where nonpartisan agencies of \nthe government--the General Accounting Office, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the Office of Management and Budget at the White House--had \ninvestigated and produced examples of spending that were either waste, \nfraud, or abuse, and had no legitimate qualification to stay on the \nbooks.\n  So we started looking into this. Thanks to Senator Coburn and others, \nwe have come up with a number of things we could easily take off the \nbooks, easily use to pay for essential things, easily use to reduce our \ndeficit spending, keep from going into debt, return money to the \ntaxpayers, or however we wanted to do it. So we started to accumulate \nthat, and our goal was to reach $100 billion to simply defy the myth \ngoing around that there is not a penny we can cut and that we have done \nall we can do.\n  So over the 20-some times I have been on this floor, we have come up \nwith a number of issues which could save the taxpayer money and \ncertainly need to be addressed. Our current total is now well over $100 \nbillion, and today we are adding $10.5 billion to our $100 billion \ntotal. We are now at $116 billion. I said we would stop at $100 \nbillion, but the examples keep rolling in, and so we are going to keep \ngoing every week. As long as this cycle of the Senate is in session, I \nwill come to the floor and label yet another example of waste.\n  Last month, when I was home in Indiana, coming down from northwest \nIndiana to our capital city of Indianapolis on Interstate 65 for the \numpteenth time--as I drive from north to south or south to north on \nthat road, I pass through wind farms of literally thousands of \nwindmills. Interestingly enough, and as I observed even this time, many \nof them are not turning. There are windmills--a few of them turning--\ndriven by the wind, but most of them are not turning. We have thousands \nof these, and it looks as if fewer than 100 or a comparable number are \noperating, and so I am wondering why and whether the taxpayer is \ngetting a good deal on this.\n  I want to give a little bit of history of how all this came to be put \nin place. Back in the early 1990s--in fact, in 1992--the Congress \npassed the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which included the renewable \nelectricity production tax credit, called the PTC. The point was that \nas we looked at alternative ways to produce electricity to reduce our \ndependence on oil and fossil fuels, there was a tax credit created for \nthose using windmills to create power. It was designed to be claimed if \nthe wind farm was actually making the power.\n  Earlier I said that many times I have come down that road and I have \nseen windmills that were idle. But the blades had to be turning and the \nelectricity had to be being produced in order to receive that tax \ncredit.\n  At the time, because I thought we were overly dependent on Middle \nEastern oil and that it was creating issues for us geopolitically and \nmilitarily and otherwise, I thought it would be good to have a stimulus \nhere to support the creation of wind energy, to give us the ability to \nstand on our own and have less dependence on Middle Eastern oil. The \nmain reason I supported it is because it was to start the process and \nincentivize diverse energy sources to get them off the ground. It was \ngoing to be a short-term boost to help these new energy sources become \ncompetitive.\n  The original credit was designed under the law to last only 5\\1/2\\ \nyears and then there would no longer be this credit. Well, like any \nother credit, subsidy, or anything else passed here which provides \ntaxpayer support for production of something, it never expires. Few if \nany of them expire on the expiration date. So once again, once you get \na law on the books, once you get a credit on the books, once you get a \nsubsidy on the books, you can't get it off.\n  Since the time the original bill passed, the wind industry and its \nsupporters have repeatedly come to Congress and said: Just give us a \nfew more years and then wind will be competitive, without taxpayer \nsubsidies.\n  As a result, this 5\\1/2\\-year program, which started in 1992, has \nbeen extended multiple times. In 2013, nearly two decades after the \ntime the subsidies expired, Congress changed the rules so the \nfacilities only have to begin construction before the expiration date \nto automatically qualify for a future 10-year subsidy, even before \nthose windmills become operational. So if someone is just in the \nbusiness of building windmills, as some of our major companies are, \nthey are going to qualify for the subsidy. They are going to get the \ntax credit--whether or not the windmills are needed. They can just pour \nsome concrete and start the building process, and they are going to \nqualify for the credit. The result is that more and more wind \nfacilities are being constructed irrespective of the needs of the \nelectricity grid or market demand.\n  Just last year, Warren Buffett, who is a smart investor, noted that \nwind isn't profitable without subsidies. He said:\n\n       For example, on wind energy, we get a tax credit if we \n     build a lot of wind farms. That's the only reason to build \n     them. They don't make sense without the tax credit.\n\n  So regardless of the demand, regardless of whether or not those \nwindmills need to be turning and generating electricity, regardless of \nwhether or not that electricity can be put into the grid--and, by the \nway, the cost of wind energy is three to four times the cost of fossil \nfuel energy--regardless of any of that, the tax credit is there.\n  In 2014 Congress retroactively extended the wind tax credit at the \nend of the year, and the general assumption here in Congress is that \nthe production tax credit will once again be extended at the end of \nthis year. That is probably going to happen.\n  According to an estimate from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on \nTaxation, if we continue and extend this tax credit, this will add \nanother $10.5 billion to our budget.\n  Clearly, it is way past time to end this seemingly never-ending \nsubsidy. It is time to give the hardworking taxpayers savings, and it \nis time to stop wasteful spending. If we can prevent Congress from just \nautomatically extending this way beyond the original 5\\1/2\\ years, \ndecades beyond, we can save the taxpayers $10.5 billion.\n  So today I am adding to this chart and picture here $10.5 billion, \nwhich now totals $116 billion-plus in terms of money that falls under \nthe category of waste, fraud, and abuse. My colleagues cannot come down \nto this floor and say we can't cut a penny more of any program and \ndefend the numerous--now\n\n[[Page S6913]]\n\nwell more than 20--examples of what have been defined as waste, fraud, \nand abuse--not by me, not by the Republican Party, but by nonpartisan \nagencies of the Federal Government.\n  There it is. Stay tuned for next week's ``Waste of the Week.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, it is time give it our best to move \nAmerica forward and give Americans a fair shot. Let's show the American \npeople that we can work across the aisle and across the dome to get the \njob done.\n  Instead, here we are facing another shutdown showdown. There is no \nreason for there to be a government shutdown. Republican leadership \ndoes not want a shutdown. Democrats don't want a shutdown. There may be \nsome drama, but we intend to keep the government open and avoid \nshutdown, slamdown politics.\n  I hoped the Senate had learned its lesson in October 2013, when \nRepublicans shut down government over the Affordable Care Act, or this \nFebruary 2015, when Republicans threatened the Department of Homeland \nSecurity with shutdown over immigration policy.\n  Senate Democrats won't be threatened and bullied into accepting \npoison pill riders. Serious policy issues like family planning and \nreproductive health deserve serious debate rather than becoming an \n``add on'' rider to a funding bill.\n  Shutdowns are bad for everyone, jeopardizing family checkbooks, \nbusiness bottom lines, and the Federal checkbook. A shutdown makes it \nimpossible for Federal agencies to meet missions that serve the \nAmerican people. A shutdown means furloughed Federal employees and \ncontractors; delayed tax returns; delayed small business loans; and \ndelayed contracts.\n  Uncertainty slows economic growth and hurts the health and well-being \nof the entire Nation. When the government was closed for 16 days in \n2013, the shutdown hurt our growing economy, sacrificing 120,000 \nprivate sector jobs. Billions of dollars of economic output was lost. \nWe lost 6.6 million work days, about 850,000 Federal employees were \nsent home.\n  My home State was hit particularly hard. Maryland is home to many \nFederal agencies. It was not just the Federal workers that got hurt. \nThe Baltimore Sun wrote about Jay Angle, the owner of Salsa Grill, a \nPeruvian restaurant in Woodlawn outside the Social Security \nAdministration. Every day, 4,700 workers go to work at Social Security, \nbut only 500 were on the job during the shutdown. Salsa Grill counts on \nthe Social Security workers as customers, but they were not there. \nThere were stories like Jay's all over the country.\n  Because of the 2013 shutdown, hundreds of patients could not enroll \nin clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health, NIH, so their \nlast chance for a miracle was delayed or denied. About 8,000 rural \nfamilies had their home loan decisions delayed, pushing the American \nDream down the road. Head Start grantees in seven States closed, \nleaving 7,200 children at home and families searching for high quality \nchild care.\n  Avoiding a shutdown is just the first step. We also need a new budget \ndeal to cancel sequester.\n  Right now our budget caps spending, but it does not cap tax breaks \nfor billionaires and corporations that send jobs overseas. Americans \nare angry. They feel the rules are rigged against them and that those \nwho write the rules don't care. But Democrats do care. We believe the \npeople deserve a government on their side.\n  That is why we are fighting to make sure the American people have a \ngovernment that works as hard as they do.\n  We have three steps to meet that goal. First, no government shutdown. \nWe need to pass a clean, short-term continuing funding resolution with \nno poison pill riders to keep the government funded and open for \nbusiness for as short a time as possible. After all, a yearlong CR just \nlocks in sequester.\n  The CR will give us time to take the second step, negotiating a new \nbudget agreement that cancels sequester and lifts the spending caps \nequally for defense and nondefense spending so we can protect our \nnational security and give the American people a fair shot.\n  After the new budget agreement is reached, we will take the third \nstep, writing and enacting an Omnibus spending bill. Remember, the \nAppropriations Committee needs 30 days to get the job done once we have \nour topline.\n  That is my plan to cancel sequester and put the American people \nfirst.\n  Why do we want to cancel sequester? Sequester requires draconian cuts \nto critical programs that will have consequences for American families \nfor a generation. Sequester was supposed to be so arbitrary and \nunthinkable that it would drive Congress to a budget deal. But \ngridlock, hammerlock, and deadlock kept that from happening.\n  It was the reality of sequester that led Congress to negotiate the \nMurray-Ryan budget deal that provided sequester relief for 2014 and \n2015.\n  Now we have got deja vu. We need a new agreement to cancel sequester-\nlevel spending in fiscal years 2016 and 2017.\n  The Republican budget for fiscal year 2016 calls for spending at the \nsequester level of $1.017 trillion. The President's budget request asks \nfor $74 billion more. That may sound like a big number, but it is \nhardly expensive. It is equal to the 2010 level--6 years ago.\n  We must cancel sequester to give Americans a fair shot by investing \nin our country and our people.\n  Sequester hurts national security. According to Army Chief of Staff \nGeneral Raymond Odierno, only 33 percent of our brigades are ready to \nfight. Without sequester relief, the Army will not be truly ready to \nfight until 2025.\n  Sequester keeps us from building and maintaining our physical \ninfrastructure. Funding to build roads, bridges, and transit creates \njobs while easing peoples commutes to their jobs.\n  Sequester deepens our innovation deficit. Funding for basic research \nis an investment in jobs today and jobs tomorrow. New ideas and \ndiscoveries lead to startups that rev up our economy and find new cures \nfor deadly diseases.\n  Under spartan budgets, NIH funding has not kept up with inflation. \nEven the increases proposed under the Republican spending caps fund NIH \nby cutting education, college affordability, and labor protections. On \nthe other hand, when we cancel sequester, we will invest in innovation \nand discovery without sacrificing other investments in our future. For \nexample, the National Science Foundation would give 600 more grants \nsupporting 7,500 scientists, students, teachers, and technicians.\n  Cancelling sequester means meeting compelling human needs. We can \nhelp make college affordable for families. Right now, under sequester-\nlevel budgeting, Republicans instead took $300 million from Pell grants \nand eliminated First in the World grants to make college more \naffordable.\n  Under sequester-level appropriations bills, we can not keep our \npromises to our veterans. Both the Senate and the House Republican \nbills underfund medical care at the Veterans Administration--by more \nthan $600 million in the Senate. That is enough money to provide \nmedical coverage for 61,000 veterans. The House also cuts $580 million \nfor building VA health care facilities when there is a $10 billion \nmaintenance backlog.\n  It is clear that we need to end sequester. It is also clear that the \nshutdown was a disaster for everyone, not to be repeated. Because \nwithout the resources to keep our government open, agencies can not \nserve the American people keeping us safe, healthy, educated, moving, \nand thriving.\n  The bottom line is we need a new topline. We need a new budget deal \nto invest in America's safety and future. We need a short-term CR, free \nof poison pill riders, to get there--not another shutdown.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise once again to speak against \nthis callous, misguided effort to defund Planned Parenthood. This is a \nclear case of politics being put ahead of the country's best interests. \nThis time the majority has tied this effort to the funding of the \nentire Federal Government--they are willing to shut down the government \nover this issue. That is preposterous.\n  Planned Parenthood serves some of the most vulnerable women in our \nsociety. It cares for 2.7 million patients in the U.S.--5 million \npatients worldwide. Ninety-seven percent of the services its 700 \nclinics provide are basic health care, including breast exams, cervical \ncancer screenings, testing for sexually\n\n[[Page S6914]]\n\ntransmitted diseases, and contraception. One in five women will use \nPlanned Parenthood as their primary health care provider at some point \nin their lives.\n  Nationwide, 80 percent of Planned Parenthood patients make less than \n$18,000 per year.\n  Planned Parenthood is often the only health care option for low-\nincome women and women in rural communities. And yet here we are, \nfacing another effort by Republicans to block funding for this vital \nhealth care provider, an effort echoed and supported by Republicans who \nare running for President.\n  Since this latest attack on Planned Parenthood began in July, I've \nreceived more than 25,000 calls and emails from women and men in \nCalifornia who support Planned Parenthood. While the details of the \nstories vary, they share the same theme: Planned Parenthood was there \nfor them at a critical time in their lives. It was the only place they \ncould go for health care when they were in college, earning minimum \nwage, or struggling to provide for their children and families. It was \nthe only place where they felt safe and respected. It provided \nessential tests and screenings and allowed them to plan their families, \nwhich is critical to women's economic security over the course of their \nlives.\n  Here is one example from a constituent in San Francisco.\n  She said ``Thirty-two years ago, I was broke, and Planned Parenthood \nwas the only place that would give me birth control. I am now retired, \nand my life would be so different if they hadn't been there. This is so \nnecessary for those who can't afford it.''\n  Another constituent from Alameda said, ``I'm calling your office for \nthe first time because I want you to support Planned Parenthood. When I \nwas a young woman, their medical services saved my life. I hope this \nphone call helps save them in return.''\n  To me, that is why this organization is so important to women in this \ncountry. Not only does it provide health care, it gives women the \nability to make a better future for themselves and their families.\n  I also want to address the false claim put forward by those who are \npushing to defund Planned Parenthood: They claim that Planned \nParenthood patients would easily find another community clinic to go to \nfor their health care. This is just not true.\n  Community health centers and clinics do great work, but if 2.7 \nmillion Planned Parenthood patients were suddenly without a doctor, \nthey simply could not handle the sudden influx of new patients. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that up to 650,000 Planned \nParenthood patients would lose their access to health care. What's \nmore, many community clinics don't provide the level of contraception \ncare and other health care services provided by Planned Parenthood. In \ntwo-thirds of the counties where Planned Parenthood has a clinic, it \nserves half of the women eligible to receive family planning services \nunder the Title X program.\n  In California, 13 of 58 counties would not have a single clinic to \nprovide family planning services under the Title X program without \nPlanned Parenthood. That tells us what will happen if this funding is \nstripped--huge numbers of women across the country will have no place \nto go for vital health services. This isn't a matter of speculation. \nWe've seen what happens when Planned Parenthood is defunded because it \nhas happened at the state level. In 2012, Texas defunded Planned \nParenthood. To serve all the women who needed access to a doctor or \nnurse, the remaining community clinics would have had to increase the \nnumber of patients they saw by an average of 81 percent. In other \nwords, they would have needed to accept almost a doubling of their \nexisting number of patients. Unsurprisingly, those clinics lacked the \nability to do so. As a result, nearly 20,000 fewer women were served by \nthe Texas Women's Health Program the following year, a 10 percent \ndecline. The number of prescriptions for birth control was cut in half, \nmeaning 100,000 fewer women were able to access affordable birth \ncontrol.\n  Louisiana is another State trying to defund Planned Parenthood, and \nrecently defended its actions in court. As part of its rationale, the \nState actually claimed that dentists and eye doctors are capable of \nproviding women's health care services. Let me repeat: Louisiana \nofficials claimed that women who receive breast exams, contraceptive \ncounseling and prescriptions, and other medical services at Planned \nParenthood could go to dentists and eye doctors instead. Any woman \nknows that is just unrealistic. So make no mistake about it: If Planned \nParenthood is defunded, many American women simply will not get the \nhealth care they need.\n  The attacks on women's health don't stop at Planned Parenthood's \ndoor. The House of Representatives recently proposed completely \neliminating the Title X program, which provides affordable family \nplanning services to low-income women. Title X is proven to reduce \nabortions by preventing unplanned pregnancies. Let me repeat that: The \nHouse has proposed to eliminate a program that reduces abortions. Of \ncourse, we also know that the House voted to repeal the Affordable Care \nAct more than 50 times. Here in the Senate we've suffered through at \nleast 30 similar votes. This law they want to repeal guarantees women \nbasic preventive care like mammograms and cervical cancer screenings. \nIt requires that prenatal care and labor and delivery are covered by \ninsurance companies. It prevents women from being denied coverage or \ncharged more because they're women. It's the greatest achievement for \nwomen's health in a generation; yet we wasted days and weeks on futile \nattempts to eliminate it.\n  These attempts to deny women and their families access to basic \nhealth care, to defund Planned Parenthood, to eliminate funding for \nfamily planning services that reduce abortions, and to deny women the \nright to make their own reproductive decisions are appalling. Planned \nParenthood has been under constant attack since its founding in 1916. \nIts founder, Margaret Sanger, was thrown in jail for providing birth \ncontrol to women. The proponents of defunding Planned Parenthood have \nbeen engaged in this assault for years. The group behind this latest \neffort, the Center for Medical Progress, has long-standing ties to the \nanti-choice movement. It is currently under investigation for possible \ncriminal activity. The individuals who obtained the footage used false \nidentification to represent a fake medical company. The videos, which \nare presented to the public as the full, unedited videos, have been \nanalyzed by forensics experts at Fusion GPS. And the truth is, they are \nnot the full, unedited videos. Content is missing, and numerous edits \nhave been made even to the so-called full footage videos. Many members \nof Congress have requested the full videos. Those requests have gone \nunanswered. So the point is, this is part of a sustained assault on an \nessential health care provider for millions of American women.\n  I also want to reiterate the real-life consequences of the rhetoric \nthat's been directed at Planned Parenthood and its staff. I talked \nabout this when I spoke on this subject in July. I strongly believe \nthat the rhetoric directed at Planned Parenthood sends a message that \nit is ``OK'' to intimidate its staff and patients. It is not.\n  A few weeks ago, a Planned Parenthood health center in Washington \nState was severely damaged when an arsonist lit it on fire. Thankfully, \nno one was hurt. But I would hope that we'd learn from this event, and \nopponents of Planned Parenthood would think about the ramifications of \ntheir words. This is dangerous territory.\n  In closing, we must remember that the attacks on Planned Parenthood \naren't about improving women's health. They are about taking away \nwomen's rights, choices, and access to the doctors and nurses they know \nand trust. And quite frankly, their efforts will only jeopardize \nwomen's health by removing the only source of health care many women \nhave available.\n  I've seen great gains for women during my lifetime, including more \neducation, greater workplace freedom, and the right to decide what \nhappens to our own bodies. I simply will not stand by and watch our \nadvances slip away. We are standing up for Planned Parenthood because \nwe stand up for women. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Let's defeat this bill and move on so we can fund the government and \naddress many other critical issues.\n\n[[Page S6915]]\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am in strong opposition to the \nsubstitute amendment to H.J. Res. 61 imposing a moratorium on Federal \nfunding for Planned Parenthood clinics and their affiliates unless they \nstop providing abortions.\n  Let's be clear about one thing: the effort to defund Planned \nParenthood is not about Federal funding for abortions. Since 1977, it \nhas been well established under the Hyde amendment that Federal funding \ncannot be used for abortions, except in very narrow circumstances where \nthe life of the mother is endangered or in cases of rape or incest.\n  The impetus for this amendment stems from the recent release of \nsurreptitiously recorded and heavily edited videos that falsely portray \nPlanned Parenthood's participation in legal fetal tissue donation \nprograms and the subsequent attempts to defund Planned Parenthood on \nthe basis of that intrinsically dishonest campaign. It is not the first \ntime anti-choice advocates have deliberately misrepresented Planned \nParenthood. I remember when a Senator stood on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate 4 years ago and claimed that abortions are ``well over 90 \npercent of what Planned Parenthood does''. And then his press \nspokesperson had to acknowledge that what he said ``wasn't intended as \na factual statement''. How much of what we are hearing and seeing now \nisn't ``intended as a factual statement''? Senators certainly are \nentitled to their sincerely held positions on abortion and \ncontraception, but I think we ought to refrain from saying things we \nknow aren't true, especially on the floor of the United States Senate.\n  The attack on Planned Parenthood, if successful, would have a \ndevastating impact on women and families across this country, \nespecially lower income women and their families. Planned Parenthood \nhealth centers are an integral part of our safety net health care \nsystem, providing high quality, affordable health care services to 2.7 \nmillion patients per year. Every year, Planned Parenthood physicians \nand nurses provide family planning counseling and contraception to 2.1 \nmillion women, perform nearly 400,000 screenings for cervical cancer \nand nearly 500,000 breast exams, and provide nearly 4.5 million tests \nand treatments for sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.\n  Banning Federal funding for Planned Parenthood would put millions of \nwomen at risk of having no place to go for basic, preventive health \ncare. For many women, family planning clinics such as Planned \nParenthood provide the only basic health care they receive. In fact, 6 \nin 10 women who access care through a family planning health center \nconsider it their main source of health care. More than half of Planned \nParenthood health centers are located in rural areas, health \nprofessional shortage areas, or medically underserved areas, putting \nwomen living in those areas at particular risk of losing access to \nhealth care services. It isn't just Planned Parenthood that is under \nattack; it is also the one out of every five women in this country who \nhas relied on Planned Parenthood for health care at some point in her \nlifetime.\n  Earlier this week, I also voted against invoking cloture on another \nassault on women's reproductive health--H.R. 36, an unconstitutional \nattempt to impose a nationwide ban on abortions when the \n``postfertilization age'' of the fetus is determined to 20 weeks or \ngreater, with extremely limited exceptions. More than 40 years ago, in \nits landmark Roe v. Wade decision, the Supreme Court made it clear that \nwomen in this country have a constitutional right to abortion services \nand that no legislature may ban abortion prior to viability, which is \nexactly what H.R. 36 attempts to do. Previous attempts to impose \npreviability bans on abortion have been repeatedly struck down by the \ncourts, and last year, the Supreme Court refused to review a Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals decision permanently blocking Arizona's 20-\nweek ban. Nevertheless, anti-choice advocates continue their relentless \nefforts to undermine women's reproductive rights and health in any and \nevery way possible. The cloture votes on H.R. 36 and today's amendment \nto defund Planned Parenthood are simply the latest attempts.\n  In addition to imposing an unconstitutional previability ban on \nabortion, H.R. 36 threatens doctors with criminal penalties, including \nup to 5 years in prison, for attempting or performing an abortion in \nviolation of the bill's onerous restrictions, which is clearly intended \nto intimidate and discourage doctors from providing abortion care. The \nbill also puts the health of pregnant women at risk by allowing an \nexception to the 20-week ban only in the very narrow circumstance where \nan abortion is necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman. \nTherefore, under H.R. 36, a pregnant woman who develops a serious \nmedical condition or complication after 20 weeks would be barred from \nterminating her pregnancy, no matter how serious the risk to her \nhealth, unless the abortion is deemed necessary to prevent the woman's \ndeath. In addition, H.R. 36 would not allow an exception in the heart-\nwrenching situation in which a severe fetal anomaly is discovered late \nin a woman's pregnancy, despite the fact that these conditions are \noften only detectable around 20 weeks.\n  H.R. 36 also lacks a reasonable exception to the 20-week ban for \nvictims of rape and incest. Adult women who have been raped would be \nrequired to report the assault to law enforcement or undergo compulsory \nmedical treatment or counseling at least 48 hours prior to receiving an \nabortion, meaning that the rape survivor must have at least two \nappointments with two different providers in order to access the care \nshe needs. H.R. 36's treatment of minors who have survived rape or \nincest is even more extreme. For minors who have been the victim of \nrape or incest, H.R. 36 would require proof that the crime was reported \nto law enforcement or the appropriate government agency in order to \nqualify for an exception to the 20-week ban.\n  These extremely narrow exceptions completely ignore the fact that the \nmajority of sexual assault survivors do not or are not able to report \ntheir assaults to law enforcement for a variety of compelling reasons. \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention--CDC--estimate that only \n35 percent of sexual assaults or rapes were reported to the police in \n2010. It is simply unconscionable to subject survivors of rape and \nincest to these burdensome and unnecessary requirements in order to \nreceive the care they need.\n  We are 6 days away from a government shutdown; yet we have spent most \nof this week on misguided attempts to ban legal abortions and defund \nPlanned Parenthood--and to link the Planned Parenthood issue to whether \nthe Federal Government will remain open for business--even as it has \nbeen obvious to everyone that such attempts would fail. A government \nshutdown is a completely avoidable crisis, and using floor time this \ntime to attack women's health care and reproductive rights instead of \nnegotiating a bipartisan plan to fund the government is both \nunacceptable and irresponsible. The American people deserve better. \nThey deserve a budget that supports a strong national defense and \ngrowing economy, not the threat of another government shutdown. I urge \nmy colleagues to join with me in opposing these latest attacks on \nwomen's reproductive rights and access to high quality, comprehensive \nhealth care services.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Majority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                       His Holiness Pope Francis\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I know I speak for the entire Senate \nwhen I say it was a privilege to welcome the Pope to the Capitol this \nmorning. For the thousands who gathered on the Capitol lawn, it was an \nexperience they are unlikely to ever forget.\n  A quiet nod, a soft smile, a simple wave--the gestures may have been \nsmall, but their meaning ran deep, captured forever in the hearts of \nthe faithful and the hopeful.\n  As we turn back to the work of governing, many will interpret his \nwords in many ways. The media certainly has. But we can also hear him \nas simply expressing his faith. And we all appreciate his closing \nremarks: God bless America.\n  Mr. President, it is no surprise that Members of the Senate have \ndifferences on issues. That is normal, healthy even. But even if our \nDemocratic colleagues may not agree with us on every\n\n[[Page S6916]]\n\nissue, let us agree that the scandal surrounding Planned Parenthood is \ndeeply, deeply unsettling. Let us agree that it makes sense to at least \nplace a scandal-plagued political organization on leave without pay and \nthen use that money to fund women's health care as Congress \ninvestigates these serious allegations.\n  Let us also agree that it is time for our Democratic colleagues to \nfinally allow the Senate to fund the government, just as we have worked \nhard to do all year long.\n  Here is the view the new Senate took from the beginning. The best way \nto fund the government is to pass a budget, and then to fund it. That \nmay be a different approach from previous years, but it is the approach \nwe chose to pursue when we came to office.\n  We didn't think it was right that the Senate hadn't passed a budget \nin 6 years or that the Senate's Appropriations Committee hadn't passed \nthe 12 bills necessary to fund the government in 6 years. So we changed \nthat.\n  The appropriations process got off to a great start. There was often \na spirit of bipartisanship inside that committee. Consider that nearly \nall of the 12 funding bills passed with bipartisan support. More than \nhalf attracted the support of over 70 percent of Democrats. We saw our \nDemocratic colleagues use phrases such as ``win-win-win'' or declare \nthe appropriations legislation would ``do right by'' their particular \nState as they issued press releases praising the bills that they voted \nfor.\n  It was great to see that bipartisan action. I was hopeful that our \nDemocratic colleagues would actually join with us on the Senate floor \nto debate and pass the legislation they had praised in committee. But \nno, they took a different path.\n  I regret that Democratic leadership determined a crisis would be \nnecessary to advance a policy aim of growing the government, and that \nour colleagues decided accordingly to block every single funding bill--\nevery single one--almost all of which had been supported by a \nsignificant number of Democrats in committee. So we have been forced to \npursue a continuing resolution as a result.\n  It would be much better to simply finish the appropriations process \nwe worked so hard to advance. But if our colleagues continue to block \nthe Senate from doing so, the Senate is left with very few options. It \nmay be regrettable, but that is the reality we now face.\n  The bill before us would help get things back on track. It would \nensure the government remains funded and open. It would adhere to the \nbipartisan spending level already agreed to by both parties. It would \nalso allow our Democratic colleagues to join us in standing up for \nwomen's health instead of a political organization mired in scandal. \nFor 1 year, the legislation would redirect $235 million in Planned \nParenthood funding to women's health instead, strengthening health \ncenters that provide critically needed community care.\n  I wish our colleagues hadn't pursued a strategy of blocking \ngovernment funding. That strategy may have succeeded in bringing the \ncountry to this point, but there is no reason to continue blocking \nevery attempt to fund the government or to protect political allies \nmired in scandal.\n  So I am calling on colleagues across the aisle to join us in standing \nagainst a shutdown. I am calling on them to join us in standing up for \nwomen's health instead.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time following the \nvote until 6 p.m. be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees; further, that all time during quorum calls until 6 p.m. be \ncharged equally between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, all time be yielded back \nand the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on \namendment No. 2669.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven).

Mr. President, today has certainly been a historic day in \nWashington, DC. With the arrival of His Holiness Pope Francis this \nweek, Washington has been flooded with the faithful who were eager to \nmark his first visit to the United States. I know my colleagues and I \nare grateful we were able to host him at a joint meeting of Congress, \nand we were all in awe of his incredible stamina given his schedule--\nsomething we are not unfamiliar with.\n  As head of the Catholic Church, Pope Francis leads a diverse \ncommunity of believers. Catholics in the United States make up about \none-fifth of the population in the United States and also in my home \nState of Texas. In fact, Catholic priests from Spain were some of our \nearliest settlers in Texas, and one of the dozens of missions \nestablished by the Catholic Church early in the 18th century in Texas \nwas Mission San Antonio de Valero, what would later be called the \nAlamo.\n  It was a privilege to welcome Pope Francis this morning and to hear \nhis remarks. I am told he was the first pontiff ever to address a joint \nmeeting of Congress.\n\n\n                        Cardinal Daniel DiNardo\n\n  It was also my honor to host a friend of mine, Cardinal Daniel \nDiNardo, who accepted my invitation to join me today to hear Pope \nFrancis. Cardinal DiNardo is the archbishop of Galveston-Houston, home \nto more than 1 million Catholics--the largest number of the 15 dioceses \nin Texas. I have had the honor of knowing Cardinal DiNardo for a number \nof years, and I am grateful to him for his unwavering commitment to \nlife and for his extreme compassion in both a pastoral and spiritual \nsense as well as a practical one. We saw that in action recently when \nhistoric flooding devastated many of the communities in the Houston \narea. During that time, Cardinal DiNardo was quick to ensure that \nCatholic Charities would provide some relief to those in need. There is \nno doubt that his leadership will continue to serve not only the \nCatholic community in the Galveston-Houston area well but also all of \nus in Texas.\n  Mr. President, on another matter, earlier today Democrats blocked a \nmeasure that would fund the U.S. Government but redirect Federal money \nthat currently goes to Planned Parenthood to go for women's health care \nat community health centers. Actually, there are many more community\n\n[[Page S6918]]\n\nhealth centers in Texas than there are Planned Parenthood facilities.\n  Earlier this week I outlined how the Democrats, while earlier calling \nfor regular order in this Chamber, have delivered on their promise to \nblock legislation from moving forward that would fund vital parts of \nour government, such as the men and women in uniform who defend us. \nThis is in spite of the fact that earlier this year, as I believe the \nmajority leader mentioned, members of the Appropriations Committee \nactually did the work we were elected to do. We passed a budget and \nthen in a bipartisan way passed appropriations bills out of the \nAppropriations Committee. But because they have chosen to filibuster \nall of these appropriations bills, we find ourselves with unneeded and \nunnecessary drama when it comes to funding the Federal Government--\nhence the vote on Monday for closing off debate on a continuing \nresolution to fund the government through December 11, 2015. \nUnfortunately, even our uniformed military has been taken hostage to \nthis strategy, which has created unnecessary drama, as I said, and \ncreated some real hardship. So as we approach the looming fiscal \ndeadline of next Wednesday at midnight, it is important to remember how \nwe got here.\n  While Democrats filibustered legislation that would have removed all \nFederal funding for Planned Parenthood, this fight--the fight for the \nsanctity of life Pope Francis talked about this morning--is far from \nover. We are going to continue the four different investigations of \nPlanned Parenthood's practices and pursue legislation that would \nprotect the fundamental right to life of the unborn. Protecting the \nsanctity of life is an ongoing mission, and it does not end with this \none vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President here we are again: with just 6 days until \nthe Federal Government has to close its doors, we find ourselves faced \nwith another manufactured crisis. Two years ago, it was defunding the \nAffordable Care Act. Congress has voted nearly 60 times on that so far, \nall of which failed. In the meantime, more than 17 million Americans \nwho had no health insurance have obtained health insurance.\n  Four years ago, it was the same issue Republicans are pushing today: \ndefunding an organization that provides health care to millions of \nwomen across this country. With the vote to defund Planned Parenthood \nnow behind us--for the second time in as many months--it is time to \nmove forward to pass a clean, short-term continuing resolution and get \nto work addressing the real challenge before us: ending sequestration.\n  We've said it before, and it bears repeating: sequestration was never \nsupposed to become the status quo. Its cuts are so extreme and so \ndraconian that imposing it will hurt programs across the board, \nimpacting every American. Sequestration neglects police and fire \ndepartments, national parks, highways and bridges, airports, public \nhealth and education; and abandons promises made to our veterans and \nmen and women in uniform. Allowing sequester-level spending bills to \nbecome law for the next fiscal year, which the President has rightly \nsaid he will not do, would be an abdication of our sworn \nresponsibilities as Members of Congress.\n  We must pass a clean, continuing resolution; we must negotiate a new \ndeal to end sequestration, and we must pass appropriations bills that \nreflect the urgent needs of our country, not a political score card.\n  Last weekend, my wife, Marcelle, and I were fortunate to join \nhundreds of Vermont women at the 19th Annual Women's Economic \nOpportunity Conference in Randolph, VT. I have sponsored this \nconference each year in an effort to help Vermont women of all ages and \ngenerations take advantage of the economic opportunities available to \nthem.\n  From emerging entrepreneurs or those transitioning their careers, \nthousands of participants have been drawn to the conference over its \nnearly two decade history. Sequestration puts at risk the ability of \nsmall businesses to access loans and counseling from the Federal \nGovernment, which helps spur and strengthen our economy. Sequestration \nwill cut critical workforce investment programs that help young \nworkers, dislocated workers, and veterans find permanent employment. \nSequestration reverses the progress we have made in recent years to \nrestore our economy and create jobs.\n  The economic harm of sequestration is, of course, not all that is at \nstake. As Senators in both parties have pointed out, sequestration \nhurts our national security and the readiness of our Armed Forces. \nSequestration hurts our roads, our infrastructure, and our public \ntransit systems and will deeply impact our affordable housing supply. \nSequestration makes maintaining our commitment to our veterans, \nincluding a generation of disabled veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan \nwars, nearly impossible. What's more, to meet the requirements of \nsequestration, we are poised to rob from such vital needs as job \ntraining programs and preschool development grants.\n  The bottom line is this: sequestration was never intended to happen. \nBut relying on budget gimmicks, as the Senate's defense spending bill \ndoes, while nearly zeroing out critical programs for low-income \nAmericans, as the Senate's transportation and housing bill does, \ncreates more problems. Republican leaders have waited too long to come \nto the table to negotiate relief from sequester-level spending caps.\n  By passing this clean, short-term continuing resolution, we can get \nto work now--immediately--to negotiate a new deal that builds on the \n2013 Murray-Ryan deal and keep the doors of our government open.\n  We have now had the pointless debate over defunding Planned \nParenthood. Let's move on. Let's not manufacture another crisis that \nputs millions of jobs on the line and hurts Americans in every state of \nthis country. We were elected to represent our constituents. The voice \nfrom Vermonters is clear: it is time to get our work done.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nsupport of a clean, short-term continuing resolution--or, as we say, a \nCR--to temporarily fund the government without controversial policy \nriders. After the vote we just had, I hope we can move to such a \nmeasure. Even some Republican leaders have acknowledged that this \nprevious vote was a show vote designed to appease, but to fail. It is \npart of a troubling pattern that has been emerging over many months of \navoiding meaningful, bipartisan talks to fix the budget and waiting \nuntil the last moment to deal with issues everyone knows must be \naddressed.\n  We have an obligation to the American people to keep their government \nworking. It is one of the most basic responsibilities we have as \nMembers of Congress. A clean CR at this juncture fulfills this \nobligation, keeping the government open for a few more weeks while we \nwork on a plan to eliminate the sequester-level budget caps for defense \nand nondefense programs. I wish we could have begun work on an overall \nagreement earlier in the year, as Vice Chairwoman Mikulski and others \nstrongly urged months ago, but at this late hour we should pass this \nshort-term measure and move on to serious negotiations on budget caps \nfor this year and beyond.\n  Shutting the government down now will not serve any useful purpose. \nWhat a shutdown will do is waste taxpayers' money and hurt the economy. \nIndeed, the 2-week Republican government shutdown in 2013 cost our \neconomy billions of dollars. Based on that experience, here is some of \nwhat we can expect if there is another forced government shutdown this \nyear:\n  The Department of Housing and Urban Development will have to furlough \nmore than 95 percent of its workforce, impacting services to more than \n60 field and regional offices nationwide. Payments will be delayed to \nthe roughly 3,000 local public housing authorities that manage the \ncountry's publicly assisted housing programs. In fact, this shifts the \nburden onto them, causing them to turn to local municipalities that are \nequally stressed in terms of their budgets. So there is no avoiding\n\n[[Page S6919]]\n\nthis pain--in fact, it will be multiplied if we shut down the \ngovernment.\n  Thousands of home sales and mortgage-refinancing packages backed by \nthe Federal Housing Administration, the FHA, will be put on standby. \nPeople who are ready to close, people who are ready to make a \ncommitment to a home, people who are ready to keep this economy moving \nwill be told: Stand back; wait and see.\n  Cities, counties, and States will not be able to move forward with \nnew community development block grant projects, preventing important \nlocal economic investment. This is a program which affects every \ncommunity in this country, and it is something which is a very \npositive, constructive way to give local leaders the resources to fund \nthe local initiatives the community desperately wants and needs. This \nis not Big Washington; this is local America getting a chance to see \ntheir projects put in place.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration will not be able to certify new \naircraft, interrupting billions of dollars in sales.\n  The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration will be \nforced to stop investigations and emergency response training.\n  Classrooms will be shuttered for 700 midshipmen at the U.S. Merchant \nMarine Academy in Kings Point, NY. These are young men and women who \nare committing themselves to serve the Nation either directly in the \narmed services of the United States or as members of our merchant \nfleet. They will basically be told to go home.\n  Financial support will stop for the Maritime Security Program, the \nMSP. This is an important public-private partnership that is critical \nto sustaining our troops serving overseas.\n  These are just a few examples from two of the Departments under my \npurview as the ranking member of the Transportation, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment Appropriations Subcommittee. There are many other examples \nthroughout the Federal Government that my colleagues are talking about \ntoday.\n  Knowing the results that shutdowns and these hardball tactics have \nbrought before, it is hard to believe some still are willing to resort \nto budget brinksmanship again.\n  I know many of my colleagues on the other side share my concern. I \nparticularly wish to commend Senator Collins, who has been an excellent \nleader in chairing the THUD subcommittee, for her support for a clean \nCR. She has done extraordinary work under very difficult and \nchallenging circumstances. Her support for a clean CR so that we can \nnegotiate a longer term budget solution is indicative of the kind of \nforthright, thoughtful, and in some cases very courageous service she \nhas rendered to Maine and to the country.\n  While we focus on the immediate showdown threat, let's remember the \nbigger threats we face in 2016. We are here because of the Budget \nControl Act and its attendant sequester-level caps on discretionary \nspending. Let's remember that these sequester-level caps were never \nintended to be implemented. At the time BCA was enacted, the cuts were \nconsidered to be extreme--in fact, so extreme that Congress would not \never let them happen, that they would embrace defense and nondefense, \nand that they would be an action-forcing mechanism--not an actuality of \nlaw but an action-forcing mechanism to cause us on a bipartisan basis \nto come up with long-term budget solutions. Unfortunately, that \nsolution did not materialize.\n  Over time, we had the very good work of Senator Murray and \nCongressman Paul Ryan to come up with a 2-year suspension, but we are \nright back where we were, and these sequester caps are staring us right \nin the face. But today, rather than working together to tackle the \nsequester, we are on the verge of orchestrating another fiscal crisis. \nAnd it is not a crisis that will help the American people; rather, it \nwill hinder the American people. And, indeed, it is ironic because \nMembers on both sides recognize the BCA cap should be raised for both \ndefense and nondefense appropriations.\n\n  Indeed, both the Defense authorization and the Defense appropriations \nbills carry bipartisan sense-of-the-Senate language that says: \n``Sequestration relief must be accomplished for fiscal years 2016 and \n2017.'' And, ``Sequestration relief should include equal defense and \nnondefense relief.'' So you have a bipartisan consensus on these two \ncommittees that represent a significant number of our colleagues who \nare essentially saying: We have to end this. And they are saying it \nbecause they believe, as I do, that our national security rests not \njust upon adequate elements of the Department of Defense but adequate \ninvestment for all our Federal programs.\n  So beyond committing a clean, short-term funding bill, we must focus \non eliminating these draconian spending caps imposed on us by the BCA. \nWe know these caps will cause real harm to programs across the Federal \nGovernment that our States and constituents rely on.\n  These are not academic issues that could be dismissed as being some \nprograms that are ineffective and less limiting. These are across-the-\nboard cuts that hit all our constituents and hit them hard.\n  Indeed, months ago Chairman McCain and I together wrote to urge the \nCommittee on the Budget to include a higher baseline funding amount for \nthe Department of Defense in the budget resolution. We were essentially \nasking them to ignore the BCA caps and produce a budget that \nrealistically recognizes the base needs of the Department of Defense--\nnot the one-time spending of OCO contingency but routine spending that \nwould be projected forth.\n  Senator McCain in particular worked in extraordinarily good faith to \ntry to get such a provision included in the budget resolution, but he \ndid not succeed. And, in response, the use of OCO contingency funds was \nincorporated to skirt the budget caps. Essentially, what the committee \nhas done--the defense authorization committee--is it has taken the \nPresident's budget numbers, but moved money out of the base budget into \nOCO, beyond the President's request. And what you are doing is creating \nthis OCO funding mechanism--in a sense, a gimmick, really--to cover the \nreal cost--the ongoing cost, the routine continuing cost--of the \nDepartment of Defense. That is not good budgeting, and it is not good \nfor Defense either.\n  Because of this I was unable to support legislation on the floor for \nthe Defense authorization bill that in many other respects--virtually \nevery other respect--was extremely well done and extremely thought out. \nAgain, I commend the chairman for all his efforts and those of my \ncolleagues.\n  I clearly disagree that using this OCO funding arrangement--gimmick, \nsleight of hand, whatever you want to call it--is the way to proceed \nforward. Relying on it essentially preempts defense from the Budget \nControl Act and leaves everything else under those onerous caps. As I \nsaid, that not only does not adequately and realistically fund defense, \nbut it seriously erodes national security because national security is \nsomething more than simply what the Department of Defense does. It is \nthe Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security, and it is \na myriad of other functions that will not see funding. In fact, they \nwill see their funding begin to shrink dramatically.\n  If we use this approach this year, with the argument that it is just \na bridge to the day we finally get ourselves together, I think we are \ndeluding ourselves. It would be much easier next year to put even more \nmoney into OCO, to take programs that are traditionally funded through \nthe base budget of the Department of Defense and say: Well, we just \ndon't have room. Let's put it in OCO. It becomes the gift that keeps on \ngiving, and it will not provide the real resources and the certainty \nthe Department of Defense needs over many years to plan for their \noperations.\n  To stick things in 1-year funding is not to tell the Department of \nDefense: You can be confident that 2 or 3 years from now, when you are \ndeveloping that new weapons system platform, the money will be there. \nIt may, but again, it may not. We can't give them that insecurity. We \nhave to give them a sense of certainty.\n  Now, this is a view that is shared not just by myself and some \ncolleagues here on both sides of the aisle but by senior Defense \nDepartment officials. They have testified repeatedly before our \ncommittee that OCO funding does not provide long-term budget certainty. \nThey need that. And the\n\n[[Page S6920]]\n\ntroops--the men and women they lead--need that.\n  In fact, it really just allows DOD to plan for 1 year. And there are \nvery few programs in the Department of Defense that are 1-year \nprograms. A major weapons system is a multiyear development and then \nthere is the production process. The strategy is not year by year. It \nis over several years at least. So this is not an efficient and \neffective way to run the organization. Proper budgeting and planning in \nthe Department of Defense requires at least 5 years. That is the \nstandard. The standard measure is a 5-year program forecast, budget \nforecast, and we are telling them: Well, this year you can have a \nbonanza of OCO funds. Next year could be more, could be less, could be \nmuch less.\n  This is not the way to efficiently allocate resources for national \nsecurity and to efficiently develop a strategy to counteract an \nincreasing array of threats around the globe in many different \ndimensions in many different regions. If we go down this path, it will \nlead to instability for our troops, their families, and for our defense \nindustrial base. They deserve certainty, not a year-to-year, perhaps-\nmaybe, maybe-perhaps approach.\n  We also need to recognize, as I have repeated before, that national \nsecurity is not just the Department of Defense. Other agencies are \ncritical--the Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, \nDepartment of Justice, and Department of Treasury, which does all the \nterrorist financing sanctions. They have to trace funds flowing around \nthe world to ensure they do not aid and assist terrorist activities or \nother maligning activities. They need resources too.\n  Taking this approach as it stands now, using this OCO approach for \ndefense and then letting everything else stay under BCA, will not give \nthese agencies the resources they need.\n  I was struck a few days ago when General Petraeus was here testifying \nthat one of the critical areas of effort against ISIL is information \nwarfare. They have proven to be extraordinarily adept at using social \nmedia, at communicating through the Internet. One of the questions from \nmy colleague--which was very thoughtful and fundamental--was this: Is \nthe State Department doing enough to counteract--as one of our major \nforeign policy organizations--this information campaign by ISIL? The \nGeneral sort of chuckled a bit, and then he said: Let me tell you that \nwhen I was commanding, on active service, the State Department had to \ncome to me and essentially borrow $1 million from CENTCOM funds so they \ncould get in the ball game--to just get in the game in terms of \ninformation warfare: counteracting measures, public campaigns of \ninformation in countries throughout the globe, particularly in the \nMiddle East.\n  That will be much worse if we proceed down this path, and we will not \nbe enhancing our national security. If the ISIL message is unanswered, \nif they are able to attract adherents from around the globe because all \nthey can really hear is this grotesque discussion of ISIL and what they \npropose, and there are no counterarguments, there is no countervailing \npoints, we lose that information war. And that is not just a DOD \nfunction.\n  Now, we have to make investments in both defense and nondefense. But \nas I said before, if we stick with these BCA caps, our non-DOD programs \nwill suffer. In addition to that, the needs of the American people will \nsuffer.\n  We will not be able to invest in adequate transportation and water \ninfrastructure. We won't be able to do things that provide adequate and \ndecent housing for our citizens. Under the budget caps we will lose \njobs too. When the resources diminish, the need for workers diminishes, \nand that will happen.\n  Now, we have a situation, particularly where some of our most \nvulnerable Americans would suffer grievously. Here are a few examples. \nThe elderly housing program has been cut in half since 2010, even when \nwe know the United States population today is aging faster.\n  Every Member of this Senate has numerous elderly housing programs in \ntheir State. Their low-income seniors rely on them. I would suspect \nthey take some pride in the fact there is adequate housing--in some \ncases not enough, but at least some adequate housing. They will suffer.\n  There are 7.7 million very low income renters in the United States. \nThat means they pay more than 50 percent of their income in rent or \nlive in substandard housing or both. If these budget caps go into \neffect, then the THUD bill will not include meaningful funding for the \naffordable housing production program available to local governments.\n  When we turn to Public Housing Authorities, they are facing more than \n$3 billion in capital needs just to keep them repaired, just to make \nthem places that are decent to live in, where people can have \nappropriate hallway lighting, they can have elevators that work, they \ncan have plumbing systems that are adequate--the basics.\n  We are not talking about building whirlpools, spas, and Jacuzzis. \nThis is just meeting basic requirements in maintenance and capital \nrepairs. The level of funding PHA's are faced with is the same level we \nprovided in the late 1980s. That is going back about 30 years. Thirty \nyears ago, relatively speaking, we would be spending as much as we are \nnow on simply maintaining public housing. These are real-world \nconsequences.\n  Again, BCA comes into play in terms of the impact on domestic \nprograms. Funding for public transit continues to fall even while \ntransit ridership goes up.\n  One of the success stories over the past few years is our public \ntransit systems. Our buses, our subway systems, our light rail systems \nare enjoying increased ridership. That is good for people to get to \nwork, and it is good for our environment because of reduces the use of \nindividual automobiles. But if our ridership goes up and the resources \ngo down, we are going to see a system that gets less and less \ndependable, reliable, and effective, and we will lose not only a number \nof those riders but have incidents--as we have seen across the \ncountry--where there are significant safety concerns and significant \ndisruptions.\n  It has not been uncommon over the last several months here in \nWashington to hear on the radio that a whole subway line has gone down \nbecause of a maintenance problem or something else, and that day's \nworkforce doesn't get to the office for 3 or 4 or 5 hours. Guess what. \nThat costs a lot of private employers a great deal of money because the \npeople aren't doing the work, and they probably would be paid. So \nessentially this impacts our economy, and it is multiplied. And it will \nbe exponentially multiplied if we start cutting away the money, as \nsuggested in the Budget Control Act.\n  It is now time to work together and to enact first a clean CR, which \nwill give us the time to systematically and comprehensively address the \nissues that are staring us straight in the face because of the BCA--the \nbudget caps on Defense and nondefense. It is time to be able to move--\nas I believe the vast majority of my colleagues want to--the excess OCO \nfunding back into the regular budget of the Department of Defense as we \nraise the budget cap, and as we raise the budget cap for the Department \nof Defense, to recognize we have to raise the cap not only for other \nnational security agencies to protect our country, but also for other \nagencies in order to invest in our economy, keep us productive, keep \npeople employed, and also keep faith with the thousands and thousands \nof Americans who have worked and now may need help. There are seniors \nin need of rental assistance. They need the support of a good transit \nsystem to get to work or, if they are a senior citizen, to get to a \ndoctor's appointment. They are counting on us.\n\n  So I hope all my colleagues can come together, forge an agreement, \navoid a shutdown, and then do something more than just keep the lights \non--invest across the board in our people and watch those investments \nmultiply to a productive, successful economy and a more secure America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6921]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 224\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, in 1975, Russian physicist Andrei Sakharov \nwas awarded a Nobel Prize for his public opposition to the totalitarian \ncommunism of the Soviet Union. He knew what he was talking about as he \nhad spent decades working on the Soviet nuclear weapons program, work \nhe had originally thought was a patriotic duty that would ensure the \nbalance of power with the United States but that he came to understand \nwas in the service of a brutal, oppressive regime with aggressive \nintentions.\n  The Soviets prohibited Sakharov from accepting the award in person, \nalthough his wife Yelena Bonner was abroad at the time. She accepted on \nhis behalf and delivered his seminal speech, ``Peace, Progress, and \nHuman Rights.'' In it, Sakharov declared:\n\n       I am convinced that international confidence, mutual \n     understanding, disarmament, and international security are \n     inconceivable without an open society with freedom of \n     information, freedom of conscience, the right to publish, and \n     the right to travel and choose the country in which one \n     wishes to live. I am likewise convinced that freedom of \n     conscience, together with other civil rights, provides the \n     basis for scientific progress and constitutes a guarantee \n     that scientific advances will not be used to despoil mankind, \n     providing the basis for economic and social progress, which \n     in turn is a political guarantee for the possibility of an \n     effective defense of social rights.\n\n  He recited the names of his fellow dissidents who were being \npersecuted by the Soviets, but he called for peaceful reform, not a \nviolent revolution, saying:\n\n       We must today fight for every individual person separately \n     against injustice and the violation of human rights. Much of \n     our future depends on this. In struggling to protect human \n     rights we must, I am convinced, first and foremost act as \n     protectors of the innocent victims of regimes installed in \n     various countries, without demanding the destruction or total \n     condemnation of these regimes. We need a pliant, pluralist, \n     tolerant community, which selectively and tentatively can \n     bring about a free undogmatic use of the experiences of all \n     social systems.\n\n  Sakharov was relieved of all his scientific duties and, after \ndenouncing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1980, was banished to \nGorky, 250 miles east of Moscow on the Volga River, to remove him from \nthe public eye. His wife joined him in 1984, charged with anti-Soviet \nslander, and was prohibited from traveling abroad for medical \ntreatment. Sakharov began a hunger strike in protest. Soviet \nauthorities detained and force-fed him.\n  In solidarity, President Ronald Reagan--who was then initiating his \nhistoric negotiations with the Soviets--proclaimed May 18, 1983, \nNational Andrei Sakharov Day, and the following year the United States \nCongress passed a bipartisan measure renaming the mailing address of \nthe Soviet Embassy from 1125 16th Street to No. 1 Andrei Sakharov \nPlaza. Every piece of mail delivered to or sent from the embassy would \nthus bear the name of the courageous dissident the Soviets were trying \nto silence.\n  The following year, the Soviet Union allowed Bonner to travel abroad \nfor heart surgery, and the year after that, Gorbachev allowed Sakharov \nand his wife to return to Moscow, although Sakharov remained critical \nof the slow speed of Gorbachev's reforms until his death in 1989--just \n1 month after the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n  The bravery of Andrei Sakharov was instrumental in bringing down a \ngreat and oppressive empire. Armed only with the truth, he was able to \nexpose to the world the reality of Soviet Communism, the futility of \ntrying to placate or domesticate the regime, and the power of standing \nfor human rights.\n  Today, we have a case before us that is eerily reminiscent of \nSakharov's legacy. Dr. Liu Xiaobo, who was awarded the Nobel Peace \nPrize in 2010, sits today in a Chinese jail for the crime of \nsubversion.\n  A poet, author, and political scientist, Dr. Liu was in 1989 a \nvisiting scholar at Columbia University, but when the pro-democracy \nprotests broke out in Beijing in June of that year, he returned to \nChina to aid the movement. He staged a hunger strike in Tiananmen \nSquare in the midst of the historic student protests and insisted the \nprotests would be nonviolent, even in the face of the violence \nthreatened by the People's Republic of China. The PRC arrested Liu for \nhis involvement in the Tiananmen Square demonstration and sentenced him \nto 2 years in prison. In 1996, the party subjected him to 3 years of \n``reeducation through labor'' for questioning the single-party system. \nIn 2004, the PRC cut Liu's phone lines and Internet connection after he \npublished an essay criticizing the party's campaign to silence so-\ncalled subversive journalists and activists.\n  In 2008, Liu, along with over 350 Chinese intellectuals and human \nrights advocates, penned ``Charter 08,'' a manifesto modeled after the \nCzech ``Charter 77,'' an anti-Communist manifesto written in 1977 by \nVaclav Havel and others calling for human rights and political reforms \nin the Soviet Republics.\n  Dr. Liu's ``Charter 08'' made 19 specific demands of the PRC, \nincluding abandoning one-party rule in favor of instituting a \nseparation of powers composed of a legislative democracy and \nindependent judiciary; abolition of the Hukou housing system that has \nvictimized poor and rural Chinese for decades; and securing freedom of \nassociation, assembly, expression, and religion. ``Charter 08'' was \nreleased on December 10, 2008. Although the Communist Party quickly \ncensored it, over 10,000 journalists, scholars, businessmen, and \nteachers have signed the document since 2008.\n  Two days prior to the release of ``Charter 08''--on the eve of the \n100-year anniversary of China's first Constitution and the 30-year \nanniversary of Beijing's Democracy Wall movement--the PRC detained Liu \nfor his involvement in this charter. In June 2009, he was officially \narrested and charged with ``inciting subversion of state power'' for \nhis coauthorship of ``Charter 08.''\n  After being detained for over a year, Liu pled not guilty to \n``inciting subversion of state power'' before the Beijing No. 1 \nIntermediate People's Court on December 23, 2009. His defense was not \nallowed to present evidence, and on Christmas Day Liu was sentenced to \n11 years in prison with an additional 2 years' deprivation of all \npolitical rights. Beijing High Court rejected his appeal 2 months \nlater.\n  On October 2010, Dr. Liu Xiaobo received the Nobel Peace Prize for \nhis leadership in writing and publishing ``Charter 08.'' Like Sakharov, \nhe could not attend in person but accepted in absentia, boldly \ndeclaring in his acceptance speech:\n\n       Hatred can rot away at a person's intelligence and \n     conscience. Enemy mentality will poison the spirit of a \n     nation, incite cruel mortal struggles, destroy a society's \n     tolerance and humanity, and hinder a nation's progress toward \n     freedom and democracy. That is why I hope to be able to \n     transcend my personal experiences as I look upon our nation's \n     development and social change, to counter the regime's \n     hostility with utmost goodwill, and to dispel hatred with \n     love.\n\n  The very moment the Nobel Commission awarded the Peace Prize to Liu, \nhis wife Liu Xia was taken into custody by the PRC. She penned an open \nletter to Chinese President Xi Jinping in June 2013 decrying her unjust \narrest and detention:\n\n       I have been under house arrest and have lost all my \n     personal freedoms since October 2010. No one has told me any \n     reasons for detaining me. I have thought about it over and \n     over. Perhaps in this country it's a ``crime'' for me to be \n     ``Liu Xiaobo's wife.''\n\n  Both Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia remain in prison today. The opening \nparagraph of ``Charter 08'' captures the entirety of Liu Xiaobo's \nlifework:\n\n       Having experienced a prolonged period of human rights \n     disasters and challenging and tortuous struggles, the \n     awakening Chinese citizens are becoming increasingly aware \n     that freedom, equality and human rights are universal values \n     shared by all humankind, and that democracy, republicanism, \n     and constitutional government make up the basic institutional \n     framework of modern politics. A `modernization' bereft of \n     these universal values and this basic political framework is \n     a disastrous process that deprives people of their rights, \n     rots away their humanity, and destroys their dignity. Where \n     is China headed in the 21st century? Will it continue with \n     this `modernization' under authoritarian rule, or will it \n     endorse universal values, join the mainstream civilization, \n     and build a democratic form of government? This is an \n     unavoidable decision.\n\n  Dr. Liu's enormous courage and willingness to voluntarily sacrifice \nnot only his own freedom but also that of those most dear to him poses \na challenge to the free world. Will we be silent, eager to enjoy the \neconomic benefits of cooperation with the PRC? Or will we put President \nXi on notice that\n\n[[Page S6922]]\n\nfor America, human rights are no longer off the table, and that we are \nlistening to the truth about Communist China.\n  I believe that the freedom championed by Dr. Liu is possible for all \nthe Chinese people. I believe that from Tiananmen Square to Taiwan, the \nevidence is clear that the Chinese desire--and are capable of--\ndemocracy. I believe that we have a moral responsibility to not \nmarginalize Dr. Liu and his brave fellow dissidents but to make their \nplight central to all our dealings with the PRC.\n  For that reason, we should follow the example of Ronald Reagan. We \nshould follow the example of standing up to oppression, standing up do \nthe Soviet Union's oppression of Andrei Sakharov. For that reason, in \nsolidarity with the Chinese people engaged in a long and nonviolent \nstruggle for basic human rights, I am asking my colleagues to join me \nin creating a new version of Sakharov Plaza by naming the street in \nfront of the People's Republic of China Embassy in Washington, DC, Liu \nXiaobo Plaza. This would be the street sign that the Chinese Ambassador \nwould look at each day. This would be the address that every piece of \ncorrespondence going into the embassy and coming out of the embassy \nwould have written on it, just as with the Soviets when forced to \nrecognize the bravery of Sakharov.\n  The PRC officials will be forced to recognize the bravery of Dr. Liu \nand to acknowledge it dozens of times a day, day after day. I realize \nthat this is an expedited request, but given the ongoing repression not \nonly of the Lius but of so many other voices for political and \nreligious freedom in China and the imminent arrival of the Chinese \nleader who is directly responsible for it, I hope that my colleagues \nwill join me. I intend to propound a unanimous consent request, and it \nis my hope that all 100 Senators will stand with me.\n  But for the moment, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRUZ addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, for reasons that I just detailed to this \nChamber, reasons for which we should stand in bipartisan unanimity in \nsupport of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dr. Liu Xiaobo and in support of \nhuman rights and dissidents across the world, that we should follow the \nsuccessful pattern of Sakharov Plaza under Ronald Reagan, this should \nbe an issue that brings us all together.\n  Accordingly, I ask unanimous consent that the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee be discharged from further consideration \nof and that the Senate now proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 224. \nI ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble \nbe agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I \nwould like to make an observation. The notice for this went out less \nthan an hour ago. The consultations with others haven't been made. It \nwas precipitously brought to the floor, and I can only infer that it \nhas political implications, because the President of China is due to \narrive here tomorrow and, therefore, this would be passed today, moved \nout of committee without a vote in front of the Senate.\n  I don't think that is the way we should do business in this Senate. \nMaybe people don't believe diplomacy makes a difference, but I do. I \nthink there will be ample time for the President to speak with the \nPresident of China and for some of us to speak as well. This is, of \ncourse--the human rights, of course--a subject. But in the absence of \nthat, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I note that this is a sad day for this \nbody. When standing up to the Soviet Union, Democrats and Republicans \nwere able to come together in support of Andrei Sakharov, and it \nworked. It made a difference speaking up for human rights. The senior \nSenator from California is correct that this was expedited, and she is \ncorrect as to why. As I said in this floor speech, the presence of \nPresident Xi in this country is precisely the reason that we should \nstand in unanimity in support of human rights. It is what makes it \ntimely until a few minutes ago, when we had been informed that there \nwere no objections on the Democratic side and Republican side. It \nsaddens me. I know there are many Chinese Americans in the State of \nCalifornia, there are many Chinese Americans in the State of Texas, and \nacross the country there are millions of Americans who care for human \nrights.\n  Just this morning we sat on the floor of the House of Representatives \nand listened to Pope Francis talk about putting aside petty partisan \ndifferences and coming together with a voice of compassion.\n  Dr. Liu is in a Chinese prison, and the senior Senator from \nCalifornia is standing and objecting to recognizing this Nobel \nlaureate's bravery, is standing and objecting because presumably it \nwould embarrass his Communist captors. I, for one, think as Americans \nwe should not be troubled by embarrassing Communist oppressors.\n  I note, as the senior Senator from California leaves the floor, that \nthis is not an issue that is abstract to me. My family, like Dr. Liu, \nhas been imprisoned by oppressive regimes. My father, as a teenager, \nwas imprisoned and tortured in Cuba. He had his nose broken. He had his \nteeth shattered. He lay in the blood and grime of a prison cell in \nCuba. My aunt, my Tia Sonia, was a few years later again imprisoned and \ntortured. This time by Castro. My father by Batista and my aunt by \nCastro was imprisoned and tortured by a Communist regime. It is a sad \nstatement when the United States of America cannot stand up and say: \nYou who are imprisoned unjustly, we stand with you.\n  If any of us listened to a word Pope Francis said this morning, that \nis a word we should have heard--that we should be a voice of freedom, a \nclarion voice of freedom across this globe. What we saw on this Senate \nfloor saddens me greatly. I understand the Democrats feel partisan \nloyalty to the White House, and this White House's Secretary Clinton \nsaid at the beginning of the administration that human rights are off \nthe table. America no longer stands for human rights. We will coddle up \nwith oppressors if they make cheap calculators to sell in our stores. I \nthink they are values that transcend the mighty dollar, and it is \nentirely possible to deal with foreign countries and yet maintain our \nprinciples and speak with unanimity.\n  A couple of years ago I had the opportunity to visit with Natan \nSharansky, the famed Soviet dissident. He and I visited in Jerusalem. \nHe talked to me about how, when he was in the Soviet gulag, the \nprisoners would pass from cell to cell notes: Did you hear what \nPresident Reagan said--``evil empire,'' ``ash heap of history,'' ``tear \ndown this wall''? The leadership of the United States of America--mind \nyou, it wasn't partisan leadership; it was clear bipartisan leadership \nin America--shined a light to the dark of those prison cells.\n  I pray today that Dr. Liu, in his prison cell, does not hear word \nthat the Democratic Senators are unwilling to stand with him. That is \nheartbreaking at a level rarely seen. It is one thing for us to \ndisagree on partisan matters. We can have disagreements over the \nappropriate rate of capital gains taxes. But for standing with an \noppressed Nobel Peace Prize laureate, for standing up to Communist \noppression, that should not be a partisan divide.\n  The objection raised by the senior Senator from California is deeply \ndisappointing, and I intend to continue to press this issue because the \nvoice of America, the voice for freedom that Pope Francis urged us to \naspire to will not be extinguished. It is who we are that is essential \nto our character and to our integrity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, over the course of the summer we have \nwatched with horror as thousands more have died in Syria and Iraq, and \nthe debate over what we should do about it has been omnipresent here in \nthe Senate and in the House. We have held hearings, appeared on \ntelevision to tell our story of how we should respond, and talked about \nit on the floor of the\n\n[[Page S6923]]\n\nSenate and the House. Similarly, we have watched the conflict continue \nto persist in eastern Ukraine. Although they have not had the same \nnumber of casualties as we have seen in Syria and Iraq, they have had \nsimilar death and destruction, and we have responded with a vigorous \ndebate on the floor of the Senate--again, hearings in committees, \nletters to the President, bipartisan pieces of legislation that have \nbeen proposed--about how the United States should seek to reduce the \namount of casualties in a place like eastern Ukraine, and we are also \ndebating what our response should be in Syria and Iraq.\n  What if I told you that this summer 4,000 people died in another \nconflict in which there was absolutely no debate here in the Congress? \nWhat if I told you there were 4,000 people who died this summer in a \nconflict and not a single committee in the Congress held a hearing on \nit? What if I told you there was a conflict this summer in which 4,000 \npeople perished and not a single Member of the majority party in the \nHouse or the Senate has proposed any comprehensive way to deal with it?\n  This chart shows the number of people on a daily, monthly, and annual \nbasis who are killed by guns. On average, it is 86 a day, 26,000 a \nmonth, and 31,000 a year. This summer, while kids were out of school, \nover 4,000 people--just this summer--died across this country from gun \nviolence. I come to the floor not as often as I would like but as often \nas I can to tell some of their stories because I kind of thought these \nnumbers would be enough to persuade Members of this body to do \nsomething--anything--to try to stem the scourge of gun violence in this \nbody, but it hasn't, and so my hope is maybe by telling the stories of \nsome of these individuals, it will hopefully make a difference. Every \nday we add dozens of stories of young men and women--mostly young men \nand women--whose lives were cut short, whose greatness we were never \nable to see, whose potential was never realized because they were \nkilled by a gun.\n  This summer we have been gripped by mass shooting after mass \nshooting.\n  Cynthia Hurd, Tywanza Sanders, Sharonda Singleton, Myra Thompson, \nEthel Lance, Susie Jackson, Daniel Simmons, and DePayne Doctor, and \nClementa Pinckney--we don't know all of those names, but we know about \nmany of them because they were killed at a mass shooting in a church in \nSouth Carolina.\n  Sgt Carson Holmquist, PO2 Randall Smith, GySgt Thomas Sullivan, LCpl \n``Skip'' Wells, and SSgt David Wyatt--maybe you have heard their names \nbecause they were all killed at a shooting in Tennessee at a \nChattanooga Armed Forces recruiting center.\n  Maybe you have heard of Jillian Johnson and Mayci Breaux, who were \nkilled in a movie theater in Lafayette, LA, in July of this year.\n  Most people have now heard of Allison Parker and Adam Ward, who were \ngunned down on live TV just a few weeks ago in Virginia.\n  On each one of those days--June 17, a shooting in South Carolina; \nJuly 16, a shooting in Tennessee; July 24, a shooting in Louisiana; and \nAugust 26, a shooting in Virginia--there were dozens more people who \ndied from gunshot wounds whom we never heard of, but they meant \nsomething to their families. To this day their loss is experienced \ndeeply by those who knew them well.\n  Some of them were people who were close to those of us who serve in \npublic service. Matthew Shlonsky was killed this summer in Washington, \nDC. On August 15 he was heading to a going-away party, and he had just \nstepped out of a cab when he was shot outside of the Shaw-Howard Metro \nstation. He was the sixth gunshot victim in the Shaw area in a little \nover a week.\n  Think about what it is like to live in a neighborhood in which there \nhave been six shootings over the course of a week. Think of the fear \nthat breeds in those communities.\n  We knew Matthew because he was an intern for one of our colleagues. \nHe was working as a consultant at Deloitte, but he had served as a \nSenate intern. He was an amazing kid by all accounts. He traveled the \nworld, spoke two languages, and was a star hockey player. His future \nwas absolutely limitless. But because this city is awash in guns--many \nof them illegal, many of them in the hands of criminals who get them \nbecause of giant, gaping holes in our background check system--Matthew \nShlonsky is no longer with us. He is dead at the age of 23.\n  How about the heartbreaking story of Carey Gabay, who was 43 years \nold. He was serving as an assistant counsel to New York Governor Andrew \nCuomo, and before that he had been counsel of the Empire State \nDevelopment Corporation. He died on September 16--just on the back end \nof the summer--after he was caught in the crossfire of a shooting in \nNew York City. He was an innocent bystander when he was shot in the \nhead while attending the pre-West Indian American Day Parade festival \nwith friends and family.\n  He was the son of Jamaican immigrants and grew up in public housing \nin the Bronx. He had done amazingly well. He attended Harvard \nUniversity and Harvard Law School. He was working for the Governor and \ntrying to make a better life for others by trying to give opportunities \nto kids who grow up in the same circumstance as he did. A friend \ndescribed him as ``an amazing human being who melded public service, \nprofessionalism, personal integrity with warmth and caring for everyone \nhe knew.'' He was 43 years old when he was gunned down in broad \ndaylight outside of a festival simply because he was in the wrong place \nat the wrong time.\n  This summer 4,000 people were killed by guns, and not a single public \nhearing has occurred in the U.S. Senate to discuss a solution. There is \nnot even mention of a debate happening anytime soon on the floor of the \nSenate as to how we stop these episodes of mass slaughter. We are \naveraging more than one mass shooting in this country every single day \nthis year. That is astounding. That is shocking. Yet there is total, \nutter, absolute silence from the world's greatest deliberative body on \nwhat we should do about it.\n  I am the last person to say there is any panacea coming from the \nCongress on how to stem gun violence. We are never going to be able to \neliminate these epidemic rates of gun violence just by one law or set \nof laws that are passed. But what is an absolute indictment of this \nplace is that we don't even try.\n  I have made this contention on the floor before, and I will make it \nagain. I truly believe our silence on this has become complicity. We \nhave become accomplices to these murders because by saying and doing \nnothing, we offer up a kind of quiet endorsement to people who exist in \nthe fringes of their minds and who are thinking about contemplating \nviolence, and the leaders of this country are doing absolutely nothing \nto seriously condemn or stop their destructive, malevolent behavior. \nOur silence has become complicit.\n  I hope that at some point over the course of the rest of this year, \nwe can begin a conversation as to how we can turn these numbers back in \nthe right direction. There is no other country in the industrialized \nworld that even comes close to these numbers.\n  I can offer a suggestion on where to start. If between now and \nDecember we can't come to a common understanding on our gun laws--I \nstill don't understand why we can't just do that since 90 percent of \nAmericans support expansive background checks--let's start by fixing \nthe mental health care system.\n  I think there are a lot of reasons why Adam Lanza walked into Sandy \nHook Elementary School and killed 20 kids over 2 years ago. The child \nadvocate in Connecticut issued a damning report on his interactions \nwith the mental health care system. His mother tried and tried and \ntried, but in the end she gave up and let him retreat into the \nisolation of his room, where he plotted these murders. That family and \nmother and young man ran into barrier after barrier and obstacle after \nobstacle trying to find a course of treatment for his very serious set \nof illnesses.\n  What we know is that people with mental illness are much more likely \nto be the victims of gun violence than the perpetrators of it. There is \nno inherent connection between being mentally ill and being violent. \nThere is no greater incidence of mental illness in the United States \nthan anywhere else in the world. Yet we have epidemic rates of gun \nviolence. But I will certainly be the first to admit that if we fix our \nmental health care system, it will help lots of people who have no \nintersections with gun violence, and it will\n\n[[Page S6924]]\n\npush these numbers downward because some of these people are committing \nthese murders because they are not getting treatment for serious \nillnesses.\n  Senator Cassidy and I--frankly, we don't agree on a lot because he is \na conservative Republican from the Deep South, and I am a progressive \nDemocrat from the Northeast--introduced a mental health reform measure \nwhich has broad bipartisan support and which would seek to break down \nthese barriers in order to get care for the seriously mentally ill and \ntry to get the parents more involved in the care, especially of young \nadults. It would increase the capacity in our mental health treatment \nsystem for both outpatient and inpatient care. Maybe over the course of \nthe rest of this year, at the very least we can make a dent in the \nmassive shortfalls in our behavioral health care system.\n  The families I have become so close with in Sandy Hook, CT, commanded \nme to come down to the floor every week or so and tell these stories, \nthe voices of victims. They would like us to come together on a set of \nmeaningful changes to our gun laws. They just don't understand why Adam \nLanza was able to walk into the school with a gun that killed 20 little \nboys and girls in less than 5 minutes because of how powerful it was \nwith the 30-round cartridges he was able to use. They don't want our \ninability to get action on gun laws to stop us from making other \nprogress that would make the next Adam Lanza less likely. Maybe we can \ndo that. But we should do something.\n  Our silence is an embarrassment after this summer of mass shootings. \nThese news reports should command us to action, but we, frankly, \nshouldn't have had to wait for the news reports of shootings in \nVirginia or Louisiana or South Carolina because these numbers were just \nas true last year as they are this year. Maybe there are more episodes \nof mass violence and mass shootings and headline-grabbing atrocities, \nbut these numbers which reflect what is happening on the ground in New \nHaven, CT; Hartford, CT; Boston, MA; Chicago, IL; and Los Angeles have \nbeen a reality for a long time, and we should have woken up long ago. \nBut maybe over the course of this year we can make some progress so \nthat moving forward there are a few less voices of victims to bring to \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Volkswagen\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I rise to speak about recent \nrevelations that Volkswagen woefully deceived regulators and the \ngeneral public to artificially lower emissions of its 2009 to 2015 \nVolkswagen and Audi diesel vehicles. These actions raise significant \nconsumer, environmental, and public health concerns.\n  According to the EPA's Notice of Violation of the Clean Air Act, \nVolkswagen used a sophisticated software algorithm on certain vehicles \nthat detected when vehicles were undergoing emissions testing. This \nsoftware--referred to as a ``defeat device''--allows vehicles to meet \nemissions standards during testing, but under normal driving \nsituations, these same vehicles emit nitrogen oxides up to 40 times the \nallowable emissions standards.\n  This is unbelievable. I think we can imagine that such technology \nexists, but I don't think we ever thought that one of our major \ninternational car companies would be alleged to have used it. So far \napproximately 482,000 diesel vehicles sold in the United States and 11 \nmillion cars worldwide have been affected. A deliberate attempt like \nthis by a company to mislead regulators and the general public is \ncompletely unacceptable.\n  This raises serious questions that need answers: Why did Volkswagen, \nfor more than a year, claim that the discrepancies in the emissions \ntests and the levels on the road were a technical error? Who at \nVolkswagen signed off on the defeat device? Did executives at \nVolkswagen know these actions were put into place to deliberately \ndeceive regulators and the general public? Does the EPA have the \nnecessary testing systems in place to detect such devices that trick \nthe software? Have other auto manufacturers of clean diesel vehicles \nbeen tampering with their software to get around emissions standards? \nHow do we ensure that this never happens again?\n  This is a matter of public trust. Consumers were lied to and sold a \nproduct under false pretenses. Those consumers who brought certain \nVolkswagen Jettas, Beetles, Passats, and certain Audis with 2-liter \ndiesel engines believed they were purchasing a vehicle that would \nprovide premium fuel economy and performance while also meeting strict \nemissions standards. Who wouldn't be enticed by these vehicles after \nthey were named the ``Green Car of the Year'' and ``Eco-Friendly Car of \nthe Year'' by national publications?\n  We now know these consumers were duped and that they will now have to \nbring their vehicles under compliance to meet Federal emissions \nstandards. Volkswagen will likely pay for the repairs but what about \nthe costs of reduced fuel economy and lower resale values?\n  Congress intentionally included strong enforceability elements into \nthe Clean Air Act statute. Regulations promulgated under the Clean Air \nAct aimed to protect human health and the environment by reducing \nnitrogen oxide and other pollutants. Motor vehicles are the primary \nsource of nitrogen oxide pollution from transportation. These highly \nreactive gases play a major role in atmospheric reactions that produce \nsmog.\n  That smog accelerates climate change and exacerbates respiratory \ndiseases that harm human health, including asthma, which affects 23 \nmillion Americans, including 6 million children.\n  That is why we have emissions standards. It is not just some far-off \nnumber that is put into place; it is to protect children from getting \nasthma; it is to protect the world from heating up; it is to ensure \nthat we protect our environment for generations to come.\n  The Clean Air Act requires automakers to certify to the EPA that \ntheir vehicles will meet applicable Federal emissions standards to \ncontrol air pollution. Through this process, Volkswagen deceived \nregulators into believing these vehicles produced low emissions. \nVehicles with the defeat device emit anywhere from 5 to 40 times more \nnitrogen oxide than allowed by law while on the road. If we pick a \nnumber in the middle of the range--let's say 20 times as much--it would \nmean that Volkswagen's fleet in the U.S. produces 46,657 more tons of \nharmful smog.\n  Changes to the EPA's emissions standards testing process are needed \nas well. I have written to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy to express \nthat concern. The EPA needs to explain why their systems did not detect \nthis deceptive software and what changes the Agency will be making with \ntheir testing processes. I strongly urge the EPA to establish robust \nsafeguards to prevent automakers from gaming the system and prevent \nthis from happening again.\n  There must also be a full investigation into Volkswagen's actions. \nThe Department of Justice is conducting a criminal investigation into \nthe company's actions, and I urge DOJ to leave no stone unturned in its \ninvestigation to determine how a company could have willfully deceived \nFederal regulators and the general public.\n  Volkswagen must conduct a thorough and comprehensive public education \ncampaign to ensure that all owners of these vehicles are made aware of \nthe defect and are informed about where and when they can go to get \ntheir vehicle fixed.\n  The Department of Transportation, which has expertise with vehicle \nrecalls, should also play an active role. If we learned anything from \nthe General Motors and Takata airbag recalls, it is that recalls need \nto be broad enough from the outset and cover affected vehicle models \nand years, the general public needs to know how and where to get their \nvehicle repaired, and automakers must have a system in place to make \ntimely repairs with replacement parts that truly fix the problem.\n  Other agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission, should also \ntake a serious look at how they can help in this process.\n\n[[Page S6925]]\n\n  As a member of both the Senate Commerce Committee and the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, I believe that consumers must be protected. I also \nbelieve Volkswagen's competitors that actually follow the law should be \nable to play on an even playing field. Other car companies that follow \nthe law did the right thing. They put the right systems in place, and \nthey should not be penalized because one car company did this. They \nshould have been able to play on an even playing field. If there is an \nuneven playing field, it hurts American employees, it hurts American \ncompanies, and mostly it hurts American consumers.\n  The actions by Volkswagen to deliberately deceive consumers around \nthe world about the emissions levels in their cars is fundamentally \nabout a breach in trust. Consumers thought they were getting the same \nproduct that was being advertised, when what they were getting was a \nproduct that met those standards only when it was tested, only for 1 \nday, and only for the time of the emissions testing.\n  As Federal agencies move forward with their investigation, it is \ncritical that we get to the bottom of this to figure out how this \nhappened, what the extent was, and if it is happening with any other \nautomakers to ensure that what happened never happens again.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Pilot's Bill of Rights 2\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I wish to take advantage of an \nopportunity to bring up the subject that no one is talking about now. \nOf course, right now everyone has been in the middle of the Pope's \nvisit and other things and what is happening with the Iran bill and the \nvotes we have. I wish to mention there is something else very \nsignificant going on right now, that we are in the middle of, and that \nis the Pilot's Bill of Rights 2.\n  To put it into perspective, 3 years ago last month we had the Pilot's \nBill of Rights 1, and it was one people were not aware of. There are \nonly 617,000 pilots in America, so it is not one of these issues that \ngets an awful lot of attention. But the mere fact that those 617,000 \npeople--many of them are single-issue people. A lot of people are not \naware that prior to the passage of the Pilot's Bill of Rights 3 years \nago, there was just one area left within our system whereupon you are \nguilty until proven innocent.\n  That is exactly what we corrected with that bill, just to refresh the \nmemory of my colleagues. It gave the pilots who were accused of \nsomething the evidence that was used against them. I had a personal \nexperience with it. It actually happened to me. I was never sensitive \nto that until such time as I experienced it myself.\n  What we have right now is we are up to 64 cosponsors of the Pilot's \nBill of Rights 2. The major part of this bill is something that is out \nthere that doesn't resolve anything. Ten years ago, as kind of an \nexperiment, we put in a sport pilot-eligible exemption so that the \npilots of small aircraft would not have to have what they call a third-\nclass medical. The result of this was that after a 10-year period, the \nmedical safety experience of these pilots has been identical to those \nwith medical certificates. A joint study was made following that by the \nAircraft Owners and Pilots Association and by the EAA, the Experimental \nAircraft Association, of the 46,976 accidents over a 6-year period. Of \nthose, only 99 had a medical cause as a factor. That is less than one-\nquarter of 1 percent. Of those 99, none would have been prevented by \nthe current third-class medical. That shows that experiment worked and \nthere is no reason to have a third-class medical.\n\n  So people are aware that some changes have been made, I want to \nbriefly outline the modifications that have been made. The \nmodifications require three things for pilots to qualify for an \nexemption. The exemption we are talking about is the exemption from \nhaving to take a third-class medical exemption process every 2 years--\nsometimes more extensive than that.\n  First, pilots will have to complete an online medical education \ncourse. Secondly, pilots have to maintain verification that they have \nbeen to a doctor at least once every 4 years and certify that they are \nreceiving the care they need by a physician to treat any medical \ncondition that warrants it. Third, a pilot would have to complete a \ncomprehensive medical review by the FAA. That would be applied to a new \npilot, so they establish a benchmark as to what a pilot's physical \ncondition is.\n  The pilot would be required to take an online medical course every 2 \nyears. This gives the pilot access to information on medical issues \nthat may not be covered by a doctor in a medical examination but that \nwould have an impact on their physical condition to fly. For example, \nthis course would make sure pilots are aware of impacts on interactions \nof over-the-counter and prescription medications and how these \ninteractions could impact their flying capabilities. Requiring pilots \nto take this course boosts aviation safety for the aviation community.\n  Secondly, pilots would need to complete an exam by their personal \nphysician at least once every 4 years and include a proof of their \ndoctor's visit in their logbooks. This resolves the problem most people \nare concerned about; that they would have to at least see a physician \nand be assured that they didn't have some condition they didn't have \nprior to that. Furthermore, the pilots would be required to certify \nthat they are under the care and treatment of a doctor for any medical \ncondition that would warrant treatment. Pilots would do this instead of \nvisiting an aviation medical examiner every 2 years and sometimes even \nmore frequently than that. With this modification, we are actually \nencouraging pilots to be honest about their health and seek treatment \nfor it.\n  Right now pilots are incentivized to hide any medical condition from \nthe FAA, including by not seeking treatment for it, out of the fear \nthat the pilot might lose his wings. We don't want that to happen. \nPeople who are not pilots do not realize how significant it is that you \ndon't want to be taken out of the air, particularly for some reason \nthat is not justified. Pilots, like any individual, maintain stronger \nrelationships with their personal physician, and this is a good thing \nthat fosters an honest dialogue between pilots and doctors, which is \nsomething we should all want and something that is not there today.\n  We want pilots to get the treatment they need. Any medically treated \npilot is safer than one who is not being treated. So for many pilots \nthe most burdensome aspects of the FAA controversy is simply the \nconstant churn of submitting paperwork over and over, every 2 years or \nless, even when there has been no change in their medical status. This \nbill, as modified, gives pilots a break from the bureaucracy.\n  The third requirement for pilots to receive the third-class medical \nexemption is to complete one FAA medical review. So if a new pilot \ncomes in, we need a benchmark--where is that pilot, what is his \nphysical condition today--so as time goes by we can see how he might be \nchanging. If someone does not have an existing medical certificate, \nsuch as new pilots who have never gone through an exam, they would have \nto do it before they fall into qualifying for the exemption. By the \nway, of the 617,000 pilots in America today, this is the one thing that \nconcerns me more than anything else, which is to have to go back and go \nthrough the type of examination they are required to, now that we know \nthe 10-year experiment of being exempt has worked.\n  There is one caveat. If a pilot flying under the third-class medical \nexemption is diagnosed with a severe condition--let's talk about maybe \na heart attack--then they need to go through the FAA special issuance \nprocess to receive medical clearance to fly again. Again, this would \nonly be needed to be done one time.\n  The ability of the FAA to maintain a stranglehold on pilots will be \ngone. I am confident the changes will result in a safer flying \nenvironment. I want to reiterate that the Pilot's Bill of Rights does \nnot change the certification standard to obtain a pilot's certificate. \nAll pilots still have to possess the pilot's certificate, pass the \nrequired practical tests and necessary check rides to\n\n[[Page S6926]]\n\ndemonstrate that they have the knowledge, skills, and ability to safely \noperate their plane.\n  Further, this bill does not change the fundamental responsibility of \nevery pilot to self-certify their ability to fly each time they get \ninto the cockpit of a plane. I am a pilot, and every time I get in a \nplane I make a conscious decision that I am fit to fly. Everyone I know \nwho is a pilot does the same thing.\n  Again, all of this is not necessary. When you go back and realize \nthat over the 10 years of the experiment with a limited number of \npilots there were no changes. There is no difference between those who \nhave or have not had the pilot exams. With these changes, the third-\nclass medical exemption and the Pilot's Bill of Rights is enjoying a \ngreater level of support from Members of the Senate. Support from \ngeneral aviation is strongly bipartisan. Sixty-four of my colleagues \nare cosponsors of this legislation. Half of those are Democrats and \nhalf are Republicans. Groups representing general aviation in the \ncommunity and in the pilot unions have declared their support for the \nbill. General aviation organizations, such as the Aircraft Owners and \nPilots Association, the Experimental Pilots Association, and the \nGeneral Aviation Manufacturers Association, support the bill. The \nNational Association of State Aviation Officials support the bill, the \nAllied Pilots Association and the Southwest Pilots Association, both \nunions which represent 23,000 pilots who fly for American Airlines, \nU.S. Airways, and Southwest Airlines, support the bill. Pilots for \nNetJets support the bill.\n  The bill has strong bipartisan support. I urge all the Members who \nsupport general aviation and all the economic activity of general \naviation to be a part of this bill.\n  One of the reasons I am doing this today is one of the two \norganizations--and I am not sure which one it is, it is either the AOPA \nor the AA--is doing a major effort right now to encourage the pilot \npopulation out there to encourage their Members of the Senate to \ncosponsor this bill. Again, we currently have 64 sponsors of the bill. \nI can't think of any reason we can't get everyone else. The same \nindividuals who supported it 3 years ago should be there to support it. \nSo I encourage those few Members of the Senate who are not sponsors to \nlook at it very carefully.\n  It may be 617,000 people are not a lot of people, but of the 617,000 \npeople, most of them are single-issue people. So it would be very good \nto join in on this. This is something we now have demonstrated clearly \nis not going to incur any safety hazards and it is going to be a real \ngodsend for pilots who don't want to go through this bureaucracy every \n2 years or more frequently in some cases. The bill is out there, and it \nis one I feel very strongly that we ought to be able to work into our \nfloor use probably in the next very short period of time.\n  With that, I do yield the floor because my very good friend from \nDelaware is here to say something profound.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                         Transportation Funding\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I don't know that I will say anything \nprofound, but I appreciate the chairman of our committee saying that.\n  Madam President, and fellow native West Virginian, I will show a map \nof the United States in just a minute, and there are some States that \nare delaying and some States that are cutting back on transportation \nprojects. One of them is West Virginia. One of them is Delaware. I want \nto talk a little bit about that.\n  Before I do, I would like to go back in time 10 months to the \nelection of last year. I am reminded of the message I heard from the \nelectorate that came out of that election. To simplify it, there were \nthree things they were trying to tell us. No. 1, they want us to work \ntogether; No. 2, they want us to get things done; and, No. 3, they want \nus to get things done that will actually strengthen our economic \nrecovery.\n  If you go back in time to the January--the week Barack Obama and Joe \nBiden were inaugurated as President and Vice President, 628,000 people \nfiled for unemployment insurance in that 1 week in January of 2009. Any \ntime that weekly number of people filing for unemployment insurance is \nover 400,000, we are losing jobs in this country and in the economy.\n  Last Thursday we got a number from the Department of Labor. Last \nweek's number was about 265,000 who filed for unemployment. That was \nlast week. There is a new number today--I am not sure what it was, but \nfor the last 28 weeks that number of people filing for unemployment \ninsurance has been under 300,000. I think that is the longest that we \nhave been keeping track, where we had 28 consecutive weeks where fewer \nthan 300,000 people in this country were applying for unemployment \ninsurance. That number is way under 400,000, so we are adding jobs, and \nwe are expecting to continue to add jobs in this country.\n  There are still people looking for jobs in my State, there are in \nWest Virginia, and other States as well, but when you consider the \nunemployment rate was about 10 percent in the early part of 2009 and \ntoday it is a little over 5 percent, we are making progress, but we can \nmake a lot more progress.\n  One of the ways we can make progress is by dealing with our fiscal \nplan and not hold the Nation's economy hostage with our inability to \npass a spending plan. And God help us if we drop the ball on this again \nand have another shutdown. I sure hope we come to our senses and avoid \ndoing that. My hope is that we will.\n  One of the other ways we can strengthen our economic recovery--and it \nis right out there for us to seize and do--is to make sure that in a \nnation where roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems are \ndeteriorating, where we need to make improvements and we need to build, \nfrankly, new projects--new highways, bridges, roads and transit \nsystems--at the very least we need to maintain the quality of what we \nhave or improve the quality of road safety, surfaces, potholes, you \nname it. There is a lot of work to be done, and there are a lot of \npeople who would like to do the work.\n  The McKinsey Global Institute, an arm of the national consulting firm \nMcKinsey, looked at what we could do for our growing GDP in this \ncountry if we fully funded a 6-year transportation plan, what we could \ndo for an employment opportunity if we funded a 6-year transportation \nplan, and the numbers are remarkable--I think amazing.\n  We were told that fully funding a 6-year transportation plan would \ngrow our GDP by approximately 1.5 percent per year--not for 1 year but \nfor the life of the transportation plan that we funded--probably 6 \nyears at 1.5 percent a year. When you consider the GDP growth over the \nlast couple years, even though it is better than it was, adding 1.5 \npercent of the GDP growth would help our economy grow in a robust way. \nWe are told by McKinsey & Company's study that a 6-year transportation \nplan robustly funded would put about 1.8 million people to work. A lot \nof folks would like to be building roads, highways, and transportation \nsystems, and they don't have employment opportunities because we are \nnot funding them. We are not funding them.\n  Let's take a quick look at this map if we could. The States that are \ngray are States, as far as we know, that are not planning to delay or \ncancel projects. They are not even considering delaying projects, but \nthe States that are in red, including Delaware over here, are States \nthat have delayed or cancelled projects. The States that are in yellow, \nincluding West Virginia, are States that are considering project \ndelays.\n  That is not good. I have not counted the number of States--it looks \nlike seven--that are in red. Those are the States that have delayed \nprojects. More than that, probably 10, are considering doing that. Why \nis it important for us to fully fund at the Federal level--do our share \nfor roads, highways, bridges, transit funding? It is because about half \nof the money that our States spend through their departments of \ntransportation, half their money comes from Federal user fees--largely \nFederal user fees--primarily, not entirely, but primarily user fees on \nthe sale of gasoline. It has been unchanged in 23 years--not since \n1993--22 years. The user fee on diesel has been unchanged for some 22 \nyears, right where we were. The price of everything else goes up. \nConcrete goes up, asphalt goes up, steel goes up, and labor goes up.\n  We have more energy-efficient vehicles. They are not using as much \ngas or\n\n[[Page S6927]]\n\ndiesel. That is a good thing, but it is also a bad thing for having \nfunding for transportation projects. So I want to look at a map and \nwould invite all of us to consider it. I don't anybody who says--any \neconomist worth their salt--who does not say: Fully funding a multi-\nyear transportation plan, not for 6 months or 3 months, something like \nthat, but fully funding it--robustly funding it for 6 years--will do \ngreat things for our economy.\n  The reason we end up with job growth of something like 1.8 million \npeople, according to McKinsey and Company, is because the economy works \nfar more efficiently if roads, highways, bridges are operating and \nworking well. So I just want to share that and start off my remarks \ntoday.\n  I have some numbers here that I would like to share. So far in 2015, \nthis year, four States--Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, and Wyoming--have \nshelved some $805 million in projects due to the uncertainty over \nFederal funds. Again, the uncertainty is over roughly half the money \nthat they are going to spend on roads, highways, and bridges. It comes \nfrom Federal user fees, Federal taxes.\n  Our transportation system--at least the way we fund it--has been \nbroken since 2008. Since that time, in the last 5 or 6 years, we have \npassed I think 12 short-term patches to the tune of nearly $74 billion. \nHow do we pay for them? We pay for them with budget gimmicks. That is \nhow we do it. And we pay for them with debt. When we issue debt, we \nborrow money. We sell Treasury securities, and we sell them around the \nworld. Among the countries that buy them are China and the Chinese \npeople. We are then beholden to them as our creditors. It puts us in a \nsituation that I do not find too comfortable. My guess is some of you \ndon't either.\n  There are better alternatives to fund our Nation's transportation \nsystem. I only mentioned a couple of them. I feel as if I have not a \nmagic wand but the ability to see into the future. Twenty years from \nnow, I think there is a pretty good chance that we will have figured \nout how to pay for roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems by \nfiguring out how to make sure those folks who use transportation pay \nfor it. One of the ways we are trying to do that--they have been trying \nto do that in Oregon for almost 10 years. They have something called \nroad user charge. Some people have heard of that term. More people have \nheard of something called vehicle miles traveled, and the ability to \nsay your vehicle--I don't care what kind of vehicle it is, but we know \nhow many miles that vehicle travels on a road, highway or bridge in the \ncourse of a year. There is fee that is attached to that. Some people \nare uncomfortable with that because it has implications on privacy. I \ncan understand that.\n  In Oregon they are trying to figure it out. They have got about 5,000 \nvehicles--at least--in their system. They are sort of--I like to say \nStates are laboratories of democracy. In this case, Oregon is trying to \nbe the laboratory. I believe California is looking at being another \nlaboratory to figure out we make something like vehicle miles traveled \nwork in a State. Oregon is good-sized state, and California is a very \nbig State. If they can do that, then we will learn from them, not just \nat the State level but perhaps at the Federal level as well.\n  I think we will be funding projects--not just now but in the future, \n20 years from now--through tooling. When I travel back to my native \nState of West Virginia, I go through West Virginia and I pay tolls. \nWhen I was a little kid and they first built the turnpike, we would \nhave to stop and find change--whatever--stop every 5 or 10 miles. You \ndon't do that anymore. We don't do that anymore in Delaware either, \nbecause we have--in Delaware and I think in West Virginia--highway-\nspeed E-ZPass. It is an express E-ZPass. You go through, and it is \ncharged to your credit card that you have already established when you \nestablish your E-ZPass plan.\n  Also, we now have the technology that even if folks don't have an E-\nZPass--in some tolling operations around the country, a person drives \nthrough in their vehicle, car, truck, van, whatever the system--when \nyou go through the toll plaza, they don't collect a toll. They have a \nhighly accurate camera with the ability to take pictures of the vehicle \nand great pictures of your license plates, and then they send a bill to \nthe owner of that vehicle. So you don't even have to have high-speed E-\nZPass. But a combination of those two, systems like E-ZPass and systems \nlike the one I just described where people drive through with no E-\nZPass or a similar system, but they actually get billed for it later \non. They do not get billed and fined; they just get billed for it. If \nyou don't pay it, then I am sure something will happen.\n  But I think 20 years from now we will have something that looks a lot \nlike that. My guess is we will also have user fees, but not everybody \nlikes tolling. As it turns out, Oregon has been working on road user \ncharge, also known as vehicle miles traveled. They have been working on \nit for 10 years, and they have got 5,000 people in the plan. So this is \nnot going to happen in 5 years or 10 years, but maybe 20 years for both \na combination of tolling and vehicle miles traveled.\n  There is another idea out there that is used in some places around \nthe country. It is called 3P or P3. When I first heard that, I thought \nthey were talking about P-3 airplanes. I spent a lot of years of my \nlife as a naval flight officer in P-3 aircraft. I used to command them, \nbut they were not talking about airplanes when they were talking about \nP3. They were talking about public-private partnerships. We have some \npretty good examples of where that is working. We can learn from those \nin different States. I think that can be part of the future. It ought \nto be.\n  Put the three of them together, is that a comprehensive plan? Not \nentirely, but it is pretty good approach. It is a heck of a lot better \nthan what we have been doing: pension smoothing, increasing fees for \nTSA. Instead of improving aviation safety, we put the money in the \ntransportation trust fund. Raising Customs fees--instead of putting the \nmoney in ways to make our borders most robust and so forth, we put some \nof that money in the transportation trust fund.\n  We sell oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve--I think probably \nat a bad time to sell it, when the price is really low. They say: Buy \nlow, sell high. Well, if we are going to sell petroleum out of the \npetroleum reserve--the price of oil is about as low right now as it has \nbeen in a long, long time.\n  I am told that--I don't know if it was last week or the week before--\nthere are 10,000 gasoline stations across the country where they are \nselling gasoline for less than $2 a gallon. I don't know what they are \ncharging in West Virginia, but I filled up my Chrysler Town and Country \nminivan, which has 403,000 miles on it, and I paid $2.15 a gallon. \nThere are some places in Delaware where people are paying less and in \nneighboring New Jersey where they are paying less. But right now, it \ndoes not make much sense to sell oil out of our Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. There are some people who want to and who want to use that \nmoney to go into the transportation trust fund. I think that is \nfoolish. We have to be smarter than that.\n  I have another chart I want us to take a look at. I want to thank \n``Vanna White'' here for putting up these charts. I will pay for that \nlater. This chart talks about legislation--it is kind of ironic. That \nis S. 1994. I mentioned earlier how the last time we raised the Federal \ngasoline and diesel tax or fee was in 1993 when we raised it to 18 \ncents for gas and about 23, 24 cents for diesel. They have been there \nfor 22 years.\n  One of the things I have done is introduce legislation, and I have \ndone so with Dick Durbin, who used to serve on the Bowles-Simpson \nCommission--remember the Bowles-Simpson Commission. I thought it was a \ngreat approach to figure out how to seriously address our Nation's \ndeficit in a variety of ways. One of the ways that Bowles-Simpson said \nwe should address our deficit situation--I will say our budget deficits \nare down--topped out, I think, in 2009 at $1.4 trillion. This year we \nare down about $400 billion. Is that an improvement? Yes, it is. Do we \nhave some ways to go? We sure do.\n  What Bowles-Simpson suggested is that we raise the gas or diesel tax \nat the Federal level by a penny each quarter, a penny every 3 months \nfor 15 quarters. So effectively you would be raising the gas or diesel \ntax by 3 or 4 cents a year for 4 years and index it going forward.\n\n[[Page S6928]]\n\n  What Senator Durbin and I have introduced is actually something quite \nsimilar to that, which a majority of the Bowles-Simpson Commission \nvoted for. It is called the Traffic Relief Act. What it calls for is an \nannual 4 cent gas increase in gas and diesel. That would be for a total \nof about 4 years--4 cents a year for 4 years. After that, we would \nindex those user fees, those taxes, to the rate of inflation. The rate \nof inflation is pretty low lately, so they would not go up very much if \nthe rate of inflation stays where it is. If the rate of inflation rears \nits head again, then that would be different.\n  A fellow who was a member of my staff back in Wilmington, DE--when we \nintroduced this bill, the price for gas at a station in the \nneighborhood where his family buys gas--in the space of 2 days, the \nprice of gas either went up or went down by 13 cents. It went up in 2 \ndays, 13 cents. As we know, the price of oil moves up and down all of \nthe time.\n  My own belief is--and I have heard this from a lot of people--there \nare a lot of days or a lot of weeks where the price of gas or diesel \ngoes up a lot more than 4 cents. Right now our world is not literally \nawash in oil but certainly figuratively awash in oil. One of the \nreasons the price at the pump for gas and diesel is so low--as I said \nearlier, a couple of weeks ago there were 10,000 gas stations across \nthe country selling gas for less than two bucks a gallon. One of the \nreasons it is so low is because the United States is producing a lot \nmore than we have for some time, and so are a bunch of other countries, \nincluding the OPEC nations.\n  With the approval of the Iran agreement, as the Iranians comply with \nthe agreement--my hope is that they will comply in spirit and in \nletter, and then as a result of that, they will be in a position to \nbegin selling. They have only been selling some of their oil products \nto customers, including I think India, maybe Japan, China, but they \nwill be able to sell more products. A world that is already awash in \noil is going to find that Iran, which I think has the fourth greatest \noil reserves in the world, is going to be back in the market and \nselling their own products. I believe that will keep the prices from \nrising anytime soon. And I think there is reason to believe that the \nprice at the pump, which is already quite low, might even go down \nfurther. Time will tell.\n\n  I have one last poster board here I wish to look at for just a \nmoment.\n  Our legislation--this is a typo here. It says that it restores $240 \nbillion for the highway trust fund. It is not $240 billion, it is $220 \nbillion. Still, compared to what? Compared to nothing. Compared to \ndoing nothing, it is a whole lot. If we had a status quo, any kind of a \nstatus quo increase--a highway bill or a transportation bill--we would \nuse maybe half of that. So what we are talking about is double, just \ngetting by, And we have such a backlog of work to do, that it doesn't \nmake sense just to push enough money to these projects to get by.\n  This would provide roughly twice that amount of money and would maybe \nnot raise our GDP by 1.5 percent, but it would sure raise it. It may \nnot put 1.8 million people to work over the next year, but it would put \na lot of people to work and people who like to do these jobs.\n  The money would fully fund the Federal highway and transit programs \nin our country. It would increase investments in upgrades and in \nrepairs as well. It would do it in a way that doesn't drop a huge \nburden on users of these products--gasoline and diesel--all in one fell \nswoop. It is like 4 cents a year over 4 years. After 4 years, there \nwill be a 16-cent increase.\n  People say: Well, what is that in terms of practical impact? What \ndoes that actually mean for somebody?\n  I am told that it is actually--I don't drink a lot of coffee, but my \nfriends who do get a small coffee over in the Dirksen Building across \nthe street. They pay $1.70, and if they get a medium-sized coffee, it \nis like $2.50, and a really big one is maybe a little bit over $3. This \nis not really fancy coffee but just a regular cup of coffee with cream \nand sugar, and the price is maybe $2 or $3. Literally for the price of \na cup of coffee a week, for those of us who use roads, highways, \nbridges, who buy gas, who buy diesel, we could have a much better \ntransportation system. This isn't $10 a week or $20 a week or $30 a \nweek. That increase over 4 years--4 cents a year for 4 years--without \nthe data for the average driver, that is about a cup of coffee a week. \nIs that too much to pay for roads, highways, bridges, and a good \ntransit system? I don't think so.\n  There is an interest in offsetting some of these increases with a \nregressive tax, but there is an interest in offsetting some of that by \nmaking some tweaks like Michigan is going to do with their State \nearned-income tax credit with a Republican Governor and Republican \nlegislature. I think there is maybe a lesson or something we can do \nthere to help address the regressive nature of this tax.\n  I close by saying I come to this floor from time to time and I \nmention one of the things I love to do. I don't know if you ever do \nthis, Madam President, but I love to ask people who have been married a \nlong time ``What is the secret for being married for a long time?'' I \nhave done it for years. I have asked this question of hundreds of \npeople who are older folks who have been married 30 years, 40 years, 50 \nyears, 60 years, 70 years. I ask them ``What is the secret?'' I get \nhilarious answers. I get some that are very poignant and others are \njust plain memorable for a lot of reasons. But the best answer I have \never gotten is there are two C's. What are the two C's? Communicate and \ncompromise.\n  That is not only the secret for a vibrant marriage between two \npeople, it is also the secret for a vibrant democracy, to communicate \nand compromise. I would add a third C, and that is to collaborate. What \nthe American people said to us last November--whether they are \nRepublicans, Democrats, or Independents--is that they want us to \ncommunicate, they want us to compromise, and they want us to \ncollaborate, and we need to do that.\n  One idea I have not mentioned here bears mentioning. It was an idea \nthat was endorsed last year by the administration and was endorsed last \nyear by the immediate past chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, \nwith whom our President served, Dave Camp. He retired earlier this year \nas a Congressman from Michigan, a very good person. What they proposed \nis international tax reform. What both Chairman Camp at the time and \nthe administration said is that there are about $2 trillion in overseas \nprofits of American companies. They are just keeping it over there and \nthey are not that anxious to bring it back because they don't want to \nhave to pay--I don't know--35 percent, 33 percent, 32 percent, 29 \npercent. They are looking for a lower tax break and then to bring it \nback when it makes sense.\n  The administration and Dave Camp said: Let's deem it repatriated.\n  The Treasury said: All right. You have money over there, American \ncompanies. Bring it back. It is going to be taxed at about 10 percent.\n  That was the proposal.\n  The administration said: American companies that have money over \nthere, we want you to bring it back. You won't be taxed at 35 percent \nor 25 percent, but you will be taxed at about 14 percent.\n  That is an idea, and it is an interesting idea. It doesn't solve the \nproblem forever. It provides one-time money--quite a bit of it--for \nroads, bridges, rail, and for airports as well. It doesn't solve the \nproblem permanently, but it surely gives us a lot of money. Not every \ncompany likes that idea, and not everybody who serves here likes that \nidea, but it is a serious idea, and it is one that deserves a lot of \nconsideration, and I hope we will do that.\n\n  Let me just say this. At the end of the day, if we come to the end of \nthis calendar year--when we run out of money yet again for roads, \nhighways, and bridges and we say ``Well, what are we going to do \nnow?''--we will have not just the States I pointed out here in yellow \nand red that are bailing on projects, delaying and stopping them in \nsome cases, we will have a lot more yellow and a whole lot more red on \nthe map I had up earlier. What do we do about it? Do we just do what we \nhave done for 5 years and kick the can down the road yet again and look \nfor cats and dogs and wherever we can find a few bucks and sort of \nthrow them at the problem for a while, not make a real committed \neffort? Frankly, we are not giving the voters in this country any \nreason to feel encouraged about our courage. I hope we don't do that.\n\n[[Page S6929]]\n\n  If at the end of the day we don't do some kind of international tax \nreform, good ideas such as expanding tolling, vehicle miles traveled, \nand public-private partnerships--those are all good ideas, and I hope \nwe grow them all. We are not going to have them all in place in the \nkind of scope we need by the end of this year.\n  If we find ourselves at a time and place where we run out of money, \nwhere the States are looking to us and we are running out of money at \nthe Federal level--and the price of gas is two bucks a gallon at gas \nstations across America--my hope is people will say: You know, for the \nprice of a cup of coffee, I could have good roads, highways, bridges, \nand transit systems again. For the price of a cup of coffee a week, I \ncould have that. Forty cents a week, maybe.\n  Maybe that is not a bad deal for their family or for our country. I \nwant people to think about that.\n  In the weeks to come, I am going to be talking a lot about this \nproposal. My hope is that as time goes buy, people will say--like my \ndad used to say in West Virginia when my sister and I were little kids \ngrowing up and they were in West Virginia--my dad used to say to my \nsister and me after we had done yet another boneheaded stunt: Just use \nsome common sense. He said that a lot. He did not say it that nicely. \nBut I think this may be an opportunity for us to use some of that \ncommon sense here, and I know he would approve, and at the end of the \nday, so would the voters of America.\n  There are a number of States that have actually done what I am \ntalking about. They have raised their user fees, and in some cases they \nhave phased them in over a couple of years. It is interesting what \nhappened in the elections last year where the State legislators had \nvoted to do that, where they raised the user fees in order to would pay \nfor roads, highways, and bridges. Interestingly enough, the legislators \nwho voted for that--Republicans--didn't get thrown out of office. \nNinety-five percent of them were reelected. They won their primaries, \nthey won their general elections, and they were reelected. The \nDemocrats who voted for those modest user fees increases didn't get \nthrown out of office either. In the States that raised the money \nlocally to make the improvements that were needed in transportation, 90 \npercent of the Democrats won their primaries and they won their general \nelections. They were reelected.\n  People want us to make hard choices here. They don't want us to \ncontinue to kid them or fool them; they want us to do the real thing. \nThey want us to work together. They want us to get things done. They \nwant us to strengthen our economic recovery, and this is not a bad way \nto do that.\n  With that, I see a great American from New Mexico has joined us. He \nis somebody who has worked with the Senator from Louisiana and the \nSenator who was just here before, Mr. Inhofe, the chairman of the EPW \nCommittee, to try to find a good way for us to strengthen the economic \nrecovery and at the same time to further clean our air, promote public \nhealth, and do good things for our public environment. I wish to say to \nTom Udall how proud I am to be his colleague and how much I appreciate \nhis leadership position on a very important issue, an environmental law \nthat hasn't been updated in almost 40 years and, frankly, doesn't work. \nIt has never worked, and we need to do something about it. Under his \nleadership, along with our other two colleagues, my hope is that we \nwill. I look forward to what he has to say.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                                  TSCA\n\n  Mr. UDALL. Madam President, thank you very much for the recognition.\n  I wish to say to Senator Carper about TSCA that we have been working \non--you were one of the early Senators who really cared about this \nissue. You were involved with it, and you helped it develop. Over time, \nwe did a marvelous thing in terms of improving what Senator Frank \nLautenberg had put on the table, bipartisan--he developed a lot of \nRepublican and Democratic support--and you were a key player all the \nway through.\n  So we know--we think at this point, you and I believe--and we do a \nlot of visiting around on both sides of the aisle--that this is ready \nto go. We now have I think 53 cosponsors. We are developing more \ncosponsors every day, and we don't think there is any real hostility \ntoward the bill in terms of wanting amendments that aren't relevant. \nThat is a key factor for us, and both sides need to focus on that.\n  I would like to express my appreciation to you for what you have done \non TSCA to help blend it into and make it into a bipartisan product. We \nhave been trying--you know, it has been very busy with the Pope in \ntown, with the sequester facing us and the shutdown and things such as \nthat. We have been trying to get onto the floor to talk about this, and \nI think we are going to continue to do that in the future. But it is \ntremendously important that this gets some floor time now, and I know \nyou have been working on that with me.\n  Do you see this as a product that is better than current law? I mean, \nmy sense is it is much better than the current law.\n  Mr. CARPER. If I could respond to my friend, I have a friend who--\nwhen you ask him ``How are you doing?'' he says ``Compared to what?'' \nAnd when we talk about the legislation initially introduced by Senator \nLautenberg, Senator Vitter, and now coauthored by you, Senator Vitter, \nand Senator Inhofe, with input from a number of us, I always say: Well, \ncompared to what?\n  The idea here is to ensure that the EPA does its due diligence on \ntoxic substances in this country. And there are thousands or tens of \nthousands of chemicals--you know better than I do--that exist in our \nenvironment--in our air, our ground, in water--tens of thousands. Are \nthey all toxic? No. But my recollection--correct me if I am wrong in \nthis, but I think that out of those thousands, tens of thousands, I \nbelieve the EPA in the last 38 years has actually done their due \ndiligence on really fewer than 200, maybe even fewer than 10 when you \nget down to it, maybe even just 5.\n  And you say: How long has this bill been around, this law been \naround? Thirty-eight years. And they have now finished work on five \nhighly toxic substances? If we can't do better than that, we ought to \nquit, and this is not the time to quit.\n  It is sort of like football. You take the kickoff, and you are in \nyour own territory and you start marching down the field. You get into \nthe other team's territory, get down to the 20-yard line, and you are \nin the red zone--not in the end zone, but you are in the red zone.\n  I think with your leadership and that of our colleagues, we are in \nthe red zone. We need to bring this onto the floor with 53 cosponsors \nequally divided between Democrats and Republicans. There is a lot of \ninterest in the House, and I think there is support from the \nadministration. We ought to get this done.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. UDALL. Madam President, it bears repeating. Senator Carper is \nvery modest, and he is a humble man, but he has done a lot to help \nbring us to this point. I think he is one of the Senators here who work \nthe best across the aisle, and that is what has happened. We have had a \nlot of Senators who have wanted to work across the aisle on this bill. \nAs Senator Carper knows, on the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nhe was joined by Senator Booker, Senator Whitehouse, and Senator \nMerkley in terms of helping to mark up the bill and make it a better \nproduct.\n  When the Senator talks about going across the finish line, with 53 \ncosponsors about evenly divided between Democrat and Republican--I \nthink it is almost exactly even--that sends a signal to our majority \nleader that this has tremendous support in both caucuses. I believe the \nPresiding Officer here is on the bill. So everybody standing on the \nSenate floor right now is on what is a good, bipartisan product.\n  So we are going to work very carefully in the next couple of days to \nsee that attention is brought to this, and hopefully we will have an \nopportunity to have a debate with amendments and then meet with the \nHouse. The House, as Senator Carper knows, has already passed a piece \nof legislation, I think 378 to 1--1 person in the House opposing it. So \nwe have a bill that is alive and ready to go, and we need to get it out\n\n[[Page S6930]]\n\nof the Senate so we can conference it with the House and get it to the \nPresident's desk for his signature.\n  I don't know if the Senator has any other thoughts on what is the \nbest way to move forward. I mean, obviously we have to be bipartisan, \nbut at this particular point, is it the Senator's sense we are ready to \ngo, from everything he has seen from the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee and these other Senators in various places? Is it ready to \ngo?\n  Mr. CARPER. If I may respond to my colleague's question, I don't care \nif the majority leader is a Republican or a Democrat--they are always \ntrying to figure out how do we have time on the calendar to get this \nstuff done. They are always looking at ways. And one of the best ways \nto ensure legislation actually fits into a reasonably small period of \ntime is to line up bipartisan support.\n  I tell my colleague, I have been here in the Senate for a while, and \nthis is almost a picture-book way to pass legislation: Work it up \nthrough the grassroots--Democratic Lautenberg and Republican Vitter and \nnow with your role and others. There are not many bills in the Senate \nthat have 26 or 27 Democrats and an equal number of Republicans.\n  Has everything been worked out? No. Is there a need for amendments? \nYes. Is there a need for a filibuster? No. We should bring it to the \nfloor.\n  I think we should go to the majority leader and visit with him early \nand often and continue to remind him. And those who believe in this, \nwhether they happen to be on the environmental side or happen to be \nfolks in the health care arena or maybe on the manufacturing side--and \nwe thank those who have helped us draft this--we ask for them not to be \nsilent about it but to urge not just us but the leadership to find \ntime--a couple of days--to bring this bill to the floor and just get it \ndone.\n  With that, I say to my colleague and the Presiding Officer, if I put \ndown my microphone and pack up my bag, I can have dinner with my wife \nin the First State of Delaware, and that is my goal. So I will bid you \nadieu.\n  Mr. UDALL. I thank the Senator. I wish you Godspeed on that train \nheaded to Wilmington because you have a wonderful wife.\n  Mr. CARPER. Well, it is not the last train to Clarksville, but it is \nthe next train to Wilmington.\n  Mr. UDALL. And let me say again that not only on TSCA, as Senator \nCarper held, we were going to have speeches earlier in the week, but we \nwere unable, with some of the scheduling issues and everything, to get \ndown here and talk as a group. We had Senator Whitehouse, who was going \nto come down, and Senator Merkley was going to come down, as well as \nseveral of the key members of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee who played such a big role in terms of moving this bill \nforward.\n  The person who really kicked this off was Senator Frank Lautenberg. \nWhat a star in terms of bipartisanship. I remember working with him \nwhen I was on the Environment and Public Works Committee for a long \nperiod of time on a very substantive piece of legislation. It was so \ngood, we couldn't find much bipartisanship on it, and he understood \nthat. It got out of the committee. It wasn't ready for prime time here \non the floor, and so what we ended up doing was saying we need to go \nback to square one. Senator Lautenberg took that very seriously. He met \nwith Senator Vitter. Senator Manchin played a role in that, and Senator \nManchin was one of the ones who were going to come to the floor to \ntalk, and he played a role in getting them together. As a result, a \nbipartisan bill came out in the last Congress. That has continued now \nfor almost 2\\1/2\\ years, and it is a very good product.\n  Madam President, the American people want a government that works, \nnot one that shuts down to send a message. They want a Congress that \nmoves the Nation forward, not one that grinds to a halt. They want a \nresponsible budget that supports working families and strengthens our \neconomy and creates jobs. These should be our priorities, not an attack \non women's health care.\n  I understand some people have strong views about a woman's right to \nchoose that are different from mine. There are strong differences of \nopinion on many important issues in this Senate and in the Congress--\nhealth care, energy, climate change, foreign policy. We could make a \nvery long list.\n  I read an insightful quote the other day from my good friend \nRepublican Senator Lamar Alexander. Senator Alexander said: ``If we had \na shutdown every time we had a dispute over a contentious issue, the \ngovernment would never open.'' I think that is a very wise observation. \nWe do have many differences, but, most importantly, we must have the \nbroader national interest in mind.\n  The clock is ticking. Funding runs out in just a few days. We need a \nclean continuing resolution, and we need it now--a temporary funding \nbill just to keep the lights on.\n  Have we forgotten what happened 2 years ago? The people of my home \nState of New Mexico have not forgotten. We were badly hurt by the \nshutdown then, and we would be badly hurt by a shutdown now.\n  In Los Alamos and Sandia, our two DOE labs are working on modernizing \naging nuclear weapons systems to keep them safe and secure. It is \nfoolish to cause unnecessary disruption to projects of this \nsignificance where there is no margin for error. Each of these labs \nemploys thousands of people, many of them scientists at the top of \ntheir field. Why would we threaten their paychecks and the important \nnational security work they are doing?\n  We have three Air Force bases in New Mexico--Cannon, Kirtland, and \nHolloman--all serving a variety of unique national security missions \nfor our country. White Sands Missile Range, unlike any facility in the \ncountry, provides critical research and testing for future \ntechnologies. Shutdowns and sequestration send a terrible message to \nthe men and women at these facilities. It limits their effectiveness \nand harms the economies in nearby communities, such as Clovis, \nAlbuquerque, Alamogordo, and Dona Ana County.\n  Shutdowns mean lost jobs and lost revenue, all in the face of a \nstruggling economy. We cannot afford another government shutdown, and \nwe cannot afford a return to sequester cuts. These are bad choices. \nThese are self-inflicted wounds.\n  A clean CR will keep the government open, but we need a long-term \ncure. We need a bipartisan budget agreement--one that makes smart \ninvestments and meets the real needs of American families.\n  The people of my State work hard. Many are still struggling. The \neconomy of New Mexico has not yet recovered completely from the \nrecession. We know New Mexicans want us to come together and push for a \nstronger recovery. New Mexicans are eager for solutions, and they are \ntired of these political games that threaten jobs and weaken our \neconomy. Yet here we are once again facing a manufactured crisis.\n  We all know that in fiscal year 2016, which begins next week, the \nMurray-Ryan budget deal will expire and we will be left with a return \nto sequestration.\n  As ranking member of the interior subcommittee on the Committee on \nAppropriations, I would like to talk about that today because the \nimpacts of the funding levels required by the Budget Control Act are \nclear and they are very destructive. Just look at the Senate Interior \nappropriations bill reported out of the committee in June. To stay \nwithin the spending limits we faced under sequestration, it slashes \nmore than $2 billion from the President's budget request. That means it \ndoesn't provide enough funding for basic water infrastructure or to \nprotect our public lands or to fulfill our trust responsibility to \nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives.\n  I know my chairman, Senator Murkowski, did the very best she could \nwith the allocation she was given, but here is the reality: The Budget \nControl Act caps don't meet the needs of our Nation. They fail critical \nprograms. They fail our communities in New Mexico and nationwide.\n  Our Nation faces an infrastructure crisis. Yet the Senate bill cuts \ngrants to States for water and sewer infrastructure by more than $500 \nmillion below fiscal year 2015 levels.\n  Actions have consequences, and here are the consequences of the \nSenate bill: Some 230 communities will not have their water projects \nfunded, 14,000 construction jobs will not be created, and\n\n[[Page S6931]]\n\n$1 billion in matching and leveraged funds from State partners will be \nlost.\n  The Senate bill also shortchanges the National Park Service with $318 \nmillion less than the President requested. That means 1,000 fewer park \nrangers. That means $150 million less to maintain our national parks \neven though the Service will celebrate its centennial in 2016 and will \nhost a record number of visitors at national parks nationwide.\n  We have 15 national parks in New Mexico, including our newest \nnational park, the Valles Caldera National Preserve. These parks and \nother public lands in my State are critical not only for conservation \nbut for our economy. A shutdown would be a disaster; sequestration is \njust a slower moving disaster. Carlsbad Caverns National Park, \nBandelier National Monument, Tent Rocks National Monument, Bosque Del \nApache Wildlife Refuge, and many other sites are key economic assets. \nThese sites help grow jobs, they help communities grow, and they are \ngreat conservation assets in communities across the country. We cannot \nkeep asking them to do more and more on less. Yet, without a sensible \nbudget, that is exactly where we are headed in New Mexico and across \nthe Nation.\n  The Senate Interior appropriations bill also cuts more than $300 \nmillion from the President's request for the Indian Health Service. We \nhave a solemn trust responsibility to Native Americans, and we are \nfailing. Again, these are not just numbers. The impact is very real and \nvery painful. It means the Indian Health Service will fund 20,000 fewer \ndoctor visits in 2016 and nearly 1,000 fewer hospital stays. It means \nfalling further behind. We need a responsible budget to meet our \nobligation to the Indian Health Service and other tribal programs, such \nas housing, school construction, Indian education. All of those are \nbeing hurt by this sequestration budget.\n\n  We cannot continue being shortsighted. We can't keep shortchanging \nprograms that make a real difference in the lives of all Americans. \nThis includes art and cultural programs, the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, and funding for our national forests and wildlife \nrefuges. And the list goes on and on. The time is now, and we are \nrunning out of time. We are on the wrong train, on the wrong track, and \ngoing nowhere.\n  Fortunately, there is a solution. Let's pass a clean CR, and let's \nwork together to pass a budget that actually meets the needs of our \nNation, with sensible funding levels for defense and nondefense \nprograms alike.\n  Before I wrap up my remarks, I wish to call attention to another \ndeadline that is fast approaching. The authorization for the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund will expire on September 30 if this Congress \ndoesn't act. Recently, I was one of 53 Members who called on the \nleadership of this Chamber to pass an extension of the law, and I want \nto reiterate that call today. The Land and Water Conservation Fund just \ncelebrated its 50th birthday. It enjoys strong bipartisan support \nbecause the idea behind it is so simple and so powerful. When this \nNation develops one natural resource--our oil and gas reserves--we \ninvest some of the proceeds in other critical conservation priorities.\n  For five decades now, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has \nprotected our national parks, forests, and other public lands. It helps \nensure hunting, fishing, and recreational access, and it improves and \nexpands our local parks and recreation facilities. The program has been \na tremendous success and has had a tremendous impact on my State, from \nurban refuges--such as the Valle de Oro--to wide open preserves such as \nthe Valles Caldera. It provides crucial funding to preserve open \nspaces, strengthen the economy, and enhance our way of life.\n  LWCF allows us to leverage today's resources to protect vital lands \nand waters for future generations. Allowing the law to expire breaks \nthat compact. It doesn't make any sense, and it doesn't have to happen. \nWe shouldn't let the Land and Water Conservation Fund expire, even for \na single day. I call on this Chamber to act swiftly to permanently \nauthorize this important program and ensure that it is fully funded.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, those of us who believe in protecting \ninnocent and precious life may have lost a vote today, but we are \nsteadily winning a larger argument--a critical argument that goes to \nthe heart of who we want to be as a society. We can feel momentum for \nlife on the rise just as we see extremism on the other side increasing. \nBy placing their allegiance with the far left instead of women, \nDemocrats are making a losing bet they will come to regret over the \nlong term.\n  Today, however, we must grapple with the challenges of the present. \nDemocrats' insistence on blocking the strategy pursued today means we \nhave to consider the options now before us. The reality is that the \ngovernment will shut down next week if Congress does not act.\n  The president of Right to Life said to those of us who believe in \nprotecting life:\n\n       There are two different roads we can take. One is to insist \n     that no more money go to Planned Parenthood and cause a \n     government shutdown (which won't result in actually defunding \n     Planned Parenthood). The other is to take a slightly longer-\n     term approach, taking advantage of the fact that we have the \n     attention of the country as probably never before. . . . \n     Every well-informed pro-lifer wants to defund Planned \n     Parenthood. I want to defund Planned Parenthood. There are \n     wonderful pro-life men and women in Congress who want to \n     defund Planned Parenthood. And, certainly National Right to \n     Life wants to defund Planned Parenthood. The difference here \n     is in strategy.\n\n  This is not the end of this debate or this discussion.\n  I urge colleagues to join me in supporting the legislation I am about \nto file which would ensure that the government remains open.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SCOTT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the legacy of Elder \nRichard G. Scott, a man whose humble example and unwavering conviction \nhad a deep and meaningful impact on my spiritual life. For nearly three \ndecades, Elder Scott served as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve \nApostles in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. On \nTuesday, he passed away from causes incident to age. Although millions \nmourn his death, we find peace in the knowledge that he is reunited \nwith his beloved wife, Jeanene.\n  As a missionary, a father, and an apostle, Elder Scott worked \ntirelessly and served selflessly. Many of us were inspired by his \ncounsel, and even more were blessed by his kindness. He was a man of \ngreat faith and unbending principle, who in his own quiet way spent \ndecades sharing the light of Christ with people throughout the world.\n  Elder Scott's beginnings were as humble as his demeanor. When he was \njust a boy, his father taught him the virtues of manual labor, \ninstilling in him the desire to craft, toy, and tinker with anything he \ncould get his hands on. It was evident from an early age that Elder \nScott would be a talented engineer, and he pursued that field of study \nwhen he enrolled in The George Washington University. To support \nhimself through school, Elder Scott took odd jobs that gave him the \nchance to work with his hands. He spent summers fishing on lobster \nboats, logging in the forests of Utah, and repairing railroads for \nUnion Pacific.\n  While in college, he met Jeanene Watkins, the woman who would win his \nlove and forever change his life. Quickly and effortlessly, Elder Scott \nfell for Jeanene, but before he could ask for her hand in marriage, she \nchallenged him to serve a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of \nLatter-day Saints. Elder Scott's decision to embark on an LDS mission \nto Uruguay was the opening chapter in a long life of dedicated service. \nHe returned from Uruguay with his faith refined and his testimony \nfortified.\n  With this newfound conviction in Christ, Elder Scott married Jeanene \nin the Manti, UT, temple; and together they started a family. For Elder \nScott, his family would be an anchor throughout a long and successful \ncareer as a nuclear engineer on the immediate staff of renowned U.S. \nNavy Admiral Hyman Rickover. For over a decade, Elder Scott served his \nNation, but he was again called to serve God when he returned to South \nAmerica as the President of the Argentina North Mission. As a \nmissionary president, he directed all proselytizing and service efforts \nfor hundreds of young volunteers.\n  After returning from Argentina with his family, Elder Scott continued \nhis ecclesiastical service, first, as a regional representative for the \nChurch in both North and South America, and later, as a member of the \nFirst Quorum of the Seventy. In October 1988, he was ordained to be an \napostle in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n  As a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Elder Scott visited \ncongregations of Latter-day Saints gathered throughout the world. He \nspoke fluent Portuguese and nearly impeccable Spanish. When possible, \nhe took special care to address each congregation he visited in their \nnative tongue. But there was always one language he spoke better than \nany other, the language of empathy.\n  Elder Scott was no stranger to heartbreak. In fact, he came to know \nit very well. Two of his children preceded him in death, and his \nbeloved wife, Jeanene, passed away in 1995. But amid tragedy, he found \npeace and healing through faith in Christ. Sadness sowed the seeds of \ncompassion, and his capacity for empathy was boundless.\n  When he spoke, he spoke as one who knew intimately well the sorrow \nthat stems from suffering, but also the comfort that comes from \nhealing. In all things, he communicated love. Whether through words of \ncounsel or quiet acts of service, he radiated the goodness of God and \nshared it abundantly with others.\n  Mr. President, I will be forever grateful for Elder Richard G. \nScott--his life, his love, and his example. I will miss\n\n[[Page S6933]]\n\nElder Scott dearly, as will all those who knew him. I send my deepest \ncondolences to his family. May God comfort them in this time of grief, \nand may his love be with them always.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/senate-section/article/S6933-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           DETENTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS IN AZERBAIJAN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

In addition, \nand in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights to which \nit is party, the Government of Azerbaijan, which recently chaired the \nCouncil of Europe, should uphold the provisions of its own constitution \nand end the persecution of civil society members, journalists, and \npolitical activists who are guilty of nothing more than peaceful \nexpression.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/senate-section/article/S6933-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ENDING THE SCOURGE OF LANDMINES IN MOZAMBIQUE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week marked an important milestone in \nthe campaign to rid the world of antipersonnel landmines. On September \n17, Mozambique, where two decades ago an estimated 200,000 unexploded \nlandmines were left over from a brutal 15-year civil war, became the \nfirst country with large-scale mine contamination to have all known \nminefields cleared. While accidents due to unknown mines and other \nunexploded ordnance in Mozambique will occasionally occur in the future \nas they still do in Europe 70 years after World War II, the number is a \ntiny fraction of what it once was, and it will continue to decline.\n  The State Department recognized this milestone in a statement, which \nincluded the following:\n\n       Since 1993, when Mozambique emerged from decades of \n     conflict as one of the world's most landmine-affected \n     nations, the United States has been proud to partner with the \n     people of Mozambique, investing more than $55 million toward \n     improving the safety and security of local communities though \n     the U.S. Conventional Weapons Destruction program.\n       Through that partnership--which includes the international \n     donor community and humanitarian demining organizations--we \n     have worked diligently to safely clear landmines and \n     unexploded ordnance, prevent injuries through community \n     outreach and education, and provide medical and social \n     services to survivors of accidents involving these legacies \n     of past conflicts.\n\n  I have spoken many times in this Chamber about these indiscriminate \nweapons, which are triggered by the victim, whether a soldier or an \nunsuspecting child. They linger for days, weeks, years, and even \ndecades after armed conflicts end. They destroy lives as well as \nlivelihoods, making fields unworkable and roads impassable, crippling \nthe economies of already impoverished communities. In recent years the \nUnited States has made important contributions to the worldwide \neradication of landmines, and I have long supported funding for the \nState Department's humanitarian demining programs and for assistance \nfor mine victims through the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment's Leahy War Victims Fund, but the job is far from done.\n  The painstaking work of HALO Trust and other dedicated organizations \nand individuals in Mozambique demonstrates what is possible. We used \nthe Leahy War Victims Fund there, starting back in 1989, to provide \nartificial limbs, wheelchairs, and rehabilitation for victims of mines. \nMelissa Wells, our outstanding Ambassador to Mozambique at the time, \nwas a strong supporter of that program. Thousands of people have \nregained their mobility as a result. My wife Marcelle, a registered \nnurse, traveled to Mozambique and visited some of them more than two \ndecades ago. With this declaration, Mozambicans can live with far less \nfear of being maimed or killed while working in their fields, walking \nto school, or just stepping outside of their homes.\n  This is a time to commend the people and Government of Mozambique and \nthe courageous deminers, as well as those who have helped the victims \nof mines rebuild their lives. But as one who has worked to stop the use \nof landmines ever since my legislation to halt U.S. exports of these \nweapons was first enacted back in 1992, I must emphasize that landmines \ncontinue to threaten innocent people in many other countries.\n  We have come a long way since 1994 when President Clinton, in a \nspeech to the United Nations General Assembly, called on all countries \nto rid the world of landmines. But we have not yet achieved that goal, \nand we should rededicate ourselves to eliminating this scourge from the \nEarth. The best way for the United States to do that is to join the 162 \nsignatories to the Ottawa Treaty banning the production, use, export, \nand stockpiling of antipersonnel landmines.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/senate-section/article/S6933-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I wish to praise Senate passage earlier \nthis week of legislation I authored, S. 1632, to help combat the threat \nposed by the Boko Haram terrorist group. I am hopeful that our \ncolleagues in the House will pass the bill quickly so that it can go to \nthe President's desk for signature.\n  Boko Haram is a notorious terrorist organization. Less well known, \nhowever, is what the name means: ``Western education is forbidden.'' \nThis descriptive moniker helps explain the organization's determination \nto terrorize young girls who seek an education--girls who seek nothing \nmore than a better life and a path to independence.\n  Following the horrific kidnapping of 276 girls more than a year ago, \nBoko Haram has continued to commit barbaric acts of violence against \ncivilians. According to the Congressional Research Service, Boko Haram \nmay have killed more than 11,000 people, with more than 5,500 people \nkilled in 2014 alone. Boko Haram has also pledged allegiance to ISIS, a \nfellow terrorist organization, in an attempt to further their reach and \nincrease their ability to intimidate the citizens of Nigeria, Chad, \nCameroon, and Niger. We cannot sit idly by while Boko Haram continues \nto terrorize women, girls, and religious minorities in these African \nnations.\n  Last year, in response to the kidnapping of the schoolgirls, I worked \nwith Senator Barbara Mikulski and garnered the support of all 20 women \nSenators in urging Secretary of State John Kerry to seek Boko Haram's \naddition to the United Nations al-Qaeda Sanctions List. Following this \nletter, the United Nations Security Council voted to subject Boko Haram \nto a complete asset freeze, travel ban, and arms embargo.\n  This year, I am again leading a bipartisan legislative effort to \naddress the threats posed by Boko Haram. Specifically, my bipartisan \nbill, which now awaits consideration in the House of Representatives, \ncalls on the U.S. Departments of State and Defense and their relevant \npartners to work together in creating a 5-year strategy to\n\n[[Page S6934]]\n\ncounter these increasing threats. Cosponsored by 18 of my Senate \ncolleagues, this bill also signals a renewed congressional commitment \nto combatting Boko Haram and bolstering U.S. efforts throughout the \nregion.\n  While I am pleased that this legislation and previous efforts \ncontinue to move us forward in the fight against Boko Haram, more must \nbe done. I will continue to work with my colleagues to create and enact \nlegislation aimed at countering the violence and terror spread by Boko \nHaram.\n  We have a window of opportunity to change the course of the fight \nagainst this intensifying terrorist threat, and we must seize the \nopportunity. We must also ensure that the United States, as a world \nleader, is providing the assistance necessary to make this strategy \nsuccessful.\n  We must never forget that the girls of Nigeria were targeted simply \nbecause they chose to pursue an education. We must send a message to \nwomen and girls around the world that their safety and well-being \nmatters, that everyone deserves the opportunity to seek an education. \nWe must also send a clear message to Boko Haram that their appalling \nacts of violence have no place in this world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/senate-section/article/S6934-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CHILD SUPPORT ASSISTANCE BILL\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from \nthe National Child Support Enforcement Association in support of the \nChild Support Assistance Act of 2015 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            National Child Support\n\n\n                                      Enforcement Association,\n\n                                               September 17, 2015.\n     Hon. Patrick Toomey,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Toomey: The National Child Support Enforcement \n     Association (NCSEA) is pleased to support your bill, the \n     Child Support Assistance Act of 2015. Your bill will make \n     even more efficient and effective the collection and \n     distribution of child support payments to the custodial \n     family. The targeted language of the measure strikes a \n     provision of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) which \n     requires a child support agency to provide 10-day notice by \n     certified or registered mail to the non-custodial parent \n     (NCP) to advise him or her that a consumer report will be \n     requested to verify income and location of employment.\n       The custodial and non-custodial parent both continue to \n     have a full range of opportunities throughout the legal \n     process to contest and correct information, including \n     information provided by a consumer report. This technical \n     change affecting only child support will further streamline \n     the administration of the program to ensure that payments are \n     made to the family as quickly as possible.\n       As you know, the House Financial Services Committee passed \n     a companion bill (H.R. 2091) earlier this year by an \n     overwhelming bipartisan vote of 56-2.\n       As your bill moves through the legislative process, we \n     stand ready to work with you to ensure its enactment into \n     law, including providing additional comments from our members \n     if questions arise about the effect of the bill's language \n     and impact.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this issue. If you have \n     any questions, please contact me or Tom Joseph, NCSEA \n     Washington Representative at tj@wafed.com.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Ann Marie Ruskin,\n     Interim Executive Director.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/senate-section/article/S6934-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         CONWAY, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \nConway, NH, a town in Carroll County that is celebrating the 250th \nanniversary of its founding. I am delighted to join citizens across the \nGranite State in recognizing this historic occasion.\n  Conway is located within the Mount Washington Valley and sits in the \nshadow of the 2,369 foot Black Cap Mountain. The town is encompassed by \nthe Saco River watershed, including both the Swift and Saco Rivers, and \nholds portions of the White Mountain National Forest to the north and \nwest.\n  Conway consists of the villages of Conway, North Conway, Center \nConway, Redstone, Kearsarge, and Intervale and was first chartered in \n1765 by Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth. The town was eventually \nsettled by Joshua Heath, Benjamin Dolloff, and Ebenezer Burbank and is \nnamed for British Secretary of State for the Southern Department Henry \nSeymour Conway. Secretary Conway is often remembered for his opposition \nto the Stamp Act, thereby in favor of moderate taxation policies for \nthe colonies.\n  Cathedral Ledge, Echo Lake State Park, and a portion of the \nKancamagus Highway are all located in Conway, offering some of most \nscenic vistas in the State. From atop the ledge, you can look over the \ntown and the surrounding mountains and rivers that make up the valley. \n``The Kanc,'' as many locals call it, has the honor of being the \nhighest mountain pass in the Eastern United States with the crest of \nthe road sitting high at 2,855 feet and stretching for 32 miles from \nConway to the neighboring town of Lincoln.\n  Conway is one of the premier tourist destinations in New Hampshire. \nEvery year, the town hosts thousands of visitors who travel north to \nenjoy the outdoor activities, dining, shopping, and culture of the \nMount Washington Valley. Conway is home to hundreds of locally owned \nbusinesses, each with its own unique style and flavor. In a single day, \na visitor could ride into the mountains aboard the historic Conway \nScenic Railroad, canoe down the meandering Saco River, zip-line at the \nCranmore Mountain Adventure Park, or virtually visit the home of the \n``world's worst weather'' at the Mount Washington Observatory Museum. \nAnd during the winter months, Conway provides ample opportunity for \ndownhill and cross-country skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, and both \nice skating and climbing.\n  On behalf of all Granite Staters, I am pleased to offer my \ncongratulations to the citizens of Conway on reaching this special \nmilestone, and I thank them for their many contributions to the life \nand spirit of the State of New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/senate-section/article/S6934-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING ANUPAM KHER\n\n Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize \nAnupam Kher, an Indian actor who has inspired many through a legacy of \ntheater and film spanning more than three decades. Anupam Kher is one \nof India's most prominent theatre and film personalities. His \ncontributions to Hindi and English-language film and culture are \ntremendous, and his exceptional career as an actor, producer, teacher, \nand author will serve as an inspiration for generations to come.\n  Born in 1955 in Himachal Pradesh, India, Anupam had a modest \nupbringing. After graduating from the D.A.V. School, in Shimla, Anupam \nattended the National School of Drama, to which he would later return \nas director. He was chair of Central Board of Film Certification from \n2003-2004, after which the Government of India awarded him the \nprestigious Padma Shri for his contributions to Indian cinema. Anupam \nhas appeared in over 100 plays and over 450 films, and he is considered \none of the greatest actors of contemporary cinema.\n  In addition to his dramatic work, Anupam is an active voice for \nchange, and he regularly speaks out against corruption and inequality. \nThe United Nations recently recognized his efforts, honoring him as a \n``Champion of Gender Equality'' for his work on their HeForShe \ncampaign. In 2010, he was appointed as the goodwill ambassador of the \nPratham Education Foundation, which strives to improve children's \neducation in India. It is inspiring to see an actor dedicate his time \nand celebrity to promote social change.\n  It is an honor to serve a State with one of the largest Indian \nAmerican diasporas in the country, and we were thrilled to host a \ntalent such as Anupam Kher, whose career has made an indelible \nimpression across the globe. Anupam's commitment to the arts is \nunwavering, and his myriad contributions to theatrical arts are a \ntestament to his dedication to his craft. Anupam has touched countless \nlives and has changed the way the world views Bollywood and India. His \nwork is worthy of the highest commendation.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in celebrating Anupam Kher's \ncontinued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/senate-section/article/S6934-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6934-S6935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RUSS FULLMER\n\n Mr. DAINES.

Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate CW2 \nRoger Capps on receiving the Defense of Freedom Medal, honoring his \nservice and sacrifice while working in Afghanistan. It gives me great \npleasure to see a member of the Nevada family being recognized with \nthis prestigious medal.\n  In April of 2013, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps, then a traditional \nlieutenant colonel, was transporting military equipment across \nAfghanistan for Columbia Helicopters. During the trip, he was struck by \nan insurgent-shot bullet that had entered the helicopter by a rare \nopening in the bulletproof flooring, ultimately shattering his femur \nand pelvis. Though he will not receive a Purple Heart because he was \nworking as a civilian that day, he will receive this unique Defense of \nFreedom Medal presented to civilian employees who are killed or wounded \nwhile working in support of the Department of Defense. His service \nremains invaluable to this great Nation.\n  Even after this difficult day, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps \nmaintained a positive spirit. While recovering from his injuries, he \nreassessed his military future, ultimately opting to utilize his \npiloting skills. In May, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps resigned his \ncommission and transferred to the warrant officer corps. He now serves \nour Nation flying Chinook helicopters for the Army Guard.\n  I extend my deepest gratitude to Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps for \nhis bravery in serving the United States of America. His unwavering \ncommitment to serving our Nation demonstrates his genuine selfless \ncharacter and love for his country. His actions represent only the \ngreatest of Nevada's values, including dedication, courage, and a \nspirit to persevere in the most difficult times.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I recognize \nthat Congress has a responsibility not only to honor these brave \nindividuals who serve our Nation but also to ensure they are cared for \nwhen they return home. I remain committed to upholding this promise for \nour veterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout the Nation. \nChief Warrant Officer 2 Capps' sacrifice warrants only the greatest \nrespect and care in return.\n  Throughout his tenure, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps has demonstrated \nunparalleled bravery and positivity. I am both humbled and honored by \nhis service and am proud to call him a fellow Nevadan. Today I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in congratulating Chief Warrant Officer 2 Capps \non his much-deserved accolade and wish him well in all of his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/senate-section/article/S6935-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6935-S6937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     NOMINATION OF FRANK ROSE AND OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE \n  DEPARTMENT OF STATE ON PROPOSED EUROPEAN UNION CODE OF CONDUCT FOR \n                         OUTER SPACE ACTIVITIES\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned by proposals \nfor arms control plans related to missile defense and outer space arms, \nincluding the EU Code of Conduct for Outer Space activities, which the \nObama administration has embraced. These plans were confirmed by Rose \nGottemoeller, Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security, during a House subcommittee hearing last week. \nI firmly believe any international agreement on a code of conduct for \nspace should be submitted for Senate advice and consent as part of its \ntreaty powers, and not be an ``executive agreement'' that sidesteps \nthat process.\n  I have engaged with the State Department to ensure that this \nagreement will not be a unilateral act and that it will be fully \npresented to Congress before moving forward. I strongly believe, given \nthe importance of this issue, that the U.S. Senate should be consulted \nas part of their advice and consent role in any decision to move \nforward.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record at the end of my remarks official \nletters and correspondence with the nominee, Deputy Assistant Secretary \nof State, Frank Rose that demonstrate three important points. First, \ndue to serious ongoing concerns related to national security, the \nadministration has not pursued plans to propose the negotiation of a \ndebris-generating ASAT testing moratorium at this time; second, that \nany decision to subscribe to a code in the future will not in any way \nconstrain our national security-related activities in space or ability \nto protect the U.S. or allies; third, and most importantly, that the \nSenate will be given access to the details surrounding any plan once \nand if any format is determined, and again before any agreement is \nentered.\n  Space is vital to our national security, and we must maintain the \nability to use satellites and various missile capabilities. In \nparticular, space is of critical importance to our national \nintelligence and warfighting capabilities. The development of anti-\nsatellite capabilities by countries such as China and Russia is well \ndocumented, as in the example of China successfully testing a direct-\nascent, anti-satellite SC-19 missile against one of its own satellites.\n  It is vital that the United States ensure we are not restricting \nactivity in ways that put our security at risk. Members of Congress \nhave been clear in their view that they see ample disadvantage to such \na code for the United States; according to assessments by the uniformed \nmilitary, implementation of this code would result in real world \noperational impacts. Congress has previously voted to limit \ninternational agreements concerning outer space activities. Section 913 \nof the fiscal year 2013 National Defense Authorization Act, H.R. 4310, \nstates that any agreement will have no legally binding effect or basis \nfor limiting the activities of the United States in outer space, and it \nrequires certification that any such agreement will be equitable, \nenhance national security, and have no militarily significant impact on \nthe ability of the United States to conduct military or intelligence \nactivities in space.\n  There are several key areas that the administration must resolve \nbefore moving forward on pursuing any decision. Pentagon officials have \nlong expressed concern that the arms initiative will be exploited by \nstates such as China and Russia to constrain U.S. missile defenses, \nwhile both states continue to develop their own advanced missile \ndefenses. In 2007, the Department of Defense concluded that the \nprogress in addressing the vulnerability of U.S. space assets has not \nkept pace with growing threat capabilities; consequently, the \nvulnerability of our space assets continues to grow. Additionally, a \nprevious U.S. Commission to Assess United States National Security \nSpace Management and Organization released a report that predicted that \nfuture warfare in space was a ``virtual certainty'' and urged the \nUnited States to begin to develop the means both to deter and defend \nagainst attacks on its space assets, and to mount offensive operations \nto deny the use of space to potential adversaries. To do otherwise, the \ncommission warned, would invite a ``space Pearl Harbor.''\n  Further troubling, a 2014 Department of Defense report noted that \nChina is ``developing a multi-dimensional program to improve its \ncapabilities to limit or prevent the use of space-based assets by \nadversaries during times of crisis or conflict,'' including \n``destroying or capturing satellites and other sensors.'' To protect \nagainst these types of attacks, the Department of Defense's ongoing \npolicy is aimed at retaining the capabilities to respond at the time \nand place of our choosing. Any effort to move forward must address our \nnational security needs and Congressional concerns.\n  Therefore, any State Department effort to move forward with a code or \na debris-generating ASAT testing moratorium should fully overcome \nexisting concerns and ensure the plan does not undermine current \nDepartment of Defense policy, U.S. capabilities, or congressional \nconcerns. Our growing dependence on space makes it fundamental to U.S. \nnational security interests. I remain extremely concerned by what \nappears to be previous endeavors by the administration to avoid \naddressing space policy concerns and potential administration efforts \nto bypass Congress.\n  While I am pleased at the assurances that Mr. Rose has provided and \nthat relevant offices will engage with Congress if a path forward is \nagreed upon,\n\n[[Page S6936]]\n\nI remain extremely concerned about the decision to negotiate a measure \nusing past measures such as the European Union's Code of Conduct as a \nstarting point. Russia has demonstrated its willingness to break its \nagreements, as seen with the ongoing violation of the 1987 \nIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty. We need to improve our \ncapacity to understand what is going on in space, and we need to ensure \nwe are adequately capable of deterring the growing number of countries \nthat are pursuing weapons capable of targeting U.S. satellites.\n  While necessary, the development of transparency and confidence-\nbuilding measures and behavioral norms promoting responsible space \noperations should not come at the expense of America's national \nsecurity. The President's own Space Policy released in 2010 states: \n``The United States will employ a variety of measures to help assure \nthe use of space for all responsible parties, and, consistent with the \ninherent right of self-defense, deter others from interference and \nattack, defend our space systems and contribute to the defense of \nallied space systems, and, if deterrence fails, defeat efforts to \nattack them.'' With a growing number of states acquiring the ability to \ndegrade or destroy U.S. space capabilities, the probability that space \nsystems will come under attack in a future crisis or conflict is ever \nincreasing. The State Department cannot have the attitude that they are \ngoing to go it alone. The United States cannot afford it.\n  The material is as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 12, 2014.\n     Mr. Frank Rose,\n     Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Space and Defense \n         Policy,\n     U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Rose: We write to \n     ask for your clarification regarding the Administration's \n     space arms control posture. Like you, we are deeply concerned \n     by the rising threats of anti-satellite weapons in the hands \n     of states like the People's Republic of China. That said, we \n     believe the Administration would do better to focus on real \n     solutions to these threats, as opposed to more feel good \n     measures like the European Union's (EU) Code of Conduct for \n     Outer Space activities or other similar measures.\n       We are concerned by proposals for outer space arms control, \n     including the EU Code of Conduct for Outer Space activities, \n     which the Administration has embraced. We see no advantage to \n     such a Code for the United States; according to assessments \n     by the uniformed military, implementation of this code would \n     result in real world operational impacts. The product of this \n     equation demands the opposition of the entire United States \n     government.\n       With the languishing of that Code, we fear a new threat to \n     our ability to protect U.S. outer space capabilities, and, \n     perhaps even to develop our missile defenses. We seek your \n     understanding of the Administration's position on space arms \n     control, specifically, the ``debris generating kinetic energy \n     ASAT testing moratorium'' which, as we have been informed, \n     you proposed to U.S. allies. We are unfamiliar with any such \n     proposal having been coordinated with the Department of \n     Defense or the uniformed military, and therefore we ask for \n     your answers to the following questions:\n       1) Please indicate the date, and by which Department \n     official, the State Department Circular 175 request was \n     signed. What was the scope of this Circ-175 and has the \n     Department determined if this moratorium would be submitted \n     to the Senate for its advice and consent?\n       2) If this Circ-175 will not be submitted to the Senate, on \n     what basis would such an international agreement be \n     negotiated and to what end?\n       3) Please detail the potential implications for United \n     States space and missile defense activities. How would such \n     an agreement protect our ability to fully develop our missile \n     defenses, including our test and targets program?\n       4) Please further detail how such agreement will ensure \n     full freedom of action for the United States to take needed \n     defensive and other action in space.\n       5) Please provide the Joint Staff assessment of impacts to \n     military operations you obtained before discussing this \n     moratorium with our allies.\n       6) Please detail the specific allies with which you have \n     discussed this moratorium and the respective dates of \n     discussion. Please further detail which State Department \n     official authorized these discussions.\n       We appreciate your prompt responses to these questions.\n           Sincerely,\n     David Vitter,\n       United States Senator.\n     Doug Lamborn,\n       Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 17, 2014.\n       Dear Senator Vitter: Thank you for your letter of November \n     12 regarding the Administration's efforts to enhance the \n     security and sustainability of the outer space environment.\n       The Administration is deeply concerned about the \n     development of anti-satellite (ASAT) capabilities by \n     countries like China and Russia. In response to this \n     increasing threat, the Department of State is pursuing a \n     comprehensive approach to space security, including the \n     development of bilateral and multilateral transparency and \n     confidence building measures (TCBMs) such as the \n     International Code of Conduct, development of international \n     long-term sustainability guidelines by the UN Committee on \n     the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, and other measures. The \n     Administration believes that pragmatic TCBMs like the Code \n     are a much more effective way to ensure the long-term \n     security of the space environment as compared to \n     fundamentally flawed space arms control proposals like the \n     Russian-Chinese sponsored Prevention of Placement of Weapons \n     in Outer Space Treaty.\n       The United States has made clear to our partners that we \n     will not enter into a code of conduct, or other agreement, \n     that in any way constrains our national security-related \n     activities in space or our ability to protect the United \n     States and our allies. We have worked closely with our \n     colleagues in the Defense Department and Intelligence \n     Community to ensure that the Code does not have any adverse \n     impact on U.S. operations, including the development and \n     testing of missile defenses. The Department, in coordination \n     with the interagency, provided a series of briefings to \n     Congress on the Administration's decision-making process \n     regarding our willingness to work with our European allies to \n     help craft a Code that would benefit U.S. national security. \n     We are available to provide updates at any time.\n       The Administration has been clear that we are open to space \n     arms control proposals. However, any such proposal would need \n     to meet the criteria as outlined in the President's 2010 \n     National Space Policy (NSP)--that it be effectively \n     verifiable, equitable, and in the interests of the United \n     States and its allies. At this time, the Administration has \n     made no decision to propose the negotiation of a debris-\n     generating ASAT testing moratorium, and therefore, no C-175 \n     request has been signed. If a decision were made to move \n     forward with a proposal in the future, we would work closely \n     with the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community to \n     ensure there were no adverse operational impacts from our \n     efforts, especially on our missile defense and space systems. \n     Furthermore, while we discuss a wide variety of space \n     security issues with allies--including the potential for a \n     Code of Conduct and ways to address the development of ASAT \n     systems--we have not made a specific proposal to allies for \n     negotiation of a debris-generating ASAT testing moratorium.\n       The Department is fully committed to closely coordinating \n     all diplomatic space security proposals within the U.S. \n     interagency. We would not table a proposal that had not \n     received full U.S. Government approval and took into account \n     all agencies' perspectives.\n       Should you wish to have further discussions on this issue, \n     the Administration would be happy to assemble an interagency \n     team to meet with you to provide further background on our \n     efforts, and answer any additional questions you may have.\n       We hope this information is useful. Please do not hesitate \n     to contact us if we can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Julia Frifield,\n     Assistant Secretary, Legislative Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 10, 2014.\n       Dear Senator Vitter, In response to follow-up questions \n     from your staff, we would like to provide the following \n     clarifications about our efforts to promote the security and \n     long-term sustainability of the outer space environment.\n       As I noted in my letter of November 12, 2014, the \n     Administration is seriously concerned about the development \n     of anti-satellite capabilities by countries like China. We \n     believe that effective diplomatic efforts are a critical tool \n     in the United States' comprehensive response to countering \n     this threat. At the same time, we recognize your concerns and \n     want to assure you that we share them. We have made every \n     effort to ensure that our diplomatic efforts to promote the \n     security and sustainability of outer space do not have an \n     adverse impact on our national security activities, \n     especially on our missile defense and space systems.\n       The administration has no plans to propose the negotiation \n     of a debris-generating ASAT testing moratorium at this time. \n     Moreover, there has been no consideration as to what format \n     we would seek for any proposed debris-generating ASAT testing \n     moratorium. As a result, no C-175 package has been prepared.\n       Currently, our diplomatic focus is on the development of an \n     International Code of Conduct on Outer Space Activities. At \n     this time, the European Union is considering its next steps \n     on the Code. As we stated in 2012, the United States has \n     decided to work with the European Union and other nations to \n     help develop a code which can help maintain the long-term \n     sustainability, safety, stability and security of outer space \n     by establishing guidelines for the responsible use of outer \n     space. Since the text of the Code has not been finalized, the \n     Administration has\n\n[[Page S6937]]\n\n     made no decision on whether to subscribe to the code. Only \n     after the text is finalized and open for subscription will \n     the Administration consider whether to subscribe to the Code. \n     Such a decision will be made only after it received full U.S. \n     Government approval that takes into account perspectives from \n     all departments and agencies.\n       As former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated in \n     January 2012, the United States will not sign-up to a Code of \n     Conduct that any way constrains our national security-related \n     activities in space or our ability to protect the United \n     States or our allies. If the United States were to make a \n     decision to subscribe to a Code in the future, it would be \n     implemented in a way that is fully consistent with this \n     statement.\n       Let me also assure you that we are in close contact with \n     our Department of Defense and Intelligence Community \n     colleagues on the development of the Code to ensure the Code \n     does not have any adverse impacts on U.S. operations, \n     including the development and testing of missile defenses.\n       Should you wish to have further discussions on this issue, \n     we would be prepared to assemble an interagency team to meet \n     with you or your staff. Please do not hesitate to contact us \n     if we can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Julia Frifield,\n     Assistant Secretary, Legislative Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 11, 2014.\n       Dear Senator Vitter: I wanted to follow-up with regarding \n     the conversation I had with your staff regarding a potential \n     debris generating anti-satellite (ASAT) testing moratorium \n     and the European Union's proposed International Code of \n     Conduct for Outer Space Activities.\n       As Assistant Secretary of State Julia Frifield noted in her \n     December 10, 2014, letter to you, the Administration has no \n     plans to propose the negotiation of a debris-generating ASAT \n     testing moratorium at this time. Should we determine to \n     pursue such an agreement in the future, I pledge to keep you \n     and your staff informed, including on the form of which a \n     potential agreement might take.\n       With regard to the Code of Conduct, it is my understanding \n     that there are no implementation issues for the Department of \n     Defense related to the current draft of the Code. That said, \n     only after the text of the Code is finalized will we have a \n     full understanding of any potential implementation issues. \n     Therefore, we continue to be in close contact with our \n     colleagues at the Department of Defense and the Intelligence \n     Community to ensure that our efforts to promote the security \n     and sustainability of outer space do not have an adverse \n     impact on our national security activities, especially on our \n     missile defense and national security space systems.\n       Before a final decision is made to subscribe to the Code, \n     the Department, along with our interagency colleagues, will \n     make sure to provide a briefing, including relevant materials \n     such as the text of the Code and other materials, to you and \n     the relevant committees on the terms of the agreement, its \n     implementation, and any other issues of interest.\n       I appreciate your interest in these issues. Please do not \n     hesitate to reach out to me or my staff in the future with \n     any questions you may have.\n           Regards,\n\n                                                Frank A. Rose,\n\n                               Deputy Assistant Secretary of State\n     Space and Defense Policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/02/senate-section/article/S6935-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING WALDO DE CASTROVERDE\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of \nWaldo De Castroverde, a prominent Nevadan whose legacy lives on through \nthe work of his sons. I send my gratitude to Mr. De Castroverde's \nfamily as they continue to serve Las Vegas' Hispanic community.\n  Mr. De Castroverde was a true patriot of Cuba, fighting to bring his \ncountry some of our Nation's most important values--freedom and \ndemocracy. In 1961, he was a paratrooper and one of 1,400 Cuban exiles \nwho participated in the Bay of Pigs invasion in an attempt to bring \ngreater sovereignty to Cuba, which ultimately led to his imprisonment. \nAfter being captured, Mr. De Castroverde was selected on multiple \noccasions to serve on a commission sent to the United States to \nnegotiate the release of those who participated in the invasion. Two \nyears later, Mr. De Castroverde was freed and moved to the United \nStates with his wife.\n  Upon arriving to the United States, Mr. De Castroverde and his wife \nmoved to Miami where he taught history at a local high school. In 1978, \nhe moved with his family to Reno, where he worked rigorously to shape a \nbright future for himself and his family of four children. He worked as \na blackjack dealer during the day and he attended law school at night.\n  Fifteen years later, he moved to Las Vegas and started his own \npractice in immigration and criminal law. In 2005, he was joined by his \ntwo sons, Alex and Orlando, forming the De Castroverde Law Group, which \nhas served as an incredible resource to Las Vegas's Hispanic community.\n  While we were saddened by the passing of this great Nevadan in 2014, \nhe will always be remembered as an inspiring advocate of liberty and as \na role model to Las Vegas's Hispanic community.\n  I am honored to commend him and his family for their work throughout \nLas Vegas. Today, I join citizens across our State in celebrating the \nlife of an extraordinary Nevadan, Waldo De Castroverde. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/senate-section/article/S6935-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ASU \n                         PUBLIC SERVICE ACADEMY\n\n Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I also wish to pay tribute to a \nman I have admired throughout my career in this Chamber, Senator Tim \nJohnson of South Dakota. I am proud to call Tim my friend.\n  Long before Senator Johnson and I crossed paths in the Senate, we \nwere both studying at Michigan State University--I was an undergrad \nwhile Senator Johnson was doing postgraduate studies. In fact, his \nparents retired in the East Lansing area. I know that Senator Johnson \nconsiders the University of South Dakota to be his alma mater, but I \nwill always think of him as a fellow Spartan.\n  All of us here are committed to public service, to defending the \nConstitution and to protecting our Nation against foreign threats, but \nfew of us have had our commitment tested as Senator Johnson has.\n  In 2004 Senator Johnson learned that he had prostate cancer, but he \nwas determined to beat it and to continue representing the people of \nSouth Dakota. ``I wish this was something that wasn't happening to \nme,'' he said. ``But I will deal with it head on,'' and he did. He had \nsurgery, then he made a full recovery, and was soon back to work.\n  In 2006 we were all shocked to learn that Senator Johnson suffered a \nbrain hemorrhage--and for weeks we hoped and prayed for him and his \nfamily. Incredibly, he again made a full recovery--and he again came \nback to work.\n  That is commitment. That is a Senator with a deep appreciation for \nthe privilege of serving the people of South Dakota. That is Tim \nJohnson\n  Despite the personal health issues Senator Johnson experienced, he \nsucceeded in leading passage of the Safe and Fair Deposit Insurance Act \nof 2005, a law that 3 years later was critical to keeping America's \ndeposits safe during a time of great economic turmoil. As chair of the \nSenate banking committee we have relied on his leadership and judgment \nin reducing risk in the financial sector and in ensuring that Dodd-\nFrank reforms were implemented effectively.\n  I will miss our work together to improve the health care of American \nveterans, and I will miss the opportunity I have had through the years \nto work with Senator Johnson on empowering small family farms to \ncompete in the modern marketplace and to help ethanol producers expand \ntheir place in our Nation's renewable energy future.\n  Knowing how important it was for ranchers to be able to tell \nconsumers their meat products came from the U.S.A., Senator Johnson has \nbeen a champion of country of origin labeling since going back to the \n2002 farm bill, and since then he has helped to strengthen and fully \nimplement the law, a mission that carried over to the 2014 farm bill \nthat I authored as chair of the agriculture committee.\n  In addition, Senator Johnson has been a forceful advocate for the \nGrain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration rules that \nensure that family farmers and ranchers are able to compete on a level \nplaying field.\n  I know how much Senator Johnson has loved policymaking, so I know he \nmust have agonized over this decision. But I also know that the love \nand devotion he has for his family comes first, and now he will be able \nto spend more time with his wife Barbara, his two sons, his daughter, \nand all his grandchildren.\n  Tim, thank you for being such a strong, resilient, and resourceful \npartner and friend through the years. I wish you a happy and successful \nretirement with your family.\n\n\n                             Mary Landrieu\n\n  Mr. President, at the end of this session of Congress, the Senate \nwill be bidding farewell to my colleague and dear friend, Senator Mary \nLandrieu, who has served the people of Louisiana with such devotion \nover the last 18 years.\n   I don't think it is possible to overstate the magnitude of the \nchallenges that she has faced on behalf of her constituents. Hurricane \nKatrina may have been the most horrible natural disaster our country \nhas ever experienced--and Senator Landrieu's native city of New Orleans \nwas ground zero.\n  No one was more engaged in the recovery effort that followed that \ncalamity. Senator Landrieu fought tenaciously to secure the funds it \nwould take to repair and revitalize the gulf coast with infrastructure \nimprovements that would protect the coast against another major event.\n  In the 10 years since Katrina, Senator Landrieu has been a champion \nfor homeowners who were struggling to afford flood insurance, most \nrecently by winning passage of the Homeowner Flood Insurance \nAffordability Act, this past March.\n  Of course, just as the gulf coast appeared close to making a full \nrecovery, it was struck by another disaster--the Deepwater Horizon \noilspill. Again, Senator Landrieu was on the vanguard of that recovery, \nwinning passage of the RESTORE Act so that the vast majority of the \nfines collected by the U.S. Government would go back to the gulf coast \nto help pay for the cleanup. It is the single biggest investment in \nenvironmental restoration in American history.\n  These were the moments when the people of Louisiana needed Mary \nLandrieu most--and she delivered as only she can.\n  At the same time, Senator Landrieu has always understood that the oil \nand gas industry is vital to her State's economy, and so it was a major \nmilestone when she became the first woman to chair the Senate energy \ncommittee.\n   She fights so hard for Louisiana, but over the years of working with \nher, I have learned how much she is driven by a deep feeling of \ncompassion, not just\n\n[[Page S6938]]\n\nfor those displaced by hurricanes or those whose livelihood was \njeopardized by the Deepwater Horizon but for the children of her State \nand our country who were given up for adoption or placed in foster \ncare.\n   Senator Landrieu knows the joys of adopting firsthand, having \nadopted her two children, Connor and Mary Shannon, and she wants other \nparents to feel that joy. So she sympathizes with parents who wish to \nadopt a child but who are struggling to do so--especially since she \nknows there are children desperate for parents but who remain wards of \nthe State. By matching those parents with that child, she knows that \nshe can create a true family.\n  So she has led the efforts in the Senate to improve child welfare \nsystems internationally and to make it easier for American parents to \nadopt children in other countries. She has pushed for Federal funds to \ncreate foster care mentoring programs, so that children who are in the \nfoster system have better guidance during the most critical years of \ntheir social development.\n   I know I speak for other Members of this Chamber when I say that we \nwill do our very best to continue the momentum that Senator Landrieu \nhas created for finding a permanent, loving home for every American \nchild.\n   I will deeply miss having her with us but I have absolutely no doubt \nthat Mary Landrieu will find new ways to express her devotion to the \npeople of Louisiana and our country. It is not just a tradition in her \nfamily; it is her singular passion. I thank her for her amazing service \nhere and I look forward to all the great achievements that are in her \nfuture.\n\n\n                               Mark Udall\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to express my gratitude to a dear colleague and \nfriend who has been a champion for our national parks and for \npreserving the natural splendor of our Western lands: Senator Mark \nUdall.\n   Just as the Great Lakes are part of my DNA, the Rocky Mountains are \npart of Senator Udall's. He likes to quote the saying that we did not \ninherit this earth from our parents but that we are borrowing it from \nour children--and that is the perspective that has guided him as Chair \nof the Senate National Parks Subcommittee.\n   He has worked to expand national parks and to revitalize our natural \nresources. Recognizing that our dependence on fossil fuels poses a \nthreat to our land, water and wildlife, Senator Udall has been a leader \nin pushing for investments in renewable energy. I know how proud he was \nthat Colorado was the first State to pass a voter-approved renewable \nenergy policy. A key to making it happen was Senator Udall teaming up \nin a bipartisan way with the speaker of the Colorado House.\n   When Colorado was struck by floods, forest fires, and beetle \ninfestations, Senator Udall fought to make sure the State had the \nFederal resources to contain the damage and aid the recovery.\n   We learn a lot about our leaders during a time of crisis, and time \nand again, Senator Udall has proven the strength of his character and \nhis convictions.\n   In the wake of the mass shooting in Aurora, CO, Senator Udall threw \nhis support behind a ban on combat weapons, as well as an amendment to \nexpand background searches for gun purchases. It was a bold position to \ntake politically, but the Udall family has a long tradition of taking \nbold positions whose wisdom is borne out by history: His grandfather \nissued a court decision that recognized Native Americans' right to \nvote; his uncle challenged discrimination by Washington's football \nteam; and his father helped integrate the University of Arizona.\n   It is fitting that in Senator Udall's last full week with the Senate \nhe gave a stirring speech on the floor, demanding transparency in the \nway that our Nation treats suspected terrorists. Senator Udall has also \nbeen one of the Senate's most vocal advocates for civil liberties, \narguing passionately that our government's conduct must always respect \nboth our values and the Constitution.\n   Personally, I have had the honor of working alongside Senator Udall \nas co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus on Parkinson's Disease, teaming \nup on behalf of the National MS and Parkinson's Disease Registries Act. \nThis past month we joined forces on an amendment that ensures women in \nthe military will have access to quality health services, with a \nspecific focus on maternity and preventive care.\n   I will miss our talks and our collaborations. But leaving the Senate \nwill allow Senator Udall to become an even more avid outdoorsman. While \nhe has already climbed Mt. Everest and the 100 tallest peaks in his \nhome State of Colorado, I have no doubt that he will soon conquer new \nand exciting challenges in the great outdoors.\n   And from listening to his farewell address, it is already apparent \nto me that Senator Udall has achieved a clarity that will serve him \nforever after. ``As a lifelong mountain climber,'' he said, ``I have \nlearned far more from the mountains I did not summit, than those that I \ndid.''\n   I know I speak for many of us here when I say that I have learned a \ngreat deal from Senator Udall, and I thank him for serving Colorado and \nour Nation in the U.S. Senate--and for being a great friend. Happy \ntrails, Senator.\n\n\n                               kay hagan\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to pay tribute to my dear friend and \ncolleague, Senator Kay Hagan from North Carolina.\n  Kay Hagan has quite a collection of hats. There is the hat she wore \nas a lawyer in Greensboro. She wore one hat as a banker, another as a \nState legislator helping to write North Carolina's State budget. And \nwhen she excelled in each of these roles, the voters of North Carolina \ngave her another hat to wear, as their U.S. Senator.\n  Kay Hagan joined us in January 2009, which was a difficult time for \nour Nation's economy. With her background in the banking sector and her \nknowledge of the housing finance system, she got right to work on \nrebuilding our economy, with a stronger foundation.\n  At the same time, she never allowed herself to be distracted from the \nneeds specific to her North Carolina constituents. She recognized that \nNorth Carolina workers and small businesses were being threatened by \nunfair trade practices abroad, and she sought to address it.\n  She recognizes how vital military bases are to North Carolina's \neconomy and to its culture, so she worked to protect them from cuts and \nclosures. She was a leader for military families who care for disabled \nchildren, seeking to provide payments for them from the Survivor \nBenefit Plan. And it was Senator Hagan who stepped up to help families \nat Camp Lejeune get access to health care, following one of the worst \ncases of water contamination in American history.\n  With two daughters of her own, Senator Hagan knows about the demands \nof balancing child care with a career, and as Chair of the Senate \nSubcommittee on Children and Families, she called attention to the need \nfor paid leave. Senator Hagan and I share important health care \npriorities: She cosponsored a bill to improve the care of mothers and \nbabies by establishing higher quality standards for maternity care \nthrough Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. And she \nhas been a valuable ally on the HOPE for Alzheimer's Act, which would \nhelp doctors detect this disease earlier and provide more support for \nthose taking care of a family member with Alzheimer's.\n  I had the distinct honor of teaming up with Senator Hagan earlier \nthis year to help pork farmers get disaster assistance after a deadly \nvirus devastated their livestock. And we worked together to sound the \nalarm on student loan debt and to try to stop interest rates on Federal \nloans from rising.\n   We both come from States where hunting, fishing, and wildlife are \nimportant components to residents' quality of life. So I was pleased \nthis past year to help Senator Hagan push for her Bipartisan \nSportsmen's Act, which sought to expand access to Federal lands while \ntaking significant steps toward conserving the land we use for \nrecreation.\n  I deeply regret that I will not be able to work with Senator Hagan in \nthe next Congress. But knowing how dear public service is to her, and \nhow deeply that tradition is established in her family, I have no doubt \nthat she will find new ways to serve the people of her beloved home \nState, and our Nation.\n\n[[Page S6939]]\n\n  Senator Hagan, thank you for your service and thank you for being a \nwonderful friend. I wish you the very best of luck in all your future \nendeavors.\n\n\n                             Mary Landrieu\n\n Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the many \naccomplishments of my friend, Senator Mary Landrieu, my colleague from \nLouisiana, during her 18 years here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Landrieu was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1996. Prior to \nserving in the Senate, she had already served the people of her State \nfor 16 years--first as a State legislator, and later as a State \ntreasurer. Altogether Senator Landrieu's service to the people of \nLouisiana has spanned nearly 34 years of commitment to the people of \nLouisiana.\n  Mary served her constituents with utter conviction, dedication, and \npersistence--qualities that her colleagues in the U.S. Senate use to \ndescribe her.\n  However, Senator Landrieu's dedication can be described in other ways \nas well.\n  In her farewell remarks last week, Senator Landrieu discussed how \nfaith and family helped drive her. She draws tremendous strength from \nher faith, and also her large and supportive family--a family that \nknows a thing or two about the ups and downs of politics.\n  Her father, Moon Landrieu, served as a judge, State representative, \nNew Orleans city councilman and Secretary of the U.S. Department of \nHousing and Urban Development. Her brother, Mitch Landrieu, was \nLouisiana's Lieutenant Governor, and both her father and brother have \nserved as mayors of New Orleans--her father during an era of renewal, \nand her brother during an era of rebuilding.\n  Mary has clearly stepped up to the plate during the devastation of \nHurricane Katrina and the horrendous BP oil spill. Those are the kinds \nof challenges that none of us expect when we enter public life--but \nthey are the challenges which show our communities what we are made of.\n  Senator Landrieu rose to both challenges. She has worked as hard as \nany Senator has ever worked to see that her constituents were taken \ncare of. She has pushed hard on Federal agencies to help rebuild, and \npassed legislation to help with Gulf restoration. She has also fought \nto see that flood insurance rates remain affordable--not just for those \nin Louisiana, but across the country.\n  Her efforts have earned the respect of everyone she has worked with, \nand she earned the opportunity to serve as Chair of the Senate Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee as well as the Senate Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship Committee. I know that the issues she championed \non these two committees were important to her constituents and I admire \nher advocacy for jobs in her State and more opportunities for small \nbusinesses.\n  Of course, Senator Landrieu's work extended beyond these two \ncommittees. For years, she worked on adoption, education, conservation, \nand other issues that were near and dear to her heart.\n  All of us will miss Mary's drive, tenacity, and willingness to work \nwith others to get things done. She will continue to be a tough and \nrelentless fighter for Louisiana no matter what her next challenge will \nbe.\n  Aloha, Mary, a hui hou, ``until we meet again.''\n\n\n                               MARK PRYOR\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about my colleague, Senator \nMark Pryor of Arkansas, who will be ending his tenure in the Senate at \nthe end of this Congress.\n  The Pryor name is synonymous with public service in Arkansas. Mark's \nfather, David, served Arkansas in the U.S. House, as Governor, and in \nthe U.S. Senate. In fact, Mark succeeded his father in the U.S. Senate \nafter serving in the State legislature and as attorney general.\n  Throughout his two terms in the Senate, Mark has been a workhorse and \nnot a showhorse. As he noted in his farewell remarks, he is not one to \nattend many press conferences. But he certainly has done a lot of work \non behalf of the people of Arkansas. In 12 years in the Senate he has \nworked to get 70 laws passed--many on a bipartisan basis.\n  His work improves the lives of Americans and our youth each day--from \nhis work in consumer product safety, access to health care, veterans \nissues, and more. He has fought to protect Medicare, and to support \nArkansas' farmers, small businesses, and middle class families.\n  That may be why in his 2008 reelection to the Senate he earned more \nvotes than any statewide elected official in Arkansas history.\n  Senator Pryor told us in his farewell to look inside our desks and \nsee the names written in the drawer, to see the predecessors who have \ncome before us. These names can serve as a reminder of what we all are \nhere for and what large shoes we must fill, as well as how we must \ncollaborate to get things done.\n  Mark has spoken about the fact that politics is about people--both \nthe people we serve and the people we serve with.\n  While there are many good people serving here, we will all miss the \nwork ethic, warmth, and charm that Mark brought to the Senate during \nhis service.\n  It has been an honor serving as his colleague.\n  Aloha, Mark, a hui hou, ``until we meet again.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/senate-section/article/S6938-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. CORKER, from the Committee on Foreign Relations, \n     without amendment:\n       S. 2078.

DINGELL\n\n Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an \namazing colleague from my home State of Michigan, who has served in \nCongress for 59 years, the longest tenure of any Member in history: the \ndean of the House, John D. Dingell.\n  In fact, his service to our Nation goes back even further: In 1938 he \nworked as a congressional page and on December 8, 1941, he was on the \nfloor to hear President Roosevelt declare that the bombing of Pearl \nHarbor was a day that would live in infamy. In fact, a 15-year-old John \nDingell helped record that speech.\n  Three years later he served America in Europe in the fight against \nNazi Germany. He would have been in the Battle of the Bulge if he \nhadn't been hospitalized with meningitis. Then he joined the fight in \nthe Pacific, making preparations to be in the first wave of American \nsoldiers for the ground invasion of Japan--except that the Japanese \nsurrendered before it could happen.\n  So John Dingell proved his patriotism long before he joined Congress \nin 1955, following the death of his beloved father, who preceded him as \nRepresentative for Michigan's 15th Congressional District.\n  It is hard to imagine, but Congressman Dingell was a Member of \nCongress before Medicare and Medicaid existed. In fact, he helped vote \nthose programs into law. When he joined Congress, the Interstate \nHighway System did not exist. Alaska and Hawaii were not yet States.\n  Congressman Dingell is not merely a witness to history. He is a maker \nof it. His original family name, translated into Polish, meant \n``blacksmith,'' and this is a man who hammered out our Nation's laws, \nforging a stronger Union that could weather the challenges of the \nfuture.\n  I would like to list all of Congressman Dingell's accomplishments, \nbut I would be accused of staging a filibuster. For the sake of \nbrevity, I will list only the most exceptional moments in Congressman \nDingell's legendary career.\n  Perhaps his most courageous vote occurred in 1964, in favor of the \nCivil Rights Act. Advisers told him that vote would destroy his chances \nat reelection, but he had more faith in his constituents--and he \nrefused to compromise the principles of social justice.\n  Health care was a great passion--one he inherited from his father. \nJohn Dingell, Sr., introduced a bill for universal health care in 1943, \nand though it failed, he continued to fight for it until the end of his \nlife, and John Dingell, Jr., adopted that cause from his first day as \nhis father's successor, proposing a bill to reform the health care \nsystem in every Congress since 1955. He has always believed that every \nAmerican should have access to health care. So I know that voting for \nthe Affordable Care Act was one of Congressman Dingell's proudest \nmoments in Congress.\n  As a boy he lived through America's Great Depression, and as a \nCongressman he helped to overcome America's great recession.\n  He witnessed the rise of the automobile industry and saw how those \nunionized workers powered the rise of\n\n[[Page S6940]]\n\nAmerica's middle class. Then we fought together to make sure that \nAmerican autos and American workers could compete with foreign \ncompetition on an even playing field. Congressman Dingell recognized \nthat this was the key to a new golden age of American cars and trucks. \nWe are seeing that today.\n  While scientific consensus was still forming about threats pollution \nposed to our air and animals, John Dingell wrote the Endangered Species \nAct in 1973 and the major expansion of the Clean Air Act in 1990. In \n2001, he created the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge--the \nvery first of its kind in North America--and in the years since he has \nworked to expand refuge protection to more acres.\n  He loves Michigan dearly. He understands the connection our people \nhave to manufacturing, to agriculture and to the land and Great Lakes \nthat power our tourism industry and our Michigan way of life.\n  Even during the years he spent chairing the House Committee on Energy \nand Commerce, when Congressman Dingell was one of the most powerful \nMembers of Congress, you could still find him waving to the crowd from \nthe open top of a Ford Mustang convertible at Dearborn's Memorial Day \nParade or at a booth at the Monroe County Fair, always with that same \nbig smile. As Tip O'Neill once said, ``All politics is local,'' and \nlocal people are what John Dingell loves about politics.\n  The people of his district never doubted his dedication. That is why \nthey would still put ``Dingell for Congress'' signs on their lawn, long \nafter his district boundaries had changed. If a piece of Southeast \nMichigan was ``Dingell Country'' once, then it was Dingell Country \nforever.\n  And now he feels great pride--and his constituents feel great \ncomfort--knowing that the district will remain in his family's hands. \nHis beloved wife Deborah, who has been his closest confidant and \nunderstands him more intimately than anyone, will carry on his legacy \nlong into the future. So if you go back to Congressman John Dingell, \nSr., it means that Southeast Michigan has been under the Dingell name \nfor 81 years--and counting.\n  While Congressman Dingell will no longer be in Congress, we can still \nfollow him on Twitter.\n  Even at age 88, he is constantly evolving, charging boldly into the \nfuture, driven by a very simple principle: We are put on this earth to \nhelp people.\n  John D. Dingell, Jr., has helped many people and yet he will insist \nthat he has received much more than he has been given. He claims to be \nthe ``luckiest man in shoe leather,'' and we are lucky that he has \nserved Michigan and our Nation, so long and so faithfully.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/02/senate-section/article/S6940-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING CARE CHEST OF SIERRA NEVADA\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 25th \nanniversary of Care Chest of Sierra Nevada, an organization that \nsupplies free medical equipment to Northern Nevadans in need. As a \nprovider of services to underserved communities, Care Chest has long \nbeen a vital nonprofit in Nevada, and I am proud of the work they do on \nbehalf of the Silver State.\n  Founded in 1990, Care Chest began as a grassroots effort to reuse and \nrecycle medical equipment. Today, this organization helps improve the \nquality of life for those who otherwise could not afford the rising \ncost of health care supplies. Twenty-five years later, Care Chest has \nserved over 100,000 people in Northern Nevada. Last year alone, Care \nChest served nearly 9,000 Nevadans and distributed over 16,000 medical \nitems. Free of charge services provided by Care Chest include emergency \nprescriptions, diabetic supplies, respiratory items, and liquid \nnutritional products. Care Chest has dedicated its efforts to the \nunderserved communities in Northern Nevada, as 69 percent of its \nclients in 2013 were uninsured while 55 percent were below the poverty \nline.\n  As Nevada's unemployment rate remains one of highest in the Nation \nand as health care costs continue to rise, I recognize the unique role \nthat Care Chest has played in working to address the needs of its local \ncommunity by offering health care services to those in need. As a \nlifelong Nevadan and member of the Senate Committee on Finance and the \nSenate Special Committee on Aging starting in the 114th Congress, I am \nproud of the work Care Chest does on behalf of the Reno community and \nits senior citizens.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing \nCare Chest of Sierra Nevada, an organization whose mission is both \nnoble and charitable.

As a lifelong Nevadan and advocate of agriculture \neducation, I am proud to celebrate this victory for Wells and for the \nSilver State.\n  As a rancher, I recognize the role the Future Farmers of America \norganization plays in preparing students for a future in agriculture. \nThe Western National Rangeland Convention, hosted in Elko, NV, brought \n14 teams from five States to compete in various categories including \nplant identification, rangeland biodiversity, habitat evaluation, and \nstocking management. With nearly 6 million acres of farmland in the \nSilver State, these are invaluable skills for future Nevada farmers.\n  I am especially proud to recognize team members Wyatt Gibbs, Deseret \nJohnson, DeMar Gale, Chelsea James, and Justin Sorenson for \nrepresenting the Wells community as leaders in rangeland farming \ntechniques. Under the leadership of adviser Don Noorda, the Wells \nFuture Farmers of America chapter proudly brought home Nevada's first \nnational title. As ranch owners, my wife Lynne and I understand the \nimportance of agriculture education. Management of our State's \nrangelands has been one of my top natural resources priorities in the \nU.S. Senate. Recently, I was instrumental in the enactment of the \nGrazing Improvement Act, which will provide much needed security to \nlivestock producers all across the West.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing \nthe Wells Future Farmers of America, a group of driven young adults \ndedicated to Nevada's agriculture and rangeland. Their commitment to \nNevada's agricultural future is commendable, and I wish them the best \nof luck in all of their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/02/senate-section/article/S6940-3", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6940-S6941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CELEBRATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH OF JAMES CLEVELAND \n                            ``JESSE'' OWENS\n\n  On Tuesday, December 16, 2014, the Senate adopted S. Res. 226, with \nits preamble, as amended, as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 226\n\n       Whereas James Cleveland ``Jesse'' Owens was born on \n     September 12, 1913 in Oakville, Alabama;\n       Whereas Jesse Owens, the youngest of 10 children of \n     sharecroppers and the grandson of a slave, moved with his \n     family at the age of 9 to Cleveland, Ohio as part of the \n     Great Migration;\n       Whereas as a student at Fairmount Junior High School, Jesse \n     Owens broke junior high school world records for the high \n     jump and the broad jump;\n       Whereas Jesse Owens attended East Technical High School in \n     Cleveland, Ohio where, as a member of the track team, he \n     placed first in 75 of the 79 races he entered during his \n     senior year, set the world record in the 220-yard dash, and \n     tied the world record in the 100-yard dash;\n       Whereas Jesse Owens, the ``Buckeye Bullet'', matriculated \n     at the Ohio State University in 1933 after attracting \n     national attention as a high school athlete;\n       Whereas while attending classes, training, and breaking a \n     number of track and field records, Jesse Owens worked various \n     jobs, including as an elevator operator at the Ohio State \n     Capitol, a waiter, a gas station attendant, and a library \n     employee;\n       Whereas due to his race, Jesse Owens was barred from living \n     on campus at the Ohio State University, denied service at \n     restaurants near the University, and forced to stay in \n     segregated hotels;\n       Whereas on May 25, 1935, in a 45-minute period during the \n     Big Ten Track and Field Championships in Ann Arbor, Michigan, \n     Jesse Owens, competing with an injured back, tied the world \n     record in the 100-yard\n\n[[Page S6941]]\n\n     dash and set new world records in the long jump, the 220-yard \n     dash, and the 220-yard low hurdles;\n       Whereas as of the 2012 Summer Olympics, only two men had \n     surpassed the long jump record Jesse Owens set in 1935;\n       Whereas at the 1936 Summer Olympics, Jesse Owens won 4 gold \n     medals, tied the world record in the 100-meter dash, and set \n     new Olympic records in the 200-meter race, the long jump, and \n     the 400-meter relay;\n       Whereas Jesse Owens' resilience and heroic performance at \n     the 1936 Summer Olympics exposed the struggle against racial \n     bigotry and publicly defied Adolf Hitler's intention of \n     proving that ethnicity was a predetermining factor for \n     achievement;\n       Whereas the record-breaking performance by Jesse Owens at \n     the 1936 Summer Olympics was never recognized by the 32nd \n     President of the United States or the 33rd President of the \n     United States, but was later recognized in 1955 by the 34th \n     President of the United States, who referred to Jesse Owens \n     as an ``Ambassador of Sport'';\n       Whereas following his Olympic career, Jesse Owens resumed \n     his commitment to public service by spending much of his time \n     working with community groups such as the Boys Clubs of \n     America, chronicling his personal story to magnify the \n     importance of equality and civil rights;\n       Whereas during the 1950s, Jesse Owens worked with the \n     Department of State to promote democracy abroad as an \n     Ambassador of Goodwill during the Cold War and advocated for \n     socioeconomic equality, individuality, freedom, and love of \n     country;\n       Whereas Jesse Owens was awarded the Presidential Medal of \n     Freedom by the 38th President of the United States in 1976 \n     and the Living Legend Award by the 39th President of the \n     United States in 1979, and was posthumously awarded the \n     Congressional Gold Medal by the 41st President of the United \n     States in 1990;

Res. 268\n\n       Whereas the Syrian conflict has driven more than 7,500,000 \n     Syrians to relocate within Syria, more than 4,000,000 Syrian \n     to flee as refugees to neighboring countries, and hundreds of \n     thousands of Syrians to seek asylum in Europe;\n       Whereas Syria's neighbors are on the front line of the \n     crisis, and Jordan, Turkey, and Lebanon in particular are \n     currently hosting millions of refugees, resulting in \n     tremendous social and economic impacts;\n       Whereas Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since \n     World War II;\n       Whereas members of the international community have a moral \n     responsibility to provide assistance to Syrian refugees, as \n     well as a national security interest in addressing both the \n     insecurity that is driving Syrians from their homes and the \n     spillover effects from that conflict;\n       Whereas all members of the international community, \n     including regional powers, should contribute substantially to \n     the humanitarian effort so as to avoid shortfalls like those \n     experienced by the World Food Programme, which has been \n     forced to reduce its assistance to refugees.\n       Whereas the European Union has agreed to resettle 120,000 \n     of the refugees who have reached frontline European nations--\n     an important first step in implementing a comprehensive \n     European refugee policy;\n       Whereas the Governments of Germany and Sweden, among \n     others, have shown great generosity towards Syrian refugees;\n       Whereas the United States Government remains the largest \n     contributor to the humanitarian effort in Syria;\n       Whereas the United States Government will accept at least \n     10,000 Syrian refugees next year, marking a significant \n     increase from the approximately 1,500 admitted since the \n     conflict began; and\n       Whereas the United States Government should continue to \n     rigorously employ its existing robust and thorough screening \n     process for refugees to effectively mitigate any potential \n     security threats: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the scale and complexity of the Syrian \n     refugee crisis and the need for the international community \n     to work together to provide resources and capacity to aid \n     refugees;\n       (2) recognizes the generosity and humanitarian commitment \n     of Syria's neighbors who have worked to absorb the vast \n     majority of refugees, as well as the European nations who \n     have made commitments to share in the refugee resettlement \n     effort;\n       (3) welcomes the President's decision to admit at least \n     10,000 Syrian refugees in 2016, and to increase the overall \n     number of refugees received by the United States to 85,000 in \n     2016 and 100,000 in 2017, as an important continuation of \n     United States humanitarian efforts; and\n       (4) recognizes that the refugee crisis is a symptom of the \n     broader conflict in Syria, the persecution of persons based \n     on identity groups, including Christians, Yezidis, Turkmen, \n     and Kurds, and instability in the Middle East and North \n     Africa, and that efforts to resolve those challenges are a \n     necessary component of any plan to address the refugee \n     crisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/senate-section/article/S6941-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6941-S6942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 269--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 19 THROUGH \n           SEPTEMBER 26, 2015, AS ``NATIONAL ESTUARIES WEEK''\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \nWyden, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Nelson, Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. Hirono, Ms. \nBaldwin, Mr. King, Mr. Coons, Mr. Brown, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Markey, Mr. \nMerkley, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Cardin, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Mikulski, and Ms. \nCollins) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

and\n       (2) recreational anglers--\n       (A) took more than 70,000,000 fishing trips; and\n       (B) spent $24,600,000,000;\n       Whereas estuaries provide vital habitats for countless \n     species of fish and wildlife, including many species that are \n     listed as threatened or endangered species;\n       Whereas estuaries provide critical ecosystem services that \n     protect human health and public safety, including water \n     filtration, flood control, shoreline stabilization, erosion \n     prevention, and the protection of coastal communities during \n     hurricanes and storms;\n       Whereas the United States has lost more than 110,000,000 \n     acres of wetland, or 50 percent of the wetland of the United \n     States, since the first European settlers arrived;\n       Whereas some bays in the United States that were once \n     filled with fish and oysters have become dead zones filled \n     with excess nutrients, chemical wastes, harmful algae, and \n     marine debris;\n       Whereas changes in sea level can affect estuarine water \n     quality and estuarine habitats;\n       Whereas the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. \n     1451 et seq.) provides that the policy of the United States \n     is to preserve, protect, develop, and, if possible, restore \n     or enhance the resources of the coastal zone of the United \n     States, including estuaries, for current and future \n     generations;\n       Whereas 24 coastal and Great Lakes States and territories \n     of the United States operate a National Estuary Program or \n     contain a National Estuarine Research Reserve;\n       Whereas scientific study leads to a better understanding of \n     the benefits of estuaries to human and ecological \n     communities;\n       Whereas the Federal Government, State, local, and tribal \n     governments, national and community organizations, and \n     individuals work together to effectively manage the estuaries \n     of the United States;\n       Whereas estuary restoration efforts restore natural \n     infrastructure in local communities in a cost-effective \n     manner, helping to create jobs and reestablish the natural \n     functions of estuaries that yield countless benefits; and\n       Whereas the week of September 19 through September 26, \n     2015, is recognized as ``National Estuaries Week'' to \n     increase awareness among all people of the United States, \n     including Federal Government and State and local government \n     officials, about the importance of healthy estuaries and the \n     need to protect and restore estuaries: Now, therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S6942]]\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of September 19 through September \n     26, 2015, as ``National Estuaries Week'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Estuaries \n     Week;\n       (3) acknowledges the importance of estuaries to sustaining \n     employment in the United States and the economic well-being \n     and prosperity of the United States;\n       (4) recognizes that persistent threats undermine the health \n     of the estuaries of the United States;\n       (5) applauds the work of national and community \n     organizations and public partners that promote public \n     awareness, understanding, protection, and restoration of \n     estuaries;\n       (6) reaffirms the support of the Senate for estuaries, \n     including the scientific study, preservation, protection, and \n     restoration of estuaries;
