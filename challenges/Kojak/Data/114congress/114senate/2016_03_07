Madam President, Nancy Reagan was one of the most \npowerful First Ladies in recent memory. For instance, sometimes she \nspoke out on issues like substance abuse, but more often Nancy wielded \nher power with calm confidence and quiet steel. It was an attitude that \nhelped guide Nancy through so many challenges in her own life: getting \nan acting career off the ground, leaving it to raise a family, riding \nthe ups and downs of a life in politics, watching her husband brave the \nbullet of a would-be assassin or face the threat of cancer, and then \nconfront the same reality herself.\n  Nancy Reagan may have been a star in Hollywood and a force in the \nrough-and-tumble of Washington, but it was the challenges to come that \nwould reveal her true strength.\n  In 1994, former President Reagan addressed a letter to his fellow \nAmericans. He said: ``I now begin the journey that will lead me into \nthe sunset of my life.''\n  Nancy shared her very personal experience with that cold and cruel \ndisease, telling Americans of the ``terrible pain and loneliness'' that \naccompanied Alzheimer's ``very long goodbye,'' but she never gave in or \ngave up. Nancy was strong for her husband, she was a rock for her \nfamily, and she was an example for a nation that looked to her for \ninspiration.\n  One day, after many long and difficult years, Ronald Reagan opened \nhis eyes and looked at Nancy. ``He hadn't done that in well over a \nmonth,'' she recalled. ``But he looked at me and closed his eyes. And \nwent. And that was a wonderful gift.''\n  We felt Nancy's immense pain when she leaned over his casket, kissed \nit, and mouthed her tearful farewell.\n  From ``Morning in America'' to a sunset in Simi Valley, the Reagan \nlove story was classic Hollywood, but it was also unmistakably human. \nNancy said her life had only really begun after she met Ronald Reagan. \nNow she joins her best friend to dance together once more.\n  We in the Senate join our Nation in mourning the loss of Nancy \nReagan. We offer every condolence to the family members left behind.\n  Let us remember the rest of what President Reagan wrote to the Nation \nin 1994. ``I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of \nmy life,'' is what he wrote then, but--but--``I know that for America \nthere will always be a bright dawn ahead.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/07/senate-section/article/S1299-6", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1299-S1300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY BILL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, as I noted earlier, combating \nsubstance abuse was an issue close to Nancy Reagan's heart. It is \nfitting that we will have an important opportunity this afternoon to \naddress the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic sweeping our \nNation. We can do so by advancing the Comprehensive Addiction and \nRecovery Act.\n  Just a few months ago, we appropriated $400 million to opioid-\nspecific programs. We are glad that all of those funds remain available \nto be spent today, and now we can pass comprehensive, bipartisan \nlegislation that will help build upon the progress being made in this \nfight.\n  This CARA bill would expand education and prevention. It would \nbolster law enforcement efforts. It would improve treatment \ninitiatives. This bill has also received broad bipartisan backing and \nthe support of nearly 130 groups dedicated to ending this crisis.\n  We appreciate the work of the senior Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, \nwho worked to move this bill swiftly out of the Judiciary Committee. We \nthank Senator Portman, Senator Ayotte, along with the junior Senator \nfrom Rhode Island and the senior Senator from Minnesota, for all the \nwork they have done to advance CARA. We recognize the continuing \nefforts of Senators on both sides of the aisle who have put party \nlabels aside to build support for this much needed legislation.\n  So let's continue that work by voting for cloture on CARA so we can \ntake an\n\n[[Page S1300]]\n\nimportant step forward to address this national epidemic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/07/senate-section/article/S1300-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I join the Republican leader in extending \nmy sympathies to the entire Reagan family. Nancy Reagan was a wonderful \nFirst Lady. She was also an incredible individual in her own right. She \nwas always gracious and charming.\n  The last time I saw Nancy Reagan, she was here in the Rotunda of the \nCapitol dedicating a statue of her husband, President Ronald Reagan. At \nthat time, she was already well into her late eighties, but there she \nwas, standing next to his statue with a big smile on her face. Her very \npresence brightened the entire Hall--she and Ronald Reagan standing \ntogether, he in the form of a statue, she standing next to him, \ntogether. It really was a fantastic picture.\n  Nancy, of course, will be missed. I say, though, my mind returns to a \ndifferent time. It reminds me of the years Ronald Reagan was in the \nWhite House--a card-carrying conservative, yet a very pragmatic \nRepublican.\n  The Nation will miss First Lady Nancy Reagan and miss her partner, \nthe President of the United States, Ronald Reagan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/07/senate-section/article/S1300-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, from the Des Moines Register. Two former \nLieutenant Governors of the State of Iowa--and I am sure the Acting \nPresident pro tempore knows both of them, one a Democrat and one a \nRepublican--here is what they said, among other things: ``This isn't \nthe Chuck Grassley we thought we knew.'' Again, I repeat, this is two \nIowans, former Lieutenant Governors Joy Corning, a Republican, and \nSally Pederson, a Democrat.\n  Last week former Lieutenant Governors Corning and Pederson coauthored \nan op-ed in the Des Moines Register criticizing the senior Senator from \nIowa for abdicating his constitutional duties by blocking consideration \nof President Obama's Supreme Court nomination. The op-ed reads, among \nother things:\n\n       Iowans are known for being hard workers, and we appreciate \n     that quality in our elected officials. We wake up every day, \n     ready to do our part, and get the job done. We are also \n     politically astute, understand the U.S. Constitution, and \n     know when an elected official is more eager to find excuses \n     than create solutions. Unfortunately, Sen. Chuck Grassley is \n     refusing to do his job as described in Article 2 of our \n     Constitution, giving ``advice and consent'' on the \n     president's upcoming nomination to the Supreme Court.\n       Grassley is threatening to use his powerful post as \n     chairman of the Judiciary Committee to block a hearing on any \n     nominee, regardless of how well qualified he or she is. His \n     recent column and public statements regarding the vacancy on \n     the Supreme Court are troubling and harmful to our courts. \n     Moreover, this isn't the Chuck Grassley we thought we knew.\n\n  ``This isn't the Chuck Grassley we thought we knew.'' I agree with \nthese Iowans. This isn't the Senator I have come to know over the last \nthree decades. The Senator I knew would not cede the independence of \nthe powerful Judiciary Committee he has served on for many decades to \nthe Republican leader. The Senator I knew would not ignore his \nconstitutional duties for the sake of election-year politics, but for \nwhatever reason the Senator from Iowa made a fateful decision in the \nhours after Justice Antonin Scalia's death. He is allowing himself and \nhis committee to be manipulated by the Republican leader for narrow, \npartisan warfare. He is taking his orders from the Republican leader \nand, sadly, Donald Trump. When asked about this issue, Donald Trump's \nwords were three: delay, delay, delay. Senator Grassley must have been \nlistening.\n  The people of Iowa, without question, are displeased with their \nSenator. The Des Moines Register quoted one of Senator Grassley's \ndisappointed supporters as follows:\n\n       He seems to be doing what other people are saying, not what \n     he thinks is best. That has really colored my opinion of him \n     in the past week.\n\n  Another Iowan who supports the Senator told the newspaper:\n\n       I think he's making a bad mistake. . . . It's purely a \n     political party play, and there isn't any space for that in \n     this situation.\n\n  Now, as each day passes, the senior Senator from Iowa is trying \ndesperately to justify his blind loyalty to the Republican leader and \nto Donald Trump. Senator Grassley is grasping for a rationale--any \nrationale--that will excuse him for not doing his job. That desperation \nis now taking Senator Grassley down a very dark path.\n  Last Thursday, the senior Senator from Iowa addressed the \nConservative Political Action Conference, CPAC, which took place here \nin Washington. In his speech to them, here is what Senator Grassley \nsaid: ``I feel it's about time that we have a national debate on the \nSupreme Court and how it fits in with our constitutional system of \ngovernment.''\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee is suggesting that we \nreevaluate the Founding Fathers' work, reevaluate the Constitution of \nthe United States, and change the Constitution of the United States. \nWhy is Senator Grassley debating what the Constitution makes clear? The \nSenate must provide its advice and consent on nominees appointed by the \nPresident to the Supreme Court. Think of the irony. Justice Scalia was \na strict constitutionalist. Yet now, in the weeks following his death, \nSenator Grassley wants to throw out the Constitution just because \nPresident Obama gets to pick Scalia's replacement.\n  The former Senator from Iowa Tom Harkin said it best yesterday. This \nappeared in the Des Moines Register: ``The position taken now by the \nmajority leader and majority members of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nis simply astounding, and not in keeping with a `strict,' or even \n`loose,' construction of the Constitution.''\n  The Constitution isn't some ball you pick up and take home just \nbecause you are still mad that Barack Obama is the President. If \nSenator Grassley and Republicans find themselves on the wrong side of \nthe Constitution, it is their policies that should change, not our \nNation's founding document, the Constitution of the United States. If \nRepublicans are uncomfortable with not performing their duties, the \nanswer isn't to take an eraser to the Constitution. No, we don't need \nto take an eraser to the Constitution. The answer is to do your job.\n  If the Senator from Iowa wants to extricate himself from the \nsituation he created, there is a way. All he needs to do is wrest back \nhis chairmanship from the Republican leader and give President Obama's \nnominee a meeting, a hearing, and a vote. In short, he needs to do his \njob. It is that easy. No changes to the Constitution are required. If \nhe does his job, the people in Iowa will not have reason to say: ``This \nisn't the Chuck Grassley we thought we knew.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/07/senate-section/article/S1300-5", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1300-S1301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, on another subject, last Thursday, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services released updated statistics \nabout the number of Americans who now have health insurance. This is \nObamaCare. The numbers are incredible.\n  Since enactment of the Affordable Care Act, 20 million Americans have\n\n[[Page S1301]]\n\ngained health care coverage--20 million; 6.1 million adults, ages 19 to \n25, now have health insurance.\n  Remember, it wasn't long ago that everyone said they wouldn't sign \nup. Now, 6.1 million have. Before we passed ObamaCare, some 50 million \npeople in this Nation were without health care. Now, because of the \nAffordable Care Act, 91 percent of Americans are now insured. That is \nstunning. It is only getting better. Every day, more and more people \nwho were previously without health insurance are now covered. That is \ntrue across racial and ethnic lines.\n  Listen to these stunning statistics. The uninsured rate for African \nAmericans has dropped by more than 50 percent. That is the equivalent \nof 3 million newly insured people. The uninsured rate for Hispanics \ndropped by more than 25 percent, representing 4 million insured \nAmericans.\n  The evidence is clear: The Affordable Care Act is working. From \nNevada to Kentucky, our constituents are getting the quality health \ncare they were promised when Congress passed the Affordable Care Act. \nIt is time for Republicans to stop following Donald Trump's lead by \nclamoring for repeal.\n  It is really nervy for Republicans to come down here, as they do all \nthe time in the Senate--they have been quiet lately--and as they do on \nthe campaign trail. This large number of Republicans, which is narrow, \nstill all say the same thing: The American people should listen to what \nwe are saying; we have to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. We have \nto get rid of it.\n  How disappointing. It is time for Republicans to face the facts. \nObamaCare is helping tens of millions of Americans and will continue to \ndo so.\n  Madam President, I ask the Chair to announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/07/senate-section/article/S1301-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, as my colleagues in the Senate just \nheard, the tantrums from the other side continue, but I guess it \nshouldn't surprise anybody because everyone around here knows that \nnothing makes the minority leader more mad than when his side is forced \nto play by its own rules.\n  The American people are divided, and the divided government the \nAmerican people delivered over the last several election cycles \nreflects those divisions.\n  Our constitutional Republic was designed with a series of checks and \nbalances. As any branch gets too powerful or exceeds its authority and \ntries to impose policies the American people don't want, the people \nexpress their will through the electoral process, and that is what we \nhave witnessed during the last several election cycles.\n  Over the last few years, our current President has engaged in a \nsystematic and very massive overreach of his executive power, way \nbeyond what the Constitution has ever considered, and--thank God for \nchecks and balances--the courts have said as much, and that is why I am \nhere today. I am here today to tell you how the courts have interceded \nand curbed this massive overreach of Executive power. But as he has \ndone so, the people have responded.\n  Since he was first sworn into office in 2009, nearly 70 additional \nRepublicans have been elected to the People's House. And there are 13 \nmore Republican Senators today than there were in January of 2009.\n  In January of 2014, frustrated that the people's representatives \nwouldn't enact his liberal policies, the President famously said that \nhe would use ``a pen and a phone'' and impose his agenda anyway even \nthough Article One of the Constitution is very clear. It states that \nthe legislative powers of the United States shall be vested in the \nCongress, not with the President of the United States.\n  Just a few months later, in November of 2014, the people spoke and \nsent nine additional Republicans to the U.S. Senate.\n  This is the beauty of our system of checks and balances, and the \nFramers of our Constitution designed it that way. The Framers knew a \nthing or two about Executive overreach, because they had to deal with \nsomebody called George III. They had firsthand experience with an \nExecutive, King George III, who imposed his will on the people \nunilaterally.\n  So you wonder why our Constitution has checks and balances? The \nPresident holds the Executive power, the Congress writes the laws, and \nthe Supreme Court interprets them. That is what we call separation of \npowers. That's why we have checks and balances. That's why we have \nseparation of powers. And that is why our Constitution is designed so \nthat no President can appoint a Supreme Court Justice with a pen and a \nphone.\n  As we continue to discuss what is at stake during this Presidential \nelection and whether the American people want to elect a President who \nwill appoint yet another liberal Justice, I wanted to take a few \nminutes to review some of this President's efforts to expand the reach \nof his power and impose his will on the American people. This President \nhas pushed the envelope at every turn. He has sought to impose his will \non the American people in ways and to a degree that this Nation has \nnever before witnessed.\n  What is striking about this President's record before the Supreme \nCourt is that even with a Court as liberal as ours, the Obama \nadministration still has the lowest winning record of any President \ngoing back to at least the Truman administration. When presented with \nthis undeniable fact, the President's apologists quickly grasp for the \nnearest bogus defense. Most notably, they claim that the Supreme Court \nis more ideologically hostile to this President than previous Courts \nwere to other Presidents. Now that is a very crafty argument, but it is \nwhat Justice Scalia would have called ``pure applesauce.''\n  Leading Supreme Court analysts declared the last term of the Supreme \nCourt, even with Justice Scalia on that Court, as the most liberal \nsince the 1960s. So the President's defenders can't blame the Court's \nmakeup for its rebuke of his expansive claims of power. And of course \nthis explanation fails to account for the fact that President \nEisenhower took office and litigated in a Supreme Court with eight \nJustices who were appointed by Democrats or that President Nixon's \nadministration began with an even more liberal Court than Eisenhower. \nNo, this President hasn't lost cases because the Court is ideologically \nhostile to this President and his policy; the Court has rejected this \nPresident's power grabs because they are based on ideology and an \nunwillingness to recognize that the law constrains that power.\n  All too often the President's claims are supported by an Office of \nLegal Counsel and a Solicitor General's Office that seem unwilling to \ntell the President that his impulse for expanded power is flatly \ncontrary to the law. I'd like to describe a few examples. The \nPresident's lawyers argued that he could ignore the Senate's \ndetermination--this body's determination--of when it was in session in \norder to make recess appointments. No President in our history ever \nclaimed that recess appointments were permissible in that situation. \nBut the Office of Legal Counsel--once considered the crown jewel of the \nDepartment of Justice--offered a tortured justification to sanction \nthat assertion of power.\n  If this view of Presidential power were allowed to stand, the \nPresident could bypass the Senate with ease to install individuals in \npowerful government positions with no check from the\n\n[[Page S1302]]\n\nSenate, as the Constitution envisions. Fortunately, the Supreme Court \ndisagreed 9 to 0. That means even this President's appointments to the \nSupreme Court said that he violated the Constitution with those recess \nappointments. The Constitution clearly says that the Senate shall \ndetermine when we are in session and in recess.\n  That isn't the only example. The Obama administration argued that the \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission could resolve an employment \ndiscrimination case between a minister and the church that fired her. \nThe Supreme Court found the Obama administration managed to violate two \ndifferent provisions of the First Amendment at the same time. It \nviolated the free exercise of religion clause because if the \nPresident's argument carried the day, the government could interfere \nwith a church's doctrine. Additionally, it violated the establishment \nclause of the First Amendment because if this President had his way, \nthe Federal Government could get into the business of selecting a \nchurch's ministers. The Supreme Court rejected those claims 9 to 0.\n  On the regulatory front, in a series of rulings, the Supreme Court \nrejected the President's arguments that agencies can deny the ability \nof private citizens to seek relief against regulatory overreach. For \ninstance, the Court rejected the Environmental Protection Agency's \npowers to force a homeowner, through escalating fines, to comply with \nan order while at the same time denying that homeowner the ability to \nchallenge the order in court. The Supreme Court rejected Obama's EPA's \nclaims 9 to 0.\n  In another case, the Court held--contrary to the position advanced by \nthe Army Corps of Engineers--that a landowner could sue in court for \njust compensation for a taking when the government-caused flooding of \nhis property is temporary and recurring. Again, the Supreme Court \nrejected the government's position 8 to 0.\n  When the Internal Revenue Service attempted to enforce a taxpayer's \nsummons while at the same time denying the taxpayer the right to \nquestion the IRS official about their reasons for the summons, the \nSupreme Court rebuked the administration 9 to 0.\n  In still another case, the Court rejected the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission's argument that its decisions aren't subject to \njudicial review when that agency concludes by its own estimation it \nfulfilled its duties to attempt conciliation under title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964. Once again, the Supreme Court rejected that \nclaim by this administration 9 to 0.\n  Similarly, when a veteran's benefits were denied and the appeal \nwasn't filed within a certain time period, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs turned around and denied that veteran the ability to seek \njudicial review. The Supreme Court rejected the position of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs 8 to 0.\n\n  And when the Federal Communications Commission changed its policies \nmidstream regarding isolated examples of indecent language, the Supreme \nCourt found 8 to 0 that the FCC had violated due process.\n  These are important rulings. Far too often, this administration \nimposes government power against the people while brushing aside \nimportant procedural safeguards. Remember, the Constitution is to \nprotect the people from its government--something we learned from \nGeorge III.\n  Justice Frankfurter spoke to this point. He once wrote: ``The history \nof liberty has largely been the history of the observance of procedural \nsafeguards.''\n  Consider as well areas in criminal law where the Obama administration \npressed positions that erode individual freedom. This President's \nlawyers argued that the police could install a GPS device on a vehicle, \nand then use that device to monitor the car's movements without a \nsearch warrant under the Fourth Amendment. I don't know what would be \nleft of the Fourth Amendment if the Supreme Court had upheld the \nPresident's claim that the government could operate in that manner. \nThankfully, the Supreme Court rejected that argument as well. The vote \ntally was 9 to 0.\n  The Court blocked the Justice Department's prosecution of a person \nunder the Chemical Weapons Convention because the convention didn't \nreach the defendant's simple assault. Again, the Supreme Court rebuked \nthe President 9 to 0.\n  These are not the rulings of a Supreme Court that is ideologically \nhostile to the Obama administration. Every one of these rulings was \nunanimous--every one. And there are still other Supreme Court decisions \nrejecting this President's power grabs where the vote tallies were much \ncloser.\n  The President and his lawyers made utterly baseless arguments for \nexecutive and regulatory power in case after case. In so many of these \ncases, the unifying thread underlying this President's litigating \nposition is the notion that the people are subservient to the Federal \nGovernment and, of course, subservient to its agencies, rather than the \nother way around. So far the Supreme Court has not agreed.\n  But during this Presidential election, the American people should \nconsider whether they want to elect a President who may nominate a \nJustice who will embrace such a vast expansion of executive and \nregulatory power. This is what I've called for in a number of speeches, \nboth in Iowa and here as well. This is an opportunity for the American \npeople to have their voices heard. Letting the people decide in the \nelection isn't just about who the next Justice on the Supreme Court is \ngoing to be. It is about the role of the Supreme Court and the judicial \nbranch in our constitutional process.\n  We heard just a little while ago the floor leader of the minority \nparty saying that somehow I want to rewrite the Constitution. This \nisn't about rewriting the Constitution. The Constitution is pretty \nclear: The Supreme Court interprets law, not makes law. And with the \napproval rating of the Supreme Court going down from about 50 percent \nto 28 percent in polls ever since this President took office, and the \ntendency for some Republican appointees as well as Democrat appointees \nto make the law the way they want it, that is just getting back to the \nbasics--that the Supreme Court is an interpreter of the law, not a \nmaker of the law.\n  So I think having a basic debate similar to what people learn in high \nschool isn't a bad thing.\n  Now, will an election change what the Supreme Court, the people who \nare on it now, decide to do? I don't know--probably not. But it will \nallow for the next elected President to have the opportunity to choose \nwhich direction they want it to go. Do they want a Justice who is going \nto interpret the law or a Justice who is going to make the law?\n  Before the passing of Justice Scalia, we had four conservative \njustices, four liberal justices, and one in the middle--Justice \nKennedy--who could go either way in some cases. We know what kind of \njudicial activists this President puts on the Supreme Court. Do you \nwant to change the direction so that the Second Amendment rights of \nguns are in jeopardy or like when we saw attempts by this \nadministration to say who a church can hire or not hire--and violate \nthe freedom of religion--and other very important issues that are at \nstake?\n  It is pretty fundamental what is at stake, and I think having this \ndebate is very important. And I think letting the people decide is very \nimportant.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I have come to the floor several times \nto talk about the ongoing investigation into the private email server \nof former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n  While serving as the top diplomat for the United States, she plainly \nbelieved she could play by her own set of rules. Instead of using a \ngovernment server with all of the attendant protections from cyber \nattacks and intelligence gathering by our adversaries, Secretary \nClinton paid a staffer thousands of dollars to set up a private, \nunsecure\n\n[[Page S1303]]\n\nemail server at her home in New York. So it is pretty clear, based on \npublished reports, that Secretary Clinton went out of her way by paying \nmoney out of her own pocket to avoid important laws that Congress has \npassed to guarantee that the American people actually know what their \ngovernment is doing. I am talking particularly about the Freedom of \nInformation Act.\n  I haven't heard of any other example of someone in the Federal \nGovernment--accountable to the people of the United States--setting up \na separate private email server just to conduct official business, not \nto mention the Secretary of State. It is simply unprecedented.\n  Her actions also put our country at risk, as her private email server \nwas reportedly unsecure. We have heard time and again from those in the \nintelligence community that her use of an unsecure, private email \nserver left her emails--some highly classified--vulnerable to hacking \nand cyber attack from our Nation's enemies.\n  We may never know the full extent to which her irresponsible actions \nhave affected our military endeavors, our diplomatic efforts, our \noverall national security or the lives and safety of those who serve in \nthe intelligence community or are in harm's way trying to keep our \ncountry safe. We don't know to what extent her recklessness and \nirresponsibility have jeopardized the lives of people who are engaged \nin keeping our country safe. We do know that it has jeopardized the \nsecurity of our country at large.\n  To this day, Secretary Clinton refuses to accept full responsibility \nfor her actions and denies the serious nature of the FBI's ongoing \ninvestigation, calling it only a ``security review.'' Well, it is \npretty clear that the Justice Department is doing an investigation. \nJust this last week, it was reported that the Justice Department \ngranted immunity to the staffer who set up Secretary Clinton's server. \nSo this further confirms that Secretary Clinton is misrepresenting to \nthe public when this inquiry is dismissed as some routine ``security \nreview.''\n  We don't grant immunity from criminal prosecution to someone in order \nto gain their cooperation to testify in a case where they otherwise \nwould claim the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. That \nis why immunity is granted--so they no longer can claim a belief that \nthey might be prosecuted for being a witness against themselves. That \nis why immunity is granted.\n  So this indicates what I have said all along, which is that this is a \nserious investigation that may determine that classified information \nhas been mishandled--a serious crime. The Justice Department should \npursue this case as aggressively as it would any other case involving \nany other person where there has been concern about the mishandling of \nclassified information because the American people deserve nothing \nless.\n  Secretary Clinton is not just some random citizen or former \ngovernment employee; she was a member of this President's Cabinet and \nSecretary of State. In light of this extraordinary case and the \nunavoidable myriad of conflicts of interest, I have called repeatedly \non the Attorney General to appoint a special counsel to fully and \nfairly conduct the investigation. It is not just important that a \nthorough and independent investigation be conducted; it is important \nthat the American people have confidence and believe that a fair and \nindependent investigation is being conducted. One simply can't reach \nthat conclusion, given the fact that the Attorney General, who is the \npolitical appointee of this President and who serves at his pleasure, \nis loathe to have this investigation proceed, and I will get to that in \na moment. The President has inappropriately made comments while this \ninvestigation is ongoing. I asked the Attorney General last fall--she \nis the only one who can make this decision--to appoint a special \ncounsel to give some semblance of independence from the political \noperation at the Department of Justice and the White House. \nUnfortunately, almost 6 months later, no independent counsel has been \nappointed. I think the necessity for such a person to be appointed is \neven more critical than ever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/07/senate-section/article/S1303-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY BILL\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, we will soon end the debate and vote on \na bill known as the CARA Act, a piece of legislation that will help \nrestore families and communities across America that have been harmed \nby addiction and drug abuse. This is a serious piece of legislation \nthat has been done on a bipartisan basis and is a good illustration of \nhow we in the Senate ought to be doing our jobs as representatives of \nthe American people. We identify a problem, and we work across the \naisle to come up with a solution. We consider it on the floor of the \nSenate so that all 100 Members can have an opportunity to discuss it.\n  An essential part of getting this legislation considered and passed \non the floor is the hard work that happens in the respective \ncommittees, and the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act is no \nexception. It is not only the result of bipartisan work but also the \nleadership of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the senior \nSenator from Iowa. We would not be here today considering this \nimportant legislation without Chairman Grassley's leadership. So it has \nbeen particularly disappointing for me to hear the Democratic leader \nand some across the aisle disparage this good man and say that he and \nother Republicans are not doing their jobs. I think the evidence is to \nthe contrary. It is our job to advance commonsense legislation that \nwill benefit the entire country. That is exactly what this legislation \ndoes and exactly what the chairman has been diligently pursuing.\n  I would like to remind our friends across the aisle that the \nlegislation we will soon advance is a bill the chairman diligently \nguided through the Judiciary Committee. I am thankful for his \nleadership and look forward to moving this bill along.\n  Madam President, I see no other Senator wishing to speak.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/07/senate-section/article/S1303-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, before I begin, as we discuss the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, I would like to take a moment \nto thank Senator Whitehouse for his role in developing the bill and \nbringing it this far. I also convey my gratitude to Minority Leader \nReid and the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, \nfor their excellent staffs and for urging that my amendments--which I \nwill address momentarily--be a part of the discussion and for managing \nthe negotiations on this bill. I also thank Senator Murray, the ranking \nmember of the HELP Committee, for help and counsel on amendments.\n  Let us pause for a moment and consider the causes of the prescription \nopioid and heroin epidemic gripping our country. Understanding the \ncauses will help us focus on the right solutions. Three distinct \nparties bear much of the blame for this public health crisis.\n  First, there is Big Pharma. In the mid-1990s, the seeds of this \nepidemic\n\n[[Page S1304]]\n\nwere planted with the aggressive, misleading, and ultimately criminal \nmarketing of the powerful opioid painkiller, OxyContin by Purdue \nPharma. Perdue claimed OxyContin was not addictive and couldn't be \nabused. Neither of those claims turned out to be true. Purdue Pharma \nbuilt a massive marketing and sales program for OxyContin. From 1996 to \n2000, Purdue Pharma's sales force more than doubled from more than 300 \nsales representatives to almost 700 sales representatives. In 2001 \nalone, Purdue gave out $40 million in bonuses to its burgeoning sales \nforce. As a result of these sales and marketing efforts, from 1997 to \n2002, OxyContin prescriptions increased almost tenfold, from 670,000 in \n1997 to 6.2 million in 2002.\n  Purdue's marketing of OxyContin broke the law. In 2007, Purdue Pharma \npaid $600 million in fines and other payments after pleading guilty in \nFederal court to misleading regulators, doctors, and patients about the \nrisks of addiction to OxyContin and its potential for abuse.\n  Second, Purdue Pharma's criminal wrongdoing did not occur in a \nvacuum. The Federal Government helped to enable this epidemic. The \nFederal Drug Enforcement Administration is responsible for approving \nthe annual production quotas for pharmaceutical companies to \nmanufacture oxycodone, the principal ingredient in OxyContin. From 1996 \nto 2016, the Drug Enforcement Administration obliged Big Pharma and \nincreased by almost 150 percent the amount of oxycodone authorized for \nmanufacture. In 1996, the DEA authorized U.S. pharmaceutical companies \nto make the equivalent of 6 billion 10-milligram OxyContin pills. By \n2016, that figure had increased to almost 14 billion 10-milligram \npills. That is right. Today the Drug Enforcement Administration is \ntelling Big Pharma it is OK to make 14 billion OxyContin pills to sell \nin the United States in 1 year.\n  The Federal Food and Drug Administration was also complicit, \napproving new opioid after new opioid. In the process, the FDA, charged \nwith ensuring the safety of all prescription drugs on the U.S. market, \nbegan turning a blind eye to outside experts who were warning of the \ndangers these drugs posed.\n  In 2013, an expert panel established to review the powerful new \nopioid painkiller Zohydro, voted 11 to 2 against recommending its \napproval, but the FDA approved the drug anyway, overruling the concerns \nvoiced by experienced physicians on the panel.\n  In 2014, in the wake of the Zohydro decision, the FDA twice skipped \nthe advisory committee process altogether when it approved two new \nprescription opioids.\n  Then, in August of 2015, the FDA did it again. This time it bypassed \nan advisory committee of outside experts on the question of a new use \nfor OxyContin for children aged 11 to 16. The FDA even ignored its own \nrules that specifically call for advisory committee advice when a \ncommittee of pediatric dosing is involved. It was clear that the FDA \nwas intentionally choosing to forgo advisory committees in order to \navoid another overwhelming Zohydro-like vote, recommending against \napproval of a prescription opioid and in order to avoid any impediments \nto new opioids being sold in the United States.\n  Finally, the medical profession must bear its fair share of \nresponsibility for this crisis. Doctors are prescribing opioids at an \nalarming rate. In 2012, America's doctors wrote 259 million \nprescriptions for opioid pain relievers, enough pills for every single \nAmerican adult to have a bottle of opioid pills given to them in the \nyear 2012.\n  And America's doctors are dangerously uninformed about the drugs they \nare prescribing. A recent survey of 1,000 physicians nationwide found \nthat ``only two-thirds correctly reported that the most common route of \nabuse was swallowing pills whole.'' It is unconscionable that our \ndoctors are so ill-informed. Nearly half of the doctors surveyed also \nerroneously reported that so-called abuse-deterrent formulations of \nopioids were less addictive than their counterparts. Abuse-deterrent \nopioids are supposed to be harder to crush, so they are harder to snort \nor to mix with liquid and inject, but abuse-deterrent formulations of \nopioids are just as addictive as non-abuse-deterrent opioids. Whether \nan opioid is abuse-deterrent or not hasn't prevented tens of thousands \nof people who have had their wisdom teeth removed or experienced lower \nback pain from getting addicted to these painkillers simply by \nswallowing them.\n  So what is the result of the combination of Big Pharma's marketing of \nprescription opioids, the Federal Government's repeatedly approving \nthem in ever-increasing numbers, and our doctors writing millions of \nprescriptions for them? Today, the United States is less than 5 percent \nof the world's population but we consume 80 percent of the world's \nopioid painkillers. We have become the United States of Oxy.\n  When prescriptions run out or the price of Oxy pills on the street \nbecome too high for those who have become addicted, they turn to \ncheaper heroin, which shares the same molecular structure as OxyContin. \nEighty percent of the people suffering from heroin addiction started \nwith opioid pain medications approved by the FDA and prescribed by \ndoctors.\n  In 2014, nearly 33,000 people died of an opioid overdose in this \ncountry. Almost 1,300 of those deaths were in my home State of \nMassachusetts.\n  I had hoped to offer amendments to CARA to address both the causes of \nthis epidemic and to provide treatment for those suffering from the \nresults. One of my amendments would have required the FDA to convene \nadvisory committees for all prescription opioid approval questions.\n  After I placed a hold on the nomination of Dr. Robert Califf to serve \nas FDA Commissioner, the agency announced it would only commit to \nconvene advisory committees for non-abuse-deterrent opioids. The FDA \nrefused to agree to convene advisory committees to inform all of its \nopioid-approval decisions.\n  We need legislation requiring the FDA to seek expert advice about the \nrisk of addiction before it approves any and all opioids, and I will \ncontinue to fight to require advisory committees at the FDA.\n  We also need legislation requiring doctors to get and stay educated \nabout the dangers of the pills they are prescribing in record numbers. \nStopping the overprescription of opioid painkillers is a critical step.\n  We need to ensure that all prescribers of these opioid painkillers \nare educated in the dangers of these drugs, how easily individuals can \nbecome addicted, and when and how to appropriately prescribe. The \ndoctors say that they do not want education to be mandated, that it \nshould be voluntary. Well, the FDA has had voluntary education for \nopioid prescribers in place since 2013 and has been actively \nencouraging doctors to take these voluntary education programs, but in \nmore than 2 years, only 12 percent of prescribers have actually \ncompleted FDA's voluntary education program.\n  It is imperative that any provider who is applying for a Federal DEA \nlicense to prescribe opioids have completed mandatory education on the \nbasics of opioid prescribing and the inherent risk of addiction. My \namendment would have done just that. It would have required basic \neducation as a condition of a DEA license to prescribe these \npainkillers, and I will continue to fight to require prescriber \neducation.\n  Finally, we need to remove the barriers to effective treatment, \nincluding outdated Federal restrictions on medication-assisted \ntherapies such as Suboxone. Medication-assisted therapy for opioid \naddiction is cost effective, decreases overdose deaths, and reduces \ntransmission of HIV and hepatitis C. Unlike other treatment regimens \nfor any other disease, physicians are severely limited in the number of \npatients they can treat with medication-assisted therapies such as \nSuboxone, contributing to long wait-lists and an inability of patients \nto get treatment for their addiction when they need it. Of \napproximately 2.5 million Americans who abused or were dependent on \nopioids, fewer than 1 million received treatment for their condition, \npartly because of the already existing Federal instructions.\n  Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and I have a bipartisan bill, the \nRecovery Enhancement for Addiction Treatment Act, or TREAT Act, which \nhas broad stakeholder support, including the American Medical \nAssociation and nurse practitioners. It emphasizes quality of care and \ncloses this gaping\n\n[[Page S1305]]\n\nhole in our addiction treatment system. We had hoped to offer TREAT as \nan amendment to CARA. We will continue to fight for it and are hopeful \nthe HELP Committee will include it in the substance abuse legislation \nthe committee will soon consider.\n  My collaboration with Senator Paul shows that whether it is the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts or the Commonwealth of Kentucky, this \ncrisis is the same. It doesn't discriminate by geography, by age, by \nrace, by socioeconomic status, or by employment. It requires a \nbipartisan effort.\n  Thirty years ago, Nancy Reagan told us to just say no to drugs. Today \nwe have to go further. We have to say enough is enough. We have to \nrecognize what has worked and what hasn't worked. In the past, we \nbelieved we could incarcerate our way out of the problem. That did not \nwork. So instead of ignoring and incarcerating, let's avow and act. \nLet's destigmatize, not criminalize. Let's treat, not retreat. Let's \nhave a comprehensive plan which we put in place that deals with the \npharmaceutical companies, the physicians, and the kinds of treatment \npatients need across our country so that they get the help they need. \nThat is our job.\n  I continue to believe we can do this in a bipartisan fashion as long \nas we understand the magnitude of the problem and what the causes of it \nwere and continue to be and will be into the future unless and until we \nput these safeguards in place. So I am looking forward to continuing to \nwork with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I compliment \nthem for the work they have done so far in bringing this bill to the \nfloor of the Senate this week, but I do believe there is more to be \ndone.\n  As long as this many Americans are addicted, as long as this much \nOxyContin and opioids are put into our system, then we are going to \nfind that this heroin epidemic we have in our country, which is \ndirectly related, will continue to spiral out of control.\n  I want to work with all my colleagues. I thank my colleagues for all \nthe work they have done so far, but there is much work to be done in \nthe future.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would like to talk for a few minutes \nabout the crime problem we have in America today, the dramatically \nincreasing problem of heroin abuse. Over the last week, we have had a \nlot of discussion about this crisis, which I am afraid we are just on \nthe cusp of. I think it is going to get worse, based on my experience \nand my best judgment, but the effort to understand and address it has \nbeen going on for a while.\n  In January, we had a good hearing on this issue in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, and I want to mention a few things I think we \nought to keep in mind as we address this very important problem.\n  Just as background, I served 15 years as a prosecutor, 12 as a U.S. \nattorney, a Federal prosecutor, and 2\\1/2\\ as an assistant U.S. \nattorney. So that was my background when I came here. I was very active \nand studied the drug and crime problem in America, and I learned some \nthings.\n  There are cycles in this, and people wrote about it over the years. I \nthink we are, unfortunately, moving into another cycle, and we have to \nbe very careful. It is so painful to have a large prison population. We \ndon't want to have that. Year after year, everybody wants to look for \nalternatives to prison, and we have tried, but if you go too far, you \nend up not having sufficient consequences for crime, not detaining \ndangerous offenders, and you end up increasing crime, increasing deaths \nof Americans from murders and other things, increasing heroin and \nserious drug problems that destroy families, destroy lives, destroy \ncommunities, and result in violence and death. It is a very real \nproblem.\n  A lot of people think, well, if you want to use heroin, so be it. \nWell, these people can't function. How are they going to survive? They \neither steal or they get on welfare or they have to go to treatment. \nAnd who pays for it, since they do not have any money?\n  We have proven and seen for decades that drug use can be brought \ndown, fewer people can become addicted. In the early 1980s, Nancy \nReagan, as President Reagan's wonderful wife, formed the ``Just Say \nNo'' program, and hundreds of thousands of volunteers nationwide in \nevery community in America got together in their communities--they got \nthe treatment community, the law enforcement community, the prevention \ncommunity, the education community, and the schools--and they worked \nand worked and crafted policies that would create a climate of \nhostility for the use of dangerous drugs. The idea was to bring down \nthe use. As a result, the use of illegal drugs dropped by half. It took \nus 15 or more years, but it dropped by half steadily. What a tremendous \nvictory.\n  In 1980, half of our high school seniors admitted they had used an \nillegal drug sometime in that year. What an unbelievable number. It had \nbeen going up steadily, it peaked, and then it began to go down under \nthis sustained effort.\n  What I have been worried about for some time, and have warned about \nit, is that if you don't maintain that but start going in the other \ndirection, you can expect drug use to increase. It is that simple. And \nit is happening. Lives--and young people's lives--will be destroyed by \nthis, families will break up, and children will be scarred.\n  Drug use is no fun, innocent thing. It is destructive. If this Nation \nis using half as much illegal drugs as before, it is a better nation. \nIt just is. And if we double the amount of drug use in America, it will \nbe a more dangerous Nation and not as good a nation.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over \n47,000 people died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2014. In \n2014, 47,000 died. That is one drug overdose death for every 12 \nminutes. And 61 percent of those overdoses involved opioids. The rate \nof all opioid overdoses in the United States has tripled since 2000. \nOverdoses have tripled since 2000.\n  Heroin overdose deaths specifically have increased sixfold since \n2001--600 percent--and have more than tripled in just the past 4 years \nalone. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, there \nwere approximately 169,000 new heroin users in 2013.\n  According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration, in 2004, approximately 589,000 people in the United \nStates had an opioid use disorder. We used to call that addiction--a \nproblem. It is affecting their lives.\n  The Drug Enforcement Administration's 2015 National Drug Threat \nAssessment noted that ``drug overdose deaths have become the leading \ncause of injury death in the United States, ahead of motor vehicle \ndeaths and firearms.''\n  This is a significant matter. As DEA Acting Administrator Chuck \nRosenberg, a bright, young mind appointed by President Obama, noted \nlast July that ``[a]pproximately 120 people die each day in the United \nStates of a drug overdose.''\n  Some argue that the increase in heroin abuse is due to over-\nprescription of opioids from prescription drugs--you get addicted from \na prescription drug, and then you move to heroin. I am sure that has \nsome validity, but according to a January 14, 2016, study published in \nthe New England Journal of Medicine, one of the premier authoritative \nmedical journals in the world:\n\n       In the majority of studies, the increase in the rates of \n     heroin use preceded the change in prescription-opioid \n     policies, and there is no consistent evidence of an \n     association between the implementation of policies related to \n     prescription opioids and increases in the rates of heroin use \n     or deaths, although the data are relatively sparse. \n     Alternatively, heroin market forces--\n\n  Please hear this, colleagues--\n\n       Alternatively, heroin market forces, including increased \n     accessibility, reduced price, and high purity of heroin \n     appear to be major drivers of the recent increases in rates \n     of heroin use.\n\n  So it is purity, price, and accessibility. While treatment and \naccountability are critical to breaking the cycle of addiction, it is \nnot the whole solution. We must also reduce the availability of \nheroin--we simply have to do that--and other illicit opioids.\n  In December of last year, the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention Director Tom Frieden said it is important ``that law \nenforcement''--a lot of people don't want to talk about this. We have \npolice officers, sheriffs' deputies, Federal agents, drug enforcement\n\n[[Page S1306]]\n\nagents, and Border Patrol agents. He said it is important ``that law \nenforcement intensify efforts to reduce the availability of heroin, \nillegal fentanyl, and other illegal opioids.'' Similarly, Drug \nEnforcement Administration Acting Administrator Rosenberg said in the \nDEA's National Drug Threat Assessment that, in addition to providing \ntreatment to addicted opioid abusers, ``law enforcement must continue \nto have the tools it needs to attack criminal groups who facilitate \ndrug addiction.''\n  I have been there. I was part of law enforcement's efforts. I \ninvested a tremendous amount of my time in the Coalition for a Drug \nFree Mobile, the Partnership for Youth, Bay Area Drug Council--groups \nlike that--working on a volunteer basis to change the use of drugs in \nthe community. Law enforcement was always a critical part of it, and \nlaw enforcement does have the capability in ways that others don't to \nreduce the availability, make purity levels less, and otherwise \nrestrict, raising the price of an illegal drug. The DEA's 2015 National \nDrug Threat Assessment confirms this. They studied the price of the \ndrugs. One thing that tells us whether or not law enforcement and \ninterdiction are effective is to discover if the price is going up or \ndown.\n  Mexican drug cartels are flooding the United States with cheap heroin \nand methamphetamine. When I was a young prosecutor, it was coming from \nTurkey, the Middle East, and that was pretty much shut off. President \nCarter did some good things. I was an Assistant U.S. Attorney and came \nback a few years later as a U.S. Attorney, but during that time they \nsomehow reduced the supply of heroin from the Middle East. As a result, \nheroin addiction dropped all over the country, and very little heroin \nwas in the heartland of America--mainly just in the big cities.\n  We are also getting cheap methamphetamine from across the Mexican \nborder, which is wide open. The statistics from the DEA Drug Threat \nAssessment confirm that, from 2010 to 2014, the amount of heroin seized \nevery year at the southwest border has more than doubled. Well, are we \ncatching that much more? No, we are not catching, I am sure, any \nsubstantially larger percentage. We are just having a larger amount \nmoving across the border. The price has fallen, so we know we have \nmore. If prices stay low, more people will try it more often, and as \nthe purity level is higher, more people will get addicted sooner and \noften die quicker.\n  These drug cartels are partnering with criminal gangs and fueling \nviolence in our cities and communities. According to DEA's 2015 Threat \nAssessment, Mexican drug cartels ``control drug trafficking across the \nSouthwest Border and are moving to expand their presence in the United \nStates, particularly in heroin markets.'' They import, transport, and \nare now actually selling it in our cities instead of just bringing it \nin across the border.\n  In 2013, the heads of the Chicago Crime Commission and the Chicago \nOffice of the Drug Enforcement Administration both named El Chapo \nGuzman, the infamous leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, as Chicago's \n``Public Enemy #1.'' So a man in Mexico, moving heroin and \nmethamphetamine into the United States and hammering Chicago with it--\nChicago named him as their No. 1 public enemy. It cannot be a \ncoincidence, as the FBI's uniform crime statistics show, that the \nmurder rate in Chicago increased by approximately 18 percent during the \nfirst 6 months of 2015. At that rate, it is a 36 percent increase in \nmurders in Chicago in 1 year. This is an unbelievably dramatic surge in \nmurders.\n  Another example is Atlanta. DEA's Atlanta office reported an increase \nof heroin availability from a rating of ``stable'' in the first half of \n2013 to ``high'' just a year later. According to the FBI's uniform \ncrime statistics, the murder rate in Atlanta increased by approximately \n15 percent in the first 6 months of 2015. This is an unsustainable \nthing. The old rule is a 7-percent increase and your money doubles in \n10 years. When you get 15- and 18-percent increases in 6 months--that's \n30 percent in 1 year--you are doubling the crime rate, the murder rate, \nin 3 years.\n\n  At a November hearing of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics \nControl, I asked DEA Deputy Administrator Jack Riley about these drug \ndistribution networks and the people in local communities pushing the \ndrugs, selling the drugs, and collecting the money. This money \neventually ends up back in Mexico, Colombia, and South and Central \nAmerica, funding the evil, violent drug cartels that are destabilizing \nwhole nations. He responded that it is ``almost as big a problem as the \ncartels themselves.''\n  When I asked him whether these drug traffickers are the ones causing \nthe violence and death on our streets, he responded that ``they are the \nones that regulate themselves by the barrel of a gun.'' If you want to \ncollect a drug debt, you can't file a lawsuit in Federal court. You \ncollect it by the barrel of a gun.\n  By its very nature, drug distribution networks are violent criminals. \nIt has always been so, and it will always be so. Conducting an illegal \nenterprise, they have to maintain discipline, and they use threats and \nviolence to maintain it and collect their debts. We must not forget \nwhat became obvious in the early 1980s, when I was a U.S. Attorney: \nDrug dealers and their organizations are not nonviolent criminals. \nThese are violent crimes.\n  Rather than enforcing the law and making it tougher on drug cartels \nby keeping our border secure, the Obama administration has done exactly \nthe opposite. Our unsecured borders make it easy for the cartels to \nflood our country with cheap heroin, and the administration has made it \nclear that officers are not to deviate from the President's lawless \nimmigration policy. They are blocked from doing their job and following \ntheir oath.\n  Just last week--and as someone who has worked closely with Federal \nDrug Enforcement officers and immigration officers as a Federal \nprosecutor--Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske \ntestified before the House Committee on Appropriations that ``if you \ndon't want to follow the directions of your superiors, including the \npresident of the United States and the commissioner of Customs and \nBorder Protection, then you really do need to look for another job.''\n  Do you hear what he is saying there, colleagues? What he is saying is \nthat if you want to do your job and enforce the laws as the laws are \nwritten, which we have ordered you not to do, and you go on and do it \nanyway, then look for another job. It is one of the most amazing things \nI have seen in my entire law enforcement career. ICE officers--\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement officers--who enforce drug laws, \nalong with immigration laws, these officers sued their supervisors. \nThey sued their supervisors, alleging that they were being ordered to \nviolate their oath to enforce the immigration laws of the United States \nby these restrictive policies.\n  It is hard to overestimate the destruction the Obama administration's \npolicies--their Executive amnesty, their refusal to sufficiently fund \nand man the border--are causing to law enforcement. A big part of this \nnow is the openness to heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana, and other \ndrugs that are being imported. I take that statement by the \nCommissioner of Customs and Border Protection as a direct threat to \nthose officers who want to follow their oath and do their duty.\n  In August 2013, a dramatic event occurred that was too little \nappreciated. Attorney General Holder, the Attorney General of the \nUnited States, ordered Federal prosecutors not to charge certain drug \noffenders with offenses that carry mandatory minimum sentences that are \nin law. If you have so much drugs, you have a minimum penalty. You can \nget more than that, but you at least have to serve this minimum \npenalty. He ordered them not to charge those crimes. This is directing \nprosecutors not to follow the law. It has contributed to a decrease in \nthe number of traffickers being prosecuted and convicted. According to \ndata from the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, at the end \nof 2015--in December--the 6-month average of drug prosecutions was down \n21 percent compared to 5 years ago. And what are we seeing? A surge in \ncrime, particularly drugs. Excluding prosecutions in magistrate courts, \nthe 6-month average was nearly 32 percent lower at the end of 2015 than \n5 years ago. We haven't cut the number of drug prosecutors. We haven't \ncut the\n\n[[Page S1307]]\n\nnumber of DEA agents. This is policy that softens the enforcement of \ndrug crimes against what we have been doing for 25 years, and it is \nhaving an impact. I am afraid it is going to continue.\n  Meanwhile, State and local law enforcement agencies are not given the \ntools they need to continue taking these dangerous drug traffickers off \nof the streets.\n  On December 21, 2015, the Department of Justice chose to stop all \nequitable sharing payments to State, local, and tribal partners under \nthe Asset Forfeiture Program. These are seized proceeds, moneys that \nare seized from drug dealers, big fancy cars and boats that they seize. \nFor the last 20 years, Federal and State officers worked together. The \nFederal Government has a good system for forfeiting the money. Then, \nwhen the forfeiture is over, it is divided among the agencies. As a \nresult, State and local people are willing to commit law officers to \nparticipate in these local task forces because they are helping clean \nup drugs in their community, helping identify and prosecute nationally \nsignificant drug dealers, and they get some compensation back from it \nwhen they find a truck full of money.\n  I personally have seen cases where $1 million, $500,000, $800,000 in \ncash was seized from these people. Some people think, oh, this is \nwrong; you shouldn't take their cash. This is the ill-gotten gain of an \nillegal enterprise and they should be able to keep it? They have no \nproof of any lawful source of this money. Virtually every time, in \naddition, there is evidence to prove it is connected to drugs. Half the \ntime, they don't even show up to contest the seizure because they know \nthey have no defense to it. This stops this sharing, and it is \nundermining the unity of effort that we really need to be successful.\n  A joint letter signed by the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, the National Association of Police Organizations, the Major \nCounty Sheriffs' Association, the National Sheriffs' Association, the \nNational District Attorneys Association, and the Major Cities Chiefs \nAssociation, pointed out that ``the suspension of equitable sharing \npayments may cause some agencies across the country to reconsider their \nability to participate in joint task forces with the Federal \nGovernment.''\n  In other words, they are going to stop participating.\n  ``The effects of this decision are far reaching and not only a \ndisservice to law enforcement, but also to the public they are sworn to \nprotect.''\n  Mr. President, if there is a limit on my time or others are waiting \nto speak, I will wrap up. Otherwise, I have about 5 minutes to wrap up. \nI see my colleague Senator Leahy, the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee. I don't want to block him. If my time is up, I will yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). There is no time limit in place.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. While law enforcement resources are being cut off, law \nenforcement officers are being blocked from doing their jobs, and drug \nprosecutions are being reduced, the administration and some in Congress \nwant to push and advance a criminal justice ``reform'' bill. But these \nproposals will have a tendency, I am afraid, to worsen the current \nproblem by allowing for more reductions in sentences than are already \noccurring and early release of thousands of dangerous drug traffickers, \nand the weakening of penalties for those prosecuted under our drug \ntrafficking laws, which have already been weakened--sending the wrong \nmessage at exactly the wrong time.\n  I am very concerned about this. I love my colleagues, and I know \ntheir hearts are in the right place, but I am convinced we should not \nbe heading in this direction at this time.\n  Make no mistake, Federal prisons are not filled with low-level, \nnonviolent drug possessors. According to the Bureau of Justice \nStatistics, 99.7 percent of drug offenders in Federal prison at the end \nof fiscal year 2012 were convicted of drug trafficking offenses, not \ndrug possession. Drug trafficking is inherently violent activity, and \nit only serves to fund the drug cartels while fueling violence in our \ncities.\n  According to the FBI, violent crime overall increased across the \nUnited States during the first half of 2015, by 6.2 percent for murders \nand 17 percent in the larger cities for murder--the largest single-year \nincrease since at least 1960. Already this year, homicides in Chicago \nare double what they were all of last year.\n  This is a complex subject. It is too soon to know the total reason \nfor this increase, but it cannot go unnoticed that over the last decade \nthe Sentencing Commission, which sets standards for sentencing in the \nUnited States--outside of the minimum mandatories that are set by our \nlaw passed by Congress--has unilaterally imposed reductions in the \nsentences for drug inmates currently in prison. So we reduced the \nsentences for those in prison and they are getting out earlier. The \nmost recent reduction in sentences resulted in the release of more than \n46,000 drug traffickers--not drug possessors, drug traffickers--which \nhas been wholeheartedly supported by the Obama administration.\n  According to Bureau of Justice Statistics, 77 percent of drug \noffenders released were rearrested within 5 years. Hear this now: 77 \npercent of these drug offenders were rearrested within 5 years, with 25 \npercent of those rearrested being rearrested for a violent crime--\nsomebody hurt, maybe dead. Maybe that is part of the murder rate \nincrease.\n  Take Wendell Callahan, a Federal drug felon who was convicted of \ntrafficking in crack cocaine and released early pursuant to the \nSentencing Commission's directives. Upon his early release, he \nproceeded to brutally murder his ex-girlfriend and her two little \ngirls, 7 and 10. He would have been deep into a 12\\1/2\\-year Federal \nsentence if it had been maintained, but the Sentencing Commission \nreduced it. The judge granted his petition for early release because of \nhis ``good behavior'' in prison, and that led the judge to conclude he \ndid not pose a danger to the safety of the public, even though in his \nbackground--when he was convicted and got the 12 years, he had \npreviously been convicted in connection with a shooting offense and \nanother drug offense. This is why you have to have some controls on \njudges. I have been there, and I saw it before the sentencing \nguidelines were passed.\n  The Federal prison population is at its lowest level since 2008. We \nare already on a downward course of the drug Federal prison population \nbeing reduced. There are only 160,000 inmates in Bureau of Prisons \ncustody today, well below its peak. The Bureau of Prisons has stated \nthat this ``downward population trend is expected to continue into \nFiscal Year 2017,'' bringing the Federal prisons population to the \nlowest level since 2005.\n  The population is up. Crime is going up. The prison population is \nfalling rather rapidly. Admissions to Federal prison have declined \nevery year since 2011.\n  You hear: We are filling our prisons. We are doing more and more.\n  Actually, there are other things that are already happening. It is \nhappening in State prisons, too, where larger numbers are incarcerated \nthan in the Federal prisons. One of the reasons we are having this \nlarge decline in State prisons is not public safety but tight budgets. \nThey are cutting back on the prison population to save money.\n  We can be smarter. Some people can be released early. I worked with \nmy Democratic colleague, Senator Durbin, 6 years ago, I believe, and we \nreduced the crack penalties more significantly than a lot of people \nknow. I thought that was justified. But we are now proceeding well \nbeyond that, and it is causing me great concern.\n  The Attorney General has ordered the prosecutors to not charge \ncertain criminal offenses. Reducing sentences and releasing felons is \nequivalent to reducing the cost to the criminal enterprise of their \ncriminal activity. It reduces the cost, the risk. Thus, crime--it is \nalready rising--would further increase as a result of the criminal \njustice ``reform'' bill that would further reduce penalties.\n  Can we take a breath, and let's think about this? I don't say there \naren't some things we can do that will allow for some reduction in the \nFederal prison population. Some people probably serve more time than is \nabsolutely necessary. But in truth, we have seen dramatic improvements \nover nearly 30 years, 25 years, in the reduction of crime. Until this \nsurge, murder rates were less than half what they were in 1980 when I \nbecame a Federal prosecutor. Drug use dropped dramatically\n\n[[Page S1308]]\n\nwhen Nancy Reagan started the ``Just Say No'' program, and drug use \nbegan to steadily decrease. It is now beginning to steadily increase.\n  You have to have leadership from Washington. You can't have the \nPresident of the United States of America talking about marijuana like \nit is no different than taking a drink, saying I used marijuana when I \nwas in high school and it is no different than smoking.\n  It is different. And you are sending a message to young people that \nthere is no danger in this process. It is false that marijuana use \ndoesn't lead people to more drug use. It is already causing a \ndisturbance in the States that have made it legal. I think we need to \nbe careful about this.\n  What if this is the beginning of another surge in drug use like we \nsaw in the sixties and seventies that led to massive problems in our \ncommunities? The solution? Well, we have to control the border. All the \nheroin and a big chunk of the methamphetamine is coming across the \nMexican border. We need barriers. We need more agents. People need to \nbe arrested. They need to be deported. They don't get to be taken to \nsome city in the United States they would like to go to and get \nreleased and asked to show up on bail, which they never do. That is an \nopen invitation to illegality and illegal entry.\n  We need to enforce our laws, and we have to make the consequences of \ndrug trafficking a deterrent. We can do this. We have done it before, \nand it is all part and parcel with prevention programs, education \nprograms, and treatment programs. All that has to be done, but it \ncannot be denied, in my opinion, that law enforcement plays a critical \nrole in it. This means supporting, not blocking the efforts of law \nenforcement to do their jobs and giving them the tools to arrest drug \ntraffickers and be effective at the border, putting them in jail, not \ngiving them early release so they can commit more crimes.\n  In January, a woman from Ohio named Tonda DaRe testified before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee at a hearing on the heroin and prescription \nopioid epidemic. She shared the powerful story of her daughter, who \ndied from a heroin overdose. She said this:\n\n       One of the things that I see happening in our little town \n     that frustrates me is . . . our officers have worked so \n     diligently to arrest people that they know are bringing this \n     [heroin] in. Just [to] have them go in front of our judges \n     and our judges just slapped these people on the wrist and \n     sent them right back out the door. . . . The boy that sold my \n     daughter the heroin that killed her just recently went back \n     in front of a judge for his fourth offense for trafficking \n     heroin. [It was the] fourth time he's been arrested for this \n     and he was given five months. How [is] that possible?\n\n  We can talk about making sure we have treatment and recovery for \npeople who have been addicted, although many people never ever recover \nfrom addiction--except by the grave. That is the sad truth. We should \nmake that a priority. But we cannot hope to solve these problems by \nonly treating people on the back end of addiction without reducing the \navailability of those drugs and keeping the purity down and the cost \nup, not continuing to fall. We have to stop people from becoming \naddicts in the first place, and we can't let the fact that we have a \nheroin abuse epidemic cause us to forget that we have a drug \ntrafficking epidemic too.\n\n  Law enforcement is prevention. Experts tell us that the price, \npurity, and availability of drugs, especially heroin, fuels more \nconsumption, more addiction, more crime, more death, and more human and \nfamily destruction. I wish it were not true. I wish there were more \noptions, but law enforcement is a central part of this effort, and \nhistory proves it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                   51st Anniversary of Bloody Sunday\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today is the 51st anniversary of Bloody \nSunday--a horrible abuse of American citizens that occurred in Selma, \nAL. Each year we commemorate the events of that fateful day, because it \nhelped transform our Nation and proved to be a catalyst for the passage \nof the Voting Rights Act. For the last two years, this commemoration \nhas been a sad reminder of what five justices did to that cornerstone \ncivil rights law. In Shelby County v. Holder a narrow majority of the \nCourt drove a stake through the heart of the Voting Rights Act when it \nstruck down the coverage formula for its preclearance provision in \nSection 5.\n  I mentioned that because under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, \nthe Federal Government has the authority to examine and prevent \nracially discriminatory voting changes from going into effect before \nthose changes disenfranchise voters in covered jurisdictions. By \nstriking down the coverage formula that determined which States and \njurisdictions were subject to Federal review, the Court rendered \nSection 5 unenforceable.\n  Unfortunately, even though almost every single Republican and \nDemocrat in the House and Senate voted for the Voting Rights Act, the \nSupreme Court, by a 1-vote margin--notwithstanding that 535 of us had \nvoted--drove a stake through the heart of the Voting Rights Act by \nstriking down the coverage formula for its preclearance provisions in \nSection 5.\n  Since then Republican Governors and State legislatures have exploited \nShelby County by enacting sweeping voter suppression laws that \ndisproportionately prevent or discourage black Americans from voting. \nThis includes the State of Alabama, which not only enacted a burdensome \nphoto identification law after the decision, but then they made it even \nharder for many of its black citizens to obtain identification when the \nState closed more than 30 DMV offices in mostly poor, minority \nneighborhoods last October.\n  It is hard to fathom that in 2016, well over 100 years after the \nCivil War and passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the \nConstitution, and after transformative moments, such as Bloody Sunday, \nthat States would continue to pass laws and take actions that would \nundermine black Americans' rights to vote.\n  This past weekend, Congresswoman Terri Sewell, who represents the 7th \nDistrict of Alabama--which includes Shelby County, Birmingham, and \nSelma--held a public forum in Birmingham to examine the harm caused by \nthe Supreme Court's Shelby County decision. Several witnesses at that \nforum testified that the State had made it harder for their citizens to \nvote, and that a disproportionate number of those citizens were \nminorities. They also spoke about the urgent need to restore the \nprotections of the Voting Rights Act. Congressman John Lewis, our great \ncivil rights hero, was in attendance, and it is heartbreaking to \nrealize that so many of the gains that he was able to help secure \nthrough his civil rights activism are being undone today.\n  Despite the compelling testimony about the urgent need for Congress \nto address voting rights, most Republicans in Congress continue to \ndisregard the urgency of this issue. More than two and a half years \nsince the Shelby County decision, and despite the introduction of two \nseparate bipartisan bills that would restore the protections of the \nVoting Rights Act, the Republican chairs of the Judiciary Committee \nfrom both houses of Congress refuse to even hold a hearing on this \nissue. Instead, Republican leaders have only paid lip service to the \nissue, supporting the award of congressional medals for brave civil \nrights leaders. That is not enough.\n  Recently, the Speaker of the House stated that he was supportive of \none of the bipartisan voting rights restoration bills. In the same \nstatement he explained that nothing could be done because the \nRepublican chair of the House Judiciary Committee refuses to take up \nthe bill or to have a hearing. This is not leadership. The American \npeople expect more than talk.\n  This pattern of Republican obstruction reached unprecedented heights \nrecently when a few Senate Republicans declared that they would not \neven hold a hearing for the next Supreme Court nominee even before the \nPresident has even announced a nominee.\n  Republicans have apparently decided that rather than be transparent \nand hold public hearings and votes on the most significant issues of \nthe day--including voting rights, comprehensive immigration reform, and \nthe next Supreme Court nominee--they would simply shut down the \nprocess. Instead they are making important and timely decisions \naffecting hundreds of millions of Americans behind closed doors. It is\n\n[[Page S1309]]\n\nnot good for our democracy and it is not good for the American people.\n  We need hearings and a vote on the voting rights bills. And we need a \nhearing and a vote on the next Supreme Court nominee. We remember what \ncame to be known as Bloody Sunday because the blood that was shed led \nto greater democratic participation and a more inclusive union. What \nRepublicans are doing now undermines the hard-fought legacy of Bloody \nSunday and the Civil Rights Movement. For the good of the Nation, I \nurge that Republican leaders in the Senate and the House change that \nshameful course.\n  Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote to bring us one step closer \nto passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act or CARA. \nLast week I suggested that we stay in session and do our job on \nThursday, Friday, and Saturday so we could finish the bill, but I \nunderstand the Republican leadership wanted to take a long weekend, so \nwe did not finish it, but now we can.\n  I am a cosponsor of this bill because it addresses the growing \nproblem of prescription opioid and heroin addiction that has had \ndevastating impacts on communities all over the country, including my \nhome State of Vermont.\n  This bill represents an important shift in the way we approach the \nissue of substance abuse and addiction. It sets a comprehensive \nframework to reduce opioid deaths, prevent addiction, and improve \ntreatment. It will also help those who suffer from opioid use disorders \nachieve recovery, and perhaps most importantly this bill reflects the \nconsensus of this body that the Nation cannot arrest or jail its way \nout of this addiction problem.\n  Since my first field hearing in Rutland, VT, on this topic in 2008, I \nhave been inspired by how my fellow Vermonters across the political \nspectrum have shaped the discussion about this public health crisis and \nhow they have served as a model for communities across the Nation.\n  I certainly feel this bill represents important progress, but we \ncannot be satisfied with just passing this one bill. We also need a \nsignificant commitment of targeted funding so we can carry out and \nimplement the programs authorized by this bill.\n  It is one thing to say we are going to authorize these great programs \neven though we are not going to pay for them, but don't you feel good \nthat we authorized them. Now we can all go home and tell our \nconstituents we care. We authorized it, but we will not pay for it.\n  At least Senator Shaheen stood and proposed an amendment that would \nhave provided emergency funding to do just that. Her vital amendment \nhad the support of a majority in this body, but Republican Senators \nblocked it from being considered and adopted. It is unfortunate because \nSenator Shaheen's amendment would have provided the resources to \nstrengthen both the law enforcement and public health components that \nwould have delivered the necessary resources to health care \nprofessionals all over the country who are overwhelmed by a need they \ncannot meet.\n  I believe there is bipartisan agreement that we have to stop the loss \nof life caused by opioid abuse. There should be a bipartisan agreement \nto provide the money necessary to do so.\n  There is an opportunity to make the bill better. Many Members have \nfiled amendments to improve CARA. A number of amendments were filed by \nboth Republicans and Democrats. Unfortunately, the Republican leader \nhas not allowed us to have an open amendment process, and contrary to \nwhat he said earlier, a number of Senators have been blocked from \noffering their amendments. I tried to work--and did in a bipartisan way \nwith Senators Grassley, Whitehouse, and Klobuchar--to consider this \nbill and report it to the Senate floor. We have continued our \nbipartisan effort to reach agreement on a number of amendments that \ncould improve the bill. I hope those important bipartisan efforts will \ncontinue this week so we can consider these amendments and have final \npassage this week.\n  Let us have an open process. These amendments can be voted on up or \ndown or adopted by consent. It is one thing for us to talk about what \nwe want to do, it is another thing to have the courage to vote for it. \nIf we do not vote for it, we are just voting maybe. Let us vote yes or \nno.\n  As we work toward Senate passage of CARA, our goal should be to make \nthis the best bill possible. Addiction is nothing less than an epidemic \nand CARA treats it like one. This bill demonstrates that Congress now \nsees addiction for what it is--a public health crisis all over our \ncountry. We need to equip our communities with both the programs and \nresources they need to get ahead of addiction.\n  CARA will save lives. It is worth putting the money in there to make \nsure it works.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia on the floor, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the senior Senator from \nVermont, who is a dear friend of mine. As he knows, this is a problem. \nIt is an epidemic all over this country. No State is immune from it. It \ndoesn't matter whether you are a Democrat or Republican. It has no \nhome. It attacks and literally eradicates all of us, and it causes \nextreme hardships for all the families.\n  I know the Presiding Officer, who is from Indiana, is aware of this \nproblem. Every week I have come to the floor to read letters from \npeople who have been affected by addiction in West Virginia and other \nStates. I have a letter from the Presiding Officer's home State of \nIndiana, and I have a letter from my State too.\n  This is something we have been fighting. The CARA Act is a bipartisan \npiece of legislation. It is not going to be a cure-all, but it starts \nin the right direction for us to start looking at opioid addiction and \nprescription drug abuse, not as much as we have in the past as a crime \nbut as an illness, and an illness needs to have treatment. I think we \nare moving in that direction. Politically we are accepting this, and we \nare going to basically meet that need of treatment which is so few and \nfar between.\n  We have 51 people dying every day. In my little, beautiful State of \nWest Virginia, just last year we lost over 600 lives to prescription \ndrug abuse, and I have a State with less than 2 million people. From \n1999 to 2013 there has been an increase of over 700 percent.\n  This is a product which has come on the market that is greater than \nanything we have ever seen. We hope the FDA gets serious about this. \nThey are hearing us loud and clear. Dr. Califf was not someone whom I \nsupported. I am very hopeful he will do a great job, and I will support \nhim. He needs to step up to the plate and change the culture of the \nFDA. The reason I say that is because the FDA has to take their role \nseriously and not just approve drugs because it meets a certain \ncriteria but also needs to realize the impact it has on the well-being \nof the families who have been addicted and affected. They need to \nconsider the devastating public health impacts of its repeated \ndecisions to approve all of these drugs that don't need to be on the \nmarket. We are very hopeful for that.\n  The thing that brings that to mind is that it took us forever to get \nVicodin and Lortab from a schedule III to a schedule II. It took us \nover 3 years. Once we did, it took about 1 billion pills off the \nmarket, which resulted in a 22-percent decrease in Vicodin and Lortab, \nwhich were being passed out like M We know it can save lives. Yet \nthey came right back with Zohydro, which was against the wishes of \ntheir advisory committee.\n  We believe it is imperative that they have an advisory committee for \nevery opioid they want to bring to the market. They must listen to the \nadvisory committee. If the FDA--the Commissioner and his staff--wishes \nto go ahead and put a product on the market that is recommended not to \nbe on the market from their advisory committee, they should come before \nus in Congress and tell us why they believe this potent drug such as \nZohydro is needed when it is against the recommendations of these \nexperts and specialists.\n  We have been flooded with these stories. I will read a story from the \nPresiding Officer's State of Indiana first.\n\n[[Page S1310]]\n\n  The girl's name is Danielle. She says: I live in Southern Indiana and \nwork as a server. About 2\\1/2\\ years ago a customer by the name of Josh \nHarvey left me his number. At the time, he told me he was living in \nChicago for school. Little did I know he was in rehab there. Granted, I \ndidn't know about his addiction for over a year because we hadn't \nstayed in constant contact. About a year or so ago I found out about \nhis heroin addiction. He still told me little about it. I do know it \nstarted out with prescription pills and later went into heroin when the \npills became harder to get. He served a month in jail in Michigan, for \nthe entire month of this past July, over a heroin-related charge. He \ncame home immediately after and overdosed that same weekend. Luckily, \nhis dad saved him that time. Now he got enrolled in college and was \ngoing to an outpatient program doing better--or so we all thought. \nSchool let out for break and I guess it all went downhill. He came to \nme on November 4 telling me he had used a couple of times and wanted my \nadvice. I suggested an inpatient program. He went to Wellstone after he \nleft my house, sat for several hours and finally was given a room. I \nwent and checked on him two different times while he waited to make \nsure he was there. Thursday I didn't receive any calls. Friday nothing \neither. Then, Saturday morning, the 7th of November, his mother called \nme to break my heart. He had passed away that Friday the 6th over in \nLouisville and they didn't know who to contact until that Saturday \nmorning, I guess. He had checked himself out of Wellstone, broke into \nhis house, and took his Xbox, which he later either pawned or traded \nfor heroin. Never in a million years did I think I would become close \nto anybody addicted to heroin. It doesn't discriminate. It can get a \nhold of anyone and everybody. Never in my life have I been so depressed \nor heartbroken. All I want is his story shared. He was my happy ending \ngone way too soon.\n  That was from our friend in Indiana who wanted to share her story \nwith us.\n  Let me tell you about Amanda, who lives in West Virginia.\n  Amanda said: I walked into our new apartment. Although we had only \nspent 2 nights there, it already felt like home. I was so excited to \nmove in with Nate. We had been on the fence between being best friends \nand a couple, and making the decision to move in together had finally \nsettled years of uncertainty. As I turned the corner, I was surprised \nto see that he was in the exact same position as when I had left for my \nmorning classes. I knew it had been a rough night of ``partying,'' but \nI thought he would be up to start our busy day of painting and moving. \nI touched his chest to feel the rise and fall, something that, as a \nmother, I had been doing to sleeping children for years. There was \nmovement. He was breathing. I breathed a quick sigh of relief. I walked \nto the back of the apartment to set down my things, and that is when I \nrealized I needed to go and get some things from my old apartment, and \nI started to leave. My hand was on the doorknob, but something stopped \nme in my tracks. To this day, I don't know why I turned around. I laid \ndown beside Nate, and I put my arm on his chest. He was not breathing, \nand when I looked up at his face, his eyes were wide open, but it was \nobvious that he was not there. The paramedics revived him to the point \nthat he survived in a coma for 1 week. At one point while in the \nhospital, his eyes opened, and I thought that our nightmare was over, \nbut it was just a muscle reflex and false hope. On January 30, 2007, \nprescription drugs took the life of Nathan Keith Dunn, age 24.\n\n  Tall, dark, and handsome is what the world saw. Intelligent, funny, \nwitty, loving, and kind were the qualities seen by those who knew Nate \nbest. He was my best friend, my musical soulmate, and my sounding \nboard. We were inseparable, and I began to experience an ache in my \nheart that, 9 years later, still occasionally brings me to my knees. \nBut that is just who Nate was to me. He was also the older son of a \nmother who had left years of abuse at the hands of her husband in order \nto find a better life for her sons. He was the brother to--and the only \nsoft spot of--a boy who had been hardened growing up on the streets of \na town outside of Houston, TX. It seemed as if the only thing that ever \nkept him grounded was Nate's love. They had one another's back in the \nbest and worst of times. Nate was also the instant crush of any girl \nwho ever laid her eyes upon him. He was the best friend of anyone who \nknew him. I often wonder who and where he would be today. But I guess I \nwill just have to wonder forever.\n  I wish this was the end of my story about how prescription drugs have \naffected my life, but it is not even close to the end. For longer than \nI care to admit, drugs have been part of my everyday life. Shortly \nafter Nate's death, I became addicted to prescription opiates. At \nfirst, they were prescribed by my doctor. Eventually, I couldn't get \nthrough a day without them. I was what is sometimes referred to as a \n``functioning addict,'' although it is fair to say that such a thing \ndoes not exist. To the outside world, I appeared to be fine, normal \neven. I held a job. I cared for my young sons. I kept a tidy home. \nMeanwhile, my tolerance was building, and I began to require more and \nmore of the drugs just to feel normal, just to get through each day. \nCan you imagine living this life in which you wake up each day \nwondering if you have enough of the drug you need just to be OK for \nthat day?\n  So many people are facing this every single day. It could be the \nperson sitting next to you. It could be your child's teacher. Even \nworse, it could be your own child.\n  The first thing to suffer was my financial situation. Every dime I \nhad was spent on the drugs that would allow me to function today, \ntomorrow, and if I am lucky, the next. Then, my relationships with \nfriends and family began to fail. It was painfully obvious that I was \nstealing from them. Next, I couldn't keep a job--a record that will \nhaunt me for the rest of my life. How could I go to work? How could I \ncontinue on?\n  Then, a catalyst walked into my life. I met a very good man. As we \nbecame closer, I realized that I couldn't bring myself to tell him that \nI was a drug addict.\n  This is a silent killer. Nobody speaks; they all keep it very quiet.\n  Mr. President, if I may have about 1 minute to finish up, I would \nappreciate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Very few people know what is actually happening in your life. In \norder to get help, you have to be willing to openly talk about your \nissues, and most of us fear being harshly judged--and rightfully so.\n  Trying to treat a person with addiction issues by using medication \nonly or therapy only is like trying to extinguish a raging house fire \nwith a garden hose.\n  She said: I was fortunate enough to have found a medication-based \ntreatment program in my area, which is paid for by my insurance.\n  She is going to move forward, and she wanted this story to be told. \nShe said she wanted people to know how difficult it is.\n  What we need to know as policymakers is how hard it is for people in \nour States who realize they need help and can't find it.\n  So what I ask all of us to do--this CARA bill is a step in the right \ndirection. It is a piece of legislation that is much needed. As we move \nforward today on this piece of legislation, I hope we will find \nbasically the support that people are needing to fight this opiate \naddiction.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 86, the nays are 3.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, that is good news. The Presiding Officer \njust announced the results of the vote, and that is good news because \nit means the Senate has just taken another step toward the passage of \nCARA, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act.\n  I see my colleague Senator Whitehouse is on the floor. I thank him \nand thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for moving forward \non this legislation that will help us to save friends, family members, \nour neighbors, and communities that are struggling with addiction.\n  This is a very important opportunity for us to be able to move \nforward on legislation that is comprehensive, that is bipartisan, and \nthat has a companion bill on the House side, so there is a very good \nchance we could get this to the President's desk. It is the only \nbipartisan legislation that is comprehensive and evidence based, and it \nis critical we move forward with it.\n  In addition to Senator Whitehouse, I also thank Senator Ayotte, \nSenator Klobuchar, and 42 bipartisan cosponsors for their support.\n  Frankly, more important to me is the support around the country this \nlegislation has. I think Senator Whitehouse and I now have over 130 \ngroups around the country that are supporting this legislation. This \nincludes doctors, nurses, health care professionals, also law \nenforcement, people who are in the trenches dealing every day with \ntreatment and recovery, and those who are focused on prevention and how \nto ensure people cannot just be treated for addiction but try to keep \npeople out of the funnel of addiction.\n  We started working on this legislation about 3 years ago. We started \nby hearing from experts around the country. We had five conferences in \nWashington where we looked at all the issues, including criminal \njustice, women and addiction, the science of addiction, youth \nprevention, recovery issues, substance abuse impacting our veterans--a \nnumber of issues that enabled us to write legislation that actually \nmakes sense, that will make a difference in our communities. These 130 \ngroups around the country are focused on getting this bill passed \nbecause they know it is going to make a difference in our communities.\n  If enacted, this will help States and communities develop and \nimplement these evidence-based practices that we have looked at from \naround the country. It expands prevention and educational efforts to \nprevent prescription opioid abuse and the use of heroin and increases \ndrug disposal sites to keep medications out of the hands of youth.\n  It also authorizes law enforcement task forces to combat heroin and \nmethamphetamine and expands the availability of the overdose reversal \ndrugs such as naloxone, which are miracle drugs. It provides not just \nnaloxone but also more training to our law enforcement officials, to \nfirefighters, and to other emergency responders.\n  In the criminal justice system, CARA will help promptly identify and \ntreat individuals suffering from substance abuse and expand diversion \nand education efforts to give individuals a second chance. Frankly, it \nis going to help to get people into treatment rather than going into \nthe criminal justice system. Locking up people hasn't worked. If people \nare being arrested for possession alone, for using, this legislation \nwill help to divert those people into the treatment to get them back on \ntheir feet.\n  CARA also authorizes resources to expand treatment in general, \nincluding medication-assisted treatment--again based on the research \nthat has been done around the country.\n  It allows veterans who were discharged for a substance abuse disorder \nto use drug courts as they recover. So it provides actual grants to \nthese veterans treatment courts. They are doing a terrific job. I have \ntoured these in Ohio and talked to some of these veterans who have been \nthrough these programs. Again, it helps get our veterans back on the \nright track. Rather than ending in jail, they end up in a treatment \nprogram with other veterans helping them and supporting them, where \nthey can begin to deal with their addiction and mental health issues.\n  CARA supports recovery programs, including those focused on youth and \nbuilding communities of recovery. This happens now at our colleges and \nuniversities increasingly. We want to support that. It also creates a \ntask force on recovery to improve ways to address the collateral \nconsequences imposed by addiction.\n  One of the most important aspects of this legislation expands drug \ntreatment for pregnant women who struggle with addiction and provides \nsupport for babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome, babies who \nare born with addiction.\n  Recently, my wife Jane and I visited Rainbow Babies and Children's \nHospital in Cleveland, OH. We toured the neonatal unit. If you haven't \ndone this, it will break your heart because you will find there an \nincreasing number of babies who are born, again, with this addiction, \nthe neonatal abstinence syndrome. Unfortunately, when you look at what \nhas happened in Ohio, we have had a 750-percent increase in the number \nof babies who are diagnosed with this neonatal abstinence syndrome just \nsince 2004--a 750-percent increase. I am told in some of our States now \n10 percent of the babies are being born addicted.\n  I have also been at other hospitals around our State, including \nCincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and St. Rita's Special \nCare Nursery in Lima, OH. Last week my wife went to Nationwide \nChildren's Hospital in Columbus. Every single one of these children's \nhospitals is experiencing the same thing. What I have learned from \nthese incredibly compassionate nurses and doctors who take these \nnewborns\n\n[[Page S1312]]\n\nthrough a withdrawal process is that the numbers of babies who have \nbeen exposed to heroin or prescription drugs continue to grow. The \nproblem is getting worse, not better. These hospitals serve as yet \nanother reminder that addiction is a disease. It is a disease that has \nto be treated like other diseases, and it is a disease that can impact \nanyone.\n\n  It is wonderful that these caring nurses, doctors, and others are \nworking to try to ensure that these babies become healthy. We don't \nknow what the long-term consequences are, but we need to do more to \navoid the addiction in the first place and better treat it when it \noccurs, and that is what this legislation does. Specifically, the \nmeasure takes steps to help women and babies by expanding treatment for \nexpectant and postpartum women and authorizing the Department of Health \nand Human Services to award grants to ensure that these women have \naccess to evidence-based treatment services. That is in this \nlegislation. It also reauthorizes residential treatment programs for \npregnant and postpartum women struggling with addiction.\n  There is a great center in Columbus, OH, called Amethyst. I had the \nopportunity to visit it. It is a treatment center, and the average \nlength of stay there is almost 2 years. Their results are unbelievable. \nThey allow women to come with their babies, with their children, to go \nthrough treatment together. So there is hope. There are treatment \ncenters doing a great job. We want to hold those up and encourage more \nof that around the country.\n  Finally, the legislation also creates a pilot program for State \nsubstance abuse agencies that allows funds to be used to target women \nwho are addicted to opioids and provide family-based services to those \nwomen in nonresidential settings. So it helps on the residential side \nbut also with the nonresidential outpatient side.\n  Helping these women and helping these babies is just one aspect of \nthis bill, but it is a very critical one. As we work to turn the tide \nin the struggle against addiction, it is one on which we should all be \nfocused.\n  The good news is that the bipartisan momentum we have seen here \ntonight is building. I think the Senate is ready to move on this \nlegislation this week. There are other amendments that have been filed. \nThe deadline was today. I hope we will have the opportunity to go \nthrough some more amendments, as we did last week, but meanwhile, we \nhave strong support and strong momentum, as we saw tonight, on both \nsides of the aisle. Both Republican and Democratic leaders have lined \nup to support this legislation. We need to pass this bill and get it \nsigned into law so it can begin to make a real difference in the lives \nof people we represent.\n  As the heroin epidemic in Ohio and around the country has reached \ncrisis level, I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this \nbill over the finish line here in the Senate and then get it passed in \nthe House, where there is companion legislation, and then on to the \nPresident's desk and enable this Congress to play a role as a better \npartner with State and local governments and with our nonprofits around \nthis country to address this growing heroin epidemic around our entire \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                         Miners Protection Act\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, last week I met with Rita Lewis of \nWestchester, OH, in southwest Ohio. She was here to testify in front of \nthe Senate Committee on Finance in honor of her late husband Butch.\n  Butch worked as a trucker for 40 years with the promise that the \npension he earned would be there to care for his family after he \nretired.\n  I would also add that Butch had been drafted by the Pittsburgh \nPirates to play baseball some 45 years ago. Instead, he enlisted to go \ninto the U.S. Army and on to Vietnam. He was injured and could never \nplay baseball again competitively. He came back and became a trucker \nand joined the Teamsters.\n  As I said, he worked as a trucker for 40 years with the promise that \nthe pension he earned would be there to care for his family after he \nretired. But for Butch and Rita and thousands more Ohio retirees, that \npromise is under threat. Truckers and mine workers in Ohio and across \nthe country are facing crippling cuts to the benefits they have earned.\n  The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act that Congress passed 2 years ago \nallows pension trustees to propose massive cuts to the earned benefits \nof retirees when a plan is running low on funds. This is disgraceful. \nIf a pension fund is in bad shape, it is our job to fix it, not break \npromises to American workers who have worked their whole lives to earn \nthat pension. I believed that 2 years ago when I voted against that law \nwhich allowed these proposed cuts, and I believe it more strongly now. \nThat is why I am calling on the Treasury Department to reject and to \nreject immediately the proposed cuts to the Central States Teamsters' \npension. I am calling for us to immediately mark up and pass the Miners \nProtection Act, which will protect the benefits Ohio workers earned \nover a lifetime of work.\n  Under MEPRA, the bill I talked about a moment ago, multiemployer \npension trustees such as Central States are now able to propose massive \ncuts to the earned benefits of participants and retirees if the plans \nare in ``critical and declining status.'' Pension trustees for plans in \n``critical and declining status'' may submit an application for \nproposed benefit cuts to the U.S. Treasury Department.\n  The Central States pension plan trustees used the authority of MEPRA \nto propose cuts of as much as 70 percent, but in their own application, \nthey admit that even with these drastic cuts, their plan--get this--\nstill only has a 50.4-percent chance of remaining solvent. In other \nwords, they are asking Treasury to approve massive, life-shattering \ncuts to hundreds of thousands of workers for what amounts to a coin \nflip. Treasury should immediately reject this application.\n  Put yourself--this is something we don't do well around here--put \nyourself in the place of a worker who has planned for her retirement \nwith her family. She expected a $2,000-a-month pension on top of $1,200 \na month in Social Security, and she all of a sudden finds out her \npension is cut 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 percent. That was the money she \nplanned to live on. She has some savings, but all that was calculated \nbecause it was a promise from this pension plan to honor that \ncommitment of decades earlier.\n  As I said, Treasury should immediately reject this application.\n  The mine workers' pension plan and the others are too far gone to use \nMEPRA. The United Mine Workers of America's 1974 pension plan covers \n100,000 mine workers, including thousands of miners in eastern and \nsouthern Ohio. It was almost completely funded before the financial \ncollapse of 7 years ago brought on by Wall Street overreach and greed, \nbut the plan was devastated by the recession. It has too few assets, \ntoo few employers, and too few union workers paying in. If Congress \nfails to act, thousands of retired miners could lose their health care \nthis year and the entire plan could fail as early as next year.\n  There is a bipartisan solution that is proposed by Senator Manchin, \nSenator Casey, me, and others and supported by leaders of both parties. \nIf it were brought to the floor today, it would pass with an \noverwhelming majority. It is time for the Senate to act. The Committee \non Finance should mark up this legislation this week. The Senate should \nbring it to the floor immediately.\n  Miners worked in dangerous jobs--dangers from a mining accident, an \nexplosion, or a collapse every day when they went to work, and \ndangerous in the sense that so many mine workers die early because of \npremature bronchial illnesses and heart ailments brought on by working \nin the mines. They have worked underground their whole lives to put \nfood on the table, to send their kids to school, and to help power this \ncountry. Truckers criss-cross the State and country to pay their bills \nand support their families and drive our economy forward. They all \ndeserve the full pension and health benefits they were promised and \nthey worked a lifetime to earn.\n  Butch Lewis led the Southwest Retirees Pension Committee's fight \nagainst cuts to their earned benefits. He passed away on New Year's Eve \ndue to a stroke, which doctors have attributed\n\n[[Page S1313]]\n\nat least in part to the stress he faced over the proposed pension cuts \nnot just to him and his family but to the workers he was fighting for \nas a union activist. The benefits to his widow, his wife Rita, have \nalready been cut. She faces an additional 40-percent reduction because \nof the proposed cuts put forth by Central States. Butch said the cuts \nbeing forced on retirees--his words--``amount to a war against the \nmiddle class and the American dream.'' He is right. Ohio's retired \nworkers have earned their pensions and their retirement savings over a \nlifetime of hard work. It was promised to them, whether they worked \nbehind a desk, on the factory floor, down in the coal mines, or behind \na wheel.\n  We should honor Butch's memory by continuing his work. That means \ncoming together to support a bipartisan solution to protect Rita's \nbenefits and the pensions of tens of thousands of retired Teamsters and \nretired mine workers.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and honor the \ncareer of Jacquelyne ``Jackie'' Brady, as she retires from her position \nas town manager for Laughlin, NV.\n  For more than 20 years, Jackie Brady has been dedicated to serving \nthe residents of Clark County. As the Laughlin town manager, Jackie has \nmanaged municipal services that Laughlin residents depend on and enjoy. \nThroughout her tenure, Jackie has worked to build partnerships that \nspur economic progress and positively impact Laughlin and southern \nNevada. Under her steadfast and innovative leadership, her office \ncreated the first economic development plan in the city, supported the \nimprovement of Needles Highway, and helped develop the Colorado River \nGreenway Heritage Park and Trails, among other accomplishments.\n  Jackie's success is hard-fought and well-earned. She was born and \nraised in east Texas in a segregated community where she was not even \nallowed to use the local library. Instead, Jackie and her peers had to \nlearn from textbooks that were outdated and out of circulation. Despite \nthis, Jackie went on to receive her bachelor's degree from East \nTennessee State University, and she later returned to Texas to attend \nthe newly established Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the \nUniversity of Texas at Austin, where she graduated with a master's \ndegree.\n  In addition to her role as Laughlin town manager, Jackie has served \nas the county liaison to the town of Searchlight, NV, for more than 17 \nyears. In 2014, Jackie was named a Distinguished Woman in Nevada, and \nin 2015, she was awarded Woman of the Year by the Real Life Church in \nLas Vegas. Jackie also sits on the Laughlin Chamber of Commerce board \nand has been involved with the Rotary Club, United Way Allocations \nCommittee, Family Resource Center Board, and the former Laughlin \nKiwanis Club.\n  I congratulate Jackie on her many successes and decades of public \nservice. I appreciate and commend her dedication to the Silver State, \nand I wish Jackie the best in her retirement and future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/07/senate-section/article/S1313-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1313-S1314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   51ST ANNIVERSARY OF BLOODY SUNDAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today marks the 51st anniversary of what \nhas come to be known as Bloody Sunday. On March 7, 1965, John Lewis and \nReverend Hosea Williams led 600 brave civil rights activists in a march \nover the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, AL. These courageous men, \nwomen, and children gathered to draw attention to the systematic \ndisenfranchisement of African Americans in Alabama and throughout much \nof the Deep South. They marched in pursuit of the most fundamental \nright, the right preservative of all others--the right to vote.\n  What they received that day, however, were brutal beatings from \npolice batons as State troopers turned them back and chased them down. \nMore than 50 of the demonstrators were injured. John Lewis was beaten \nunconscious and nearly killed.\n  Ten days later, Federal district court Judge Frank M. Johnson, Jr., \ngranted protection to the activists, ruling that they were permitted to \nmarch from Selma to the State capitol in Montgomery. In the historic \norder he issued, Judge Johnson wrote: ``The law is clear that the right \nto petition one's government for the redress of grievances may be \nexercised in large groups. Indeed, where, as here, minorities have been \nharassed, coerced and intimidated, group association may be the only \nrealistic way of exercising such rights. . . . These rights may be \nexercised by marching, even along public highways.''\n  Days later, the march proceeded with a crowd of approximately 3,200 \nmarchers--which swelled to 25,000 by the time they reached the capitol. \nWithin months, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act \ninto law--guaranteeing that the right to vote would not be restricted \nthrough clever schemes, like poll taxes and literacy tests, devised to \nkeep African Americans from voting.\n  Last month, the foot soldiers of the 1965 voting rights marches were \nrecognized with a Congressional Gold Medal. John Lewis, who since 1987 \nhas been Congressman John Lewis, along with Reverend Frederick D. \nReese, accepted the medal on behalf of the foot soldiers. At the \nceremony, Congressman Lewis said: ``It was their determined marching \nfeet that led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act. . . . They were \njust ordinary people with an extraordinary vision, to build a true \ndemocracy in America.''\n  In 2005, I was proud to join Congressman Lewis on a trip to Selma for \na ceremonial walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to mark the 40th \nanniversary of Bloody Sunday. As we marched in recognition of that \nextraordinary vision to build a true democracy, we celebrated the \nmarchers' achievement--a bill that has often been called the most \nsignificant civil rights law ever passed by Congress. Little did we \nknow that, 8 years later, in 2013, the Supreme Court would strike down \na major provision of that landmark legislation.\n  In Shelby County v. Holder, on a 5-4 vote, a divided Supreme Court \nstruck down the provision of the Voting Rights Act that required \ncertain jurisdictions to preclear any changes to their voting laws with \nthe Department of Justice. This decision effectively gutted the Voting \nRights Act. Since the decision, States like Texas, North Carolina, \nAlabama, and Mississippi have put in place restrictive State voting \nlaws--which all too often have a disproportionate impact on lower-\nincome and minority voters.\n  In order to truly honor the foot soldiers of Bloody Sunday and repair \nthe damage done by Shelby County, Congress must restore the Voting \nRights Act by passing the bipartisan Voting Rights Advancement Act. \nThis bill, which Senator Leahy, Senator Coons, and I introduced last \nyear, would ensure that the Federal Government is once again able to \nfully protect the fundamental right to vote.\n  I wish that, 51 years after Bloody Sunday, America had reached a \npoint where the protections of the Voting Rights Act were no longer \nnecessary. But we have not, and the Voting Rights Act is still very \nmuch needed today.\n  In 2006, Congress reauthorized the Voting Rights Act with an \noverwhelming bipartisan vote in both the House and the Senate. It is \ntime to once again come together on a bipartisan basis and recognize \nthe ongoing challenges that minority voters all too frequently face. \nCongress must take action to repair the Voting Rights Act and ensure \nthe legacy of those who marched 51 years ago.\n\n[[Page S1314]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/07/senate-section/article/S1314-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING NANCY REAGAN\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday the American people lost an \nicon. Nancy Davis Reagan died at the age of 94.\n  Years ago, during an event at the White House, Nancy once serenaded \nher husband, singing: ``together we are going a long, long way.'' And \nboy did they ever.\n  Born in New York and raised in Chicago, Nancy studied theater at \nSmith College in Massachusetts before moving westward to California to \npursue a career in acting. She appeared in 11 motion pictures, but her \nlife changed forever when her name appeared on the infamous list from \nthe House Un-American Activities Committee. This was a list of people \nsuspected of having ties to the Communist Party.\n  Worried that she may be blacklisted, she demanded to meet with the \npresident of the Screen Actors Guild in an effort to remove her name. \nAnd guess who was serving as president of the Screen Actors Guild--\nRonald Reagan.\n  They met and fell in love. The rest is history.\n  This month, 64 years ago, Ronald Reagan and Nancy Davis married, and \nin Nancy's words: ``my life really began when I married my husband.'' \nAnd what a life it was.\n  From the Governor's mansion in California to the White House, one \nthing was clear, Nancy was always on Ronald Reagan's mind.\n  Straight out of a Hollywood script, their 52-year marriage was a true \nAmerican love story. Their mutual love and devotion is a beautiful \nreminder of what a marriage should look like. We should all be so \nlucky.\n  Fiercely loyal to her husband and America, you didn't want to get on \nthe wrong side of Nancy Reagan. She had grit and was one tough lady \nwhen she had to be.\n  Nancy was a passionate protector of her husband and the Presidency. \nAnd during talks with the Soviet Union, she constantly encouraged her \nhusband to stay with it and not give up. She understood that nothing is \nmore important than peace, and the historic START I arms reduction \ntreaty may not have been possible had it not been for Nancy.\n  After her husband's Presidency, she championed issues such as drug \nand alcohol abuse and afterschool programs. In 1994, after announcing \nhis diagnosis with Alzheimer's, Ronald Reagan wrote: ``I only wish \nthere was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience.''\n  But Nancy endured by working to stamp out Alzheimer's and tirelessly \nadvocated for embryonic stem cell research for the rest of her life. \nShe was determined to save other families from the pain she had gone \nthrough and she raised millions of dollars for research.\n  She praised President Obama when he removed restrictions on the \nFederal funding of embryonic stem cell research and even teamed up with \nTed Kennedy to work on these issues that were so close to her heart. \nNancy had a special friendship with Ted Kennedy--who would call her \nevery year on her birthday and sing an old Irish song to his dear \nfriend.\n  That type of bond between the two political parties is missing today \nin Washington.\n  In an era when the political discourse can overwhelm the real \nproblems we work to solve, Nancy Reagan's legacy can offer a path \nforward that we all can learn from. Before her death, Nancy reflected \non the state of American politics and the inflammatory rhetoric we hear \non the campaign trail, saying: ``Do you believe this? Do you believe \nthis?''\n  Like many of us, she was disappointed by the lack of civility between \nthe candidates. It certainly does not reflect a saying she made famous: \n``Dignity should be at the center of everything we do.''\n  In honor of Nancy Reagan, I hope we all take that message to heart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/07/senate-section/article/S1314-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:08 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4557.
