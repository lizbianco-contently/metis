Mr. President, last night, the American people heard \ntwo very different addresses. One was focused on the middle class and \nhow Washington can work together in a serious way for better jobs, \nhigher wages, and more opportunity. It was a call for constructive \ncooperation. It was a call for new ideas.\n  I wish to commend Senator Ernst for her thoughtful address. She \nunderstands the needs of working people in a way those of a particular \nmindset in Washington simply don't understand. She knows that the \nmiddle class is looking for Washington to function again and that hard-\nworking Americans want DC to focus on their needs instead of the \ndemands of powerful special interests. That is just what they told us \nin November when they sent this new Republican Congress here on their \nbehalf.\n  I was hoping for something similar from President Obama--not \nidentical, of course. We don't agree on all the issues; that is clear \nenough. But there are enough areas of common ground where we should be \nable to work together. It would have been most constructive if he had \nput the focus of his address on those areas of potential agreement. The \nmoment of high purpose called for the leader of the free world to show \nAmerica what could be accomplished through constructive, bipartisan \nengagement.\n  The State of the Union can be about more than veto threats or \nstrident partisanship. This kind of partisanship is what we have become \naccustomed to from the President. We know the President may not be wild \nabout the people's choice of a Congress, but he owes it to the American \npeople to find a serious way to work with the representatives they \nelected.\n  On some issues, such as cyber security, he sent a positive sign. He \nalso began what I hope will be a sustained effort to move his own party \nforward to encourage them to work with us to help create more jobs by \nbreaking down foreign trade barriers and allowing America to sell more \nof what it makes and grows.\n  Those were the good signs. But that was only part of the speech. \nThere is not a lot serious lawmakers can do with talking points \ndesigned specifically not to pass. Members in both parties would have \nwelcomed serious ideas about how to save and strengthen Medicare, how \nto protect Social Security for future generations, and how to balance \nthe budget without tired tax hikes.\n  We listened closely for specific details on how he would work with \nboth parties to achieve comprehensive tax simplification that focuses \nnot on growing the government but on creating jobs.\n  The President has expressed some support for ideas such as this \npreviously. He should have expanded on it last night. There is still \ntime for him to do it. But whatever he chooses, the new Congress will \ncontinue working to send good ideas to his desk.\n  One of those good ideas is a bipartisan infrastructure project the \nSenate will resume working on today--the Keystone jobs bill. It is \nheartening to see a real debate and an amendment process on the floor \nof the Senate again. It is a result of a new spirit of reform that is \nbeing brought to Congress. It aims to give Members of both parties a \nstake in positive solutions so we can get Washington functioning again \non behalf of our people.\n  We are looking to the President to join us in our positive mission \nfor the middle class. It is what the American people just voted for \nlast November. It\n\n[[Page S302]]\n\nis what Senator Ernst articulated so well last night. And if the \nPresident is willing to put the veto threats away and the designed-to-\nfail talking points aside, we can still cooperate to get some smart \nthings done for the people we represent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/21/senate-section/article/S302-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last night the President talked about the \neconomy and the progress we have made. The United States grew 2.6 \npercent last year, and in the third quarter alone our economy grew by 5 \npercent. Nearly 3 million jobs were created--the best year for the U.S. \nlabor market since the height of the economic boom under President Bill \nClinton. Lower gasoline prices are providing relief to many families \nand consumer confidence is up. The deficit has been cut in half.\n  Yet we know that while the economy is growing and unemployment is \ndeclining, sadly, much of the benefit is going to those at the very top \nof the ladder. The top 1 percent of American wage earners saw 49 \npercent of the decline in incomes during the recession, but they have \nseen 95 percent of the income gained since the recovery started. Let me \nrepeat that. The top 1 percent of wage earners have seen 95 percent of \nthe gains since our economy has recovered.\n  The gap between wages for low-income and middle-income families and \nthose at the top is staggering. Forty-seven people in America own more \nthan 160 million Americans combined. That has to change.\n  This isn't just a Democratic observation. Even Republicans have \npublicly agreed with us that working families are falling behind. Let \nme quote a few. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, a potential candidate \nfor President, said: ``Here's reality: If you're fortunate enough to \ncount yourself among the privileged, much of the rest of the Nation is \ndrowning.'' Jeb Bush said that.\n  Mitt Romney, a former Republican candidate for President and perhaps \na Republican candidate for President again--here is what he said last \nweek as he has rekindled his dream for the Presidency: ``. . . the rich \nhave gotten richer, income inequality has gotten worse, and there are \nmore people in poverty than ever before.''\n  Even Speaker John Boehner said this in an interview:\n\n       The top third of America are doing pretty good. The bottom \n     two-thirds are really being squeezed.\n\n  So how do we address these challenges? Our parties look at it \ndifferently.\n  The Republican majority in this Chamber had to pick the first bill \nthey would bring to the floor of the Senate once they reached the \nmajority. There were a lot of initiatives they could have considered. \nWe know what they chose--the Keystone XL Pipeline--a pipeline owned by \na Canadian company. That is the No. 1 priority of the Republicans in \nthe Senate, bar none. When they wanted to respond to President Obama's \nState of the Union Address with Senator Ernst of Iowa, they focused on \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline. What a limited vision of the future--one \npipeline.\n  Then we took two votes yesterday on this pipeline, and it started to \nbecome clear what this pipeline is all about. It is moving Canadian tar \nsands from Canada, through the United States, and to a refinery in \nTexas. We learned yesterday the Republicans will not even support the \nproposition that the refined oil products coming out of this refinery \nwill help America.\n  We had a simple amendment Senator Markey of Massachusetts offered \nwhich said that at the end of the pipeline, the refinery's oil products \nwill be sold in America. The Republicans defeated that amendment. So \nall this argument about how this oil out of this pipeline is going to \nhelp our economy in the future? Nope, don't expect it to happen. \nYesterday's overwhelming Republican vote made it clear.\n  There was a second part that was considered yesterday. This bill--the \nNo. 1 priority of the Senate Republican majority--is going to build a \npipeline, that is for sure. We said, good, if it is going to be built, \nuse American steel in building the pipeline. That is not an outrageous \nsuggestion. If this is such a priority for the Republicans, wouldn't \nthey want to put Americans to work to make the steel to build the \npipeline? We offered that as an amendment yesterday. Senator Franken \noffered that amendment and the Republicans rejected it. The Republicans \nrejected the premise that the steel that goes into the most important \npipeline in the history of America, from their point of view, should \nactually come from America. That is the second amendment we considered.\n  This special interest project, the Keystone XL Canadian-owned \npipeline, is going to continue to be the No. 1 dominant issue in the \nSenate for days to come.\n  Republicans plan to do everything they can to help build a pipeline, \nbut they want to deny millions of Americans access to health care. That \nis what the House Republicans have come up with. They want to come up \nwith a plan that will literally take away the coverage of health care \nfrom Americans. Is there anyone in this country who thinks that is the \nright thing for our future? We are trying to reduce the number of \nuninsured. The Republican changes to the Affordable Care Act would \nincrease the number of uninsured and increase the number of Americans \ndependent on government-sponsored health care. It doesn't sound like a \nRepublican idea to me, but it is. That is what is coming from the House \nof Representatives.\n  There are pretty clear differences in how we help working families. \nFor the Senate Republicans, it is to build a Canadian pipeline. Don't \nuse American steel, don't keep the oil in America, but build this \npipeline--No. 1 priority. The House Republicans take away health \ninsurance coverage for hundreds of thousands of Americans at a time \nwhen we know that leaves people in a precarious position.\n  Here is what the President said last night: We want to make certain \nwe focus on projects and programs and new ideas that can leave our \nchildren a better world and our grandchildren as well. Do we want an \neconomy where everyone has an opportunity to climb that economic ladder \nor do we want a world where those who are born into lives of luxury set \nthe rules and always come out ahead? Do we want an economy that rewards \nthose who work hard and play by the rules or an economy where \ncorporations rig the game so it is tails you lose, heads I win?\n  We know that an economy with a strong middle class is key to growing \nAmerica. Yet it is becoming harder and harder for families to even \nreach the middle class. Working families aren't looking for a handout--\nnot in my State. They just want a chance for a better life for their \nkids.\n  There is a way we can do this. It is called the earned-income tax \ncredit. This is an idea supported by Republican Presidents in the past. \nHistorically both parties have supported it. The earned-income tax \ncredit is designed to encourage work by providing a tax credit to \nworking families.\n  The President's proposal, similar to one that Sherrod Brown and I \nhave introduced, would expand the credit to help the only group that \nour Tax Code pushes into poverty: childless workers. What a difference \nthis would make for millions of working families, the difference \nbetween paying a heating bill or putting it off, the difference between \ngetting a prescription filled or waiting. A small refundable tax credit \nfor these workers can make a bigger difference than many U.S. Senators \nwould ever realize.\n  The President also proposed making 2 years of community college free \nfor responsible students and giving motivated students a path to a \nsolid educational foundation without debt. This is not a Democratic \nidea. The President acknowledged last night that this idea came from a \nRepublican Governor in Tennessee. I might add that a Democratic mayor, \nRahm Emanuel of Chicago, has a similar program, but the President went \nto Tennessee to acknowledge that the Republican legislature and the \nRepublican Governor had come up with a good idea. So to argue this is \nsomehow a partisan idea, it sure isn't in Tennessee. If it is partisan, \nit is a Republican partisan idea.\n\n[[Page S303]]\n\n  The President understands that in the 20th century, maybe K-12 was \njust enough to make it. In the 21st century it is not enough. K-14, \nmost of us understand, is the ticket to a good-paying job.\n  I called in to some of the media this morning from Illinois, and they \nsaid, oh, this community college free tuition idea--another Federal \nmandate. Well, let me disabuse you of this idea. This is voluntary. It \nis original. States decide if they want to be part of it, but I think \nthose States that want to be part of free community college tuition for \ngood, achieving, hard-working students are on the right track, and \nthose who ignore it may fall behind.\n  The jobs of this century will require more training and education \nthan ever. I think this notion is a good one. Have we ever gone wrong \nin the history of the United States by investing in education, \ninvesting in our students, investing in our future? That is what the \nPresident's proposal does. It has been dismissed out of hand by the \nRepublicans, even though it had a Republican origin. That is a mistake. \nWe should count on our community colleges, the affordable alternative \nfor higher education for 40 percent of America's college students. And \nthank goodness it steers these kids away from these God-forsaken for-\nprofit colleges and universities which too often exploit these young \npeople, these young men and women, sink them deep in debt and, if they \nare lucky, hand them a worthless diploma at the end of the day. \nCommunity colleges are the affordable ticket in Kentucky, in Illinois, \nand across America.\n  The President reminded us last night that we live in a great country \nand our economy is recovering. But while the wealthiest Americans are \ndoing fine, more American families are spending hours at the kitchen \ntable trying to figure out how to make ends meet. Let's help those \nfamilies. Let's agree to help those families. One Canadian-owned \npipeline is not the answer. We need to think about education, we need \nto think about a Federal transportation bill, and we need to think \nabout investing in America and its future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/21/senate-section/article/S303-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S303-S304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in the aftermath of the recent terror \nattacks in France, it is tough to know what the House of \nRepresentatives is thinking. Last week, the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives threatened to shut down the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. That is the government agency responsible for protecting \nAmerica from the threat of terrorism.\n  Why are we debating full funding for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity? Every other government agency, I might add, has been properly \nfunded through the omnibus bill. But the Republicans insisted on not \nfunding the Department of Homeland Security, which fights terrorism in \nthe regular orderly appropriations process. They insisted this \nDepartment be funded only through the end of February. Does that mean \nthat America is safe from terrorism? I wish it were true. But we know \nthat we are only one terrorist away from a terrible incident in \nAmerica.\n  One of the Departments with the major responsibility of protecting us \nis the Department of Homeland Security. So why did the Republicans \ndecide they wanted to make the funding of this Department uncertain and \ncontingent?\n  Well, the reason was they are so angry with President Obama's \nExecutive order on immigration that they are putting America at risk by \nfailing to properly fund the Department of Homeland Security. Then last \nweek, the bill the House passed made the appropriation for this \nDepartment contingent on five riders. A rider is an addition. It is \nlanguage that doesn't relate to a budget or appropriation, and it \nrelates to the Executive orders that were established by the President.\n  The House bill passed last week would defund President Obama's \nimmigration policies, including the Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrivals Program, known as DACA, which has been in place for over 2 \nyears.\n  What does DACA do? By the President's Executive order, it puts on \nhold the deportations of immigrant students who grew up in America. It \nallows these young people to continue to live and work in this country \non a temporary basis. They are known, in shorthand, as the DREAMers.\n  I know a little bit about this because I introduced the first DREAM \nAct 14 years ago in the U.S. Senate. It has become a very familiar \nterm, but when I first started, no one had ever heard of it. What I \nfound was there were young people brought to the United States by their \nparents at a very early age who had, obviously, no voice in the \ndecision, raised in America, undocumented, went through our schools, \nwere successful, had no criminal problems, and wanted a future.\n  They couldn't get a future under American law. The DREAM Act would \ngive them that opportunity to move to legal status. We have already \ninvested in these young people, in their education, so why would we \nwant to give up on their talents by deporting them after they are \neducated? That is exactly what the U.S. House of Representatives has \nproposed.\n  In 2010, I joined with Republican Senator Richard Lugar. We wrote a \nletter to President Obama. It said: Why would we deport these young \nDREAMers? They offer so much potential for America.\n  A year later, 22 Senators joined me in sending a followup letter to \nthe President, and he issued his Executive order called DACA.\n  Six hundred thousand eligible DREAMers have signed up for DACA, which \nmeans for these 600,000, they can live and work in America without the \nfear of deportation. It makes a big difference. Thirty thousand of them \nlive in Illinois. We estimate there are another 1.5 million eligible.\n  The Center for American Progress says these young people aren't just \ntaking up space, they are going to add to the economy because of their \ntalents. They estimate that these DREAMers will add $329 billion to our \neconomy and create 1.4 million new jobs by 2030. That is a pretty tall \nprediction to think that these young people could have that impact on \nour economy.\n  Let me tell you the story of one of the DREAMers whom the House \nRepublicans would deport, and you may understand why this estimate of \nthe profound, important impact of these DREAMers on our economy is \nrealistic.\n  As I mentioned, I introduced the DREAM Act 14 years ago. I have come \nto the floor over 50 times to tell stories of these DREAMers who, \nfrankly, make the case for passing the DREAM Act and for defeating this \nhate-filled provision that was passed by the U.S. House. I am going to \ncontinue to update these stories about these DREAMers so you can \nunderstand why giving up on these DREAMers is giving up on the future \nof this country.\n  I want to tell you the story about Carlos Martinez. Here is a picture \nof him. Carlos is holding his DACA card under the President's Executive \norder. Carlos and his brother were brought to the United States in \n1991. Carlos was 9 years old. He came to this country and didn't speak \none word of English, and his father told him, ``Estudien para que no \nbatallen en la vida como yo.'' What it means in English is: Study so \nyou don't have to struggle in life like I have.\n  Carlos took his father's advice to heart. At high school in Tucson, \nAZ, Carlos graduated ninth in his class. Then he enrolled at the \nUniversity of Arizona. He was undocumented at the time. He had never \nowned a computer, but he loved math and he dreamed about being a \ncomputer engineer.\n  Four years later, in 2003, Carlos Martinez graduated with a bachelor \nof science degree in computer engineering and a minor in computer \nscience, electrical engineering, and math. He was named the top \nHispanic graduate in his class.\n  For the record, Carlos Martinez did not qualify for 1 penny of \nFederal assistance to go to college, and you can imagine in Arizona \nprobably not 1 penny of State assistance. But he made it through, \ngraduating as the top Hispanic in his class from the University of \nArizona. But after he graduated, reality set in. He received job offers \nfrom Intel, IBM, and a host of tech companies, but then they found out \nhe was undocumented. He couldn't be hired.\n  He didn't give up. He enrolled in the master's program for software \nsystems engineering at the University of Arizona. He completed a 2\\1/2\\ \nyear program in a year and a half.\n\n[[Page S304]]\n\n  Carlos Martinez was also nominated for the University of Arizona \nGraduate School Centennial Award, given to the school's top graduate \nstudent.\n  Carlos Martinez submitted his application for DACA when President \nObama created this opportunity in August of 2012. The first day the \nforms were available, he was in line. He was one of the first to be \napproved. As soon as he received the notification he had been approved \nunder this Executive order, Carlos Martinez went to a career fair at \nthe University of Arizona and handed out his resumes to IBM, Intel, and \nother high-tech companies. Today Carlos Martinez is working for IBM. \nOut of more than 10,000 applicants for the job he filled, he was one of \nonly 75 who were hired.\n  Is America a better place to have that kind of educated individual \nworking with good ideas, creating new products, expanding employment \nopportunities? Of course it is.\n  So now the U.S. House of Representatives has decided the best thing \nfor the future of America is to deport Carlos Martinez and deport those \nother young students who hold such potential for this country. That is \nthe House Republican approach to immigration--deport Carlos Martinez.\n  There are so many other DREAMers around this country with the same \ntalents as Carlos. I want the American people to understand the human \ncost of the proposal that has been sent to us by the House of \nRepresentatives under Republican control. The House Republicans want to \nend DACA. Hundreds of thousands of people such as Carlos Martinez, \nprotected by DACA, would be deported, and 1.5 million eligible to apply \nfor DACA would never have that chance. It is shameless, shameless to \nplay politics with the lives of nice young people who grew up in \nAmerica and want to be part of our future, and it is so shortsighted.\n  Will America be stronger if Carlos Martinez is gone? The House \nRepublicans say yes, he should leave. After all of this investment, K-\n12, bachelor's degree at the University of Arizona, the top graduate \nstudent in his master's program at that same university, the House \nRepublicans say, ``Deport Carlos Martinez.'' They feel so strongly \nabout this they are willing to hold up the appropriation for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the agency responsible for protecting \nour Nation.\n  Let me be clear. Democrats are not going to be swayed by this \nblackmail. We will insist the Department of Homeland Security be \nproperly funded to protect America and to do it now. This President \nmade it clear he is ready to sign that bill, the sooner the better. \nLet's not assume that America has somehow been immunized or inoculated \nand never can be threatened again by terrorists. Let us properly fund \nthe Department of Homeland of Security, and let us not pursue that \nshameless agenda sent to us by the House Republicans.

Mr. President, last night the President delivered the \nState of the Union Address. So it was interesting to hear the acting \nminority leader talking about homeland security, budgeting for homeland \nsecurity. I know the Presiding Officer, through his service to our \nNation overseas, wearing a uniform, keeping us safe, keeping us free--\nthe Presiding Officer has concerns, as do I, about what we heard last \nnight.\n  It was interesting to hear some of the commentary after the \nPresident's speech as we talk about securing the homeland and what it \nmeans for the American public. Andrea Mitchell, MSNBC, ``I think that \non foreign policy his''--meaning President Obama's--``projection of \nsuccess against terrorism and against ISIS, in particular, is not close \nto reality.'' The President of the United States, ``not close to \nreality.''\n  I have just come back from a trip to the Middle East, been to Saudi \nArabia, Qatar, Israel. I concur with Andrea Mitchell; that on the \nspecifics of the President's assessment of success against terrorism \nand against ISIS, this President ``is not close to reality.'' So \nRepublicans are going to continue to bring forth the issues to the \nAmerican people of what reality is like in the world, in spite of the \nway the President may address it, because of the specific failures of \nthis President and his foreign policy.\n  It is interesting. Last night in the State of the Union Address, the \nPresident started by saying that ``the state of the Union is strong.'' \nThe state of our Union is strong. But President Obama mistakenly took \ncredit for that strength. He implied it was because of his policies, \nbecause of his actions. On that point this President could not have \ngotten it more wrong. The state of our Union is strong because of the \nstrength of the American people.\n  Americans are resilient. Americans are hardworking. In the November \nelections, the American people showed they can act decisively. It is \ninteresting, this morning's headline, New York Times: ``Staunchly \nLiberal Wish List Brushes Off G.O.P.'s Gains.'' Headline, New York \nTimes, bright, bold, above the fold. ``Staunchly Liberal Wish List \nBrushes off G.O.P.'s Gains.''\n  So we are a resilient nation. People know what they believe. They \nknow how they feel. They voted those beliefs. When the American people \nchose Republicans to lead both Houses of Congress, they said clearly \nthey wanted change, a change from Barack Obama, a change from the \ndirection he has been taking this country. People want Democrats to \nstart working with Republicans to get things done.\n  The American people said in the November elections they are tired of \nthe gridlock, they are tired of the dysfunction, tired of Democrats \nrunning the Senate to protect their own jobs and not caring about the \njobs of middle-class Americans.\n  President Obama had a great opportunity last night, an opportunity to \nshow that he understands what Americans have been telling him. Instead \nhe went out and he gave the same speech he always gives. It was a \npartisan attack on Republicans and the Americans who voted to put the \nRepublicans in charge in the House and in the Senate.\n  It is interesting listening to the commentary after the speech. Wolf \nBlitzer, CNN, said, ``I don't remember a State of the Union address \nwhere I heard a President issue so many veto threats to the opposite \nparty in the Congress.''\n  So we have Andrea Mitchell, MSNBC, saying that in terms of foreign \npolicy the President's views ``are not close to reality.'' CNN, Wolf \nBlitzer, ``I do not remember a State of the Union address where I heard \na President issue so many veto threats to the opposite party in the \nUnited States Congress,'' especially when it is at a time, as the New \nYork Times point out, of GOP gains in the elections, the President \nspecifically ignoring what has happened across this country in the \nNovember elections. President Obama seems to have missed the November \nelections entirely.\n  Republicans know we have an obligation to the American people to \ndeliver effective, efficient, and accountable government. We have an \nopportunity and an obligation to put Americans first. Last night \nPresident Obama showed he still wants to put Washington first. \nRepublicans are not willing to help this President continue down the \nsame wrong road that the American people have rejected. Let's be \nhonest. This past election was a rejection election, rejecting the \npolicies of this President, this administration.\n  We are charting a new course and a better direction. We are already \nmaking progress. The Senate is working like it has not worked in years. \nWe are debating actual legislation, laying on the floor the Keystone \nPipeline jobs\n\n[[Page S305]]\n\nbill. We are allowing Senators to offer amendments. We actually had \nvotes on three amendments yesterday. We are going to pass this bill. We \nare going to send it to the President's desk.\n\n  Then we are going to turn to more jobs bills and the important issues \nthe American people care about. We are going to work on reforming our \nhealth care system. In his speech last night President Obama offered no \nsolutions on the major issues facing this country. Instead, he offered \nthe same old tired policies of higher taxes, more Washington spending, \nmore bureaucracy, more obstruction of bipartisan solutions coming out \nof the new Congress.\n  The President said Congress should focus on areas where we agree. \nThat is exactly what Republicans have been doing. We are moving \nbipartisan bills, bills that overwhelming majorities of Americans \nsupport. The President continues to threaten to veto them, things such \nas the Keystone XL Pipeline bill that supports 42,000 American jobs. \nThat is not my number. That is what the State Department--the \nPresident's own State Department--said, it would support 42,000 \nAmerican jobs.\n  In a poll last week, 65 percent of Americans said the President \nshould sign that into law. We will pass bills to allow for more exports \nof American energy and to give the President trade promotion authority \nthat he has asked for and that America needs. We will pass commonsense \nreforms to America's health care system, to end many of the outrageous \nand expensive mandates for coverage that people do not want, do not \nneed, cannot afford.\n  We will pass bipartisan education reform to give all of America's 50 \nmillion students a better chance to succeed. We will push for tax \nsimplification, to make taxes less fair, less complicated. That is what \nAmericans need to compete in the 21st century. We do not need higher \ntaxes, more debt to pay for spending and more IRS agents, things the \nAmerican people do not believe we need.\n  Republicans are going to send the President bills that will help \nexpand our economy by growing the private sector, not by growing the \nWashington bureaucracy. We are going to pass bills that increase how \nmuch families earn and how much of that they actually get to keep, not \njust how much Washington gets to take and the President gets to spend.\n  So the state of our Union is strong. It is also in greater agreement \nthan it has been in years about the direction this country should take. \nPresident Obama could have taken the opportunity last night to actually \ntalk about this. He could have offered a positive plan to work with \nRepublicans and Democrats in Congress instead of the defiant tone he \nplaced upon the country.\n  He made threats to veto bipartisan legislation. He chose to double \ndown on more obstruction, more unaccountable Washington bureaucracy, \nmore wasted tax dollars. The American people have rejected this course. \nThe American people want a better path, not the same old tired speech \nfrom a President now in the final quarter of his time as President.\n  The speech is over. Now the President needs to decide what he is \nactually going to do. Is he ready to get on board with bipartisan ideas \nor does he want to spend the next 2 years as a lameduck. There are \nDemocrats in this body who agree it is actually time for the Senate to \nget back to work. They are ready to listen to ideas, good ideas, work \nwith Republicans to help America, to help the American people thrive.\n  This President should work with all of us. That is what Americans \nwant. They want us to work together. They want us to change the \ndirection our country has been headed for the first 6 years of \nPresident Obama's time in office. This Republican Congress is listening \nto the American people. The President continues to ignore them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, similar to the rest of the country, I \nlistened with close attention to the President's State of the Union \nAddress last night. I had a pretty good seat down front. I got to \nlisten to the President very closely. Of course I was interested \nbecause this presented a great opportunity for the President, following \na very eventful election on November 4, to state his vision for the \ncountry and most particularly to talk about his plans for working with \nthe new Congress that was elected in November.\n  It was a big election for a lot of reasons but one was that we got \nnine new Republican Members of the Senate. I have been in the Senate in \nthe minority and I have been in the Senate in the majority. I can tell \nyou I like it a lot better in the majority. But the fact is that \nnotwithstanding a very good election, from my perspective, on November \n4, one that sent a real clear message, I was left to wonder whether the \nPresident got that message.\n  While I believe this was a referendum on Washington's dysfunction in \ndealing with so many of the issues that face hard-working American \nfamilies, what the President seemed to promise was more dysfunction. \nBut I for one am here to say we are not going to follow the President \ndown this low road. We will try to find areas where we can work with \nthe President. He did mention a few: things such as trade, things such \nas criminal justice reform. There are a few things the President seemed \nto indicate were not partisan issues. We look forward to working with \nhim on those issues.\n  But the biggest problem we have and which still faces our country is \nthe fact that notwithstanding one pretty good quarter of economic \ngrowth, our economy and our recovery are still pretty fragile. We know \nthe number of people, the percentage of Americans in the workforce is \nat about a 30-year low. Some of that is because they have looked for \nwork and they cannot find work, Americans who are seeking full-time \nwork and have to settle for part-time work. Part of it is because of \nthe President's own policies, things such as the Affordable Care Act--\nObamaCare--which incentivizes employers to put people on part-time work \nin order to avoid some of the penalties.\n  But notwithstanding my optimism after this important election we had \nin November and the potential we have working together--the President \nand Congress--to try to address the challenges that face our country, \nmy optimism was quickly tempered. Why only tempered optimism? I heard, \nas the Senator from Wyoming, my friend Mr. Barrasso, mentioned, the \nPresident has issued seven veto threats since the election--seven veto \nthreats; this from a President who in the first 6 years of his term of \noffice has only vetoed one bill.\n  But the first thing he does after this election, where it should have \nbeen a wake-up call to him and others--should have been a wake-up call \nto all of us--he is issuing seven veto threats to bills that have not \neven been voted out of the Senate, that have not even made their way to \nhis desk. To me that sends a very disturbing message that the \nPresident, instead of just being Commander in Chief, wants to be the \nobstructionist in chief. I do not know how else to interpret that.\n  Then there is the President's disquieting tendency to take credit for \nthings other people have done, and for his own failures, to blame them \non someone else. It is truly disturbing. Since this new Congress has \nconvened, it seems to me it has been a tale of two branches of \ngovernment.\n  While the Congress has shown a commitment to working together--and in \nmy private conversations with my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, many of them are eager to work with us to try to find solutions \nto these challenges on a bipartisan basis.\n  This is one reason why the majority leader, Senator McConnell, chose \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline legislation, because it enjoys broad, \nbipartisan support. We thought it was important to demonstrate, right \nout of the starting gates, that we actually listened to what the \nAmerican people told us on November 4--that they want us to work \ntogether and they are tired of the dysfunction. But it appears the \nPresident hasn't noticed or, perhaps more accurately, he doesn't really \ncare what the American people said on November 4.\n  If the President isn't going to listen to the American people and the \nvoters who voted in a referendum on his policies--those are not my \nwords; those are his--I wish he would at least listen to what he \nhimself has said. He has said time and again that elections have \nconsequences.\n\n[[Page S306]]\n\n  Well, I agree with that. Who wouldn't. But this is the same President \nwho 22 times said he did not have the authority to issue an Executive \naction on immigration and then turned around and did it. Twenty-two \ntimes he said he didn't have the authority, and then he did it.\n  What I have learned in Washington is we can't just listen to what \npeople say. We have to watch what they do. We have a track record of \nthe past 6 years of what this President has done and not just what he \nhas said.\n  As I say, the intransigence and the tone deafness was pretty shocking \nlast night. Notwithstanding, the President gave a good speech. What I \nthink the President really hadn't cracked the code on--as anybody in \nelected office has to understand--is that there is a difference between \nrunning for office and actually governing once the election is over. \nBut this President seems to be in a perpetual campaign mode, making \npromises that sound like campaign promises rather than recognizing the \nreality of divided government and looking for opportunities to work \ntogether to actually solve problems.\n  So he is back on the campaign trail again. I think he is going to \nIdaho and other places around the country touting his new agenda--\nhundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes. Of course, somebody has \nto pay the bills, but the President mainly talked about free stuff last \nnight. Free stuff is always pretty popular. I am surprised he didn't \noffer Americans free beer and pizza while he was at it. It is very \npopular.\n  But the American people are not dumb. They understand somebody is \ngoing to have to pay the bill, and the President ignored that entirely. \nHe also ignored that for the past 6 years this President has added $7 \ntrillion to the national debt. It is now over $18 trillion.\n  Now, I know that it is impossible for the human mind to wrap itself \naround a figure that big. That is so big that it is incomprehensible in \nmany ways. But we didn't hear a thing about the President adding $7 \ntrillion to the national debt.\n  What he did take credit for--this is interesting because I have \nmentioned he takes credit for things he had nothing to do with and he \nblames other people for his own failures. But here is where he was half \nright. He did say that the deficit--the difference between the money we \nbring in and the money we spend--actually had gone down a little bit.\n  That is true, but the fact remains that we are still adding to the \nnational debt for every dollar of deficit spending. But what the \nPresident also did not say is the main reason why the annual deficit \nhad gone down was because he advocated one of the largest tax increases \nin recent history--perhaps in all of American history--during the \nfiscal cliff debate. Then, of course, there was the sequester, which \nare the caps put on discretionary spending, which the President railed \nagainst even though he was the one who thought this up during the so-\ncalled supercommittee deliberations.\n  I couldn't help but think, as the President kept talking about \nraising taxes, increasing spending, and not dealing with problems such \nas the looming debt, that he was turning us more into Europe, a welfare \nstate, where everybody would look to the government to take care of \nthem, not a country that we were left by our parents and grandparents, \nwhere we could exercise our individual freedom and seek opportunities \nto rise above what we had been left by previous generations.\n  To me that is the most important difference in what the President \nsaid last night and what he might have said, because our children do \ndeserve more opportunities. The truth is that for most of us who are \npeople my age, we are going to be OK. But the fact is the next \ngeneration, my children and beyond, have been bequeathed more debt.\n\n  Now the President wants to add on to that debt--more taxes, more \nspending, bigger government.\n  If there was one thing that was rejected in this last election, it \nwas what we have had for the past 6 years. What we have had for the \npast 6 years was a grand experiment in government. We have always had \nthis debate about the size and the role of the Federal Government, but \nwe have never had such an aggressive attempt to grow the size of the \ngovernment in recent memory, certainly since the New Deal, as under the \npast 6 years. What the American people, I believe, rejected was this \nexperiment in big government.\n  Perhaps that would be understandable if there weren't examples of \nwhat actually does work, what does grow the economy, what does put more \nmoney in hard-working taxpayers' pockets, and what does provide more \njobs and opportunity. One reason why it seems somewhat obvious to me is \nbecause I see what has been done in places such as my home State of \nTexas, and it has been done in other States where they put their trust \nin people and not in bigger government that somebody has to pay for.\n  The formula is not all that unique. Governor Perry, who just left \noffice after 14 years, when people talked about the ``Texas miracle,'' \nsaid: No, it is not a miracle; a miracle is a supernatural event. This \nis the Texas model. It is a conscious effort to choose policies that \nactually work, that grow the economy and create jobs, lower taxes, and \nresult in less red tape and a balanced budget.\n  Wouldn't that be nice? We haven't had a balanced budget in Washington \nsince 2009. It is really malpractice.\n  There are other policies that would foster a better business \nenvironment and encourage businesses to invest and grow because that \ncreates jobs, that creates rising wages and a successful middle class. \nSo the fact is that if it works in the States, it can work here too.\n  Now, measures such as reforming the Tax Code to provide tax relief in \na way that incentivizes people to work harder and produce more are pro-\ngrowth tax policies--not regressive policies such as the President has \nproposed, which would make it harder.\n  Improving infrastructure projects--the President talked about \ninfrastructure last night, but he has also issued a veto threat on the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. We are--I agree with the Senator from Wyoming--\ngoing to approve it, put it on his desk, and then it is up to him. \nThen, of course, there is putting Americans back to work and repealing \noppressive government overreach--such as ObamaCare.\n  There is a difference between governing and campaigning. The \nPresident--there is no doubt about it--is a world class campaigner. He \nis right that he won two elections by running very successful \ncampaigns, but he seems absolutely disinterested, detached, and, \nindeed, actually an obstacle to governing, which is the job in front of \nus.\n  In closing, I would say the state of the Union is always a work in \nprogress, but it should always be improving. It is my sincere hope the \nPresident will realize the hand he has been dealt, which is one of \ndivided government, and that rather than campaigning perpetually, \nmaking promises for free stuff, higher taxes, and bigger government, \nthat he would work with us to solve some of the very clear challenges \nthat confront us, primarily ones that will help grow our economy and \nput Americans back to work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thought last night, as the majority whip \njust mentioned, that the President once again showed his sense of why \nthe majority in the Congress and the majority of people in the country \nsupport the Keystone XL Pipeline. It is not just about the pipeline, \neven though he doesn't quite seem ever to get that. It is about whether \nwe are going to truly take advantage of more American energy.\n  Clearly, the President suggested that was one of the great \naccomplishments of his administration. I think we could make the \nargument--and make it effectively--that his administration hasn't done \nmuch to implement the great steps we have made forward. In fact, on \npublic lands and other measures that we were in the process of \nconsidering when he became President,\n\n[[Page S307]]\n\nthey have backed away from that rather than stepped forward.\n  We seem to be unwilling to step forward and embrace this great \nopportunity that is so much more than the jobs for just the pipeline \nitself.\n  I filed two amendments today on the pipeline bill--the topic we are \ntalking about, the topic my good friend from North Dakota has done so \nmuch to bring attention to since the day he arrived in the Senate.\n  It was 4 years ago, when the Keystone XL Pipeline application was \nonly 2 years old at the time. Now 6 years later, we are continuing to \nmiss an opportunity. It seems that on this topic, as once was said \nabout seeking a solution to the Middle East, we can't seem to miss an \nopportunity to miss an opportunity.\n  But the two amendments I have filed deal with a couple of critical \nissues that relate to our energy future and our infrastructure future. \nOne would be a community affordability amendment where we would have to \nhave a study to look at the impact that all of these EPA regulations \nhave on communities. These are EPA's unfunded mandates on communities, \nwhere they tell communities they have to do things but really don't \ngive the community any idea how to pay for it.\n  The Presiding Officer and I are from two States that have many small \ncommunities. Those small communities often have a water system, a sewer \nsystem, and a storm water system, and the EPA comes in and says: Here \nis what we want you to do--maybe not with one of those, maybe with all \nof those--the air quality, the water quality.\n  I know the EPA has one regulation on water where the solution can't \ncost more than 2 percent of the median income over a specific period of \ntime.\n  Now, 2 percent of your income, if you haven't been paying it for your \nwater bill, your sewer bill or your whatever bill--2 percent of your \nincome is taken right off the top of your income. It makes a difference \nto most families, but at least there is a cap there. But you can have \nthat 2 percent on increasing the cost of the water system and another 2 \nor 4 or 5 percent on increasing the storm water system, and somebody \nhas to pay those bills.\n  What this amendment does is suggest that we figure out who is paying \nthose bills, what is a reasonable way to pay those bills, and how those \nbills can be paid. We know on the Senate floor, and the President \nknows, and the EAP knows who pays those bills and the people who have \naccess to those services. There is no mythical payee here. The person \nwho pays your utility bill is you, and if there is increased cost to \nthe utility system, that comes to you. The person who pays your water \nbill is you.\n  So I believe we need to have a coordinated effort to see how those \nprojects impact communities, impact families, and understand how this \nworks.\n  So this amendment that I filed today directs the EPA to collaborate \nwith the National Academy of Public Administration to review existing \nstudies of costs associated with major EPA regulations. The amendment \nalso directs the administration to determine how different localities \ncan effectively fund these projects. The end result would be to come up \nwith a working definition of a phrase they use a lot--individual and \ncommunity affordability--but I can't find any evidence that this \nphrase--individual and community affordability--really means anything.\n  The amendment I filed today has already been endorsed by the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, the National \nAssociation of Counties, and the chamber of commerce in my hometown, \nSpringfield, MO.\n  The other amendment I am filing, submitted as a sense of the Senate, \nis that the President's U.S.-China greenhouse gas amendment would be \nlooked at in a different way. This amendment is cosponsored by my \ncolleague from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe. It talks about the agreement \nnegotiated between the President and the People's Republic of China \nand, in fact, says this agreement really has no force and effect \nbecause frankly, Mr. President, it already has no force and effect in \nChina. Of the two parties the President says have agreed to this, we \nare the only one who would have to do anything. We think this is a bad \nidea--Senator Inhofe and I--and I think others will join us. It is a \nbad deal for our country, it is economically unfair, it is \nenvironmentally irresponsible, and once again it produces exactly the \nopposite result of what we would want.\n  First of all, I think the Constitution is pretty clear on agreements \nnegotiated between countries. There is a Senate role to be played. It \nrequires the advice and consent of the Senate. The Senate should insist \nwe do that job. Whether it is here or on any other agreements with \nother countries, those agreements need to be consented to by the \nSenate. It happens to say that in the Constitution.\n  These agreements, under this amendment, also would have to be \naccompanied by actions that may be necessary to implement the \nagreement, including what it costs to implement. The amendment says the \nUnited States should not sign bilateral or other international \nagreements on greenhouse gases that will cause serious economic harm to \nthe United States. It also says the United States should not agree to \nany bilateral or international agreement imposing unequal greenhouse \ngas commitments on the United States.\n  The reason I filed this amendment is simple. The agreement the \nPresident unilaterally negotiated with China and announced last \nNovember is a bad deal for workers and a bad deal for families, whether \nthose workers are in Missouri or Arkansas or anywhere else in the \ncountry today. The agreement requires the United States to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions from 26 to 28 percent below the 2005 levels by \n2025. It allows the Chinese to increase their emissions until 2030.\n  So last night the President said in his State of the Union Address \nthat the United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon \npollution and China committed for the first time to limiting their \nemissions. Well, let's be very frank about that. The President is \nactually right. He has agreed that we would double the pace, somewhere \naround 26 to 28 percent below the 2005 levels in the near term, but the \nChinese have agreed actually to be allowed to increase their emissions \nfor another 15 years and then they would consider--they would \nconsider--reducing emissions after that. What this does is drive jobs \nand opportunity to China and other countries that care a lot less about \nwhat comes out of the smokestack than we do. We lose the jobs we \notherwise would have had. We try to solve a global problem on our own \neven though we have made great strides already, some of which were \ncost-effective, but they get less cost-effective all the time.\n  I am grateful my colleagues allowed me to have a few extra minutes. I \nhave filed these amendments, and we will be talking more about them and \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline issue over the next few days. I look forward \nto having a vote on these amendments and the vote on the Keystone XL \nPipeline.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

After I make some opening \nremarks, I will try to request that through the Chair but only if the \nSenator is interested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I certainly would welcome that opportunity \nand look forward to joining the Senator from Illinois in that dialogue.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from North Dakota and warn him that \nwe are getting perilously close to a Senate debate, which almost never \nhappens. So we want to alert all the news bureaus that this might even \nturn into a debate on the floor of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S308]]\n\n  This is Senate bill 1. It is the highest priority of the Senate \nRepublican majority. It is their first bill in the majority. They \ndecided their first bill would be the Keystone XL Pipeline bill. The \nKeystone XL Pipeline is not owned by an American company; it is owned \nby a Canadian company, is my understanding, TransCanada. What they are \ndoing is shipping tar sands from Canada--at least it is proposed here--\ninto the United States, across the Midwest, to be refined in Texas and \nthen turned into refined oil products, which could include, of course, \ngasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and other things.\n  Yesterday we had two votes on the floor of the Senate about this \npipeline and what it is going to produce, and they were interesting \nvotes.\n  In the first vote we said: Well, if we are going to have this \npipeline come into the United States of America and bring Canadian tar \nsands to be refined, then whatever oil it produces, the products it \nproduces, should be used in America to help Americans reduce the cost \nof gasoline, to make it cheaper for manufacturing concerns to use their \nproducts.\n  The Republicans rejected that notion that the oil and products \nproduced by the Keystone XL Pipeline would be used in America. They \nrejected that. I think the vote was 57 to 42. Three or four Democrats \njoined them, but all of the Republicans, if I am not mistaken, voted to \nsay the products coming out of this pipeline wouldn't be used in \nAmerica.\n  Then we offered a second amendment. The second amendment said: Well, \nif we are going to build this pipeline--and a lot has been said about \nthis being the Keystone jobs bill--shouldn't we use American steel, use \nAmerican products to build it so that it truly does create jobs in the \nsteel industry and demand for steel products?\n  The Republicans rejected that amendment as well. So their idea of a \nKeystone jobs pipeline is a pipeline that produces a product that won't \nbe sold in America and a pipeline that is built with foreign steel. \nThat is their idea of an American jobs bill?\n  There is also another aspect of this, on which I have introduced an \namendment. There is a dirty little secret about this Keystone XL \nPipeline which we will get to vote on today. This is what it comes down \nto. For the longest time nobody looked at Canadian tar sands as a \nviable source of a product that could be refined into gasoline or \ndiesel fuel. The reason it was never considered viable was the price of \na barrel of oil was too low. They knew that in these tar sands up in \nCanada, there was the potential of drawing oil after they went through \na lengthy and expensive process, and they couldn't afford it until the \nprice of oil started knocking on the door of $80, $90 and $100, and \nthen Canadian tar sands became viable. They could afford to refine the \nproduct and make some money. And that is what happened.\n  The Canadian tar sands were developed in Alberta, and they were \nshipped to the United States and other places to be refined. In fact, \nthe first Keystone pipeline, I would argue--although it went by a \ndifferent name--actually went to Illinois. It went to Wood River, IL, \nto the Conoco refinery, and I have seen it. I have seen the refinery \nsince it has been receiving these tar sands.\n  The reason why it is more expensive to use Canadian tar sands to \nproduce oil products is you have to take out the tar sands. That is a \nviscous, nasty product that has to be dealt with with extraordinary \nrefining capacity, which they developed at Wood River, what is now the \nPhillips refinery. I have seen it.\n  The dirty little secret about this process is that after they have \ntaken off the worst parts of it--the parts that are not really \neconomically valuable to most--they have to do something with it, and \nit turns out that in this process they generate huge amounts of what is \nknown as petcoke. Petcoke is the byproduct of Canadian tar sands. \nPetcoke is what is left over after they take what is valuable out of \nCanadian tar sands. And there is a lot of it.\n\n  Proponents of the bill would like to tell you the pipeline won't have \nany harmful environmental impact, but a lot of communities across \nAmerica know better--Detroit, Chicago, and Long Beach, CA, for three. \nThese communities have seen what happens when big refineries near their \nhomes start processing large amounts of Canadian tar sands.\n  Let me show an illustration. This is from the city of Chicago--the \ncity of Chicago. This is a Chicago neighborhood. If you didn't know \nbetter, you would assume it is someplace in a remote area. It is not. \nThis Chicago neighborhood looks an awful lot like Little Rock, AR; \nFargo, North Dakota, except take a look at what is next door to these \nlittle bungalows and homes. This is a petcoke dumpsite.\n  The British Petroleum refinery receives Canadian tar sands in \nWhiting, IN, refines them, and the leftover product--this petcoke \nsludge--is shipped over to the city of Chicago, where it is deposited \nin piles that are three- and four-stories high. I have seen them.\n  The residents started noticing these mountain-like piles of petcoke \nappearing right over the train tracks from their homes and at a local \nbaseball field after the Whiting refinery began processing tar sands. \nYou might imagine that on windy days, giant clouds of petcoke dust \nswirl above these storage piles and cover the neighborhoods. I have \nseen them. I have visited them. So these working families, when the \nwind is blowing in their direction, end up with this petcoke blowing \ninto their homes, into the lungs of their children.\n  Often, the dust from these petcoke piles means that people living in \nthe southeastern part of Chicago are forced to breathe dirty air that \none organization--National Nurses United--says causes severe health \nthreats. You see, petcoke--this product from Canadian tar sands--\ncontains heavy metals such as nickel, vanadium, and selenium. Nickel \ncauses cancer. Chronic exposure to nickel can cause neurological and \ndevelopmental defects among children. You can see this nasty petcoke on \nthe windowsills and buildings around this neighborhood, but you can't \nsee it in the lungs of the children until it is too late.\n  The National Institute For Occupational Safety and Health warns that \ninhaling nickel-laced dust increases your risk for lung cancer and \nfibrosis.\n  Petcoke dust also contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which \nhave been linked to cancer as well. And it is not just because the \nchemical composition of petcoke is toxic; the dust particles themselves \nare extremely dangerous. When you inhale petcoke, that dust can get \ntrapped in your lungs, causing respiratory problems. Once in the lungs, \nthese tiny particles can aggravate asthma, leading to premature death \nin people with heart or lung disease, and cause heart attacks.\n  Yesterday I made the point that when I visit schools across my State \nto ask how many students in the classroom know someone who has asthma, \nwithout fail, rural or urban schools, half the hands go up. I invite my \ncolleagues to do the same. So anything we do to aggravate this asthma \nthreat we face is something we ought to think about very carefully. \nSome safety documents even note that long-term exposure to petcoke \nmight cause damage to the lung, liver, and kidney.\n  Because of petcoke dust, the city of Chicago has advised residents in \nthis neighborhood and around it to limit the time they are outdoors. In \naddition, Mayor Emanuel and the city are working with residents and \nlocal environmental organizations to limit the amount of petcoke that \ncan be stored in the city and to require that it be enclosed in \nfacilities that would protect it from blowing around.\n  This isn't the first city in America to face this danger from \nCanadian tar sands, which will be transported, if built, by the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. The city of Detroit, shipping ports near Los \nAngeles, they have dealt with petcoke piles too. We need to do more.\n  Many of these cities have had to act because for years petcoke has \nbeen exempt from regulation under many Federal environmental laws, and \nit has not been forced to comply with Federal cleanup standards.\n  The Federal Government's views on the official side of the ledger--\nthe regulatory side of the ledger is that these petcoke piles are \nbenign, not to be worried about. The health information tells us they \nare wrong.\n  That is why I proposed an amendment to end petcoke's exemptions and \nrequire the EPA and Department of Transportation to promulgate rules on \nhow to store and transport petcoke to protect public and ecological \nhealth. It\n\n[[Page S309]]\n\ncloses the environmental loophole for petcoke.\n  My amendment would require we make these changes before construction \nis allowed to begin on this pipeline. It is important because tar sands \ntransported by the Keystone XL Pipeline--this Canadian company--will \ndramatically increase the amount of petcoke produced in this country.\n  In the year 2013 the United States produced a record amount of 57.5 \nmillion metric tons of petcoke.\n  According to the environmental impact statement for the Keystone XL \nPipeline, the No. 1 priority of the Senate Republican majority, this \npipeline will produce over 15,400 metric tons of petcoke every day.\n  Under current law all of this new petcoke would continue to be \nshipped to local communities for storage and disposal in the same large \nopen piles we see in this photograph in Chicago. That isn't right. We \nin Congress should deal with the acres of petcoke piles that are \nalready out there before we build a pipeline that will create 15,400 \nmetric tons of it a day. Incidentally, the BP refinery that has created \nthis mess is generating 6,000 tons a day. More than twice as much will \ncome out of the Keystone XL Pipeline, the No. 1 Republican Senate \nmajority issue, S. 1, Keystone XL Pipeline, Canadian company, 35 \npermanent jobs but 15,400 metric tons of petcoke every single day \nsomewhere in America.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment to treat petcoke for \nwhat it is. It is a dangerous byproduct that shouldn't be stored in \nopen-air piles near neighborhoods, ballparks, children, and elderly \npeople.\n  End the regulatory loophole for petcoke and establish reasonable \nguidelines for handling this dangerous material. This would help ensure \nthat clean air and clean water is something everyone can enjoy--even if \nyou happen to have the bad luck of living in a neighborhood near a \npetcoke dump site such as this one near the city of Chicago.\n  I see the Senator from Minnesota is seeking recognition. I ask \nunanimous consent for the Senator from North Dakota and myself to enter \ninto a 3-minute dialogue so we don't hold up my friend from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I know the Senator is a reasonable man and has been \nGovernor of a State and understands responsibility.\n  Is it too much to ask that we regulate petcoke so it is not a public \nhealth hazard to the people who happen to live next door to these \ndumps?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to respond to \nmy esteemed colleague from the State of Illinois.\n  Of course the answer to the question is that in fact it is a \nregulated substance, and it is primarily regulated at the State and \nlocal level.\n  In the State of Illinois, for example, petcoke would be regulated by \nthe State of Illinois. What I understand the Senator from Illinois to \nbe saying is that he is dissatisfied with the way the State of Illinois \nhas chosen to regulate petcoke.\n  But in fact the EPA has found that petcoke has a low hazard \npotential. According to the Congressional Research Service, most \ntoxicity analysis of petcoke, as referenced by EPA, finds it has low \nhealth hazard potential in humans, has no observed carcinogenic, \nreproductive or developmental effects. In fact, it is a byproduct of \nnot just oil from the oil sands but also some of the oils from \nCalifornia, Venezuela, and other places.\n  So it is a byproduct that in fact is recycled. It is used in products \nsuch as aluminum, steel, paint. It is used to produce electricity.\n  Here is a case of a product that actually can be and is in fact \nrecycled. I would argue that what we want to do as we produce energy is \ncontinue to invest in these new technologies that will help us produce \nmore energy but also do it with better environmental stewardship, which \nmeans we not only work on CCS, carbon capture and storage--which is a \nmajor undertaking in the oil sands right now; and I would be willing to \nengage in that discussion as well--but then also work to find uses for \nthese byproducts in things such as steel and aluminum.\n  For example, the President last night talked about how the auto \nindustry is making a resurgence, and he talked about the CAFE \nstandards. One of the things they are doing in Detroit with new \nautomobiles is they are using more aluminum in the construction of the \ncars to reduce the weight to try to meet those CAFE standards.\n  So here is a product from the oil sands oil that is actually used in \naluminum to make those vehicles lighter to achieve one of the things \nthe President talked about in the State of the Union Address last night \nas a byproduct from the oil sands oil.\n  So I appreciate the question and look forward to further dialogue.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reclaiming for a brief followup. I want to make sure I \nunderstand the Senator's position.\n  The Senator's position is we should not establish any Federal \nstandards on the safety of petcoke and leave it up to the States.\n  He also argues it is not a danger, it is not carcinogenic, and it is \nlow hazard, in his words. I don't know if the Senator has seen petcoke \nneighborhoods that have this blowing into them.\n  I would just say to the Senator, this notion that somehow petcoke is \ngoing to be some fabulous discovery for new inventions--maybe it will, \nbut at this point it is being sold to China and they are burning it to \ngenerate electricity. I would just try to imagine for a moment what is \ncoming out of those smokestacks in China, where sadly the air pollution \nis awful at the moment.\n  I yield the floor, but I don't think it is adequate to say that the \ncity of Chicago should be regulating this substance. We have a nation \nwhich will be affected by a national pipeline from this Canadian \ncompany. We ought to have a national standard to protect Americans from \nthe dangers of petcoke. Whether we are talking about Fargo, Little Rock \nor Juneau, I wouldn't want to live this close to these petcoke piles.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds for \na simple point of clarification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, the characterizations of petcoke are from \nthe EPA and from the Congressional Research Service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/21/senate-section/article/S309-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S309-S310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about the \nPresident's speech from last night. I think it was very important. It \nwas a major event. All Members of Congress were there. To me, it was a \ncall to action. It wasn't just ideas, it was about how to turn ideas \ninto action. It was a strong speech focused on the middle-class economy \nand how we can strengthen our economy. I thought there was a lot of \nenergy.\n  I know some of my colleagues in the last few months have predicted \nthat the President was somehow going to slide down because of the \nactions he took on immigration or the actions he took on Cuba, and I \nthink what we are seeing around the country is quite the opposite. I \nthink people are excited that there is an energy, and they are \ncertainly pleased we have seen some major improvements in the economy.\n  I would say to my colleagues across the aisle, whom I take at their \nword when they say they want to work with us to govern this country, \nthat I think we know--if we didn't know it before, after last night--\nthat the President is not going to be spending his next year-and-a-half \nslouched in an armchair planning his Presidential library. I think what \nwe saw last night is a President who wants to get things done in his \nremaining time in office, and I think we see an energized country that \nalso wants to get through the gridlock and move forward.\n  First of all, I think the President did a very good job of laying out \nthe status of the economy, and I think it is very important, when there \nare so many numbers out there and information and people throwing \nthings out, that we\n\n[[Page S310]]\n\nstep back and look at that. Because when we look at where we are going \nto move forward, we need to understand from where we came and how we \nended up where we were a few years back in the midst of a recession.\n  So as I look at these young pages--thinking about how difficult it \nwas for so many years for young people to find employment and that we \nare now finally seeing hope for young people out in the job market and \nhow we can build what we have got.\n\n  So what do we know? We have had 58 straight months of private sector \njob growth. Our national unemployment is below 6 percent. In fact, in \nmy State it is down to 3.7 percent. Our unemployment rate last year \nwent down faster than in any other year we have seen since 1984. We are \nnow No. 1 in oil. This fall we surpassed Saudi Arabia as the No. 1 oil \nand gas producer in the world. That is what our country has done \nbecause of the work in North Dakota--I see my friend Senator Hoeven \nover there--because of the work going on all over this country.\n  As the President also pointed out last night, we also are increasing \nour renewable energy in wind. I would add, from the State of Minnesota, \nthat the renewable fuel standard and the fact that we have better gas \nmileage standards--all of these things have helped to bring down our \nconsumption and to raise our production, bringing these prices down in \nour country.\n  I thought one of the most interesting statistics last night was a \nfact I had never heard before. Since 2010, America has put more people \nback to work than the combined countries of all of Europe, Japan, and \nall advanced economies across the world. That shows that our workers \nare so good--something we know. It shows that our businesses are so \ngood. I think this is an opportunity we now have to finally in this \nChamber govern from opportunity, not just be governing from a state of \ncrisis. That is what we need to do.\n  One of my favorite parts, of course, was Rebekah and Ben Erler from \nMinnesota, who were mentioned right near the beginning of his speech, \nsitting right up in the First Lady's gallery in the House, a woman who \nhad gone through some hard times. Her husband had lost his job in the \nconstruction industry, but because of the strength of our State and the \nstrength of her family, her personal strength to want to go back to \nwork and go to a community college, her family is now stabilized. As \nthe President pointed out, maybe their big treat is getting together \nfor a pizza on Friday, but the point is that they have gotten through \nsome very hard times, as have so many resilient people in this country.\n  So the question we now have is this: How do we get ahead? How do we \nkeep going? I am going to go through a few of the ideas that the \nPresident discussed last night that are near and dear to my heart.\n  The first is community college. I would not be standing in the Senate \nright now if it wasn't for community college. My grandpa worked 1,500 \nfeet underground in the mines in Ely, MN. He never even graduated from \nhigh school. At age 15 he had to quit school. Even though he was \ngetting A's in math, he had to quit school to go and help support his \nfamily. Within a few years he was down in those mines. That is where he \nworked his whole life. He had dreamed of a life at sea. He had dreamed \nof a life in the Navy. He had dreamed of a life where he could use his \neducation, but he worked in that mine because he believed, more than \nanything, in the American dream--in his two young boys, in his wife, in \nhis family, in the nine brothers and sisters he raised because both of \nhis parents died. That is why, at ages 15 and 16, he and his brother \nwent to work. They went to work to help their family. When the youngest \nkid, Hannah, had to go to an orphanage for a year and a half, my \ngrandpa borrowed a car a year and a half after that and went and got \nher back, as he promised.\n  So what did he do for my dad? He saved money in a coffee can in the \nbasement so he could send my dad to college, and my dad is a proud \ngraduate of Ely Junior College, a 2-year community college. From there \nhe was able to go to the University of Minnesota, get a journalism \ndegree and interview everyone from Ronald Reagan to Mike Ditka, to \nGinger Rogers. That is our family's story.\n  My sister never graduated from high school. She had some trouble in \nhigh school. So what did she do? She was able to get her GED, go to a \ncommunity college, and move on from there to finalize her 4-year degree \nand get an accounting degree.\n  Those stories are all over America. The President's devotion to \ntalking about these 2-year community colleges and using them as a \nlaunching pad for kids' careers is the right one.\n  I am hoping, given the support I have seen from businesses across my \nState--where we don't have enough welders, we don't have enough people \nto work the technology in a lot of the factories. I am hoping my \ncolleagues will join us because of the strong business support, because \nof the need we have in our country to get more people into these jobs.\n  We have 5 million job openings. We have 8 million people who are \nunemployed. We need to match those two numbers. And the way we do it, I \nthink, is by doing more with these 1- and 2-year degrees and doing more \nwith kids in high school.\n  The second topic I appreciated that the President talked about was \nthe middle-class tax cut. We all know the numbers. We all know the \nfacts that due to the widening gap we have seen in income distribution, \nabout 80 percent of families have $1 trillion less in income than they \ndid during the Reagan time--$1 trillion less than during the Reagan \ntime. The top 400 people in the country have more wealth than the \nbottom half of the country combined. So as we look at where we should \nbe giving tax cuts and who we should be helping, it is clearly the \nmiddle class of this country.\n  That includes help with childcare and childcare credits that the \nPresident talked about. We are the only advanced country, as he pointed \nout last night, in the world that doesn't have some kind of sick leave \nor paid maternity leave. When I go and talk to women all over my State \nand I ask them what they most want, so many of them say time. They want \ntime to be able to be with their kids when they are sick. They want \ntime to be able to be with their baby when their baby is born. That is \nthe best thing for our country. So I don't believe the naysayers that \nsay we cannot work across the aisle to start talking about these \nimportant middle-class issues.\n  As the President pointed out, he is not running again, and he has \nnothing to do but to try to move forward with this country.\n  I appreciated the words of so many of my Republican colleagues who \ntalked about governance, who said they wanted to get back to the real \nbusiness of government, which is governing. I also appreciated those \nwho have put out innovative ideas on things such as infrastructure. The \nsimple idea that perhaps we can get some of these foreign earnings that \nare stuck there overseas that are just sitting there, billions of \ndollars--why don't we do something to bring that money back and make \nsure a portion of it goes into infrastructure? No one knows that better \nthan our State. Our State is a State where a bridge fell down in the \nmiddle of a summer day--not just a little bridge, an eight-lane highway \neight blocks from my house; a highway my family would drive over every \nsingle day--down into the middle of the Mississippi River on a summer \nday. That is infrastructure and that is a problem.\n  There are 75,000 bridges in this country that have been found to be \nstructurally not efficient, not able to function. That is what is \nhappening in this country right now.\n  So I truly appreciated the fact that the President talked about, yes, \nwe are going to be defending something, we are going to be arguing \nabout things in this Chamber. That is what this is set up to do. That \nis democracy. That is government. But there are also some very clear \nareas of agreement, and one of them is helping the middle class. Let's \nmove. Let's go forward.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/21/senate-section/article/S310-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S310-S311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan).

The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are back again with the Keystone XL \nPipeline, S. 1, the bipartisan 60-sponsor bill in front of us. We had a \ngood day yesterday debating three amendments and ultimately disposing \nof them. We have a half dozen of them in front of us this morning and \nthis afternoon.\n  I think it is worth noting, there have been several Members who have \ncome to the floor to give comments about the State of the Union last \nevening delivered by President Obama. It was his sixth official State \nof the Union Address. It marked the sixth address that he has given to \nthe Congress and the Nation while this project has been under review \nthe whole time throughout his entire administration. Every one of those \nState of the Union Addresses has happened at a time when the Keystone \nXL application has been pending. It puts into context how long we have \nbeen considering this legislation.\n  The President didn't really speak much to the demerits or the \nopposition to Keystone XL--it was basically a quick reference--but he \ndid in a manner attempt to compare this bipartisan, subsidy-free bill \nto major taxpayer-funded infrastructure projects. Whether it is our \nhighways or bridges, the need is clear. But I think we also recognize \nthose are projects that are taxpayer-funded that will require millions \nand perhaps billions of dollars a year. What we are talking about with \nthe Keystone XL is something where we don't have any Federal subsidies \ngoing in. It is not taxpayer-funded. I think it is important to make \nsure that we understand the difference.\n  What we didn't hear last night was how this project could be \nadvanced. Once again, there was no indicator. I would like to remind \neveryone that we are sitting at over 2,300 days where we have not had a \nPresidential decision. I think the good news for us here on this floor \nis the debate on this issue is not going to last that long, thankfully.\n  Again, we moved into regular order, and I think it was helpful for \nMembers of the body to not only know that there was a series of \namendments that were called up, but that we were able to have debate on \nthem, and then we were able to dispense with them.\n  The majority of the Senate voted to table two of those proposals, but \nthen when it came to the Portman-Shaheen bill, the energy efficiency \nprovision, we were able to move that by a vote of 94 to 5, \ndemonstrating again a great deal of support for this small energy \nefficiency provision. I wish it had been bigger, in fairness to the \nbill sponsors who have been working so hard for years on that. We just \nadvanced a very small piece of that. I think we have more to do in the \narea of energy efficiency, and I am looking forward to working with \nthem on that.\n  What we have in front of us now at this point in the process is we \nhave a bill that will approve the cross-border permit for the Keystone \nXL Pipeline and we will work to deal with some aspects of energy \nefficiency. I think that is some good progress.\n  Once again this morning I will encourage Senators. We have called for \nan open amendment process, but as the leader has reminded us, it is not \nopen-ended. We are not going to be on this bill indefinitely. So move \nto file your amendments. If you want a vote on them, you need to be \nfiling them now and talking to us now.\n  We are at 77 amendments that have been filed and that was as of last \nnight. So there is clearly already a line, and my hope is we will be \nable to dispense with this half dozen today.\n  Briefly speaking to the measures that we have from each side, we have \nSenator Fischer's amendment 18; Schatz amendment No. 58; No. 33 is the \nLee amendment; we have Senator Durbin's amendment 69; we have Senator \nToomey's amendment 41, as well as the Whitehouse amendment No. 29.\n  I spoke a little bit on a couple of these measures yesterday, and I \nwill be speaking more this afternoon before we move, hopefully, to \nvotes.\n  I do want to take a minute before I turn it over to Senator Cantwell \nto be recognized and then to Senator Hoeven. There have been several \nsense-of-the-Senate amendments that have been filed--presented on the \nissue of climate change. I think it is important for people to note \nthat in order to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline, as the legislation \nitself lays out, there is no climate change provision that is required. \nI find it a little ironic that in neither of the two pending amendments \nthat we have before us--Senator Schatz's and Senator Whitehouse's--\nneither of them actually quotes the parts of the State Department's \nfinal EIS that explains, I think in pretty fair detail, that this \nproject will not significantly contribute to climate change. In fact, \nthe State Department found that without the Keystone XL Pipeline \ngreenhouse gas emissions associated with transporting Canadian oil \ncould actually increase, and the estimate is increasing somewhere \nbetween 28 and as high as 42 percent. One might ask, how can that be? \nThe reality is that not only is a pipeline less costly and more \nefficient, but it has the least environmental impact in terms of any \nadditional emissions.\n  So I think it is important to recognize that when we are talking \nabout the oil coming from Canada, oil that Canada is producing for lots \nof different reasons that benefit Canada, that that oil is going to \nmove. So our challenge is, is that oil going to move in a manner that \nbenefits Americans with increased jobs and opportunities? Is it going \nto help fill our refineries in the gulf coast? Is it going to help from \na safety perspective in terms of transporting a product in the safest \nmanner as well as providing the least environmental impact?\n  The State Department also provided in the EIS that:\n\n       Approval or denial of any one crude oil transport project, \n     including the proposed project, is unlikely to significantly \n     impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands or the \n     continued demand for heavy crude oil at refineries in the \n     United States based on expected oil prices, oil sands supply \n     costs, transport costs, and supply and demand scenarios.\n\n  I think we are going to have some discussion this afternoon about \nwhat is contained in the State Department EIS. At 1,000 pages the full \nEIS is substantive. There is an executive summary that helps us all out \nand distills all of this. But I think it is important that Members look \nat what that report outlines.\n  I previously mentioned that we have about 77 amendments in front of \nus that have been filed at this point in time. We have nine, as of this \nmorning, separate sense-of-the-Senate or sense-of-the-Congress \namendments relating to climate change.\n  I have noted that this is the first time we have had an energy-\nrelated bill on the floor in a while where there has been an \nopportunity for debate. You will recall that this same measure was on \nthe floor in December when the Democrats were in charge. The floor was \nmanaged at that point in time by the Senator from Louisiana, obviously \nvery passionate in her support of the Keystone XL Pipeline. But in that \ndebate there was no opportunity for amendments. You didn't see \ncolleagues on either side of the aisle able to offer any amendments. We \ndidn't see any amendments on climate. Now we have nine climate-related \namendments here. So when you think about the urgency, we are having \nfolks coming down and saying we must act on this now. I will remind \npeople the reason we are able to\n\n[[Page S312]]\n\nhave this debate and the reason we are able to have votes on this issue \nis because we are operating under a regular order process where we are \nallowing for amendments, whether it is on issues such as climate change \nor whether it is on issues such as dealing with exports as we took up \nyesterday. We are not going to agree in many of these areas, but at \nleast we are going to get back to being a deliberative body that not \nonly talks about issues, but has an opportunity to vote on them.\n  So, again, I think we are probably going to hear a lot of different \nconversations about climate change.\n  I want to point out an article before I conclude this morning. This \nis an article that ran November 27, 2014, just a few months ago. It ran \nin the Financial Post, and it is entitled ``New emissions from Canada's \noil sands `extremely low,' says IEA's chief economist.'' The article \nhas some interesting quotes that I think are relevant to our \ndiscussion.\n  The first line of that article states:\n\n       As an energy advisor to some of the world's most developed \n     economies, Fatih Birol worries about critical issues \n     including security of energy and the impact of fossil fuels \n     on the climate. One issue he does not spend any time worrying \n     about, however, is carbon emissions from oil sands.\n\n  Mr. Birol is quoted as saying: ``There is a lot of discussion on oil \nsands projects in Canada and the United States and other parts of the \nworld, but to be frank, the additional CO2 emissions coming \nfrom the oil sands is extremely low.''\n  So here we have a statement by IEA's chief economist. If we combine \nthat with what we have contained in the State Department's final EIS--\nagain, I think these are important statements of support or fact to \nhave on the record.\n  As we are debating these amendments today, I encourage everyone to \nkeep in mind that oftentimes much of what we hear can be a little \namped-up. I understand the passion that goes on, but we need to make \nsure we are looking critically at the facts as they exist.\n  I am just going to conclude my comments this morning by saying that \nwhat is happening in Canada--the simple facts are that Canada is \nproducing its oil and it will move that oil to markets. Canada is our \nstrongest partner, and they supply us with more oil than any of our \nother trading partners. So Canada is going to continue to produce oil, \nand they will move that oil.\n  The question is, Who will ultimately benefit from that production of \noil? Will the United States gain the benefit of those construction \njobs? Will the United States gain the benefit from the crude that will \ncome down through the line and go into the gulf coast and benefit from \nthe refineries that are built to handle and process that heavy crude \ncoming from the north?\n  I want the United States to be a participant in this important \nproject for a lot of different reasons, and I am encouraged that more \nthan 60 of my colleagues seem to share that view.\n  We will continue the discussion through the series of amendments we \nhave before us today. I know my colleague from North Dakota is prepared \nto speak, but at this time I will turn it over to my ranking member, \nthe Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Alaska \nhelping us to work through this process and being down here to talk \nabout how we move forward. I heard her say we are obviously thinking \nabout how we move through the amendment process, and I am sure she and \nI will get a chance to talk about the potential votes we will have \nlater on as we continue with this amendment process.\n  Like her, I wish to add a few comments to this morning's comments \nabout the State of the Union Address last night because I do feel as \nthough it was the first time we heard a speech from a President of the \nUnited States that was all about an innovation economy.\n  As someone from Seattle and the Pacific Northwest, I know a lot about \ninnovation, and I was glad to hear he basically spoke about the whole \nperspective of what it takes to have an innovation economy and how we \nhave to think about research and development and investing in our \nworkforce. He mentioned trade and a variety of things that are all \ncomponents of an innovation economy and how we can continue to move \nforward. I was very glad to hear that level of innovation, including \nhis community college effort because it is about training the workforce \nfor the future.\n  I also heard him talk about making improvements in infrastructure. \nThe one thing I didn't hear him talk about was the issue of plug-in \nvehicles or electric cars. The reason I bring that up is because I \nthink for most of the Bush administration, and maybe even some of the \nearlier days of this administration, I constantly heard talk about how \nwe had to get electric vehicles and plug-in cars so we could get off \nour dependence on foreign oil.\n  We should take pride that in last night's speech we didn't have to \nlisten to that because we have made progress in plug-in electric cars. \nPlug-in electric cars are in the marketplace, and we are making great \nprogress in that area. We are also making progress in getting off \nforeign oil, and we are seeing how fuel efficiency is having a positive \nimpact on our savings.\n  The President of the United States was asking what is the next level \nof innovation we have to do and how do we move forward while still \nprotecting ourselves from what has been the deterioration of our \nenvironment from the greenhouse gases and the threat it makes to our \nplanet.\n  Again, being from the Pacific Northwest, I consider those threats to \nbe very real. The shellfish industry has been almost ruined due to the \nlack of oxygen in the water and the amount of carbon that basically \nsinks into our oceans and causes damage to the shellfish.\n  I see the Presiding Officer is also from the great State of Alaska.\n  When it comes to sources of feeding for Pacific Northwest salmon, \nthere are not a lot of great food sources for the salmon. Climate \nchange is having an effect on the ecosystem and the economy, so you can \nbet that climate issues are very important to our State. Those issues \nare no longer hidden and there is no longer a way to escape from that. \nIt is on our plate right now.\n\n  The President of the United States said: Let's deal with that and \nmove forward, and instead of talking about one pipeline, let's talk \nabout an energy plan and an infrastructure investment for the Nation.\n  I will point out to my colleagues: You are becoming dangerously close \nto saying we can't do something like Portman. How many times were my \ncolleagues from Ohio and New Hampshire held up on energy efficiency \nbecause no one would let us vote on that? How long--1 year, 2 years? \nThen yesterday we finally had a vote, and 95 of our colleagues voted \nyes on moving forward on energy efficiency.\n  I will also point out that energy efficiency is, I believe, key to \nour economy of the future. If the United States is a leader in making \nenergy--no matter what source it comes from--more efficient, we will \nwrite the playbook around the globe because so many people will want to \nmake very dear energy resources more usable, better utilized, and have \nlower costs to their individual businesses and consumers.\n  Energy efficiency is incredibly important, but we never got to energy \nefficiency. It is almost as if the other side of the aisle is saying: \nYou will only get energy efficiency if we pair it with other \nlegislation where we are rolling back environmental rules, and that is \nthe objection I have and the people from the State of Washington have \nas well.\n  People want people to play by the rules. They want to know that if \nyou propose a pipeline, you will actually follow the laws to protect \nthe environment, such as the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and \nfollow the process of what is in the public interest. We should be \nhaving that debate. We should not usurp the President of the United \nStates in determining what is the national interest of this country.\n  At the very time the State Department was saying to this company, \nTransCanada, you have a pipeline proposal we don't like because it goes \nright through an aquifer, at the very moment when the State Department \nwas telling them we don't like the proposal and you need to adhere to \nthe environmental laws, the same people were in Congress trying to get \nSenators and House Members to vote on\n\n[[Page S313]]\n\nlegislation that would have said pass the pipeline right through the \naquifer.\n  I believe the President should be given the due diligence to drive \nhome with this foreign company the fact that we have a national \ninterest, that this national interest will be met, and that we will set \nthe standard for whether these environmental laws are going to be \ncomplied with. I don't believe we should be usurping them. I think my \ncolleagues are now offering amendments on the other side that also \nusurp other environmental laws.\n  I hope my colleagues will think about this because it will certainly \ngive the Senator from Alaska and myself something to think about. As we \ntry to move forward on energy legislation, we are going to have to \nthink about how we are going to pass something that has bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Since I have been on the energy committee--and I have been on the \ncommittee now the entire time I have been in Congress--I have had the \nopinion that you should not hold up good energy legislation just to try \nto get bad energy legislation. I have the opinion that we should pass \nenergy bills every year. That is the transformation our country is \ngoing under.\n  I wish we would have helped the Senators who wanted to usher in \nenergy efficiency 2 years ago, but it is telling that 95 of our \ncolleagues have always thought that was an easy lift. We should keep \nmoving forward on those issues that are easy lifts and ensure the \nbusinesses that need predictability and certainty that we can move \nforward on that.\n  Another example is the clean energy tax credits. While we are trying \nto overwrite environmental rules to give a foreign interest a pipeline \nthrough our country--I should say, people thought the pipeline that \nwent through Yellowstone was safe, and we just had a big spill there \nthis past weekend. It is not as if these spills don't happen.\n  We had a colleague from Michigan talk about the spill that happened \nin Kalamazoo. I just saw the Commandant of the Coast Guard again last \nnight at the State of the Union Address and we talked about how we \ndon't have a solution for cleaning up tar sands in the water, and that \nis why we in the Pacific Northwest are so interested in this issue.\n  Let's not hurry through a process of special interest when we can do \nthings that we need to give predictability and certainty on, such as \nthe energy tax credits that are germane and are within the boundaries \nof what Congress is supposed to be deciding on. The American people are \nasking us to debate those issues and to come up with a resolution on \nthem. I don't know that the American people are asking us to override a \nprocess and usurp what is the right of the President to make sure our \nnational interests are considered in this policy debate.\n  I do appreciate the Senator from Alaska working through this process, \nand I do appreciate the fact that I think she is serious about she and \nI sitting down and talking about a larger energy bill. I pride myself \non having a Pacific Northwest view; that is, there are things that are \ngood for both Alaska and Washington and we should work on them \ntogether. Maybe there are some things that are well and good for Alaska \nand Washington but maybe the rest of the country doesn't agree with, \nbut we will work through a process together.\n  I say to my colleagues, as we look at these next tranches of votes, \nwe should consider what the President said last night. We need a \nbroader innovation strategy for our economy. I believe there are ways \nto get there. I think these amendments we are considering--I don't \nthink we need to change the Antiquities Act. I am a big believer in the \nfact that there are some tremendous national beauties that have been \nestablished through the Antiquities Act both--actually by lots of \nRepublican Presidents, and I don't feel we have to change the \nAntiquities Act. I certainly don't think we need to change the \nEndangered Species Act, and I don't think we need to overrule the Clean \nAir Act, as the amendment does of the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  We will have more time to talk about these amendments on the floor, \nbut I hope my colleagues will understand that we want environmental \nrules to be followed, and we want people to follow a process. We want \nthese issues to move forward from an energy policy that will move \nAmerica to a 21st century energy policy and not continue to hold on to \nthe 19th century pollutions that are challenging our economy.\n  I am sure we are going to hear from our colleagues when they come \ndown to debate these issues as it relates to greenhouse gases and other \nthings. Again, I appreciate my colleague from Alaska helping us to work \nthrough this process. I appreciate that it is a debate and that all of \nmy colleagues will have a chance to come down and express their \nopinions.\n  With that, I yield back to my colleague on whatever process we are \ngoing to follow to go back and forth on amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the comments of \nthe ranking member of the energy committee and her focus on energy \ninnovation. I think we can look to that as not only a bright spot in \nour economy where we have seen great progress in recent years, but we \nhave also seen great enthusiasm and an optimism about the future of our \ncountry when we allow our great minds to work on some of the problems \nof the day to get us to these advanced solutions.\n  The Presiding Officer and I come from an energy-producing State. We \nare also a State that has some of the highest energy costs in the \ncountry. Right now in the village of Fort Yukon, they are paying $7.25 \nfor a gallon of fuel. Up in Kobuk--in the northwest part of the State--\nthey are paying $10 for a gallon of fuel. The rest of the country is \nenjoying a price break because of the drop in fuel, but in Alaska, when \nthere is no neighborhood filling station that is connected to a road \nthat is connected to someplace that brings people somewhere, people \nhave to bring in their fuel by barge or by plane. The contract for that \nfuel in July--July's prices were not what they are now. Folks are \nlocked in. Talk about being frozen in someplace--well, their prices are \nalso frozen in.\n\n  So we know and understand the challenges when it comes to energy. We \nknow and understand the challenges when it comes to paying to keep your \nhouse warm or your lights on. We have every interest--every interest--\nto make sure that we are pushing out, that we are being innovative, \nthat we are being as efficient as we possibly can be when it comes to \nenergy use and consumption. I want to urge us, to push us, to be really \naggressive in pushing us toward those technologies that will allow us, \nin a small-population State that has no real energy grid, so to speak, \nto figure out how we can be more self-sufficient, get us off diesel, \nget us off $10-a-gallon oil in Kobuk, AK. We have to figure this out.\n  We are talking about the challenges we face, but as we begin this \ngood, robust debate on issues such as the climate, I think we need to \nbe careful about what we are doing in response to the issue of a \nchanging climate. If the answer is to increase energy costs, if it is \nto implement a carbon tax, if it is to make it more expensive, if it is \nto cripple our economy, then we don't have the ability to move out on \nthese technologies because they are expensive.\n  We need to have a strong economy. We need to figure out how we can \naddress climate through adaptation, mitigation, and new technologies \nthat are going to take us to cleaner fuel sources, to renewable energy \nsources we have in great abundance in Alaska and elsewhere. But it \ntakes money. It takes a strong economy. So I am not willing to do \nanything that is going to put the brakes on our economic strength and \nviability.\n  This is a good part of the discussion. It is very germane to where we \nare right now.\n  I mentioned in my comments that we currently have six amendments \npending to the bill. Our side would like to set up votes on these \namendments, with a 60-vote threshold required for any amendment that is \nnot germane. We are working on a side-by-side right now on the Schatz \namendment as well as a potential modification to the Fischer amendment. \nBut I don't think there is any reason why we wouldn't be voting on \nmost, if not all, of the pending amendments shortly after lunch today. \nOnce we have gotten through those amendments, Senator Cantwell and I \nwill queue up the next batch of\n\n[[Page S314]]\n\ntwo to three amendments from each side so we can continue to make \nprogress on this bill.\n  At this time, I turn to my colleague Senator Hoeven, the sponsor of \nS. 1, who has been waiting to address the body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nHoeven be followed by the Senator from Vermont to speak for 10 minutes \nabout an amendment he has filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I wish to verify that I have 10 minutes \nbefore my time expires. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is not aware of a limit on the time \nof the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I don't know how much time the Senator \nfrom North Dakota is seeking this morning. Maybe that would help the \nSenator from Vermont in understanding the schedule.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, that is fine. I will use 10 minutes at \nthis point, and I will use more later.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Vermont \nis just going to speak to an amendment he has filed. He is not seeking \nto call up the amendment; is that correct?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is correct. I will probably need about 5 or 6 \nminutes.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. No objection, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, if the Senator from Vermont is only going \nto speak for 5 minutes, then I will defer to him. I may go longer than \n10 minutes, so I will defer to him if we would like to proceed at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his usual courtesy, \nand I appreciate it.\n  As the most senior Member of this body, I have served in both the \nmajority and minority numerous times, under three Democratic \nPresidents, four Republican Presidents, and Democratic and Republican \nmajorities. Throughout that time, I learned that the Senate can be \nproductive. The Keystone Pipeline legislation we are considering today, \nthough, is not one of those productive topics.\n  I hoped we would begin the 114th Congress by showing the American \npeople that Congress is putting the needs of hard-working American \nfamilies over those of powerful special interests, from job creation to \ncharting a sustainable energy future for this country. We ought to be \nconsidering legislation that supports the highway trust fund. That \nwould create tens of thousands of jobs across the country. We should be \nconsidering tax legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor at this time.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I wish to respond regarding the \nlegislation that is currently on the floor in several regards. I would \nlike to discuss some of the environmental arguments that have been \nbrought up. I wish to also reference the issue of export as well as \ntouch on some of the comments of the President relative to this project \nand comments others have made regarding the Keystone XL Pipeline \napproval bill, S. 1, being the first bill we brought up.\n  One of the things we hear is, well, this is a private investment, it \nis $8 billion, but we should somehow be doing something else. The \nreality is this is an $8 billion shovel-ready project, good to go. It \nis vital energy infrastructure for this country. So it is important in \nits own right. To compare it to the highway bill, which is all funded \nby Federal tax dollars, whereas this is a private investment which is \ngoing to generate revenues in addition to providing vital \ninfrastructure and providing jobs--that is not a fair comparison.\n  The point in bringing up this bill first was not only because this is \nimportant energy infrastructure but also because we wanted to try to \nget the Senate back to regular order, to an open amendment process. We \njust spent the last session and even before where we couldn't get \namendments offered. Whether Republican or Democrat, we could not come \nto the floor of this body--the most deliberative body in government--\nand offer amendments, have the debate, and get a vote.\n  So understand that bringing up this legislation is important in its \nown right, particularly as we consider how we best build the energy \nfuture of the United States and have this important energy debate.\n  Look what is going on at the pump right now. We pull up to the pump \nand gas is down more than a dollar. I think the national average price \nof gasoline is $2.05, when it was up between $3 and in some cases $4 in \nsome markets. That is a huge savings. That is hundreds of billions of \ndollars in consumers' pockets. That didn't just happen; that happened \nbecause we are building the right energy future for this country.\n  We are working to create energy security for the United States by \nproducing more oil and gas in this country, along with other types of \nenergy, and working with Canada to produce more oil and gas so we don't \nhave to get it from OPEC, so OPEC doesn't get to dictate terms to \nAmerican consumers and American businesses. And why don't they get to \ndictate terms? Because we are producing more energy. As we produce more \nenergy and we get more energy from Canada, our closest friend and ally \nin the world, we become energy secure. That is more energy, that is \nmore jobs, that is economic growth, that is national security, and that \nis what the American people want.\n  So when we talk about why this bill is up first, it is because we \nwant to build an energy plan that works for this country. We want our \nNation to be energy secure. This is how we do it. This kind of \ninfrastructure is a vital part of building that energy plan where we \nproduce more energy than we consume. So, together with Canada, we truly \nhave North American energy security. That means lower prices, that \nmeans a stronger economy, and that means we don't have to depend on \nOPEC for our energy.\n  Now look what is happening. OPEC is pushing back, aren't they? We are \nnow in this market fight, a fight for market share. So what do we do? \nDo we continue to build our energy resources here in this country or do \nwe say: No, we are not going to build the infrastructure. We are not \ngoing to continue to produce more oil and gas in this country. We are \nnot going to work with Canada. We are going to have Canada send that \noil to China because they want it.\n  Then we will go right back to where we were before, where our energy \nshrinks back down and we don't work with Canada, and OPEC is right back \nin business. That has to be music to OPEC's ears. They probably love it \nwhen they hear that the President is going to block our efforts to \nbuild vital energy infrastructure--and private investment, mind you, \nnot taxpayer dollars--that will create hundreds of millions of dollars \nof revenue for all of these States as they collect property taxes and \npayment in lieu of taxes. OPEC is doing great.\n  When we shrink our industry back down and Canada sends its energy to \nChina, who is back in business? Who is back in the driver's seat? OPEC \nand the other petro-dependent countries, such as Russia. Russia \nfinances virtually 50 percent or more of their economy on what? Petro \ndollars. Iran is a petro-dependent state. Do we want to be in the \ndriver's seat or do we want to keep them in the driver's seat? Do we \nwant to repeat history or do we want to take control of our own \ndestiny? That is why this is an important issue.\n  It is also an important issue because it is about getting this body \nback to a regular order so we break the gridlock. We are offering \namendments. We are saying to Republicans and Democrats: Come down and \noffer amendments.\n  We voted on three amendments yesterday. We have six pending \namendments right now. We are looking for more. This is about breaking \nthe gridlock and getting the important work of the country done.\n  It is the difference between the President giving a speech wherein he \noutlines all of his initiatives--OK, everybody, do it my way--and then \nspends the second half of the speech talking about how if we do it his \nway, somehow that is a compromise--that is not the case. That versus a \nproject he has talked about vetoing.\n\n[[Page S315]]\n\n  Let's take a look at whether this is a bipartisan project where \npeople have come together.\n  No. 1, it has been reviewed by the administration for more than 6 \nyears. How long do we have to hold up private enterprise before we let \nthem build the vital energy infrastructure we need--infrastructure that \nwill not only move Canadian crude to our refineries but will move light \nsweet Balkan crude from my State and from Montana to other refineries \nas well. So it is moving domestic crude as well as Canadian crude. If \nwe can't move it on this pipeline, it will be 1,400 railcars a day. How \ndo we move our agriculture products and other goods when we have that \nkind of congestion on our railroads?\n  The whole point is that the President talks about coming together on \nissues that have broad bipartisan support. Let's think about it. We \nhave broad bipartisan support in the House. This bill has already \npassed the House. We went through cloture in this body with 63 votes. \nThe last time I checked, 63 votes out of 100 is a pretty strong \nmajority. So we have bipartisan majority support in the Congress.\n  Second, in the polling over the 6 years that this project has been \nunder review and under study, the public has overwhelmingly supported \nit. They said: Yes, we want to be energy independent in this country. \nWe don't want to get our oil from OPEC. We would rather get it from \nCanada and produce it here at home, and we need the infrastructure to \nmove it around. So in the polls, 65, 70 percent of the people \nconsistently said: Build it. Build it.\n  By the way, all six States on the route, including Montana, South \nDakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, have all approved it. It \nwasn't as though they had to rush because they had 6 years to do it, \nbut they have all approved it. Is the U.S. Federal Government the only \nentity that can make a good decision around here? All of these States, \ntheir legislatures, their Governors--they don't know what they are \ndoing? The only one who can make a decision about whether this works or \nnot is the administration?\n  What are we saying to our friends in Canada? They are our largest \ntrading partner in the world. Think about our relationship with Canada. \nWhat if the situation were reversed and Canada wanted to work with us \non a project of this importance to them and we said: No, go work with \nChina.\n  When we think about all of these things, it brings home the reality. \nPeople can have their opinions on all kinds of issues, but those are \nthe facts as they relate to this project.\n  So now I just want to take a few minutes and reference a couple of \nspecific things, both on the environmental aspects that have been \nbrought up and then also on whether this oil will be exported or used \nhere at home. Again, this is an open-amendment process. So people can \ncome down and offer amendments on climate change or all those other \nthings. Everybody is entitled to their opinion and to advocate for \nwhatever they want to advocate for. But at the end of the day, we are \ngoing to keep bringing them back to the facts on this project. Those \nfacts were laid out in not one but five reports, three draft \nenvironmental impact statements and two final impact statements done by \nthe Obama administration's Department of State.\n  When we come down and people want to use different discussions and \ntalk about their views on climate change and all these other things, \nthey can do that and we can vote on amendments in regard to those \nthings. They can come down and talk about their views on whether oil \nshould or shouldn't be exported and all of those kinds of things. They \ncan offer amendments on them, and that is the process. But at the end \nof the day, we are going to work to bring them back to the facts. The \nfacts are this is the finding in the Obama administration's \nenvironmental impact statements--three draft statements and two final \nstatements done over 5 years. The Keystone XL Pipeline will have no \nsignificant environmental impact according to the U.S. Department of \nState environmental impact statements.\n  There is one thing I want to add to that. I talked about the fact \nthat if we don't build a pipeline, if we are going to get the oil, it \nis going to have 1,400 railcars coming in here on a daily basis. The \nenvironmental impact statements point out that we get more greenhouse \ngas without the pipeline than with it because without the pipeline we \nare either going to move that by railcar or it is going to China. And \nif it goes to China, it goes in tanker ships, and they produce more \ngreenhouse gas. It is refined in Chinese refineries, and they have \nhigher emissions than our refineries. And we still have to bring our \noil in from the Middle East. So now you have more greenhouse emissions \nfrom those tankers. The environmental impact statement itself points \nout that we have more emissions without the pipeline than if we \nactually build it.\n  I also want to take a minute to talk about the effort going on in \nAlberta for carbon capture and sequestration. In other words, one of \nthe things I have always talked about in terms of building the right \nkind of energy plan for this country is that instead of holding up the \ninvestment, we empower the investment. If we empower private \ninvestment, we not only produce more energy here at home and with our \nclosest ally in the world, we not only produce more energy, we not only \nget the infrastructure we need to move it--now understand, I am talking \nabout private investment, just getting the government out of the way \nand letting the private sector do what they do. If we empower that \ninvestment, we not only get the infrastructure we need to move energy \naround, we not only get the new technologies that develop that energy \nmore cost-effectively and more efficiently, we get better environmental \nstewardship.\n  New technologies produce better environmental stewardship. We are \nseeing that over and over. Take directional drilling in my State of \nNorth Dakota. We now drill down 2 miles off one ECO-Pad. We can put as \nmany as 16 wells on one ECO-Pad. We drill down 2 miles, and we go out 3 \nmiles and more in all different directions underground. Whereas before \nwe would have seen wells all over the terrain, now we see one spot \nwhere there is a well for miles, and it is producing for miles around.\n  Think how much you reduced that environmental footprint, right? It is \nthe same with carbon capture sequestration. People talk about clean \ncoal technology. They talk about carbon capture sequestration. There \nare other fossil fuels such as oil and gas. The only way we are going \nto get to that is by stimulating private investment and encouraging not \nonly the research and development that creates those technologies but \nactually getting them to deploy those technologies. That is exactly \nwhat is happening right now in the oil sands up in the Province of \nAlberta.\n  Since 1990 the greenhouse gas footprint of oil produced in the oil \nsands has gone down 28 percent. Because of better drilling techniques, \nbecause of cogeneration, because of other processes that have been put \nin place, the greenhouse gas emissions on a per-barrel basis for the \noil producing oil sands has gone down by almost a third, 28 percent. \nRight now major companies are continuing not only to produce more oil \nin the oil sands but to find ways to reduce the greenhouse gas and do \nwhat is called carbon capture and sequestration--carbon capture and \nstorage.\n  I will just touch on two of those for a minute and then relinquish \nthe floor to the good Senator from Vermont, because there is more that \nI will pick up on related to this environmental aspect as we debate \nthis legislation, as well as this whole issue of making sure that we \nget our country to energy security. But let me just touch for a minute \non two projects. Exxon is one of the companies that produces oil up in \nthe oil sands region, and they are investing on the order of $10 \nbillion in that oil development and production. Their Kearl project, \nwhich is a huge part of it, will use cogeneration for steam and low-\nenergy extraction processes to recover oil and heat integration between \nthe extraction and the treatment facilities to minimize energy \nconsumption. As a result, oil produced from Kearl will have about the \nsame life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions as many other crude oils \nrefined in the United States as a result of technologies which \nsignificantly enhance environmental performance.\n  Other environmental innovations for Kearl include onsite water \nstorage to\n\n[[Page S316]]\n\neliminate river withdrawals and low-flow periods and progressive land \nreclamation which will return the land to the boreal forest.\n  The plan is this. They are developing these new technologies so the \nenvironmental footprint is the same as conventional drilling. That is \nwhat they are working to develop. How else are we going to develop this \ntechnology to reduce the carbon footprint if we continue to block these \ninvestments? That is what we have heard from opponents of the project \nis: Oh, well, gee, we don't want to have oil from Canada if it has \nhigher greenhouse gas emissions or a higher environmental footprint.\n  Yet we pointed out that oil produced in California, oil that produced \nin Venezuela right now has the same level of carbon emissions, and we \nhave huge projects going on up here to actually reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions and develop that technology that will not only reduce the \nenvironmental footprint up here and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions \nup here but technology that we can use in the United States and around \nthe globe.\n  That is how we get better environmental stewardship, by developing \nthose technologies that help us do it. And who better to accomplish it, \nwho better than the ingenuity of American companies and Americans--\nAmerican entrepreneurs. That is how we make it happen. So the reality \nis--another one is the Quest project that Shell is undertaking. They \nare working right now with the Provincial government in Alberta on \ncarbon capture and storage. So the Province of Alberta actually has a \nprogram where they work with these companies on carbon capture and \nstorage. This is a tremendous opportunity to develop those technologies \nwe hear talked about on this floor so often if we are willing to work \nwith these companies and allow them to make the investments to do it.\n  My question to opponents or critics to the project is: How in the \nworld are we going to develop these new technologies to improve \nenvironmental stewardship if we block the very projects that are trying \nto do it?\n  I see the Senator from Vermont is here, and so I want to provide him \nwith his time to introduce his amendment, as well as the Senator from \nLouisiana. I will stop at this point. We will continue this debate, but \nI want to end on this very important subject by saying, again, the \nenvironmental impact shows we will have higher greenhouse gases without \nthis project versus with it. Again, I understand people can come down \nand talk about their opinions, but that is what the reports determine--\nfive reports done over 6 years. Furthermore, what I am pointing out is \nthat doesn't even take into account the kind of carbon capture and \nother projects that are being done in a huge way up here to develop \nreally the technologies that are not only going to help us in terms of \nreducing emissions and the environmental impacts of energy production \nin the oil sands but will help us in the United States and technology \nthat can be adopted in other countries around the globe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my friend from North Dakota for his usual courtesy \nshown earlier. Unfortunately, I had a nose bleed, and I had to stop my \nspeech. I think I am not used to the elevation--the altitude of the \nSenate--but after over 40 years I should be.\n  I was saying earlier, I had hoped we begin this 114th Congress by \nshowing the American people that Congress is putting the needs of hard-\nworking American families first. I wish we were considering legislation \nto support the Highway Trust Fund. That supports tens of thousands of \njobs around the country in every one of our States. I wish we were \nconsidering tax legislation to bring investments to our small local \nbusinesses and encouraging energy efficiency in construction and \ninvestment. I wish we were finding places to support the educational \npursuits of our children. I would like to maintain our status as a \npremier leader on the world stage.\n  Instead, we are considering legislation that puts Canadian tar \nsands--which are intended for export, not to be used in the United \nStates--as our priority. The pipeline will support 35 permanent jobs--\njust 35--not hundreds, not thousands--35. I would like to be \nconsidering legislation that creates thousands of jobs. It is hard not \nto question whether the new Senate majority is truly focused on the \nneeds of hardworking Americans.\n  Some who support the legislation claim the pipeline is truly ``shovel \nready.'' They claim the project has been thoroughly studied and \nanalyzed, and that the Administration sat for 6 years with no decision \non the permit.\n  Even before the Nebraska Supreme Court recently released its decision \non the location of this pipeline, the Republican leadership said this \nshould be our priority even ahead of that decision. The decision did \nnot clarify lingering questions about the process. In fact, the \nmajority of the justices said the decision to circumvent the public \nprocess and block Nebraskans' ability to raise concerns about the \npipeline was unconstitutional. Four of the seven justices said that it \nis unconstitutional under State law. But in their state procedure, you \nneed a supermajority of 5 of the 7 justices to halt this project, so \nthe landowners' appeal was rejected.\n  What bothers me is not only that the majority opinion is being \nignored in Nebraska but that the legislation approved last week by the \nHouse in consideration here would remove consideration of all appeals. \nYou have to take them out of local Federal courts and put them before \nthe DC Circuit. In other words, if you are in a State where this \npipeline goes through your community and you have a question, you would \nhave to make an appeal to the DC Circuit. What that is saying is that \nCongress believes that Washington knows best. Frankly, the people in my \nState of Vermont--and I suspect in States across the country--would \nprefer to trust the courts in their States.\n  We ought to be showing the American people that Congress cares more \nabout the public process and the public's access to their courts, than \nabout the wishes of foreign special interests. That is why I have \noffered an amendment that would strike the judicial review provision \nand restore the role of local federal district courts in reviewing \nchallenges arising from the Keystone Pipeline.\n  The majority leader promised an open debate and open amendment \nprocess. I appreciate that. I certainly have concerns about \ncircumventing what would be normal court procedure and the President's \napproval process, and I want to be able to address that. But more than \nthat, I hope this debate can be an open and honest conversation, not \nabout a pipeline that supports special interests but about the \ndirection in which our country is moving on sustainable energy, on job \ncreation, and on issues as fundamental to all Americans--Republicans or \nDemocrats--as who will have access to our courts. Will it just be \nspecial interests or will it be the American people? I prefer the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I have an amendment on this important \nbill at the desk, amendment No. 80. I am not going to offer that \namendment now because the minority side is blocking the offering and \ncalling up of additional amendments until we dispose of those presently \ncalled up. I want to do that right now. But hopefully, I will be doing \nthat in the very near future. I look forward to a full debate and a \nvote on this amendment, probably in the next tranche of amendments on \nthe bill.\n  My amendment is about energy. It is about a very crucial part of the \ndomestic policy, something I believe will absolutely be a huge positive \nincentive and factor to allow us to produce even more American energy, \nto become even more energy independent, and to provide an even greater \nboost to our economy; that is, through revenue sharing, sharing the \nrevenue produced by domestic energy production with the producing \nStates.\n  That is fair for two reasons: one, because those producing States do \nbear costs and burdens and impacts, including environmental impacts, \nand, two, providing that incentive is the most important way we can \nboost even further important domestic energy production. That energy \nproduction is vital for our country and our economy. In fact, we are \nnot in recession right now because of those U.S. energy jobs.\n\n[[Page S317]]\n\n  If it were not for those oil and gas and related jobs in America, we \nwould still be in a technical recession right now. Last night President \nObama talked glowingly of the state of our economy. I think he \nexaggerated that significantly. However, we would be in a technical \nrecession and we would be in a far different and worse place were it \nnot for those domestic oil and gas and energy jobs. That is what this \namendment would boost and would improve even further.\n  Again, the heart of this amendment is revenue sharing, establishing \nand expanding revenue sharing for producing States. So rather than all \nthe royalty and revenue produced by this domestic production just going \nto the Federal Treasury, we need to share that. A lot will go to the \nFederal Treasury. Most will go to the Federal Treasury. But we need to \ngive producing States a fair share.\n  Again, as I stated, that is for two reasons--two very important, very \nbasic reasons. First of all, those States bear a burden. They have \nimpacts from that production, including environmental impacts. They \nneed funds to deal with those impacts. It is manageable and it is worth \ndoing, but there are impacts.\n  Secondly, and maybe even more importantly, providing that revenue \nsharing for producing States--host States--is the most important way \nthat we will get more producing States, that we will get more host \nStates, that we will have more American energy. So that is what this is \nall about.\n  My amendment, again, will be amendment No. 80. I look forward to a \nvote on the Senate floor soon. It is simple and straightforward. It \ndoes several important things. First, it would expedite Outer \nContinental Shelf lease sales and move forward with a positive OCS \nlease plan. By expediting leasing and opening up more areas to \nproduction, we can create jobs and further enhance and build our \nmanufacturing renaissance and our American energy revolution.\n  In recognizing concerns for production in the North Atlantic Planning \nArea as well as the North Aleutian Planning Area in Alaska, this \nproposal excludes lease sales in those particular regions. Secondly, \nthe bill would increase revenue sharing for Gulf States, and it would \nestablish revenue sharing for brand new production in other areas, such \nas Alaska and the east coast.\n  Again, revenue sharing is fair, and it is the most powerful, positive \nthing we can do to get more States into the act in a positive way of \nproducing American energy, helping our economy, and helping our energy \nindependence. So that would provide revenue sharing for the first time \nfor the Atlantic States of Virginia, North Carolina, and South \nCarolina. It would provide that revenue sharing for the first time for \nnew production we would be authorizing for Alaska--a clear net gain for \nNorth Carolina, Virginia, South Carolina, and Alaska.\n  This is critical. I know my colleagues from those States are all very \nsupportive of that offshore energy activity. So again, for Alaska, for \nthe first time, Alaska would enjoy revenue sharing with the potential \nfor significant dollars from offshore production going to Alaska. Now, \none might ask: What about the Federal revenue impact? What about the \nfiscal impact? This amendment is fully offset in terms of the Federal \nTreasury. It is fully offset with revenue from two sources: No. 1, \nexpedited and increased lease sales in our OCS that will produce more \nFederal revenue, and No. 2, trimming our Federal workforce by \nattrition, a policy laid out by the Simpson-Bowles Commission--\nbipartisan, straightforward, and exactly what we need to do in a \nfiscally responsible way.\n  Now, on that piece, the legislation would not fire anyone. It would \nsimply reduce the Federal workforce through attrition. For every three \nFederal workers who retire, only one could be hired. That is exactly \nwhat Simpson-Bowles proposed. Two exemptions exist to this rule that \ncould be used by the President in a state of war or extraordinary \nemergency--again, exactly the Simpson-Bowles proposal.\n  This amendment is very important in the area of energy and to be fair \nto producing States and to be a powerful incentive--the single most \npowerful incentive possible to get more producing States, more American \nproduction into the act. That is vital for our energy independence. It \nis also vital for our economy. This amendment, No. 80, would be a big, \npositive boost over time for our economy.\n  As I said, right now we would be in a recession still were it not for \nthose American energy jobs. That energy renaissance has led the way in \nour economy. But for those jobs, we would still be in a recession. This \ncan make a good thing better. This can provide more incentives to go \nfurther in a powerful, responsible way. It will also be a responsible \nway on the environment.\n  Let me note that in Louisiana, you know what we do with our revenue \nsharing? We spend all of it on environmental concerns, mostly coastal \nrestoration. We are losing our coastline. We are losing a football \nfield of Louisiana costal area every 38 minutes--every 38 minutes, 24 \nhours a day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks a year. That is the biggest \nenvironmental issue we have by far. That is what this money goes to in \nLouisiana--proper environmental stewardship.\n  So with that, I urge bipartisan support of this important amendment. \nI look forward to formally calling it up soon, after we vote on the \npending amendments early this afternoon. I look forward to a vote on \nthis on the Senate floor--hopefully, a strong bipartisan vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 58\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, yesterday I offered an amendment to the \nKeystone XL bill which is really straightforward and will not affect \nthe underlying legislation. I do think it has the potential to get \nstrong bipartisan support. That is because my amendment states a simple \nset of facts--that climate change is real and humans are contributing \nto it.\n  This is an opportunity for people on either side of the Keystone \ndebate to agree on something; that is, the facts. It will inform, I \nthink, what happens next in energy policy. As intense as this debate \nover this pipeline is, the real question in front of us, after we \ndispose of this legislation and it goes to the President's desk for a \ncertain veto, is that then we have to contend with our national energy \npolicy.\n  We need to agree on the set of facts that everyone outside of this \nCongress agrees on. These claims require evidence, and my amendment \nprovides those pieces of evidence. It cites the final supplemental \nenvironmental impact statement prepared for the Keystone Pipeline by \nthe State Department, which says that ``human activities . . . have \nadded to the greenhouse gas accumulation and exacerbated the greenhouse \n. . . effect, resulting in greater amounts of heat being trapped in the \natmosphere.''\n  Now, this is not controversial. It also states: ``These climate \nchange shifts can . . . affect other processes and spark changes that \ncascade through natural systems to affect ecosystems, societies, and \nhuman health.'' Only in the halls of Congress is this a controversial \npiece of legislation.\n  This impact statement, in turn, cites the work of thousands of \nscientists who have contributed to reports by the IPCC, the National \nResearch Council, and the U.S. Global Change Research Program. These \nindependent factfinding bodies have conducted decades of research on \nquestions related to climate change. They have been subject to intense \nscrutiny both internally and externally. Their work has held up to \nrepeated concerns about impartiality and accuracy.\n  This scrutiny helps. It has forced these organizations to improve \ntheir methodology and be increasingly deliberate as they develop their \nfindings and present the facts and only the facts. Human-caused climate \nchange is accepted by Fortune 500 companies, school teachers, religious \ngroups, and the U.S. Department of Defense. It is accepted by nurses \nand doctors, professional sports leagues, the majority of other \ncountries, more than 97 percent of scientists, and many of my \ncolleagues in the House and Senate.\n  For most people, climate change existing is not a controversial \nissue. Certainly, the Keystone Pipeline is a controversial issue. Once \nwe together set the premise of climate change facts, there is plenty to \nargue about. What approach ought we take with respect to\n\n[[Page S318]]\n\nsolving this problem? Is a carbon tax the right approach? Is the \nPresident's clean powerplant the right approach? Ought we to wait for \nor accelerate our actions with respect to international coalitions and \nagreements?\n  Those are legitimate debates to have. But we have to agree on the \nfacts. That is why a vote on my amendment is so important. The Senate \nhas before it a bill to approve a pipeline and an environmental impact \nstatement touted by Keystone supporters as a comprehensive, accurate \ndocument that impartially assesses the environmental impacts of the \npipeline. Within that impact statement is a comprehensive review and an \nacknowledgment of the reality of the facts of climate change.\n  Many of my colleagues who support Keystone might be the same ones who \nquestion the reality of climate change, but I want to try to create a \npolitical space where one can be for Keystone XL and still want action \non the climate. Now, I think Keystone XL is the wrong direction to move \nin. I think it is absolutely doubling down on fossil fuel energy and \nthe tar sands oil. So I will be voting against Keystone.\n  But I understand there are people of good faith and plenty of \nknowledge who are going to be supporting the pipeline. What we need to \ndo after this legislation is disposed of--and it will be relatively \nquickly--is agree on a set of facts and move forward with intelligent, \nbipartisan climate policy.\n  Last week, we learned that 2014 was the hottest year on record \naccording to two separate studies by our Nation's brightest scientists \nat NASA and NOAA. That means that the 10 hottest years on record have \nall occurred since the year 2000. A warmer planet means big changes in \nweather patterns, rising sea levels, and increases in extreme weather \nevents.\n  Sea level has been rising more than twice as fast since 1990 as it \ndid over the previous century, nearly doubling the likelihood of storm \nsurges such as the one we experienced during Hurricane Sandy. Over the \nyears, the issue of climate change has, unfortunately, become a \npartisan issue. It did not used to be that way. It does not need to be \nthat way going forward.\n  We may not agree on the solutions, on the path forward or even on \nsome of the details, but I do believe it is time for us to begin to \nagree on a basic set of facts. The purpose of my amendment is to take a \nstep back, to take a deep breath on a very contentious issue, and to \ngive the Senate an opportunity to come together and state with no value \njudgment that we accept the work of thousands of the world's brightest \nand most dedicated scientists, including those working at U.S. agencies \nand for U.S. companies; that we accept the reality our farmers, our \nfisherman, and our families see with the every passing season.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this amendment. It is an \nopportunity to restate a set of facts with which a majority of \nAmericans already agree. It makes no presumptions about where we go \nfrom here.\n  I am hopeful that we will have a big bipartisan vote this afternoon \non this amendment. I think there is an opportunity for common ground.\n  Obviously, Keystone XL is dividing not just this Congress but the \nDemocratic conference, so I understand that. But agreeing on the set of \nfacts related to climate change is a good predicate for all of us \nmoving forward.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I rise today to speak on behalf of my \namendment to the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline bill. I thank Senators \nBennet, Carper, Leahy, Menendez, Warren, and Whitehouse for \ncosponsoring this amendment.\n  My amendment is extremely simple. It is about 1\\1/2\\ pages, and I \nthink it is easily understood by anyone who reads it. It says:\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that Congress is in agreement \n     with the opinion of virtually the entire worldwide scientific \n     community that--\n       (1) climate change is real;\n       (2) climate change is caused by human activities;\n       (3) climate change has already caused devastating problems \n     in the United States and around the world;\n       (4) a brief window of opportunity exists before the United \n     States and the entire planet suffer irreparable harm; and\n       (5) it is imperative that the United States transform its \n     energy system away from fossil fuels and toward energy \n     efficiency and sustainable energy as rapidly as possible.\n\n  That is it. That is the entire amendment.\n  What this amendment does is simply ask the Members of the Senate \nwhether they agree with the overwhelming majority of scientists who \nhave told us over and over and over again that climate change is real, \nthat climate change is caused by human activity, including the emission \nof carbon, that climate change is already causing devastating problems \nin the United States and around the world, and that if we are going to \nleave our children and our grandchildren a planet that is habitable, we \nmust transform our energy system away from fossil fuels.\n  Progressives, conservatives, and people in between have many \ndisagreements on issues--and that is called democracy. There is nothing \nto be ashamed about that; that is the democratic process. We all have \ndifferences of opinion. But what is not a good thing is when we make \npublic policy in contradiction to what the scientific community tells \nus. That is not a good thing.\n  When we look at medical issues such as cancer or heart disease, what \nwe do is look at the scientific communities and medical doctors for \ntheir opinions as to how we should proceed.\n  When we look at infrastructure issues, the issues of roads and \nbridges, we look at engineers for their opinion as to how we should \nproceed.\n  When we look at education and try to understand how best kids can \nbest learn, we look at educators and those people who know most about \neducation for advice as to how we should proceed.\n  In terms of the issue of climate change, the process should not be \nany different. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, \nis the leading scientific body that deals with the issue of climate \nchange. I will very briefly quote what the IPCC said last fall:\n\n       Warming of the climate system is unequivocal as is now \n     evident from observations of increases in global average air \n     and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice \n     and rising global average sea level.\n\n  More than 97 percent of the scientific community in the United States \nand across the globe agrees with these findings, including the American \nChemical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of \nScience, the American Meteorological Society, and the American \nGeophysical Union, to name just a few.\n  In fact, at least 37 American scientific organizations, 135 \ninternational scientific organizations and national academies of \nscience, and 21 medical associations, all agree that climate change is \nreal and is significantly caused by human activities.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the names of 37 American scientific organizations, 135 \ninternational scientific organizations and national academies, and 21 \nmedical associations which all have gone on record as stating that \nclimate change is real and is significantly caused by human activity.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Virtually every major scientific organization in this \n     country and throughout the world have said that climate \n     change is real, climate change is caused by carbon emissions \n     and human activity, and that climate change is already \n     causing devastating problems in the United States of America \n     and around the world.\n       This list includes at least: 37 American scientific \n     organizations, 135 international scientific organizations, 21 \n     medical associations, 4 religious organizations.\n\n\n                  37 American scientific organizations\n\n       American Anthropological Association, American Association \n     for the Advancement of Science, American Association of \n     Geographers, American Association of State Climatologists, \n     American Astronomical Society, American Chemical

I know that recently a number of my colleagues have made \nthe point that they are not scientists and they cannot formulate an \nopinion on this subject. Well, let me be clear: I am not a scientist. I \nhad a lot of problems with physics when I was in college. I am not a \nscientist.\n  But these are scientists. These are 37 American scientific \norganizations and 135 international scientific organizations. These are \nscientists who tell us that climate change is real, it is caused by \nhuman activity, and that it is imperative we transform our energy \nsystem away from fossil fuel.\n  I will read an excerpt from a letter sent to the Senate in 2009 \nsigned by virtually every major scientific organization in this \ncountry:\n\n       Observations throughout the world make it clear that \n     climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research \n     demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human \n     activities are the primary driver. These conclusions are \n     based on multiple independent lines of evidence, and contrary \n     assertions are inconsistent with an objective assessment of \n     the vast body of peer reviewed science. Moreover, there is \n     strong evidence that ongoing climate change will have broad \n     impacts on society, including the global economy and on the \n     environment. For the United States, climate change impacts \n     include sea level rise for coastal states, greater threats of \n     extreme weather events, and increase risk of regional water \n     scarcity, urban heat waves, western wildfires, and a \n     disturbance of biological systems throughout the country. The \n     severity of climate change impacts is expected to increase \n     substantially in the coming decades.\n\n  Once again, I am not a scientist, but that is what the scientific \ncommunity overwhelmingly in the United States and around the world is \nsaying. It is imperative the Senate goes on record in saying we agree \nwith science.\n  Climate change is one of the great threats facing our country and the \nentire planet. It has the capability of causing severe harm to our \neconomy, to our food supply, to access to water, and to national \nsecurity.\n  According to NASA and NOAA, 2014 was the warmest year ever recorded. \nThe most recent decade was the Nation's warmest on record. Across the \nglobe, the 10 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1997. We \nknow that the Earth's climate is warming and doing so quickly.\n\n[[Page S320]]\n\n  According to NOAA, October, August, June, and May were the hottest \nOctober, August, June, and May months ever recorded.\n  The consequences of this rapid and dramatic rise in global \ntemperatures will have a profound impact on billions of people \nthroughout the world. What we can expect are more severe weather \ndisturbances, more flooding, more heat waves, more droughts, more \nforest fires, and saltwater inundation of water supplies and \nagricultural land.\n  As the New York Times reported in August, droughts in the Western and \nSouthwestern United States appear to be intensifying as a result of \nclimate change:\n\n       Over the past decade, droughts in some regions have rivaled \n     the epic dry spells of the 1930s and 1950s . . . The country \n     is in the midst of one of its most sustained periods of \n     increasing drought on record.\n\n  China's heat wave 1\\1/2\\ years ago was the worst in at least 140 \nyears. As ClimateWire reported in November, the Sao Paulo region in \nBrazil is suffering from its worst drought in 80 years. In the United \nStates, fire suppression costs have increased from roughly $1 billion \nannually in the mid-1990s to an average of more than $3 billion in the \npast 5 years.\n  Our oceans are not only getting warmer, they are also becoming more \nacidic, threatening fish, coral reefs, and other sea life. As a study \npublished in the journal Science reported, carbon dioxide emissions in \nthe atmosphere are driving a rate of change in ocean acidity that is \nalready thought to be faster than any time in the past 50 million \nyears. The authors warned that we may be ``entering an unknown \nterritory of marine ecosystem change.''\n  Extreme storms, weather disturbances, are also becoming more common \nand more intense with extraordinary impacts. When Typhoon Haiyan struck \nthe Philippines over 1 year ago, it displaced more than 4.1 million \npeople, killed thousands, and cost that country at least $15 million in \ndamages.\n  The situation clearly is bad today in the United States and around \nthe world, but--according to the scientific community--if we do not get \nour act together, if we do not cut carbon emissions, it will only get \nworse in years to come.\n  The IPCC estimates--and I hope people listen to this--that without \nany additional efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions--in other \nwords, if we continue to go along our merry old way of dependency on \nfossil fuels--``warming is more likely than not'' to exceed 4 degrees \nCelsius, which is 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit, by the end of the century.\n  Let me repeat that extraordinary observation. If we continue along \nour present course, ``warming is more likely than not'' to exceed 7.2 \ndegrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century.\n  Similarly, just last year the White House released the National \nClimate Assessment warning that global warming could exceed 10 degrees \nFahrenheit in the United States by the end of this century. Take a deep \nbreath and imagine what it will mean to this country--the huge impact \non every aspect of our life, on our economy, on agriculture, on \nhealth--if the temperature of the United States rises, as some are \npredicting, by 10 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. It is \nalmost unthinkable. Yet that is what the scientific community is \ntelling us.\n  The World Bank is by no means a radical institution. It is a very \nconservative institution. It tells us that temperature increases by \neven just 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit would bring about unprecedented heat \nwaves, severe drought, and major floods in many regions, with serious \nimpacts on human systems, ecosystems, and associated services.\n  The IPCC reports that sea levels are likely to rise by another 10 to \n32 inches by the end of this century. As the New York Times reported, a \nsea level rise of less than 4 feet--less than 4 feet--would inundate \nland on which some 3.7 million Americans live today. We are talking \nabout Miami, New Orleans, New York City, and Boston all being highly \nvulnerable to rising sea levels. Similarly, of course, this problem \nwill impact people all over the world.\n  According to the IPCC:\n\n       Many small island nations are only a few meters above \n     present sea level. These states may face serious threat of \n     permanent inundation from sea-level rise. Among the most \n     vulnerable of these island states are the Marshall Islands, \n     Kiribati, Tuvalu, Tonga, the Federated States of Micronesia, \n     and the Cook Islands.\n\n  The Army Corps of Engineers has predicted that the entire village of \nNewtok, AK, could be underwater by 2017 and that more than 180 \nadditional Native Alaskan villages are at risk. Parts of Alaska--one of \nour great and beautiful States--are already vanishing as a result of \nclimate change.\n  The evidence is overwhelming, and it is no longer good enough for \npeople to say: I am not a scientist; I don't know. We may not be \nscientists, but we can read and we can listen to what the overwhelming \nmajority of scientists are telling us. That is our job--to listen to \nthe experts who know something about this issue.\n  As we debate the Keystone Pipeline, what disturbs me very much is \nthat in the face of this overwhelming evidence from the scientific \ncommunity, in the face of deep concerns about climate change all over \nthe world, what is the Senate going to be doing in the next week or two \nas part of the Keystone Pipeline? Are we going to be voting to impose a \ntax on carbon so we can break our dependence on fossil fuel? Is that \nwhat we are going to be voting on? No, I don't think so. Are we going \nto be voting to pass legislation that moves us aggressively toward \nenergy efficiency and weatherization and such sustainable energies as \nwind, solar, and geothermal? Is that what we are going to be voting on \nas we listen to the scientific community? No, I don't think so. Are we \ngoing to be passing a bill investing in research and development so \nthat we can make our transportation system more energy efficient? Is \nthat what we are going to be voting on? No, we are not. In fact, what \nwe are going to be voting on is a bill that will allow for an increase \nin the production and transportation of some of the dirtiest oil on \nthis planet. That is what we are going to be voting on. What we are \nvoting on is a proposal that moves us in exactly the opposite direction \nfrom what the scientific community wants us to do.\n  Let me conclude by saying this: Honest people can and do have \ndisagreements on many issues, but it is not a good thing for the United \nStates to reject what the scientists and the experts are telling us. \nThat is not a good thing. So I hope very much that on the amendment I \nhave brought forth--which says nothing more than to listen to the \nscientists on this important issue; do not reject science--that we can \nget widespread bipartisan support for the amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 33\n\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, excessive litigation under the Endangered \nSpecies Act has become an obstacle to the act itself and the good it \npromises to do for the American people.\n  According to the Department of Justice, more than 500 Endangered \nSpecies Act-related lawsuits have been filed or opened against the \nFederal Government since 2009. As a result, Federal agencies have to \nspend their time, their energy, and taxpayer-funded resources fighting \nlawsuits instead of protecting endangered species.\n  One of the primary reasons for this excessive litigation is the \npotential for massive awards of attorney's fees under section 11(g)4 of \nthe Endangered Species Act. These awards can be granted regardless of \nwhether the parties seeking the attorney's fee award prevails, and \nthere is no limit on the hourly fee that can be collected. These \nattorney's fees can reach upward of $700 per hour. In one case \ninvolving a series of lawsuits related to the operation of \nhydroelectric power facilities in the Northwestern United States, \nattorney's fees were awarded in an amount totaling nearly $2 million--\nin one case lasting just a few years. Such lofty levels of compensation \nwould be high even in a private law firm setting, even in a big city, \nbut they are completely indefensible when one considers they are paid \nfor by American taxpayers, often to well-funded activist organizations.\n  Excessive awards of attorney's fees also create perverse incentives \nfor cottage industries of lawyers to sue the Federal Government in \norder to advance specific policies--policies that cannot be achieved \nthrough the legislative process and are therefore sought\n\n[[Page S321]]\n\nout by these very same lawyers in the courts. This is what many call a \nsue-and-settle strategy: Sue the Federal Government and then settle \nwith the Federal Government. Achieve what you want to achieve and then \nget paid by the court without limit. Sue-and-settle is the dishonest, \ndistorted practice of suing the Federal Government not to achieve a \njudicial outcome in court but to resolve the suit in a settlement with \nterms that advance narrow political ends, narrow political goals. The \nrecent decision by the Fish and Wildlife Service to grant Gunnison \nsage-grouse protected status under the Endangered Species Act is the \nresult of this precise sue-and-settle strategy.\n  Congress must put an end to policymaking by litigation, and it must \ndo so by removing the incentives to engage in this kind of litigation. \nMy amendment would do just that by bringing a citizen's suit provision \nof the Endangered Species Act into harmony with a similar provision of \nthe Equal Access to Justice Act. The Equal Access to Justice Act limits \nawards for attorney's fees to $125 per hour and allows those awards to \nbe granted only to prevailing parties. Any departure from this limit \nhas to be approved by the judge based on some unique circumstance in \nthat case. If such terms are acceptable for nearly every other type of \nlawsuit against the Federal Government, certainly they should be \nacceptable as applied to the Endangered Species Act. This simple fix \nwould deter the frivolous lawsuits that so often end up in closed-door \nsettlements with Federal agencies.\n  There is a lot of work to do to reform the implementation of the \nEndangered Species Act. This amendment is just one of many reforms I am \ndeveloping with my colleagues in the Senate and our counterparts in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I ask for support on this amendment. Again, this is something that \njust brings into harmony section 11(g)4 of the Endangered Species Act \nwith requirements that are already in existence, already on the books \nin connection with the Equal Access to Justice Act. We need those same \nlimitations in this Endangered Species Act that already exist in the \nEqual Access to Justice Act. I ask all my colleagues to support this \namendment and to help us resolve this problem that has crept into \nFederal law based on an inequity and imbalance in these two statutory \nregimes.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to proceed \nas in morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Before I begin my comments, let me commend the Presiding \nOfficer on her excellent presentation last night. The Presiding Officer \ndid an extraordinary job and made all of us very proud.\n\n\n                      Forty Hours is Full Time Act\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, 2 weeks ago Senator Joe Donnelly and I \nreintroduced bipartisan legislation that we call the Forty Hours is \nFull Time Act. It would correct a serious flaw in the Affordable Care \nAct that threatens the hours and pay of part-time workers all across \nAmerica. Our bill would change the definition of ``full-time'' work \nunder ObamaCare from 30 hours a week to the standard 40 hours a week, a \ncommonsense threshold that has always been the standard for full-time \nwork. In fact, under the Fair Labor Standards Act, it is 40 hours a \nweek that defines ``full time,'' after which workers are eligible in \nmany cases for overtime.\n  Information I received from the Home Care & Hospice Alliance of Maine \ndemonstrates that this illogical definition of ``full-time'' work could \nresult in hundreds of home health care workers losing their jobs and \n1,000 seniors losing access to home care services in the State of Maine \nalone.\n  The impact would be just as severe outside of Maine, a point driven \nhome by a letter I recently received from the National Association for \nHome Care & Hospice, an organization that represents caregivers who \nprovide in-home health and hospice services to chronically ill, \ndisabled, and dying Americans. The association just conducted a survey \nof its members that reveals the devastating impact this definition will \nhave on home care and hospice services around the country if Congress \ndoes not act to change it. Let me share with my colleagues just a few \nof the key findings of this survey.\n  Nationally, four out of five home care and hospice providers are \nunable to provide health benefits to their employees because they rely \non government programs such as Medicaid, with its low reimbursement \nlevels, and because they provide services to people with limited \nincomes.\n  So it is not as if they can simply boost their rates. In many cases \ntheir rates are set by Medicaid and at a very low level. In other cases \nthey are serving people with limited incomes who simply cannot afford \nmore expensive home care.\n  Another finding: Three out of four providers will have to cut the \nhours of their caregivers. That means those caregivers who are engaged \nin such compassionate and skilled work will have smaller paychecks on \nwhich to live.\n  Nine out of ten providers expect patients to lose access to home care \nin their communities.\n  One in five providers of home care and hospice services will actually \nhave to close their doors. Think of the impact closing one in five home \ncare and hospice agencies would have on America's seniors and our \ndisabled citizens. In my view, taking action to spare this vulnerable \npopulation would, by itself, justify restoring the threshold for full-\ntime work to the standard 40 hours a week.\n  But this is not the only reason to do so. Reforming the law would \nalso help protect the caregivers who provide the services as well as \ntheir patients, and ironically it would protect taxpayers as well. Data \nfrom Maine's Medicaid Program shows that home care services are \nextremely cost-effective compared to alternatives. If access to these \nservices is restricted because of the application of the 30-hour rule, \nthose in need of these services will be forced into costlier forms of \ncare paid for by Medicaid and Medicare, such as hospitals and nursing \nhomes, driving up both Federal and State costs. In addition, the \npatients now served by home health care providers would no longer be \nable to receive vital care in the comfort, privacy, and security of \ntheir own homes.\n  So whether we look at it from the perspective of the patients served \nor the caregivers employed or the taxpayers who pay for the Medicare \nand Medicaid Programs, this hurts all three groups. Of course, there is \nobviously a lot of overlap among those groups.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, immediately \nfollowing my remarks, an excellent letter from the National Association \nfor Home Care & Hospice which elaborates on the problems created by \nthis definition under ObamaCare.\n  Of course, the justification for using the standard definition of \nfull-time work extends far beyond the field of home care services to \nthe full breadth of our economy. Raising the threshold for full-time \nwork to 40 hours a week is necessary not only to protect the paychecks \nof workers employed by private sector businesses, such as restaurants \nand hotel staff, but also to protect those who work in the public \nsector, such as substitute teachers, ed techs, and schoolbus drivers, \nto name just a few.\n  The 30-hour rule will not only harm school staff who want and need \nmore work, but it will also hurt our students by causing unnecessary \ndisruption in the classroom. It does not make sense to have to limit \nsubstitute teachers to 29 hours a week because of the definition of \n``full-time'' work under ObamaCare. That means there will be a \nrevolving door of substitutes in our classrooms and lower paychecks \nonce again for those substitute teachers.\n  I have also heard of a school district that has been forced to cut \nfield trips and transportation to athletic events and employees who \nused to work more than 30 hours total in two jobs who have been forced \nto give up one of their\n\n[[Page S322]]\n\njobs, thus hurting their financial security.\n  Several Maine municipalities have described to me the impact on their \nworkers, particularly volunteer and oncall firefighters, emergency \nmedical technicians, and employees of the parks and recreation and \npublic works departments.\n  Although the IRS adopted regulations last year in an attempt to \nexclude volunteer firefighters from the calculation of the employer \nmandate, these regulations do not give our towns and cities the level \nof protection provided by the Forty Hours is Full Time Act.\n  In most Maine communities, the fire department is staffed by \nvolunteers and oncall firefighters who typically have health care \ncoverage through their regular day jobs. In fact, in Maine, oncall \nfirefighters for our smaller communities often serve as full-time \nfirefighters--receiving full health care benefits--in a neighboring \ncommunity. They help the smaller towns by serving as on-call \nfirefighters. Unfortunately, under ObamaCare it doesn't matter that \nthese on-call firefighters already have health care coverage; the towns \nthat employ them for more than 30 hours a week may still face the \n$2,000 penalty per on-call firefighter for doing so. This makes no \nsense whatsoever.\n\n  For example, one town in southern Maine has told me that the 30-hour \nrule will require it to offer health care coverage to more than a dozen \nvolunteer and on-call firefighters who do not qualify for coverage from \nthe town today. The cost of doing so will drive up that town's health \ncare budget by 20 percent at a time when its budget is already \nstretched to the breaking point.\n  Another Maine community has employees who work part time but year-\nround performing various tasks, including plowing and salting the roads \nin the winter. These employees typically work 30 to 34 hours a week, \nand they do not qualify for health benefits under the town's plan. \nSince the town cannot afford to add them to its health care plan, it \nsimply will have no choice but to cut their hours back to 29 hours a \nweek. The town doesn't want to do that. The workers don't want to have \ntheir hours cut. As anyone who has lived in Maine or any Northern State \ncan tell you, snowstorms do not keep to a schedule. Mother Nature seems \nnot to have heard about the 30-hour workweek under ObamaCare. So it \nwill be a challenge for this town to keep its roads safe, clear, and \npassable in the winter while making sure its part-time employees don't \nexceed 29 hours a week. So, once again, what is the result? Reduced \nhours, a smaller paycheck for part-time workers, and more costs for the \ntown and more disruption in the services it provides.\n  Winters are long in Maine and summers are short. Towns have to manage \ntheir workers' schedules to match the season, but the 30-hour rule will \nmake it very difficult for them to do so.\n  For example, one town in central Maine told me that a number of its \nemployees work full time in its parks and recreations department in the \nsummer, and then they work part time in the winter. Because of the 30-\nhour rule, however, this town won't be able to stagger the schedules of \nthese employees in the winter the way it used to and will have to lay \nthem off instead and then, adding insult to injury, pay them \nunemployment during the layoff period. So here we have a case where the \nlaw is actually going to force the town to lay off part-time employees \nwho want to work. This makes no sense.\n  Part-time workers who are hired to help with snow removal are often \nshifted to other departments in the spring and summer months to assist \nfull-time employees or to take their place when they are on vacation. \nBut the 30-hour rule once again takes away the flexibility towns need \nto do this.\n  For example, one town in northern Maine has told me that the part-\ntime workers it has relied upon to help cover vacation time for its \nfirefighters in the summer months will have to be cut back to 29 hours \na week because the town cannot afford to pay the $2,000 penalty it will \nface for each employee if they work their usual hours. Raising the \nthreshold for full-time work to 40 hours a week would restore the \nflexibility this town needs to manage its workforce, give these part-\ntime workers more hours and the bigger paychecks they need, and help \nfull-time firefighters get a break after a long, tough winter.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to proceed \nfor 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). Without objection, it is so \nordered\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Today I have described just some of the damage the 30-hour rule is \ndoing to municipal employees, to providers of home health care and \nhospice services, and to those who work in our school systems. \nNationwide, 100 school systems have had to scale back the hours of \ntheir workers already. Employees in all industries--for-profit and non-\nprofit, private sector and public sector--are similarly affected.\n  Regardless of the varying views of Senators in this Chamber on the \nAffordable Care Act, surely we ought to be able to agree to fix this \nproblem in the law that is hurting workers' paychecks and creating \nchaos for employers. Senator Donnelly has introduced bipartisan \nlegislation with Senator Joe Manchin and Senator Lisa Murkowski that \nwould do just that. It is the Forty Hours is Full Time Act, and I urge \nall of my colleagues to join us in supporting it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                      For Home Care & Hospice,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 6, 2014.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Joe Donnelly,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Collins and Donnelly: I am writing to offer \n     our support for the ``Forty Hours Is Full Time Act.'' The \n     National Association for Home Care & Hospice (NAHC) is the \n     leading association representing the interests of the home \n     care and hospice community since 1982.\n       Currently the provision in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) \n     that imposes penalties on employers with more than 50 full-\n     time equivalent employees for not providing health insurance \n     for their ``full time'' workers defines an employee working \n     just 30 hours a week as full time. This definition of full \n     time is entirely out-of-keeping with standard employment \n     practices and could cause irreparable harm to many home care \n     agencies and the patients they serve.\n       The great majority of the estimated 25,000 home care \n     agencies are small businesses under the standards of the \n     Small Business Administration, but most are considered \n     ``large employers'' subject to the employer mandate under the \n     ACA because of the number of workers they employ. All told, \n     there are over 2 million persons employed in home care. These \n     home care agencies are innovative job creators that provide \n     much needed compassionate, high quality care to elderly and \n     disabled individuals in their homes and communities.\n       The majority of personal care home care workers do not \n     receive employee health insurance because home care agencies \n     have three problems that are fairly unique: reliance on \n     government programs such as Medicaid where payment rates as \n     low as $11 an hour won't cover the increased costs of \n     providing health insurance; consumers of private pay home \n     care who are often elderly and disabled with fixed, low \n     incomes; and a home care workforce with widely varying work \n     hours primarily to accommodate the needs of their infirm \n     clientele.\n       Home care agencies that are unable to provide health \n     insurance or absorb the ACA penalties will have to restrict \n     their employees to no more than 29 hours per week to ensure \n     their workers are considered part-time under the ACA. A \n     survey that NAHC concluded in December 2014 showed that the \n     employer mandate would weaken patient access to care, reduce \n     wages and working hours of home care staff, and require home \n     care companies to restructure their operations to rely on \n     part-time caregivers. Home care companies that primarily \n     provide Medicaid services and those that service private pay \n     personal care clients were most susceptible to these adverse \n     outcomes as Medicaid funding is already stretched and seniors \n     on limited incomes are unable to spend more on home care.\n       Our survey showed:\n       1. 82.54% of home care and hospice companies do not provide \n     health insurance to all of their employees because of \n     reliance on government program payments and service to \n     individuals with limited incomes\n       2. 46.2% of those companies face a financial penalty under \n     the employer mandate ranging as high as $4.5 million\n       3. 73.3% of the companies would reduce the working hours of \n     employees to under 30 per week in order to avoid the cost of \n     health insurance or financial penalties that they cannot \n     afford\n       4. 22.16% of the businesses expect to close because of the \n     financial penalties\n\n[[Page S323]]\n\n       5. 83.2% of the companies expect that access to home care \n     in their community would be reduced with fewer providers of \n     care, more restrictive patient admission criteria to fit a \n     part-time workforce, and restrictions on service areas.\n       6. 88.46% expect that access to Medicaid home care will no \n     longer be sufficient to meet client's needs\n       Home care agencies are an essential part of the network of \n     services that our growing population of elderly and persons \n     with disabilities rely on. The last thing we need is an \n     obstacle to helping them grow and create much needed jobs. \n     Simple common sense solutions are often the best answers to \n     complex problems. As far as most people are concerned 40 \n     hours a week equates with full time employment.\n       Thank you for offering this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Val J. Halamandaris,\n\n                                   President, National Association\n     for Home Care & Hospice.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                December 19, 2014.\n     Hon. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of AASA: The School \n     Superintendents Association, the Association of Educational \n     Service Agencies, the National Rural Education Association \n     and the National Rural Education Advocacy Coalition, I write \n     to express our support for the Forty Hours is Full Time Act. \n     Collectively, we represent public school superintendents, \n     educational service agency administrators and school system \n     leaders across the country, as well as our nation's rural \n     schools and communities. We have followed closely the \n     Affordable Care Act and stand ready to implement the law, and \n     see your proposed legislation as one way to alleviate an \n     unnecessarily burdensome regulation.\n       The Forty House is Full Time Act would change the \n     definition of 'full time' in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to \n     40 hours per week and the number of hours counted toward a \n     'full time equivalent' employee to 174 hours per month. The \n     current ACA arbitrarily sets the bar for a full work week to \n     30 hours. This is inconsistent with how most Americans think: \n     full-time is a 40 hour work week. The current definition \n     causes confusion among employers who struggle to understand \n     and comply with the new requirements, especially ones that \n     are in conflict with long-standing practices built on the \n     long-standing 40-hour work week premise.\n       We welcome the opportunity to ensure our employees have a \n     positive work environment and we remain committed to \n     providing a robust set of work benefits. We are concerned \n     that the ACA, as currently written, puts additional, undue \n     burden on school systems across the nation, many of whom will \n     struggle to staff their schools to meet their educational \n     mission while meeting the strict 30-hour regulation.\n       We applaud your continued leadership on this issue and look \n     forward to seeing the Forty Hours is Full Time Act move \n     forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Noelle M. Ellerson,\n          AASA, The School Superintendents Association, Associate \n      Executive Director, Policy & Advocacy, AESA, NREA and NREAC \n                                              Legislative Liaison.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise today to propose three \nimportant amendments to S. 1, the Keystone XL Pipeline Act.\n  First of all, I want to make it very clear that I strongly oppose the \nKeystone XL Pipeline plan. I have serious concern about the effects \nthis project would have on our health and safety; I have serious \nconcerns about the environmental impact; and I am skeptical of the \nreal, permanent jobs it could create.\n  This project has many risks and very few advantages, and I will be \nvoting against it. But if this legislation does pass the Senate, we \nshould at least try to make it a better bill. There is no excuse why we \ncannot turn the Keystone XL Pipeline Act into an opportunity to protect \nour clean drinking water and ensure that polluters have to pay to clean \nup their own messes.\n  First, I have offered amendment No. 48, which would remove the \nHalliburton loophole from the Safe Drinking Water Act and finally \nrequire gas storage and gas drilling companies to comply with our clean \nwater laws. Every other industry has to do it. Our farmers have to do \nit. Construction companies have to do it. Yet our gas companies have \nbeen exempt for years.\n  It should give my colleagues pause that fracking companies are \nallowed to ignore our clean water laws when they pump chemicals deep \ninto the ground. In this country, when we turn on the tap for a glass \nof water, we need to know that our drinking water is safe. So let's be \nfair and hold the gas industry to the same environmental and public \nhealth standards as everyone else.\n  Second, I worked with Senator Menendez on amendment No. 65, which \nwould make oil companies financially responsible for the damages they \ncause when they spill on our land and leak into our waterways. Under \ncurrent law, when an onshore oilspill occurs, the company that causes \nthe spill is only liable for $350 million in damages, including cleanup \nand compensation. Yet a major oilspill into a river or lake, such as \nthe one this week in Montana, could easily result in damage well above \nthat arbitrary limit.\n  Hard-working taxpayers should never be stuck paying for an oil \ncompany's mess, and local property and businesses should not have to \nslog through endless litigation just to get the compensation they \ndeserve from a negligent oil company. This amendment would finally \nplace the burden on companies to clean up after themselves.\n  Third, I have proposed amendment No. 76, which would allow our \nhomeowners and business owners whose property has been damaged by \nnatural disaster to use Federal disaster assistance funds to upgrade \ntheir property's energy efficiency. Under current law, the disaster \nassistance can only be used to replace what was lost even if that \nproperty was antiquated and not up to current standards. We need to \nhave much more forward-looking policies that actually make sense.\n  Due to the effects of climate change, we have seen a growing number \nof natural disasters in recent years, from blizzards, to hurricanes, to \nraging fires, to endless droughts. When we pick up the pieces after a \nmajor storm, we want to make sure that when we rebuild, we rebuild in \nthe smartest way possible, and that includes not only protections \nagainst the next disaster but also proactive measures to save energy, \nreduce emissions, and lower costs.\n  As I said, I don't support the construction of the Keystone XL \nPipeline, but if this new Congress is intent on sending this bill to \nthe President, then we need to make sure the bill keeps our drinking \nwater safe, holds companies accountable for their own messes, and \nencourages efficiency in our economy.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. I congratulate the Presiding Officer for sitting in that \nchair.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 18\n\n  I wish to speak about the Fischer amendment which is slated to be \nvoted on at some point. While I respect where my neighbor from Nebraska \nis coming from with this effort, the proposal unfortunately misses the \nmark by a mile.\n  The amendment would set up a new and unprecedented process for \nprotective land designations. It says the Secretary of the Interior or \nAgriculture has to publish in the Federal Register two findings before \nany congressional protections on public lands would go into effect. \nFirst, the Secretary has to find that new, protected land would not \nadversely affect our efforts to administer existing protected land. \nSecond, the Department has to have ``sufficient resources''--whatever \nthat is--to implement plans for existing protected land. While perhaps \ninnocuous sounding, these would be huge changes in how we do business \naround here.\n  Coming from a State that is over a third Federal land, I prefer that \ndrastic reform proposals such as this at least have the benefit of a \ncommittee hearing before we vote on them on the floor. That way, we can \nhear expert testimony as to whether this is a good idea or consider \nways we might be able to improve the measure. But as far as I know, \nthis language hasn't had a hearing in this Congress, or any other \nCongress, for that matter.\n  Proponents of this amendment are going to argue it simply ensures \nthat our land agencies can afford to keep up with the maintenance of \nnew protected lands. Listen, I am the first--and I have been on this \nfloor year after year after year talking about the fiscal condition of \nthis country--to believe we need more fiscal discipline around\n\n[[Page S324]]\n\nhere, but this is not the way we should get it. I am also a huge \nbeliever that we shouldn't be overburdening these agencies, and we \nshouldn't be overregulating through them, either.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment takes a hatchet when the absolute most \nthat is needed, if anything, is a surgical fix. In fact, under the \namendment, the opponents of protected lands could reduce funding for \nour land agencies through the appropriations process and then turn \naround and say the Secretary got a veto of the new proposals because \nsufficient resources aren't available. As one of my friends from \nColorado said in the paper this morning: ``This amendment would be a \none-two punch--first starve conservation agencies of needed funding and \nthen block any new protections.''\n  This amendment is drafted in a way that it leaves huge discretion to \na future Secretary to approve or veto protections that Congress has \nseen fit to create. If the amendment passed, nothing would stop a \nfuture Secretary from finding that every single conservation bill this \nCongress has passed should not take effect, all because he or she \nfailed to publish the vague set of findings laid out in this proposal.\n  Historically, we don't give a member of the executive branch any \ndiscretion as to whether they implement the laws that Congress passes \nand that the President has signed. Yet, this measure would do just \nthat.\n  I think keeping that historical precedent--where the legislative \nbranch makes the laws and the executive branch implements them--is \nimportant. We have heard a lot about that on this floor recently, \nparticularly in a case such as this where we are talking about our \nnational heritage.\n  Coloradans, and all Americans, love their public lands and want to \nsee more done to protect them. Instead, this amendment creates new \nlayers of redtape and makes enacting protective designations even more \ndifficult than it has been.\n  Once again, I wish to say on this floor that I appreciate the effort \nof the Senator from Nebraska and I would be happy to work with her to \naddress some of her concerns. But I would argue that the investments we \nmake in our public lands are worthwhile ones, and I would invite anyone \nin this Chamber to come to Colorado and see what I am speaking about.\n  Protected lands and wide-open spaces are a huge driver of economic \ngrowth all across our country. They help sustain a $600 billion outdoor \nrecreation economy, and a lot of those businesses, for obvious reasons, \nare headquartered in Colorado. On top of the economic benefits, \nwilderness areas, national monuments, and national parks are a \nfundamental part of the fabric of our country and of our country's \nhistory. It is important to preserve these lands for our kids and our \ngrandkids, just as our grandparents preserved them for us. It is worth \ninvesting some money to do that so the next generation and the one \nafter that can experience the greatness that all Americans feel when \nthey first visit the Grand Canyon or Rocky Mountain National Park, or \nChimney Rock National Monument, or the Everglades, or wherever we find \nthe next beautiful or historically significant area that Congress or \nthe President decides to protect.\n  This discussion is actually a timely one because just this past \nDecember we passed a large package of conservation measures into law on \na bipartisan basis. That package included a bill that we worked on in \nColorado called the Hermosa Creek Watershed Protection Act. Let me say \nat the outset that our office may have introduced that bill in \nCongress, but it was really the people I represent in southwest \nColorado who wrote that bill. This legislation grew from the grassroots \nup from day one--Republicans, Democrats, Independents working together \nto cement a long-term plan for their community's future. Not only was \nit bipartisan at the local level, but also in Congress. My friend Scott \nTipton championed the bill on the House side.\n  The Hermosa Creek Watershed deserved to be protected. That is why the \ncommunity came together to keep it just as it is. That was the plan in \nthe community, and that is what our bill finally accomplished at the \nend of the last Congress. However, if we were to pass the amendment in \nfront of us today, all the hard work that went into passing the Hermosa \nbill could be undone by the Secretary of the Interior. Every single \nmeeting that took place in southwest Colorado, every single \nconversation that led to the improvement of this legislation--all of \nthat could be gone in an instant, not because the Congress undoes the \nlaw but because some administrator, using their fiat, is able to undo \nthe law. It is unlikely--I can't say this for sure, but it is unlikely \nthat person is going to have any idea what is in the Hermosa Creek bill \nor any of the other bills we have worked on in the past. That is just \nsimply not how we do business around here, and there is a good reason \nfor that.\n  I am compelled, therefore, to urge other Senators in this body to \nplease oppose the Fischer amendment so we can avoid such a scenario. \nRejecting the amendment will preserve our conservation legacy--a legacy \nthat goes straight back to President Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican, who \nsigned the Antiquities Act into law in 1906. It includes the formal \nestablishment of the national park system almost 100 years ago.\n  This is an extraordinarily beautiful country that we all have the \nprivilege to represent. We ought to encourage conservation efforts, not \nmake them harder to achieve. We ought to build on the legacy of \ngenerations of Americans and generations in this body of Republicans \nand Democrats working together to preserve our natural heritage.\n  I will, therefore, oppose the Fischer amendment when it comes up for \na vote, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would like to share some thoughts about the debate we \nare having on the Keystone Pipeline, climate change, and how the two \nintersect. The concept that climate change is real, I completely \nunderstand and accept. To the point of how much man is contributing, I \ndon't know, but it does make sense that manmade emissions are \ncontributing, and the global warming effect, the greenhouse gas effect, \nseems to me scientifically sound. The problem is how we fix this \nglobally is going to require more than just the United States to be \ninvolved.\n  This deal with China where they have to do nothing for 20 years is \nprobably not exactly where I want to be. The bottom line is that the \nsolutions coming from our Democratic friends about how to deal with \ngreenhouse gas emissions turn our economy upside down and do more \ndamage to the economy and to the welfare of the American people than it \nwill in terms of helping the environment.\n  Our liberal friends give us a false choice. You have to reorganize \nthe economy in a draconian fashion to help the environment. Some people \non my side believe that the whole climate change experience is \nscientifically unsound. I am not a scientist, but I have heard enough \nregarding those who make it their life's work to be convinced that \nmanmade emissions are causing the problem and contribute to the overall \nwarming of the planet.\n  About the Keystone Pipeline, my Democratic friends are making an \nargument that is just absolutely false. The product that Canada will \nproduce from the oil sands is going to be used by us, the world \ncommunity through the gulf port or by China.\n  Those who believe denying the building of the pipeline protects the \nplanet from fossil fuels do not understand what Canada is about to do. \nCanada is going to sell the product to somebody. The question for us \nis, Would we benefit from building a pipeline that will create American \njobs and help us put oil into that pipeline within the United States in \na joint venture with Canada or we will say no to the Canadians and they \nwill go build a pipeline and send it to China?\n  The product is going to be burned. It is going to be used. The only \nquestion for this Congress is, Do we want the pipeline to go West and \nexport the product to China or do we want to\n\n[[Page S325]]\n\nbuild the pipeline so we will have more product from a friend rather \nthan enemies?\n  Dirty oil is oil that comes from people who hate your guts. The \nsulfur content of oil sands product is higher than Mideast sweet crude \nbut no different than the oil we find off the coast of California. The \nactual carbon content is no different than the oil we find off the \ncoast of California. To lock this country and the world into buying \nmore Mideast product seems to me to be a very bad idea at a very \ndangerous time. So when I hear Members of the Democratic Party take the \nfloor and say: Don't build this pipeline because it will help the \nenvironment, you obviously don't realize what Canada is about to do. \nCanada is going to sell the oil to another customer, build a new \npipeline, and the only question for you is, How do you justify that? \nHow do you justify destroying the ability to create thousands of jobs \nin the country at a time when we need them? How do you justify not \nbuilding a pipeline that could be used to help us with product from \nNorth Dakota and other places within our own country?\n  You can justify it, but you can't say it is based on climate change \nbecause the product you are talking about is going into the \nenvironment. It is going to be used. It is either going to be used \ncoming to America to our benefit or the pipeline will be built west and \nit will go to China.\n\n  To our friends in Canada, I imagine your patience is about to run out \nwith us, and I don't blame you one bit if you get tired of dealing with \nan American Government that seems completely out of sync with reality. \nIn terms of the lawsuits, it is a procedural issue. In Nebraska the \npipeline is one of thousands of pipelines we already have in America.\n  To the President last night, instead of one pipeline, why don't we \nhave a comprehensive infrastructure strategy? I am all for that. But \nyou are threatening to veto building this pipeline. Why? Because your \njudgment has been taken over by the environmental community which is \nhell-bent on no fossil fuels anywhere, anyway, anyhow.\n  That is not the world in which we live. I embrace the fact that a \nlower carbon economy will be beneficial over time. My view is: Find \nmore fossil fuels from friendly people, including our own backyard--\nCanada, the United States--to replace fossil fuels we have to buy from \nforeign entities that do not like us very much. That concept is a \nreality. We are not going to be able to replace fossil fuels any time \nsoon.\n  We can invent technology to make it cleaner. We can find \nalternatives. But at the end of the day it comes down to this: If you \nare using climate change as a reason not to build this pipeline, you \nare kidding yourself or you are misleading the public because the \nproduct is going to be used. They are going to build a pipeline in \nCanada. The question is, Do they build a pipeline that we get no \nbenefit from or do they build a pipeline in collaboration with us that \nhelps us with our job problems and our energy needs?\n  I don't understand how you can justify voting against the Keystone \nPipeline based on a concern about climate change because it has \nabsolutely nothing to do with the issue in this regard. The product is \ngoing to be used by somebody, and they are going to build a pipeline \nsomewhere. For you to deny us the ability to build this pipeline that \nwould make us more energy independent from overseas' fossil fuels is \nshortsighted and does not advance the cause of climate change.\n  To the people who believe in climate change, it is gimmicks such as \nthis and tricks such as this that hurt your cause. You are undercutting \na real genuine debate. You made climate change a religion rather than a \nproblem. It is a problem, but you are taking a draconian approach to \nthe problem to the point that you are denying our country the ability \nto build a pipeline that we would benefit from economically and energy \nsecurity-wise. The alternative you are leaving this country is that the \nsame product will go somewhere else, and the next pipeline will not \nbenefit America. So it is stunts like this that undercut your overall \nefforts.\n  I wish you would change your mind about the pipeline and work with \nRepublicans who are willing to work with you to deal with emissions in \na realistic way and stop selling what I think is a fraud when it comes \nto this debate.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wicker). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 29\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am on the floor to say a few words \nabout my amendment No. 29, which we will be voting on shortly after 3 \no'clock, I am told. That is the simple amendment that says it is the \nsense of the Senate that climate change is real and not a hoax.\n  It is, perhaps, a telling coincidence that we are having this \nconversation on the floor of the Senate now on the fifth anniversary of \nthe Citizens United decision, because before Citizens United came \nalong, there was actually a pretty robust conversation between \nDemocrats and Republicans about carbon pollution, climate change, and \nwhat needed to be done about it.\n  For instance, Senator John McCain ran for President on a robust \nplatform of addressing the carbon that causes climate change.\n  Senator Collins worked with the current energy ranking member, \nSenator Cantwell, on a very robust climate bill that would have put a \ncap on carbon pollution and paid a dividend back to the American \npeople.\n  Senator Mark Kirk voted for Waxman-Markey when that bill was on the \nfloor of the House, the famous cap-and-trade bill.\n  Senator Flake wrote an article in his home State paper expressing the \nvalue and merit of a carbon fee when it is offset by reductions in \nother taxes as a way to help workers and address the pollution problem.\n  Over and over again there were these joint actions all the way back \nto when I first came to the EPW Committee and Senator John Warner of \nVirginia was its then ranking member. He wrote Warner-Lieberman with \nour colleague, then Senator Lieberman.\n  Then came Citizens United. Then came the massive influx of polluter \nmoney into our political system, much of it dark money. At about the \nspring of 2010--and Citizens United was decided in January of 2010--\nthat was the end of the conversation.\n  So here we are today. We are just now reaching agreement on several \nvotes by which I believe our Republican colleagues will, for the first \ntime since Citizens United--some of them, at least--acknowledge that \nclimate change is real.\n  Indeed, we just heard my friend Senator Graham come to the floor and \nspeak--right there--saying that climate change is real, that humans had \na significant role in causing it, and it was something we ought to pay \nattention to.\n  This is new. Today, after 5 years of more or less silence. I have \nspoken on this floor, as everybody knows, a great deal on this subject, \nand nobody has ever come from the other side of the aisle to respond to \nme, except for the now-chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, to maintain his view that climate change is actually a hoax \nthat is perpetrated by the scientific community in order to get grants \nand funding.\n  So it has been a long drought. It has been a long, long drought. \nFrankly, it has been a drought that does not reflect the best \ntraditions of this body.\n  This body has taken on big issues in the past. It took on civil \nrights. It tried to hold this country together over the issue of \nslavery.\n  This body has been significant in the history of the United States at \nimportant junctions, and here we are at this important junction where \nour energy policy needs to change and half of the body basically was \nmute.\n  Today that seems to have changed.\n  That, to me, is very significant. I look forward to a vote on my \namendment. As I said, it is very simple. Climate change is real and not \na hoax. I hope that is something we can agree on as a body. If we do, \nthen it becomes a predicate for beginning to advance an important \nconversation.\n  I am not going to agree with all of my Republican colleagues about \ntheir views on how to respond to this problem, and I don't expect my \nRepublican\n\n[[Page S326]]\n\ncolleagues to agree with all of my views on how we should respond to \nthis problem. But the dark days of denying that there actually is a \nproblem may very well have seen their first little break of dawn right \nnow.\n  If that is so, that is exciting news because, as many Republicans \nhave noted--Republicans such as Secretary Schultz, Republicans such as \nSecretary Paulson, Republicans such as Ronald Reagan's economic \nadviser, the economist Arthur Laffer--there are smart, conservative \nways to address this problem.\n  I continue to think that the idea that Senator Flake signed off on \nall those years ago is still the right one to do: Raise a fee by \nputting a price on carbon that reflects the economic fact that it \ncreates harm for so many other folks, the so-called externalities, what \nthe economists would say. The costs that burning carbon causes to \nfishermen, to foresters, to homeowners, to people who live near the \nsea, those costs--build them into the price of the product. That is \neconomics 101. Then take every single dollar that we raise and lower \nworking people's taxes.\n  I am completely comfortable with that notion. That is one that has \nbeen over and over again brought up in the context of Republican and \nconservative discussions, including a very good recent paper jointly \nauthored by a writer from the American Enterprise Institute.\n  I see the deputy minority leader on the floor. I had the pleasure of \ntraveling with him and with our ranking member on the Judiciary \nCommittee and other colleagues to Cuba. When we spent time with Cuban \nofficials, Cuban religious leaders, Cuban--just regular folks on the \nstreet, over and over again we heard the same phrases coming at us, \nthat it was a time of hope and it was a time of promise.\n  If there is going to be a time of hope and a time of promise in Cuba, \nlet's hope it can be a time of hope and a time of promise in this body \non climate change. It starts with admitting that you have a problem, \njust like in so many other areas of human life. So I hope that, \nfrankly, every Member of the Senate will vote for my amendment. We \nappreciate the opportunity to work with the new majority on ways that \nwe can address this telling problem.\n\n  I will close by saying this. I am never going away on this subject. \nIt is too important to my home State of Rhode Island. There is no \nSenator in this body who, if they had an issue as important to their \nhome State as this issue is to Rhode Island, I would not expect and \nrespect to fight all the way through to the bitter end for the \ninterests of their State. My fishermen are not finding the fish where \nthey have been for generations. People who have built homes on the \nshore are losing them into the sea in big storms. These are real \nconsequences, and we--I promise you one way or the other--are going to \ndo something about it. I hope this is the dawn of that new day.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Rhode \nIsland. He and I did travel to Havana, Cuba, earlier this week. \nInterestingly enough, we sat down with the scientists and the people \nresponsible for the oceans and other natural benefits in Cuba to \ndiscuss global warming, and the conversation started at the same place. \nEven with these scientists, there is no question they can see the \nimpact, and they started their predictions about the rise of the ocean \nlevels--and the Senator from Rhode Island knows this far better than I \ndo--with their anticipation that the ocean levels will rise over a foot \nin just 10 or 20 years and then twice that over a period of 50 years or \nmore. That will have a profound impact on the island, the archipelago \nof Cuba, and the United States.\n  Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island, more than any other Senator, has \nreally brought this issue home--not just to his home but to the \nAtlantic Coast States--and has reported on the impacts they face. Now, \nI live smack dab in the middle of the country--in Illinois. I can tell \nyou we appreciate there are changes taking place on this planet that \nare not in our best interests--nor will they leave our children and \ngrandchildren a better place to live.\n  The obvious question we face is what will we do in this generation. \nThis bill, S. 1, which has been chosen by the Republican majority, has \ngiven us a venue finally to raise some important environmental issues \nwhich have been ignored for too long.\n  I know the object of this bill was to build a pipeline. TransCanada, \na Canadian company, wants to build a pipeline through the United \nStates. They may or may not sell any oil from it in the United States. \nWe had a vote on that yesterday, and the Republicans overwhelmingly \nsaid they would not require them to sell their oil in the United \nStates. They may or may not use American steel to build their pipeline. \nWe had that amendment yesterday, and the Republicans voted \noverwhelmingly that there is to be no requirement to use American steel \nto build this pipeline. Yet it is characterized as an American jobs \nbill. It is hard to understand that characterization.\n  If nothing else, whatever happens to this bill--and it may not have a \ngreat fate ahead of it, if it is not changed significantly because the \nPresident has already threatened to veto it--what the Senator from \nRhode Island said is significant. After years of denial from the other \nside of the aisle about the issues of global warming, we may have just \nreached a point where we are finally, on a bipartisan basis, going to \nacknowledge the obvious--the scientific facts which have been given to \nus over and over and over. That is a step in the right direction, and \nso I want to thank my colleague from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 69\n\n  Let me take 2 minutes to say a word about my pending amendment, which \nmay come up for a vote shortly. It is amendment No. 69.\n  What I have said on the floor is there is a dirty little secret about \nthe Keystone Pipeline. You don't take Canadian tar sands and turn them \ninto gasoline and diesel fuel without filtering and refining out some \npretty horrible things. What is filtered out is called petcoke, and \npetcoke is going to be produced in the refining process if this \npipeline is ultimately built--over 15,000 tons a day of petcoke, the \nbyproduct of this refining process.\n  If you look at it and you think to yourself what impact will that \nhave, it could have a very negative impact. In my city of Chicago, \nwhich I am very proud to represent, as well as in other communities, \npetcoke piles have become a challenge to the public health and the \npeople in the community. I am asking in my amendment that we establish \na standard of safety when it comes to petcoke--that we establish a \nstandard of transportation and storage of petcoke to protect American \nfamilies and children from the hazards of breathing petcoke dust.\n  This is a simple public health amendment, and I hope my colleagues \nwill support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. May I inquire of the Senator--we will be shortly \nvoting on a number of measures. One is a side-by-side to the Schatz \namendment which includes a quotation from an environmental impact \nstatement, and the quotation is as follows:\n\n     . . . approval or denial of any one crude oil transport \n     project, including the proposed Project, is unlikely to \n     significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands \n     or the continued demand for heavy crude oil at refineries in \n     the United States based on expected oil prices, oil-sands \n     supply costs, transport costs, and supply-demand scenarios.\n\n  Does the Senator recall when the EIS was written and what the oil \nprices were that were expected at the time this document was prepared?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Until very recently, of course, the price of a barrel of \noil was high enough to justify tar sands, their extraction, the cost of \ntransportation and the additional cost of refining them into a final \nproduct. Since that time, the cost of oil is almost half today what it \nwas when that report was written.\n  I don't remember the exact date, perhaps the Senator has it handy.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Indeed, I would say the breakpoint for that study was \nat $75 per barrel, and it was at that point that the environmental \nimpact became very real from this harmful tar sands fuel. Not only are \nwe not just under $75 per barrel, we have hit as low as below $50 per \nbarrel.\n  So I just want to make sure, as long as we are voting on this \nlanguage very\n\n[[Page S327]]\n\nshortly, that it is clear in the Record of the Senate that the \nenvironmental impact statement was hinged on that the ``expected oil \nprices'' were north of $75 per barrel; that they are now well below \nthat, around $50 per barrel. And, indeed, I would add that the Canadian \nResearch Institute has said the tar sands can't be properly extracted \nat prices less than $85 per barrel.\n  So that puts in context what we will be voting on that I thought \nshould be in the Record.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  It is significant that the first bill of the Senate Republican \nmajority is a bill to build a pipeline for a Canadian company to bring \ntar sands across the United States to be refined in Texas and then sold \noverseas. That is the highest priority of the Republican majority.\n  There are those who, based on what the Senator just said, question \nwhether this is economically viable with the price of a barrel of oil \ntoday. I am not an economist in energy, but it strikes me there has \nbeen a significant change in the premise of this whole project.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Indeed, in my remarks earlier, I referred to this \npipeline as possibly an economic zombie at the current oil prices. I \nhave not seen a single report that this pipeline can be built and \noperated properly at oil prices where they are right now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder for Senator Hoeven or his designee to offer his amendment No. 87, \nas modified; further, that the time until 3:15 p.m. this afternoon be \nequally divided in the usual form; that following the use or yielding \nback of the time, the Senate then proceed to vote in relation to the \nfollowing amendments in the order listed: Lee, No. 33; Durbin, No. 69; \nToomey, No. 41; Whitehouse, No. 29; Hoeven, No. 87, as modified; and \nSchatz, No. 58; further, that all amendments on this list be subject to \na 60-vote affirmative threshold for adoption and that no second-degrees \nbe in order to the amendments. I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided between each vote and that all votes \nafter the first in the series be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, as my colleague from Alaska just said, \nwe are making progress. We have another group of amendments we are \ngoing to be voting on shortly. I would encourage any of the Members on \nour side who would like to take a few minutes to go over their \namendments before the vote--we have a few minutes between now and 3:15 \np.m.--to do so. During this series of votes coming up, we will be \nworking with our colleagues to get the next set of amendments and to \ncontinue to move forward.\n  I will have a little more to say, but I see a couple of our \ncolleagues here, so I will give them a chance to talk about their \namendments.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. My understanding is that we have time equally divided \nbetween now and 3:15, before the votes start.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 69\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Seeing no one on the floor, I would like to say a word \nabout an amendment which will be voted on. I believe it is the second \nin the queue, and it is the amendment I have offered relative to \npetcoke.\n  Petcoke is the product derived from the refining of Canadian tar \nsands, and if you happen to live in some communities in America, \npetcoke can be a real problem.\n  This is the city of Chicago, IL. You can see some of the bungalows \nand houses here, and right across the railroad tracks you can see \nmounds of petcoke coming in from the British Petroleum refinery. They \ngenerate somewhere in the range of 6,000 tons a day of this petcoke and \npile it up right here. It is ultimately transported to different \nplaces, but it sits here. It obviously is a hazard to people who live \nnearby. It blows in the wind, creating public health issues and real \nconcern for families with children with asthma, respiratory disease.\n  I have an amendment, and it is very basic. No. 1, the amendment talks \nabout making sure there are standards and rules for the storage \nenclosure of petcoke. Most of the cities--whether it is Long Beach, CA; \nor Detroit, MI; or Chicago, IL--are trying to find established \nstandards to enclose this petcoke so it doesn't blow freely in the \natmosphere.\n  Senator Hoeven spoke earlier and said it was not carcinogenic. Those \nfindings related not to the breathing in of this dust but to the \ningestion of petcoke itself. We have yet to establish that this is a \nbenign substance, and we are trying to take care to protect families \nwho might be exposed to it.\n\n  I am not surprised to see that there has been a letter issued by the \nNational Association of Manufacturers opposing my amendment. They start \nby saying that petcoke is a valuable, essential commercial product that \nis used in a wide array of applications. I am not stopping that at all. \nAnyone who wants to take this petcoke and use it to produce energy and \npower generation, cement kilns, steel, glass, as long as they comply \nwith basic environmental standards, be my guest. But to store it in \nsuch a fashion that it can blow all over and cause public health \nhazards is unacceptable--it should be--in a modern society. Secondly, \nif those who store it end up, we find over the long haul, creating a \nlong-term hazard to the environment, they should be held legally \nresponsible.\n  That is the extent of my amendment. I am not surprised that the \nNational Association of Manufacturers would oppose it. But I would ask \neach and every Member to consider the possibility that if they lived \nacross the tracks from this kind of petcoke conglomeration--I have seen \nit. It is horrible, and we are fighting it in the city of Chicago. The \ncompany that owns the petcoke--the Koch Brothers. So it shouldn't be \nany surprise that the National Association of Manufacturers took the \nposition they did.\n  I hope that all of us who may be subject to this kind of dumping of \npetcoke near a city in our State will think twice. Let's at least have \nsome standards for storage and enclosure to protect the people in our \nStates, and let's make certain that if there is ultimately \nenvironmental damage here, that the parties who make the profit off of \npetcoke are ultimately responsible.\n  That is the extent of my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 33\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I would like to take a few minutes to talk about the \nLee amendment, No. 33, which is going to be voted on shortly. I know my \ncolleagues are going to have 2 minutes divided before the vote, so \npeople can add comments as they wish.\n  This amendment makes it very difficult for citizens to retain \ncounsel, particularly related to the Endangered Species Act. I don't \nknow why we would be handicapping legal cases just because they deal \nwith the environment. I mean, I guess if you are not interested in \nprotecting the environment, you would want to make it harder for people \nto retain lawyers. But when I think about property rights and clean \nwater and clean air and all of those issues, I think that is something \non which we ought to go the extra mile\n\n[[Page S328]]\n\nand make sure they get representation and counsel, not handicap them \nand make it harder just because we don't want companies to adhere to \nenvironmental laws.\n  I believe this is important because my colleagues should remember \nthat the ESA was signed into law in 1973 by then-President Richard \nNixon and was intentionally drafted to manage and to engage citizens in \nthe protection of endangered species.\n  Now, in general, litigants in the country must bear their own costs, \nand the prevailing party is not ordinarily entitled to collect his or \nher expenses in a defending suit from the loser. But both the courts \nand Congress have provided an exemption from that rule, and so they \nhave allowed in certain circumstances for judges to shift the cost to \nlitigants in the interest of fairness and to further protect the public \ninterest.\n  So that is what is at stake this morning. I think the Endangered \nSpecies Act is a prime example of why the courts decided they wanted to \nhave this kind of leeway and protection. Congress knew when it enacted \nthe Endangered Species Act that it would be difficult and the Nation \nwould want to make sure that ordinary citizens had the opportunity to \nhelp ensure compliance with the law. So Congress recognized that when a \ncitizen did so, he or she did not do so necessarily by themselves alone \nbut with the counsel of a private attorney. Congress recognized this \nreality in statute.\n  So this is what we are going to be addressing. In contrast, the Lee \namendment would weaken the prevailing citizen's request for \nreimbursement under an Endangered Species Act--and narrow those \nrestrictions of equal access to justice. This is because the cap on \nfees would include the Equal Access to Justice Act, which often falls \nwell below the market-based rate for attorneys. Basically, what the Lee \namendment does is say you will not be able to recap on the attorneys' \nfees at the cost of doing business, and their hope is that citizens \nwill then not have representation before the courts on issues such as \nclean air, clean water, and other environmental issues.\n\n  I say to my colleagues--and I have said this to the now-ranking \nmember on the EPW Committee--I don't know why we are not taking up the \nSuperfund bill. To me, getting the Superfund reauthorized--these are \npolluters that have polluted our country, and they are not even paying \nthe tax that it would cost to clean up the pollution.\n  Instead, we are considering an amendment that says: Let's roll back \nthe environmental law on this issue and make sure that citizens don't \nhave the right to help enforce environmental law.\n  I ask my colleagues to defeat the Lee amendment when we get to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 87, as modified, to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I wish to call up my amendment, as \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n  The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Hoeven] proposes an amendment \nnumbered 87, as modified, to amendment No. 2.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding climate change)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The environmental analysis contained in the \n     Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement referred to \n     in section 2(a) and deemed to satisfy the requirements of the \n     National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et \n     seq.) as described in section 2(a), states that--\n       (1) ``[W]arming of the climate system is unequivocal and \n     each of the last [3] decades has been successively warmer at \n     the Earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850.'';\n       (2) ``The [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change], in \n     addition to other institutions, such as the National Research \n     Council and the United States (U.S.) Global Change Research \n     Program (USGCRP), have concluded that it is extremely likely \n     that global increases in atmospheric [greenhouse gas] \n     concentrations and global temperatures are caused by human \n     activities.'';\n       (3) ``A warmer planet causes large-scale changes that \n     reverberate throughout the climate system of the Earth, \n     including higher sea levels, changes in precipitation, and \n     altered weather patterns (e.g. an increase in more extreme \n     weather events).\n       (4) ``The analyses of potential impacts associated with \n     construction and normal operation of the proposed Project \n     suggest that significant impacts to most resources are not \n     expected along the proposed Project route'' (FSEIS page 4.16-\n     1, section 4.16.;\n       (5) ``The total annual GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions \n     (direct and indirect) attributed to the No Action scenarios \n     range from 28 to 42 percent greater than for the proposed \n     Project'' (FSEIS page ES-34, section ES.5.4.2).; and\n       (6) ``. . . approval or denial of any one crude oil \n     transport project, including the proposed Project, is \n     unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in \n     the oil sands or the continued demand for heavy crude oil at \n     refineries in the United States based on expected oil prices, \n     oil-sands supply costs, transport costs, and supply-demand \n     scenarios'' (FSEIS page ES-16, section ES.4.1.1).''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Consistent with the findings under \n     subsection (a), it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) climate change is real; and\n       (2) human activity contributes to climate change.\n\n\n                        Vote on Amendment No. 33\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to a vote in relation to amendment No. 33, offered by the \nSenator from Utah, Mr. Lee.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry--I wish to speak on \nthe Hoeven amendment and take the 1 minute.\n  Excuse me. I withdraw my request.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 69 offered by the Senator from Illinois.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is the petcoke amendment. There are \ncommunities in this Nation--Chicago, Detroit, Long Beach, CA--and it \nmay be coming to other areas soon. Petcoke is the byproduct of Canadian \ntar sands when it is refined. This pipeline will\n\n[[Page S329]]\n\ngenerate 15,000 tons a day of petcoke that has to be stored. We are \nasking that it be stored responsibly so it doesn't blow through towns \nand neighborhoods that I and my colleagues represent, and let's \nestablish standards for that purpose. It can still be used legitimately \nfor many products, but let's make sure it doesn't cause respiratory \nproblems for the people we represent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. When Canadian oil sands are refined, they produce \npetroleum coke, which is this high-energy, mostly carbon, coal-like \nsubstance, but it does have economic value. It can be used for fuel; it \ncan be used for smelting; it can be used for producing dry cell \nbatteries and other purposes.\n  The EPA's own Web site states--and this is from their Web site--\npetroleum coke itself has a low level of toxicity, and there is no \nevidence of carcinogenicity. The EPA's hazard characterization has also \nshown there are no adverse environmental effects associated with \npetroleum coke piles and the EPA's words are ``they are essentially \ninert.''\n  I have listened to the comments of my colleague from Illinois, and I \nappreciate the concerns those in neighborhoods have, but I think it is \nimportant that we recognize we are not trying to skip the science. We \nare not trying to add regulations for the transport and storage of \nsomething that is apparently not hazardous, according to the EPA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee).

Mr. President, before we proceed to hear from the \nsponsor of this amendment, I would just remind Members that these are \n10-minute votes. It would be good--we have four more that we need to \ndo. It would be good if we could stick to our 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I want to thank Senators Casey and Hatch \nfor joining me in this amendment. For almost 200 years, we have been \nmining coal in Pennsylvania. Some of it came out of the ground, and it \nturns out it was not suitable for the steel industry for which it was \nintended. The unsuitable coal has been piled up for decades. It forms \nmountains. Pennsylvania alone has 2 billion tons and 180,000 acres of \ncontaminated land. These mountains of coal poison our water. They \npoison our air when they spontaneously combust and burn--sometimes for \nover a year--releasing pollutants with no controls whatsoever.\n  So we have an industry that is solving this problem, systematically \nturning this coal into electric power. Senators Casey, Hatch, and I \nhave an amendment that will simply allow this cleanup to continue, to \nexempt these 19 powerplants from the particularly onerous regulations \nin utility MACT and from the cross-air pollution regulations.\n  A vote in favor of this amendment is a vote to continue to clean up \nthis environmental disaster that we have on our hands. I would be very \ngrateful for Member support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, in speaking in opposition to the Toomey \namendment, it is an attack on the Clean Air Act. I want to speak in \nfavor of making sure that we are doing everything the Supreme Court \nsaid we need to do, which is to enforce the Clean Air Act.\n  While my colleague is making a point, I do not know why we should \ngive some powerplants in Pennsylvania an exemption to the Clean Air \nAct. Obviously, there are businesses all across America that have to \ncomply with environmental laws. By voting against this amendment, we \ncan continue to fight against these pollution issues and make sure that \nspecial interests are not getting another narrow carve-out in this \nlegislation.\n  So I would ask my colleagues to make sure that we are not creating a \nspecial exemption for the mercury and air toxic standards in the Clean \nAir Act and vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Toomey \namendment.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Colleagues, I almost hate to use my minute because I \nam so eager to hear what will be said during the minute when our energy \nchairman will follow me, but I am hoping that after many years of \ndarkness and blockade, this vote will be a first little beam of light \nthrough the wall that will allow us to at least start having an honest \nconversation about what carbon pollution is doing to our climate and to \nour oceans. This is a matter of vital consequence to my home State, the \nOcean State, my home, Rhode Island, and to many of yours as well.\n  I hope this is a place where we can get together and have a strong, \npositive vote that sends a signal that this Senate, at this time in \nhistory, is ready to deal with reality.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I yield 1 minute on our side to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as \na cosponsor to the Whitehouse amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Climate is changing. Climate has always changed, and it \nalways will. There is archaeological evidence of that, there is \nbiblical evidence, and there is historical evidence. It will always \nchange. The hoax is that there are some people who are so arrogant, who \nthink that they are so powerful that they can change the climate.

Mr. President, we have an amendment before us, a side-\nby-side to the amendment that has been offered by the Senator from \nHawaii, and what we do within this side-by-side is effectively lay out \nfindings contained within the administration's EIS that outline the \nenvironmental impact of a Keystone XL Pipeline, recognizing the impact \nto the environment will be less if this line is actually constructed.\n  We further go into a sense of the Senate that acknowledges--again \nafter the vote we just had--that climate change is real and that there \nis an impact.\n  With that, I would recommend that folks look at the language that has \nbeen offered. I will be supporting the Hoeven amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are about to vote on something that I \nthink will be recorded as a breakthrough moment in the climate debate. \nFor the first time we will go on record saying the following: Climate \nchange is real and human activity contributes to climate change.\n  What a breath of fresh air this amendment is, and I urge an ``aye'' \nvote very strongly.\n  The front part of the amendment accurately quotes the EIS, parts of \nwhich a lot of us agree with and parts of which we don't. Let it be \nknown that the parts we don't agree with are under review by various \nagencies, but this is accurate. This is a quote from the current EIS.\n  You are not voting to endorse the EIS, you are just voting to \nacknowledge that is what it says. But you are voting on original \nlanguage written by Senator Hoeven that says climate change is real and \nhuman activity contributes to it.\n  I urge an ``aye'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n  This has been a surprisingly productive day on the issue of climate \ndebate. I know there has been a lot of consternation and discussion, \nbut that is a good thing.\n  We have one final amendment to consider today, and it simply takes a \nportion of the language from the EIS for the Keystone XL and adopts it. \nThat language says, in summary, that climate change is real and that \nclimate change is caused by humans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. That language simply states that climate change is real, \nthat climate change is caused by humans and principally by carbon \npollution.\n  So the simple vote in front of us is: Do you agree with the factual \nevidence? Will you concede to the facts? We have an opportunity to set \na new chapter in this climate debate. Today has been good progress.\n  So I urge my colleagues for a big bipartisan vote on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I urge colleagues to oppose the Schatz \namendment. There is a distinct difference between this amendment and \nwhat was previously considered in the sense of the Congress, which \nwould refer to human activity that significantly contributes to climate \nchange, and the issue of degrees. And I would suggest to colleagues \nthat the inclusion of that word is sufficient to merit a ``no'' vote at \nthis time.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, at this time I know Senators are \ninterested in coming to the floor and offering their amendments. We \nhave been discussing a process forward on this side of the aisle.\n  Earlier in the day Senator Fischer had been working on an amendment \nthat she has agreed to modify. I understand that the other side has a \nside-by-side that they will ask for consideration on.\n  I know the Senator from Louisiana will be on the floor to speak on an \namendment he would like considered, and I understand there are a couple \nof other Senators on the other side who wish to speak as well.\n  There will be no more votes today on these amendments, but again, \ngiven the interest in this subject, I encourage Members to come down \nand speak to their amendments. We would like to figure out that process \nto get a series of amendments pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I again thank the Senator from Alaska \nfor working through this process and the due diligence given. I think \nwe are very close to having the side-by-side language, and once that is \ndone, we will give it out to everyone for review. We need to get the \nFischer amendment and the side-by-side figured out.\n  Everybody is asking about the process. If we could get the next set \nof amendments offered by colleagues, it will give us a chance to \nproceed on figuring out when the next votes will be scheduled.\n  With that, I understand Senator Sanders wishes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 24 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Murkowski and Senator \nCantwell for working on a sensible process.\n  I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the current amendment and call \nup my amendment No. 24.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders], for himself, Mr. \n     Bennet, Mr. Carper, and Mr. Menendez, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 24 to amendment No. 2.\n\n  Mr. Sanders. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding climate change)\n\n       After section 2, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that Congress is in agreement \n     with the opinion of virtually the entire worldwide scientific \n     community that--\n       (1) climate change is real;\n       (2) climate change is caused by human activities;\n       (3) climate change has already caused devastating problems \n     in the United States and around the world;\n       (4) a brief window of opportunity exists before the United \n     States and the entire planet suffer irreparable harm; and\n       (5) it is imperative that the United States transform its \n     energy system away from fossil fuels and toward energy \n     efficiency and sustainable energy as rapidly as possible.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I especially wish \nto applaud Republican Senators. I believe, for the very first time, a \nnumber of them stood up and said: Climate change is real and climate \nchange is\n\n[[Page S332]]\n\ncaused by human activities. This is a significant step forward, and I \nthink that in the months and years to come more and more Republicans \nwill accept that position because that is the position of the \nscientific community.\n  What my amendment does is in fact repeat what we heard today and what \nwe voted on; that climate change is real and that it is caused by human \nactivities, but it also has three other provisions in it. It says \nclimate change has already caused devastating problems in the United \nStates and around the world.\n  I think it is hard to argue against that. Whether it is drought or \nflooding--in the United States or around the world--increased forest \nfires in the Southwestern United States, rising sea levels or extreme \nweather conditions and the damage that does, it is very hard to argue \nthat climate change has not caused severe and devastating problems in \nthe United States already.\n  This amendment also says that a brief window of opportunity exists \nbefore the United States and the entire planet suffers irreparable \nharm. Again, that is what the scientific community is telling us. They \nare saying that damage is being done today, now, and it will only get \nworse in years to come. We have a brief window of opportunity to \nprevent very serious problems. I hope my colleagues will support that \nprovision.\n  Lastly, and what logically follows from the previous four positions, \nis the following: It is imperative that the United States transforms \nits energy system away from fossil fuels and toward energy efficiency \nand sustainable energy as rapidly as possible. That doesn't mean you \nclose down every coal-burning plant in America tomorrow, but it does \nmean we move away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable \nenergy as rapidly as possible.\n  I think in terms of this bill we have already made some good \nprogress. I will look for bipartisan support tomorrow so the Senate \ngoes on record supporting the overwhelming percentage of scientists who \nare in agreement with what this amendment says.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 80 to Amendment No. 2\n\n       (Purpose: To provide for the distribution of revenues from \n     certain areas of the outer Continental Shelf)\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 80, which I discussed previously today and which is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter], for himself and \n     Mr. Cassidy, proposes an amendment numbered 80 to amendment \n     No. 2.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 80, as Modified\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask that the amendment be modified with \nthe changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n       TITLE--OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF OIL AND GAS LEASING REVENUE\n\n     SEC. _01.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 72 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment to call up my amendment No. 72 to protect private \nproperty from unjust seizure by a foreign corporation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Menendez], for himself and \n     Ms. Cantwell, proposes an amendment numbered 72 to amendment \n     No. 2.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To ensure private property cannot be seized through \ncondemnation or eminent domain for the private gain of a foreign-owned \n                            business entity)\n\n       In section 2 of the amendment, strike subsection (e) and \n     insert the following:\n       (e) Private Property Protection.--Land or an interest in \n     land for the pipeline and cross-border facilities described \n     in subsection (a) may only be acquired from willing sellers.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It \nprohibits TransCanada from using eminent domain proceedings to seize \nprivate property in order to build the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  As we all know, eminent domain is the power of a governmental entity \nto take private property and convert it into public use subject to \nreasonable compensation. Traditionally, property could only be seized \nfor public use, such as a public park or a public road, but \nincreasingly the exercise of eminent domain has been used for private \ngain.\n  Many, including some of my most conservative friends on the other \nside of the aisle, are outraged by the idea that eminent domain \nproceedings could be used to seize private property for private gain.\n  President Bush issued an Executive order restricting the use of \neminent domain by the Federal Government for ``the purpose of \nbenefitting the general public and not merely for the purpose of \nadvancing the economic interest of private parties.''\n  The senior Senator from Texas introduced the Protections of Homes, \nSmall Businesses, and Private Property Act of 2005, which would have \nprohibited the use of eminent domain by Federal, State, or local \ngovernment entities for private economic development.\n  I have been working very closely with Senator Cantwell on this \namendment, and we agree with our conservative colleagues that using \neminent domain proceedings for private gain is outrageous.\n  On the issue of Keystone, a foreign-owned company is using eminent \ndomain to seize private property so it can better export Canadian oil. \nThe project is not in the public interest, but it is clearly in the \nspecial interest.\n  I do not begrudge the fact that a Canadian company wants its \nsubsidiary to build this pipeline so it can export foreign oil to \ndistant shores through American infrastructure. They want to make a \nprofit, and I understand that. But I do not think we should allow our \nsovereignty to be compromised in order to do it.\n  Right now the U.S. Federal Government is trying to build a ferry \nterminal in Canada to serve Alaska, but Canadians are protecting their \nsovereignty and objecting to U.S. steel and other U.S. content from \nbeing the sole source for the ferry terminal. I disagree with Canada on \nthat point, but I understand they want to protect their sovereignty. \nSimilarly, we need to protect American sovereignty and American \nlandowners from a Canadian-owned company that wants to seize our \nprivate lands for private gain and force Americans to take a risk of \nCanadian pollution.\n  Over the weekend landowners along the route of the Keystone XL \nPipeline were seeing a pipeline spill on the Yellowstone River in \nMontana. It is happening now. If we were to see pictures of it, we \nwould see that the efforts to clean up the spill are being hindered by \na sheet of ice. Who knows what damage is being done by 50,000 gallons \nof oil in this river. We might not know until spring. Landowners are \nwondering if their family farm will be the victim of a similar spill, \nwondering if property that has been in their family for generations can \nstill be passed on to the next generation.\n  One landowner who has seen firsthand what can happen when a pipeline \nis put on your property is Lori Collins. In October of 2012 Lori \nCollins walked outside her home to find construction workers for a \nTransCanada contractor trying to clear the way for the southern leg of \nthe Keystone Pipeline. They had dug up the lines to her septic system, \ncompletely destroying it. When she asked the workers to repair the \ndamage, they did not. Instead, they piled dirt over the damage and \nclogged the system. The result was raw sewage flooding back into the \nCollins' home, staining walls and carpets, leaving a black mold \nthroughout their house, and leaving Lori Collins with severe \nrespiratory problems. The Collins family was eventually forced to move \nout of their home. While they were able to get a settlement after suing \nTransCanada, the family says they can never repair the damage to their \nlives.\n  Jim Tarnick, a farmer in Nebraska, has heard of TransCanada's track \nrecord and fears that he might have to suffer similar damage or, worse, \nface an oilspill. TransCanada wants to put the pipeline right through \nhis front yard on his property that has been in his family for over 100 \nyears.\n  Mr. Tarnick's farm sits near the Ogallala Aquifer, which provides \ncritical freshwater for farmers and ranchers in the heart of U.S. farm \ncountry. A pipeline spill such as the one on the Yellowstone River over \nthe last few days could damage the aquifer and therefore jeopardize a \nresource relied on by Nebraskan farms and ranches. Mr. Tarnick fears he \nwill be served with papers invoking eminent domain on his property any \nday now. TransCanada is asking that he and other Nebraskans trust that \nthey will protect the Ogallala Aquifer and the livelihoods it supports.\n  Instead of forcing Mr. Tarnick to host the Keystone Pipeline against \nhis will, let's instead let TransCanada work with landowners who are \nwilling to take the risk and will be paid what they feel is fair rather \nthan what TransCanada's lawyers can convince a judge is fair.\n  Senator Cantwell and I believe this amendment is one of simple \nfairness and should be a no-brainer, an easy amendment every Senator \ncan support. In recent years Republicans have insisted on similar \nlanguage prohibiting the use of eminent domain when we establish \nnational parks. If eminent domain cannot be used to establish a \nnational park in the public interest to conserve our national treasures \nand preserve America's beauty for future generations, then surely it \nshould not be used to benefit private interests--in this case, in the \ninterest of a foreign-owned oil company seeking to ship its product \naround the world.\n  I call on my colleagues to be consistent, stand on principle and \nlogic, protect landowners, and support my amendment to protect private \nproperty from seizure by foreign corporations,\n\n[[Page S334]]\n\npreserve our sovereignty, and preserve the rights of U.S. citizens \nalong the way.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor such time as I shall consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cap and Trade\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me address what happened \ntoday because I think it is significant. I think a lot of people are a \nlittle bit confused over what did happen, and it was somewhat of a \nsurprise.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, I have been leading the opposition to \nthis whole idea of cap and trade. It originated way back in 2001. Since \nthat time, we have voted on it many times. I will always remember that \nback in those days most people believed that manmade gases were \ncontributing to global warming and that the world was going to come to \nan end because of manmade gases and CO2 emissions.\n  At that time, early on, I was on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. I think at that time I was not chairman, but I was the \nchairman of one of the subcommittees, and I thought, it must be true, \neverybody says it.\n  Well, some time went by and we got a report. The first one came from \nthe Wharton School where they talked about the fact that if we were to \npass cap and trade--at that time there were two bills before the U.S. \nSenate--not in the House, just in the Senate--and those bills would \nhave been cap-and-trade types of bills. So they calculated what this \nwould cost if we in the United States passed cap and trade. This was \nway back in 2002, 2003. They said that the range of the cost to the \nAmerican people would be between $300 billion and $400 billion a year.\n  I do something that I don't think very many people do, but I always \ndo it. Every time I hear a large number, I go back and get the latest \nfigures from my State of Oklahoma as to how many families file a \nFederal tax return, and then I do the math to determine how much it is \ngoing to cost an average family who pays taxes. It came back in excess \nof $3,000 a year. I thought, that is a lot of money. Let's be sure \nthere is science behind this idea, knowing it all came from the United \nNations. That is what started this whole thing.\n  By the way, this IPCC is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, and that is within the United Nations. That is where it all \nstarted. If my colleagues remember, that was during the Clinton-Gore \nadministration, when Al Gore went to South America and came back with \nthis idea of the Kyoto Treaty. We were all going to sign it, and if we \ndidn't, then we were all going to die because of manmade gases.\n  So we started looking at it to see if the science really was there \nbecause the only science we had heard about was the IPCC. Well, sure \nenough, we started getting phone calls from scientists all over the \ncountry. This was a long time ago. I started naming the scientists and \ngroups of scientists who were calling in. We got up to 100 and then to \n1,000 and then to 4,000. This is all on my Web site even though it was \na long time ago. We can see all of these renowned scientists.\n  Richard Lindzen is with MIT. He is one who is considered by a lot of \npeople to be the foremost authority on this, and he is the one who came \nout adamantly and said: No, the science is not there. It is not \nsettled.\n  So several others started calling in.\n  In fact, I will quote him, if I have it here, what Richard Lindzen \nactually said at that time. He said: ``Controlling carbon is a \nbureaucrat's dream. If you control carbon, you control life.''\n  That is what bureaucrats would like to do. The Presiding Officer \nunderstands that because he has served in the other House and is new \nhere in the Senate.\n  Lindzen also said, talking about Al Gore--Al Gore at that time was \nVice President of the United States. He was the one who was really \npushing this. He said: To treat all change as something to fear is bad \nenough. To do so in order to exploit that fear is much worse.\n  Of course, what Richard Lindzen of MIT was talking about was the fact \nthat Al Gore at that time--they speculated he would be the first \nenvironmental billionaire. That was speculated in the New York Times. \nAnyway, after that happened, all the other scientists started checking \nin. These are scientists who cannot be challenged--these individuals. \nWe have hundreds more, and I have a make on each one of these that I \nwould be glad to discuss or debate with anyone. But at the same time, \nother things were happening.\n  One of the universities here in Virginia commissioned a poll to be \ndone of all of the weathercasters on TV. They came back with 63 percent \nof the weathercasters saying that any global warming that occurs is a \nresult of natural variation and not human activities.\n  So when I hear people--I have good friends on the other side that \nreally believe this, and I think that one sometimes has to open it up \nand realize there is another side to this story. When they say that 97 \npercent, 98 percent of the scientists agree, it just isn't true. We \nhave the names and things that have actually been said.\n  I think one item that people are going to have to remember--let me \nfirst of all say what happened today because I know they have been told \nI would explain what happened today.\n  My good friend, Senator Whitehouse, had an amendment. The amendment \nwas one sentence. It says that climate change is real and it is not a \nhoax. There is a ruling against talking about your own votes on the \nSenate floor, so I can't do that. But that hoax came from a totally \ndifferent interpretation. The hoax was the idea that this is \nhappening--climate change. That it is due to manmade gases. In other \nwords, man is causing it.\n  So what I said on the Senate floor today is: How arrogant is it for \npeople to say that man can do something about changing climate? Climate \nhas always changed. I quoted this morning--I said it has changed. Go \nback and look at the archeological findings. They talk about climate \nfrom the beginning of time having changed and changed both ways. The \nScriptures talk about it. This is something on which everyone has \nagreed, and no one would debate that it has always happened. The debate \nis whether man is causing that to happen.\n  So here we have a chart that shows--do you remember the hockey stick? \nThe hockey stick was the concept that one of the guys with the IPCC \ncame out with and said that it is like a hockey stick. We had this \nweather going like this for a long period of time. Then all of a sudden \nit shot up, and it resembled a hockey stick.\n  What they forgot was to put these two things in the hockey stick \nwhere it is supposed to be level. One is the medieval warming period \nthat is between 1000 and 1500 A.D. We are talking recently. Then that \nwent into the little ice age. Those were left off the chart. We have \nlooked back, and everything you look at talks about how many years in \nthe past we have had this change that is taking place in climate.\n  I am going to do this from memory. There are--in addition to these \nmajor changes such as you are seeing on this chart, which is a chart \nthat--this actually is the IPCC's chart. No one is going to argue with \nthat because they are the ones who dreamed up this whole idea. That is \nan intergovernmental panel on climate change. But within that--I can \nremember when I first heard the terms global warming and ice age, it \nwas when they went back and they started tracing not long-term trends \nin climate change in weather but short term. Starting in 1895, from \n1895 to 1918, they had what they referred to as a cooling spell, \npossibly another little ice age. Then in 1918, it started getting warm \nagain. So from 1918 to 1945 there was a little warming period. That \ntook place kind of every 30 years. Then in 1995, from that period until \n1975, for 30 years again, it went into a cooling period.\n  Here is the key. No one will argue with the fact that 1945 was the \nyear that we had the maximum increase\n\n[[Page S335]]\n\nsurge in CO2 emissions. That precipitated not a warming \nperiod but a cooling period. Then, of course, 1975 came along.\n  Where are the charts that showed that in 1974--Time magazine or one \nof those? Here it is. This is Time magazine. This is the front. They \nsaid: Is another ice age coming? This is 1974. This is making the case. \nEverybody believed it. They talked about global warming before that and \nthen another ice age. We are all going to die one way or another.\n  Put up the other chart, which is also Time magazine. This is when \nthey said: Oh, no, here is the last polar bear and all the ice--so we \nhave another global warming period. Both of them are from Time \nmagazine. Both are 30 years apart. This is what has been happening for \na long period of time.\n  Recognizing this, we had a little experience that--getting back, I \nmade a determination that I would not only support the Whitehouse \namendment, since it was just one sentence, it said that climate is \nchanging, and it is not a hoax, but that I could clarify that and maybe \nbecome a cosponsor to his amendment. So I did that on the floor just a \nfew minutes ago. I said on the floor that, yes, it is changing--no \nquestion about that. But the hoax is that there are people who are so \narrogant they think they have the power to change climate. That is the \nhoax--not the fact that climate is changing. So that is what has been \nhappening.\n  When some of the scientists came out and they started changing back \nand forth and all of a sudden people realized this whole thing was \ncooked up by the United Nations--IPCC was part of that group--then they \nfound out that some of the scientists who were behind this were \ndiscovering that they had some emails that were sent out saying and \nproving conclusively that they were cooking the science, that these \nscientists were lying.\n  One of the things that was discovered and came out was an email from \none of the scientists to another. It was 1999 and it read: I have just \ncompleted Mike's nature trick, adding in the real temperatures of each \nof the series for the last 20 years.\n  In other words, they were cooking the science at that time. This \nthing was such a scandal that throughout the world--we didn't hear \nnearly as much in the United States, but we did throughout the world. \nThe UK Telegraph, which is maybe the largest communication in the UK, \nsaid that it is the worst scientific scandal of our generation.\n  What they are talking about is the scientific scandal. They are \ntrying to make it sound as if man is responsible for all of these \nthings. The Financial Times came out and said the closed-mindedness of \nthese supposed men of science is surprising even to me. The stink of an \nintellectual corruption is overpowering.\n  One of the IPCC physicists said that climate-gate was a fraud on a \nscale I have never seen before. This went on and on, and we could quote \nNewsweek, the Guardian, and all the rest of them. It was known \nworldwide as a scandal. What was the scandal? It was that they had a \nbunch of scientists who were saying we are going to have to pass \nsomething like cap and trade because man is causing the world to come \nto an end.\n  So that is really what that was all about. We are going to have the \ndebate. We want to do that. I chair the Committee on Environment and of \nPublic Works. I chaired it 8 years ago. Then when the Democrats got \ncontrol of the Senate--and now I am back in that position. We will have \na chance to have hearings. We are going to have hearings with prominent \nscientists to come in and talk about this issue because all they say \nnow is: Oh, the science is settled; the science is settled.\n  The science is not settled. That is the reason my good friend Senator \nWyden wants to make some remarks. That is the reason I made that \nstatement today. I think we will have that very healthy debate. But \nlet's keep in mind what the President was suggesting last night. It \nwould cost the American people $479 billion a year, and that would \nconstitute the largest tax increase in the history of America. That is \none of his legacies which he is trying during the last part of his \npresidency and which he announced last night that he is going to put as \na top priority. We will be there to be the truth squad in that and make \nsure that my kids and grandkids--I have 20--are not going to be \nencumbered with the largest tax increase in the world, particularly \nwhen their own director said: If you pass it, it will not reduce \nCO2 emissions.\n  I yield floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 27 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up and make \npending Wyden amendment No. 27 to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to clarify that products derived from tar sands are crude oil for \npurposes of the Federal excise tax on petroleum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden], for himself, Mr. \n     Bennet, Mr. Brown, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Casey, Mr. \n     Nelson, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Markey, \n     Mr. Merkley, and Mr. Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered \n     27 to amendment No. 2.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify that \n   products derived from tar sands are crude oil for purposes of the \n                    Federal excise tax on petroleum)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. CLARIFICATION OF TAR SANDS AS CRUDE OIL FOR EXCISE \n                   TAX PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (1) of section 4612(a) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(1) Crude oil.--The term `crude oil' includes crude oil \n     condensates, natural gasoline, synthetic petroleum, any \n     bitumen or bituminous mixture, any oil derived from a bitumen \n     or bituminous mixture, and any oil derived from kerogen-\n     bearing sources.''.\n       (b) Technical Amendment.--Paragraph (2) of section 4612(a) \n     of such Code is amended by striking ``from a well located''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to oil and petroleum products received, entered, \n     used, or exported during calendar quarters beginning more \n     than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this amendment closes a tax loophole that \ncurrently places Canadian tar sands oil ahead of the American taxpayer. \nWhile oil produced here in the United States, in places such as North \nDakota and Texas, pays into a cleanup fund for oil spills, tar sands \ndoes not. The bottom line here is simple--when Canadian tar sands oil \nis spilled on American soil, the American taxpayer pays up. In effect, \nit is possible to state what this is all about in straight forward \nEnglish: right now, our Tax Code is so out of date that it says that \noil from the tar sands isn't actually oil. Put your arms around that \nfor a second. The Tax Code is in a time warp. Under the current policy, \nwhat concerns me is a judgment that oil from the tar sands isn't \nactually oil.\n  All other crude oil product refiners have to pay an 8-cent-per-barrel \ntax to support the oilspill liability trust fund that pays for cleaning \nup the spills.\n  This puts our own domestic producers at a competitive disadvantage.\n  I see my colleague from Colorado who cares greatly about these \nissues. I am saying to myself, in Colorado or Texas or North Dakota--in \neffect the policy that we have today on tax law--and I am the ranking \nDemocrat on the Senate finance committee--as I looked at it, the first \nthing that came to mind is we have a tax policy here that, without the \namendment I offer with my Senate finance colleagues, Senator Markey and \nothers, we are putting domestic American producers--whether it is \nColorado, North Dakota or Texas--at a competitive disadvantage. While \ndomestic producers willingly contribute to clean up the oil spills, \ntheir Canadian competitors, and the tar sands up north of Edmonton, \nsimply do not. This just defies commonsense.\n  Oil from the tar sands is just as likely to spill as other kinds of \noil. Unfortunately, you don't have to look much beyond today's \nheadlines to get a sense of what an oil spill actually means for \ncommunities across our country.\n\n[[Page S336]]\n\n  This past weekend an oil pipeline ruptured in Montana, pouring about \n50,000 gallons of oil into the Yellowstone River, 5 miles upstream from \nthe city of Glendive. Now local residents are reporting that their \nwater smells like diesel fuel. The officials tested the water in \nGlendive and found oil in the drinking water and along with it elevated \nlevels of benzene, a cancer-causing agent.\n  That is what is under consideration with this amendment, making sure \nthat all of the parties responsible--no matter where they are from--\nwould pay their fair share when they put our citizens' health and \nsafety at risk.\n  The double standard--the standard that is much more exacting on our \ndomestic producers than it is on the Canadian tar sands producers--\nought to be fixed.\n  Tar sands oil producers ought to pay into the same fund as other oil \nproducers to clean up the spills. Because, make no mistake about it, at \nthe end of the day, without this amendment that closes the tar sands \nloophole, Canadian tar sands oil will keep getting a free ride.\n  The last point I want to mention, is just to put this issue in \ncontext. Before I chaired the Senate Finance Committee in the last \nCongress, I had the honor of chairing the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. In session after session of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, proponents of the pipeline said: We have got to \nhave this to lower gas prices. If we are really going to lower gas \nprices, said the proponents--this was session after session after \nsession--we have got to build the pipeline.\n  Well, we have all seen that prices have fallen dramatically. To a \ngreat extent it is due to exciting developments in the Bakken and \nothers. We are now essentially the Saudi Arabia of oil production. This \nis good news. This is like a tax cut for working-class families across \nthe country.\n  One of the judgments I reached in making the decision to oppose the \npipeline is I did not think it made much sense to tamper with something \nthat was such a promising development as real rate relief at the pump. \nA fair number of experts--yes, there is a difference of opinion, but a \nfair number of experts--are concerned that the pipeline, if it is \nbuilt, could actually raise prices, particularly for vulnerable parts \nof the country. The Midwest could be one, but certainly there could be \nothers.\n  So I had reservations about this from a variety of standpoints, \nincluding the standpoint that tar sands are a very carbon-dense \nmaterial. But I am particularly concerned tonight about the inequity of \nthe tar sands loophole, where the Canadians get a free ride at the \nexpense of communities all across the Nation.\n  My amendment would close this flagrant abuse, close this loophole, \nhelp us put our tax priorities in order, and protect American citizens \nand American communities, rather than giving an undeserved advantage to \nforeign oil.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment, to reform the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, to clarify that those products derived \nfrom tar sands are crude oil for purposes of the Federal excise tax on \npetroleum. I hope this amendment will generate bipartisan support. No \nmatter how a Senator feels with respect to the pipeline, I do not see \nhow you can make the case that you should not correct something that \ndefies common sense.\n  Before the Presiding Officer came in, I made mention that right now \nthe absence of the amendment that I offer puts a disadvantage--a \nserious disadvantage--on all of America's domestic producers. We did an \nawful lot to make it possible for Americans to get relief at the pump. \nThat does not make any sense. So I hope my colleagues tomorrow will \nsupport this amendment on a bipartisan basis to close a flagrant tax \nloophole, to end what amounts to an inequity that hurts at a minimum \nour producers, but puts at risk our communities needlessly.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The clerk will call the roll\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE.

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, let me talk a little bit this evening about \namendment No. 77 that I filed. This is an amendment I filed to the bill \nthat is pending that we are now on, what I would call the oil sands \npipeline. It has been called a jobs bill, I know, on the other side. \nBut, you know, the reality is, there are good construction jobs here. \nBut as soon as the pipeline is built, the permanent jobs are really \nvery small.\n  What we need to do--my belief--in terms of energy, is work to where \nthere are larger numbers of jobs. I do not\n\n[[Page S337]]\n\nknow whether people know this, but the energy that is being added to \nthe system now worldwide and in the United States is renewable energy. \nSometimes it is wind, sometimes it is solar, to a lesser extent \nbiofuels, biomass and things like that. But the renewable sector is \ngrowing. The new energy is growing. Some of this is rather dramatic in \nterms of the numbers and the size. That is the direction clearly we \nneed to head, because we want to in the future be lessening our carbon \nfootprint. There is absolutely no dispute that we need to be moving in \nthat direction. That is where all the scientists are.\n  We are even seeing today in the amendments that we have on the floor \nour friends across the aisle agreeing that we have got a real problem \nwith climate change and that human beings are causing this and we need \nto address this. I applaud them stepping forward and saying that. How \ndo you do this? How do you encourage more of the renewable forms of \nenergy?\n  Let me say before I get into that, my hope is to have a discussion \nwith the two Senators who are on side who are leading the debate here, \nSenator Boxer and Senator Cantwell, about offering this amendment and \ngetting in line in the next tranche of amendments.\n  But how do you get moving in the direction of more renewable energy? \nWell, we already know we have got a very good pattern here. We have \nstarted in the States and started in the District of Columbia, where \nmore than half of our States in the United States of America have \nadopted what have been called renewable electricity standards. New \nMexico has one. We have 15 percent by 2015. Some of our bigger States \nhave been more aggressive. States such as California and New York are \nreally pushing the envelope. They are saying by about 2025 we are going \nto have 30 percent or close to 30 percent renewable energy. So, really, \nwhat they are doing by putting a standard in place is they are saying \nto their power companies in their State: This is important to do. We \nknow it is cost effective. Go out and develop your portfolio so that \nyou put more renewable energy in it.\n\n  The remarkable thing, looking around the country, is how many States \nhave done this. We have seen 29 States, I believe, including the \nDistrict of Columbia, for a number of years now that have put a \nrenewable electricity standard in place. So that is something that we \nknow is working at the State level.\n  In fact, my Senator from New Mexico--who retired just a couple of \nyears ago, Senator Bingaman--one of the things he did was go out to \nStanford and study all of these renewable electricity standards that \nwere in place and came up with ideas on the best practices and where \nthere were disadvantages. He has actually published a report with a \nbunch of other researchers. So there is good wealth of knowledge about \nwhat is working and what isn't working.\n  But the major thing that is working is when we encourage a \nmarketplace in renewable energy. We don't necessarily call out winners \nand losers. I know that is something that on both sides of the aisle we \nobject to when we said: This is going to be a winning form, that is not \ngoing to be a winning form.\n  What we are doing is saying: Let's try to move toward renewables. \nLet's put a goal out there and then let's let the marketplace work on \nthat. Let's see innovation. Let's move forward down that road. We have \nseen the 29 States do it and the District of Columbia.\n  My proposal in this amendment--and it is one I have worked on--has a \ngood history. One of the things we know is when Senator Bingaman was in \nthe Senate and head of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, he \nwas able to pass through the Senate three times, over his career as \nchairman, a renewable electricity center out of the Senate.\n  When I was in the House of Representatives from 1998 to 2008, my \ncousin Mark Udall and I worked on a renewable electricity standard in \nthe House. For the first time we were able to get a bill through the \nHouse of Representatives. So our big challenge always was we were never \nable to match the House bill and the Senate bill and put in place \nsomething that a President can sign and have a national standard. That \nis where we are today. We have had good support, and really what this \namendment would do is set up a national marketplace. Many States across \nthe Nation, and almost every State, have renewable energy. If you go \ninto the South, it may be more biomass than it is of solar. If you go \nto the West and Midwest, it may be more wind and solar, but it depends \non location.\n  What is clear from all of the experts who looked at this is it is \nvery easy to focus on when you have a goal, and you say, in the case of \nthis amendment, by 2025, let's get 25 percent of our energy from \nrenewable sources. So if we have a goal like that, we could get there.\n  I am urging everybody to take a look at this amendment to see what it \nis that we should be doing.\n  If we are talking about moving down the road with this proposal that \nwe have before us, where we are scavenging, in a way, for the dirtiest \nforms of energy, these tar sands--which are much dirtier than the \nenvironmental impact statement said. Not only are they dirtier by about \n17 percent, but when you tear down all those forests, which are taking \ncarbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, you are putting yourself in a \nposition where you are headed down the wrong road in terms of easing \nour carbon footprint.\n  I ask all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a look \nat this amendment. I will visit with the leaders on the floor about \nthis amendment and see if we can't get it in line in terms of being \nconsidered.\n  This is an important debate about our energy future. There is a lot \nof work to be done. I hope we can work together.\n  We are at a crossroads in our energy policy. We can lead the world in \nclean energy production with wind, solar, and advanced biofuels. We can \nreduce global warming pollution. We can become energy independent--and \ncreate permanent American jobs.\n  That is our future. That should be our priority. We have the \ntechnology. We have the resources. We need the commitment. That is why \nwe need a national Renewable Electricity Standard. It takes us forward.\n  My amendment would require utilities to generate 25 percent of \nelectricity from renewable resources--by 2025.\n  There are many benefits to a national RES. It would create 300,000 \njobs. Over 50 percent of these jobs are in manufacturing. It would save \nconsumers $64 billion by 2025--and $95 billion by 2030--in their \nutility bills. There would be $263 billion in new capital investment. \nIt would provide over $13 billion to farmers, ranchers, and other \nlandowners in the form of lease payments, creating new economic \nactivity in rural communities across the U.S. It would add more than \n$11 billion in new local tax revenues--and revitalize communities, \nespecially rural communities.\n  I have pushed for this ever since I came to Congress. The House \npassed it. The Senate has passed a version of this three times.\n  New Mexico and over half the States already have an RES. The States \nare moving in that direction. The Nation needs to move in that \ndirection.\n  I have long said we need to do it all, and do it right as an energy \npolicy. That includes traditional energy sources. Oil and gas play an \nimportant role in my State. New Mexico is a leading producer of both. \nWe have strong, independent companies. They employ over 12,000 New \nMexicans. They help pay for our schools and other public services.\n  We invested in the oil industry. We also need to invest in wind, \nsolar, and biofuels.\n  The U.S. has incredible wind energy potential--enough to power the \nNation 10 times over. My State has some of the best wind resources in \nthe Nation--enough to meet more than 73 times the State's current \nelectricity needs.\n  Wind power has almost no carbon pollution. It uses virtually no \nwater. It already saves folks in my State 470 million gallons of water \na year.\n  The U.S. solar industry employs more than 143,000 Americans--more \nthan coal and natural gas combined. Solar jobs grew 10 times faster \nthan the national average.\n  These are well-paying, local jobs. These are permanent jobs, and they \nwon't be shipped overseas.\n\n[[Page S338]]\n\n  Now is the time to build on the momentum and invest in a clean energy \neconomy. Now is the time to create energy at home and jobs at home--\nnow, not later. We can't lose this market to our overseas competitors \nin Germany, China, and elsewhere. They can see the future too--and they \nare going after it.\n  A national Renewable Electricity Standard gives certainty to \nbusiness, to companies that are looking to invest billions of dollars \nin our economy, to manufacture wind turbines, solar panels, and other \nrenewable energy components.\n  We have a great opportunity to grow our manufacturing sector, to \ncreate jobs, and to move toward a cleaner energy future.\n  This is a new Congress. Let's find common ground, and let's move \nforward.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 78 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Blunt, I ask \nunanimous consent to call up amendment No. 78, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Ms. Murkowski], for Mr. Blunt, for \n     himself and Mr. Inhofe, proposes an amendment numbered 78 to \n     amendment No. 2.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the conditions \n   for the President entering into bilateral or other international \n agreements regarding greenhouse gas emissions without proper study of \n  any adverse economic effects, including job losses and harm to the \n       industrial sector, and without the approval of the Senate)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING BILATERAL OR OTHER \n                   INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS REGARDING GREENHOUSE \n                   GAS EMISSIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) On November 11, 2014, President Barack Obama and \n     President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China \n     announced the ``U.S.-China Joint Announcement on Climate \n     Change and Clean Energy Cooperation'' (in this section \n     referred to as the ``Agreement'') reflecting ``the principle \n     of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective \n     capabilities, in light of different national circumstances''.\n       (2) The Agreement stated the United States intention to \n     reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by one-quarter by 2025 \n     while allowing the People's Republic of China to double its \n     greenhouse gas emissions between now and 2030.\n       (3) While coal fired electricity remains the least \n     expensive energy alternative, the reduction of coal use \n     because of the Agreement would result in a 25 percent \n     increase in electricity prices in the United States in 2025, \n     according to analysis conducted by the Energy Information \n     Administration.\n       (4) The people of China will not see similar electricity \n     price increases as they continue to use low cost coal without \n     limit for the foreseeable future, at least until 2030.\n       (5) Increases in the price of electricity can cause job \n     losses in the United States industrial sector, which includes \n     manufacturing, agriculture, and construction.\n       (6) The price of electricity is a top consideration for job \n     creators when locating manufacturing facilities, especially \n     in energy-intensive manufacturing such as steel and aluminum \n     production.\n       (7) Requiring mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in \n     the United States while allowing nations such as China and \n     India to increase their greenhouse gas emissions results in \n     jobs moving from the United States to other countries, \n     especially to China and India, and is economically unfair.\n       (8) Imposing disparate greenhouse gas emissions commitments \n     for the United States and countries such as China and India \n     is environmentally irresponsible because it results in \n     greater emissions as businesses move to countries with less \n     stringent standards.\n       (9) Union members, families, consumers, communities, and \n     local institutions like schools, hospitals, and churches are \n     hurt by the resulting job losses.\n       (10) The poor, the elderly, and those on fixed incomes are \n     hurt the most by the President's promised increased \n     electricity rates.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Agreement negotiated between the President and the \n     President of the People's Republic of China has no force and \n     effect in the United States;\n       (2) the Agreement between the President and the President \n     of the People's Republic of China is a bad deal for United \n     States consumers, workers, families, and communities, and is \n     economically unfair and environmentally irresponsible;\n       (3) the Agreement, as well as any other bilateral or \n     international agreement regarding greenhouse gas emissions \n     such as the United Nation's Framework Convention on Climate \n     Change in Paris in December 2015, requires the advice and \n     consent of the Senate and must be accompanied by a detailed \n     explanation of any legislation or regulatory actions that may \n     be required to implement the Agreement and an analysis of the \n     detailed financial costs and other impacts on the economy of \n     the United States which would be incurred by the \n     implementation of the Agreement;\n       (4) the United States should not be a signatory to any \n     bilateral or other international agreement on greenhouse \n     gases if it would result in serious harm to the economy of \n     the United States; and\n       (5) the United States should not agree to any bilateral or \n     other international agreement imposing disparate greenhouse \n     gas commitments for the United States and other countries.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we are wrapped up here for the evening \nso far as amendments, and I just want to thank colleagues for the \ndiscussion we have had today, the opportunity to bring forward some \nissues that clearly generate their own level of passion and emotion, \nand again the chance to bring forth issues we have been waiting for \nsome period of time to have before us.\n  While some may suggest these are hard issues and hard votes to take, \nnobody ever said voting should be easy here in the Senate. The issues \nthat come before us are issues the Nation considers and that we as \ntheir representatives should take seriously. So sometimes there are \nhard votes, and we will argue and debate over the wording and \ncritically, and that is appropriate.\n  So again, looking forward to tomorrow, we have an opportunity to have \nnow eight amendments that will be pending tomorrow afternoon, and I \nlook forward to the continued discussion and a new day.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Becky \nLockhart, former Speaker of the Utah House of Representatives, who \ntragically passed away on January 17, after a brief battle with a rare \nand devastating disease.\n  Becky Lockhart was the first woman to serve as Speaker of the House \nin the State of Utah. She did so in a truly extraordinary manner. She \nestablished a pattern of leadership that will be a model and a guide \nfor wise legislative leaders in our State and across this great Nation \nfor many, many years to come.\n  I affectionately yet admiringly refer to Speaker Lockhart as the iron \nlady of Utah as she possessed so many of the qualities of the original \niron lady, Margaret Thatcher. Grounded in conservative principles, \npassionate about policy, and committed to federalism and local control, \nshe knew where she stood and she stood firm every single time.\n  She followed the admonition of another great leader in American \npolitics, Abraham Lincoln, who said, ``I will stand with anybody that \nstands right, stand with him while he is right and part with him when \nhe goes wrong.''\n  Professionally trained as a nurse, Speaker Lockhart also understood \nthe\n\n[[Page S339]]\n\nsofter yet equally important gifts of compassion and concern, as well \nas listening and laughter. Even in the most heated discussion, she \ncould change a room with a flash of her charismatic smile, a wink and a \ngrin, or even some well-worded sarcasm to provide a little bit of \nlevity.\n  Combining her nurse's intuition and strong leadership made her the \nperfect combination of satin and steel. She could and would and did \nstand up to any political or business bureaucracy, forcefully correct a \ncolleague, rebuke an inaccurate report, and challenge the small-minded \nideas and thinkers. Less reported was her impact and influence as a \nmentor to new members of the Utah House of Representatives, her work in \nhelping more women become involved in the political process, and how \nshe gave voice to those who did not have a strong voice of their own.\n  Above all, Speaker Lockhart looked out for, longed to be with, \ncherished and loved her family. She knew that the work she did in the \nwalls of her own home was the most important work she would or could \never do. Becky also recognized that family is the bulwark of society \nand the strength of our Nation.\n  More than the ink of good press and the accolades of others, Speaker \nLockhart knew that her most important legacy would not be recorded in \nhistory books, it would not be recorded in the Utah State code that has \nso many of her words written on it. No, it would be written in the \nhearts of her family and her friends.\n  I have been lifted by Becky Lockhart's leadership, inspired by her \ninsight and her integrity, and encouraged by her commitment to the U.S. \nConstitution, and her love of country and am most blessed to call her \nmy friend. Speaker Becky Lockhart, the iron lady of Utah, will indeed \nbe heralded for her satin-and-steel leadership in the Utah House of \nRepresentatives. She will indeed be remembered for all that she did, \nbut more significantly she will hold a special place in countless \nhearts because of who she was.\n  I pay tribute to this special person, this amazing leader, and this \nbeloved friend, whose loss we mourn this very week, and who some \nMembers of this body were privileged to know. It is my honor to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, let me say to my cousin, my heart goes out \nto you, and my condolences on what you have talked about here today. I \nreally appreciate you coming down and talking so sincerely about that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am grateful for the opportunity to pay \ntribute to a remarkable woman, a loving wife, and a caring mother--\nformer Utah Speaker of the House Rebecca ``Becky'' Lockhart.\n  After weeks of battling a rare degenerative disease, Becky quietly \npassed away on January 17, 2015, with her loving family gathered at her \nbedside. Becky leaves behind a legacy of leadership and passionate \nadvocacy that will resonate for years to come. It was this same passion \nand resilience that defined her tenure as Speaker of the Utah House. \nShe was a dedicated public servant who always rose to meet our State's \nchallenges with wisdom and strength.\n  Becky's career was a model of selfless service. Guided by a desire to \nhelp others, she studied nursing at Brigham Young University. Before \nentering public service, Becky worked as a registered nurse for 7 \nyears, during which time she treated thousands of patients and became \nintimately familiar with health care issues affecting Utah families. \nHer experience as a nurse would later shape her career as a legislator, \nand as Speaker of the House, she became a powerful advocate for State-\nbased health care reform. I had the opportunity to discuss these and \nmany other issues with Becky throughout the years. In doing so, I was \nalways impressed with her eloquence, her intelligence, and her \ncommitment to the State of Utah.\n  Becky was first elected to the Utah House of Representatives in 1998, \nand she quickly distinguished herself as a persuasive collaborator, a \npassionate legislator, and one of the hardest-working representatives \nin the legislature. Her colleagues recognized her leadership abilities \nand elected her Assistant Majority Whip in 2008. Just 2 years later, \nBecky made history when she became the first women to serve as Speaker \nof the House in Utah. Through her remarkable career, she trail-blazed a \npath for generations of women to follow and became known as Utah's \n``Iron Lady.''\n  Utah grew under Becky's leadership. She championed legislation that \nmodernized our State's transportation system, strengthened our \ninfrastructure, and promoted technological advancement. During her last \nyear as Speaker, she spearheaded an ambitious education initiative \naimed at putting technology directly into the hands of Utah students. \nHer leadership spurred a much-needed discussion on ways to improve \nUtah's education system to equip our students with the resources they \nneed to succeed academically.\n  Many are familiar with Becky's public life, but of even greater \nimportance was her personal life. Before she was House Speaker and even \nbefore she became a well-known political figure, Becky was, first and \nforemost, a wonderful wife and a loving mother. Becky and her husband, \nStan, created a strong partnership in politics and in parenthood as \nthey lovingly raised their three children, Hannah, Emily, and Stephen. \nI know that Stan and his family will miss Becky most of all. During \nthis time of heartrending loss, I pray that they may feel the \ncomforting embrace of God's love and find peace in the memories they \nshare with this remarkable woman.\n  I, too, will miss Becky dearly. May her memory always serve as a \nmodel of compassion, selflessness, and dedicated public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/21/senate-section/article/S339-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S339-S341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

This rule \n     is not intended to broaden, narrow, or otherwise modify the \n     class of projects or legislative proposals for which \n     environmental impact statements are required under section \n     102(2)(C).\n       (b) Project Approvals:\n       (1) Whenever the committee authorizes a project under \n     Public Law 89-298, the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1965; Public \n     Law 83-566, the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention \n     Act; or Public Law 86-249, the Public Buildings Act of 1959, \n     as amended; the chairman shall submit for printing in the \n     Congressional Record, and the committee shall publish \n     periodically as a committee print, a report that describes \n     the project and the reasons for its approval, together with \n     any dissenting or individual views.\n       (2) Proponents of a committee resolution shall submit \n     appropriate evidence in favor of the resolution.\n       (c) Building Prospectuses:\n       (1) When the General Services Administration submits a \n     prospectus, pursuant to section 7(a) of the Public Buildings \n     Act of 1959, as amended, for construction (including \n     construction of buildings for lease by the government), \n     alteration and repair, or acquisition, the committee shall \n     act with respect to the prospectus during the same session in \n     which the prospectus is submitted.\n       A prospectus rejected by majority vote of the committee or \n     not reported to the Senate during the session in which it was \n     submitted shall be returned to the General Services \n     Administration and must then be resubmitted in order to be \n     considered by the committee during the next session of the \n     Congress.\n       (2) A report of a building project survey submitted by the \n     General Services Administration to the committee under \n     section 11(b) of the Public Buildings Act of 1959, as \n     amended, may not be considered by the committee as being a \n     prospectus subject to approval by committee resolution in \n     accordance with section 7(a) of that Act. A project described \n     in the report may be considered for committee action only if \n     it is submitted as a prospectus in accordance with section \n     7(a) and is subject to the provisions of paragraph (1) of \n     this rule.\n       (d) Naming Public Facilities: The committee may not name a \n     building, structure or facility for any living person, except\n\n[[Page S341]]\n\n     former Presidents or former Vice Presidents of the United \n     States, former Members of Congress over 70 years of age, \n     former Justices of the United States Supreme Court over 70 \n     years of age, or Federal judges who are fully retired and \n     over 75 years of age or have taken senior status and are over \n     75 years of age.\n\n                       Rule 8.

PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n       (A) Each Presidential nominee whose nomination is subject \n     to Senate confirmation and referred to this Committee shall \n     submit a statement of his or her background and financial \n     interests, including the financial interests of his or her \n     spouse and of children living in the nominee's household, on \n     a form approved by the Committee, which shall be sworn to as \n     to its completeness and accuracy. The Committee form shall be \n     in two parts:\n       (1) Information concerning employment, education, and \n     background of the nominee, which generally relates to the \n     position to which the individual is nominated and which is to \n     be made public; and\n       (2) Information concerning the financial and other \n     background of the nominee, to be made public when the \n     Committee determines that such information bears directly on \n     the nominee's qualifications to hold the position to which \n     the individual is nominated.\n       (B) At any hearing to confirm a Presidential nomination, \n     the testimony of the nominee and, at the request of any \n     Member, any other witness shall be under oath.\n       (C) Committee action on a nomination, including hearings or \n     a meeting to consider a motion to recommend confirmation, \n     shall not occur until at least five days (not counting \n     Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays) after the nominee \n     submits with respect to the currently pending nomination the \n     form required by this rule unless the Chairman, with the \n     concurrence of the Ranking Minority Member, waives this \n     waiting period.\n\n\n       VIII. NAMING OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS FACILITIES\n\n       It is the policy of the Committee that a Department of \n     Veterans Affairs facility may be named only after a deceased \n     individual and only under the following circumstances:\n       (A) Such individual was:\n       (1) A veteran who (i) was instrumental in the construction \n     or the operation of the facility to be named, or (ii) was a \n     recipient of\n\n[[Page S342]]\n\n     the Medal of Honor or, as determined by the Chairman and \n     Ranking Minority Member, otherwise performed military service \n     of an extraordinarily distinguished character;\n       (2) A Member of the United States House of Representatives \n     or Senate who had a direct association with such facility;\n       (3) An Administrator of Veterans' Affairs, a Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs, a Secretary of Defense or of a service \n     branch, or a military or other Federal civilian official of \n     comparable or higher rank; or\n       (4) An individual who, as determined by the Chairman and \n     Ranking Minority Member, performed outstanding service for \n     veterans.\n       (B) Each Member of the Congressional delegation \n     representing the State in which the designated facility is \n     located must indicate in writing such Member's support of the \n     proposal to name such facility after such individual. It is \n     the policy of the Committee that sponsoring or cosponsoring \n     legislation to name such facility after such individual will \n     not alone satisfy this requirement.\n       (C) The pertinent State department or chapter of each \n     Congressionally chartered veterans' organization having a \n     national membership of at least 500,000 must indicate in \n     writing its support of such proposal.\n\n\n                      IX. AMENDMENTS TO THE RULES\n\n       The rules of the Committee may be changed, modified, \n     amended, or suspended at any time provided, however, that no \n     less than a majority of the entire membership so determine at \n     a regular meeting with due notice or at a meeting \n     specifically called for that purpose. The rules governing \n     quorums for reporting legislative matters shall govern rules \n     changes, modification, amendments, or suspension.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/21/senate-section/article/S342-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S342-S344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        VERMONT ESSAY FINALISTS\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the \nRecord finalist essays written by Vermont High School students as part \nof the Fifth Annual ``What is the State of the Union'' Essay contest \nconducted by my office. These 20 finalists were selected from over 400 \nentries.\n  The essays follow.\n\n\n              Liam Gibbons, Milton High School (Finalist)\n\n       We learn in school and from our parents that America is the \n     land of opportunity. Yet that is not the case. When the \n     wealth gap is steadily increasing, as women earn 70 cents for \n     each dollar a man makes, as the U.S. government spends more \n     on defense than on its disenfranchised, the land of \n     opportunity seems no longer under boot, but instead a distant \n     reality. Equal protection under the laws for every citizen, \n     promoting the general welfare, rights to life, liberty, and \n     the pursuit of happiness. All of these things are printed on \n     our country's most sacred documents, these things which need \n     to be an attainable reality for every American.\n       Perhaps one of the most egregiously neglected groups in the \n     U.S. is women. Wage inequality combined with the control of \n     their own bodies in the hands of the government all add to \n     the fact that women are among the most disparaged people \n     within the U.S. Throughout America, women are denied the \n     right to a safe and constitutional abortion. Some of the \n     biggest contenders for the presidency have voiced their \n     belief that women shouldn't have this constitutional right \n     even in the context of rape or incest. Because of Roe v. \n     Wade, because of its constitutionality, a safe abortion \n     should be as accessible to the women in Texas as much as the \n     women in Vermont.\n       A law needs to standardize how abortion clinics are made \n     and run, and if there is an issue regarding states' rights \n     and federalism, then an amendment must be made. Because not \n     only are women not currently in control of their own bodies, \n     they also lack the ability to earn equal wages as men. In \n     1977, the Equal rights amendment lost by the votes of three \n     states. Who in their right minds would vote against equal \n     rights in 2015. In order to ensure true equality and civil \n     rights bring back the ERA, and this time ratify it.\n       Another group of people who lack this promised opportunity \n     is the poor. Most Americans are employed, but many of them \n     aren't earning livable wages. An American shouldn't have to \n     work three jobs to support their family. An American \n     shouldn't have to ride a bus three hours a day in order to \n     work for privatized welfare. An American should be able to \n     work for 40 hours a week, and be able to live comfortably. \n     And this is possible if we raise the minimum wage so that it \n     equates to a livable wage. However, no American should not \n     have to strive for the minimum, each citizen should have a \n     chance at exceeding, each American should be able to go to \n     college.\n       In Germany, in Sweden, in Norway college is free. In Syria, \n     a week of bombing by the U.S. costs the same as the tuition \n     of 40,000 American students. If we were to take a fraction of \n     our defense budget and give it to the impoverished for higher \n     education, if we were to reallocate the budget, we would be \n     seeing a lot more opportunity.\n\n\n              Eli Hulse, Vermont Commons School (Finalist)\n\n       As the United States moves into 2015, we have achieved many \n     things that have furthered the nation, and improved the \n     security of the people economically, socially, and \n     militarily. Some of these advancements include electing Janet \n     Yellen as the first female Chair of the Federal Reserve, \n     reducing the unemployment rate from 6.7 percent to 5.8 \n     percent; the lowest it has been since 2008, and helping \n     foreign forces fight against the militant group ISIS. \n     However, there are many problems that the United States faces \n     and needs to address over the next year.\n       The single most important issue that the United States \n     needs to recognize and correct is the disparity of income. \n     Although it is true that the gap in income causes problems \n     with equality between the social classes, there are concerns \n     that the percentage of income that the upper class has is \n     causing instability in the United States economy as a whole. \n     People who have more money do not spend as much of percentage \n     of it as poorer people, which means that that money sits in \n     savings accounts, and is not paid to businesses in return for \n     products. As the income gap widens, less money will be \n     introduced into the economy, and it will leave the economy in \n     a precarious position.\n       Another serious issue that the United States needs to \n     address is the spread of Ebola in Africa. Although domestic \n     cases of Ebola have been isolated and treated, an unstable \n     Africa would allow Ebola to potentially spread to the United \n     States and other countries, and could be catastrophic. It is \n     important that the United States government continues its \n     support of Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and other countries \n     that are struggling to create the infrastructure to treat \n     this deadly disease.\n       Finally, it is key that the United States continues its \n     resistance to terror threats both domestically and \n     internationally. Although currently not a direct threat to \n     the United States or to the general populous, ISIS has the \n     potential to cause great damage to the European Union and \n     eventually to the United States. A military force this size \n     has not been seen in a long time, and the influence that it \n     has in the countries it overtakes is alarming and needs to be \n     kept in check. The United States needs to keep this in mind \n     when making international policy decisions, and needs to \n     continue supporting countries that are actively fighting \n     ISIS.\n       The United States continues to be one of the largest \n     influencers on the international playing field. However, \n     policy makers need to keep in mind many domestic problems, \n     and begin working across the aisle in order to keep the \n     government of the United States secure and capable. 2014 has \n     seen a whole array of new policies, and these policies have \n     ensured the security of the American people. In 2015, new \n     policies will be created, that will hopefully fix some of the \n     problems in our society. God bless the United States of \n     America.\n\n\n      Kathy Joseph, Champlain Valley Union High School (Finalist)\n\n       America has undoubtedly grown in the past year, but the \n     many problems plaguing our nation continue to persist. The \n     United States economy is stronger. We added 300 thousand jobs \n     in November, the best in nearly three years. The unemployment \n     rate is at 5.8%, a post-recession low point. President Obama \n     struck a climate change deal with China--the two countries \n     with the largest energy consumptions agreed to curb their \n     carbon emissions by 2030. The war on terror in Afghanistan \n     officially ended. Relations with Cuba have been reopened, \n     which will make educational travel to Cuba easier and is a \n     new approach to dealing with the oppressive regime that is \n     currently leading Cuba.\n       All of these are steps America has taken in the past year \n     in the right direction. However, we still face many \n     challenges. The US has a growing income gap--the rich are \n     getting richer while the poor are getting poorer. This is \n     highlighted in the spending bill passed in December to \n     prevent the government shutdown. In it there were several \n     provisions to cut welfare spending, such as Medicare and \n     spending on the Women and Children support while there was \n     another provision essentially written by the banks to reverse \n     the Dodd Frank act. That act was written after the recession, \n     but now things will go back to the way they were. Lobbyists \n     for banks and for the wealthy have louder voices in \n     Washington. Over 50% of Congress people are millionaires, \n     while millionaires make up only 5% of the US population. This \n     helps explain why income inequality is only getting worse, \n     and is something that the American people must change.\n       It is harder for students to afford college. Student loans \n     are not of importance in Washington, which is something that \n     needs to be changed. More people are afraid of the debt they \n     will be in after getting their degree, and would rather start \n     working out of high school. This is not the path we should be \n     going on, and it is time for Congress to start listening to \n     the students and prioritizing education.\n       The media have recently brought the nation's attention to \n     police brutality, racial discrimination, and our broken \n     criminal justice system. President Obama allocated $263 \n     million for police body cameras and training, which is an \n     acknowledgement of the need for reform but does not solve the \n     root problem. Although there was footage available for the \n     strangling of Eric Garner, the officer had no charges filed \n     against him. These injustices seem to be occurring only more \n     frequently, and Congress should focus its attention on real \n     solutions that will lead to demilitarization of the police \n     and a stop to the criminal\n\n[[Page S343]]\n\n     justice system disproportionately affecting minority groups.\n       We are still moving forward as a nation, but in 2015 we \n     must work to reverse trends such as the growing income gap, \n     increased police brutality, and losing sight of our \n     priorities. There is still hope for a brighter future if we \n     remember what values America really stands for.\n\n\n   Emily (Emery) Mead, Missisquoi Valley Union High School (Finalist)\n\n       As a young Vermonter, just getting ready to begin my \n     college journey, there are some concerns that trouble me most \n     about the future of our country. Please consider my advice as \n     you prepare your address on the state of our union. My main \n     concern is about how the transgender community is treated in \n     America. Things have gotten better for them, but there's \n     still quite a bit of discrimination against transgender \n     people. Many people don't think trans folk deserve rights, \n     but they're still just humans. I am a part of this community \n     so I know about its difficulties personally. I am physically \n     female but I identify as male.\n       One of the difficulties I have is the bathrooms and I'm not \n     the only one, it's one of the biggest problems for us. I am \n     literally terrified to go to the bathroom at school and in \n     other public places because I use the men's bathroom and \n     every time I do I'm afraid I will be ridiculed or kicked out \n     and have been confronted by kids telling me to stay out of \n     the guys bathroom at school. No one should be afraid to pee.\n       I don't have it that bad, for some people it's a lot worse. \n     A friend of mine came out as transgender to his family and \n     they kicked him out and disowned him. Luckily he has a very \n     supporting girlfriend who he's currently living with and good \n     friends who helped him with his struggles. Some people don't \n     have that kind of support. Some are kicked out of their \n     houses or run away from abusive families to live on the dirty \n     streets and beg for money to pay for food or to buy a blanket \n     to keep them warm on cold nights. An article about gay and \n     transgender youth homelessness on americanprogress.org gives \n     these stats which I have paraphrased; There is an estimated \n     1.6 million to 2.8 million homeless youth in the United \n     States; 20 to 40 percent of that are gay or transgender kids; \n     an estimated 320,000 to 400,000 gay and transgender youth are \n     facing homelessness each year. Some are lucky enough to find \n     a shelter or housing for transgender people, but not everyone \n     lives near one or knows about one near them. It's not right \n     for these kids to have no place to sleep.\n       These problems are very serious and need to be addressed \n     and fixed. A possible solution for the bathroom problem is to \n     fund more unisex bathrooms in more public places; I strongly \n     believe this will help reduce the awkwardness and fear of \n     going to the bathroom; even for those who are just \n     uncomfortable with using public bathrooms. As for the shelter \n     problem, putting more of these shelters around the country \n     and making them more advertised and well known these kids \n     won't be forced to live on the streets anymore.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n\n\n               Alicia Muir, Milton High School (Finalist)\n\n       As a global powerhouse, the United States is bestowed with \n     a responsibility. This country stands upon its obligation and \n     ability to be innovative, to provide opportunity and to \n     maintain a respectable quality of living for every citizen. I \n     would like to take this moment to address where we stand on \n     these principles and how far we still have to go.\n       In our current state, economic problems are most apparent. \n     While the economy rests in a steady stage of recovery, many \n     of our neighbors struggle to obtain and secure an adequate \n     standard of living. We can try to justify yearly improvement \n     by pointing out that unemployment rates and gas prices are \n     down. But despite such progress, the standard of living is \n     always increasing. Paired with this fact is the abundant \n     number of citizens who struggle to survive on a wage that is \n     not livable. The obvious action to take is to raise the \n     federal minimum wage, which has been set at $7.25 since 2009. \n     For a single person working 40 hours a week, the basic costs \n     of food, housing, medical care, utilities, and other \n     necessary expenses should be attainable with the lowest \n     margin of pay. As of now, it is not. Starting in 2015, many \n     states have already decided to raise their minimum wage. If \n     we increase the pay benchmark on the federal level, every \n     state will have to do the same.\n       When high school graduates are launched into adulthood, \n     college is the promising route that comes with a discouraging \n     debt sentence. Higher education is needed to be competitive \n     in the job market. Rather than pouring mass amounts of money \n     into defense spending and other well budgeted programs, \n     legislators should create a larger budget for student loans \n     and grants. I urge the United States to make college more \n     accessible. In addition to the budget, the federal government \n     can offer incentives for universities that will encourage \n     them to administer greater financial aid packages and cut \n     tuition costs. Specific criteria can even be established to \n     provide free education to certain financial groups based on \n     their low incomes.\n       Transitioning to a problem that is often neglected, I \n     believe that as a country we must address the gender wage \n     gap. To this day, a vast majority of women make on average \n     only 75% of what men make. First, the United States has to \n     establish a paid pregnancy leave at the standard of other \n     industrialized nations. This will allow women to balance \n     earning a sustainable income and raising a family. We can \n     also regulate companies that retaliate against workers who \n     discuss their wages, as well as increase the limitations on \n     gender based pay discrimination. It's time to finally stop \n     employers from paying less for equal work. Let us break down \n     the glass ceiling.\n       To affirm that these programs will take place, and that \n     these solutions will triumph, it is vital that the Congress \n     disregards the party polarization that has crippled the \n     government for so long. With collaboration and determination, \n     the United States can prosper and prevail.\n\n\n            Curtis Richardson, Milton High School (Finalist)\n\n       My country, our country, is something I love and wish that \n     everyone within its borders receives the highest amount of \n     happiness possible and lives a life well fed and secure.\n       With that said an issue not talked about as much as it \n     should. Homelessness. People spend their nights in cold dark \n     alleyways covered only by the warmth of the Sunday paper. \n     Shelters are full, stomachs empty. There are children who are \n     homeless. There should never be a child without a warm place \n     to sleep. By enacting programs which employ the homeless, and \n     renovating buildings that serve no purpose, transforming them \n     into shelters and low income housing we can find a solution \n     to this problem and make sure that every American does not \n     have to worry where they are going to sleep.\n       The poverty level in the United States is at 14.5 percent \n     42,000,000 Americans. A percentage that is entirely too high. \n     A percentage of those Americans may work well over 40 hours a \n     week, put in overtime and are yet still unable to rise above \n     the poverty level. This is because the national minimum wage \n     is at $7.25. The minimum wage is not a livable wage. By \n     raising the national minimum wage to over $10 we can make \n     sure that those hard working Americans are not living below \n     the poverty line.\n       There is always a need for jobs in America. Many jobs are \n     being outsourced for big business to make more money. By \n     federally regulating how much a company can outsource jobs \n     from America we can make companies open more factories in \n     America and by doing so will open the way for more jobs \n     spread throughout these United States.\n       While there are many domestic issues that are very \n     important there are international ones as well. With the \n     terrorist group Isis still at large we must ensure the \n     security of citizens in the United States and places \n     overseas. That is why we will have troops ready to be \n     deployed. As long as there is a terrorist presence we will \n     protect the people of the United States and its allies.\n       Bees are needed in order to pollinate flowers and grow many \n     of the foods we eat. The bees are dying off and without them \n     many of the foods we eat will increase in price and will \n     deplete. Opening bee farms in America and increasing the bee \n     population we can save many crops and flowers that the bees \n     greatly assist with, and the federal government would also be \n     assisting those small bee farmers who may be running low on \n     business and this will be supporting the hard working \n     Americans and not big business.\n       This cannot be accomplished alone. It will take the country \n     as a whole cooperating with one another to make everything \n     here into a reality. Working past party lines and finding an \n     answer that's the best solution will ensure that these \n     problems are solved.\n\n\n      Friedemann Schmidt, Brattleboro Union High School (Finalist)\n\n       Under the presidency of Ronald Reagan the United States \n     turned within four years from the biggest creditor nation in \n     the world in 1981 to the world's largest debtor in 1985. \n     Supported by numerous foreign assignments of the U.S. Armed \n     forces, the public debt increased constantly, reaching a \n     figure of $18 trillion in recent years. This is a very \n     serious issue for the United States not only because it \n     deepens the dependence on creditor nations like China or \n     Saudi Arabia which neglect values like freedom and equality, \n     but also it directly affects everyone.\n       In 2013 the interest payments of the U.S. public debt made \n     up 6% of the federal budget excluding an actual debt \n     reduction. With a steadily growing budget deficit, primarily \n     due to outrageous defense spending, that figure will even \n     form a larger part of the annual budget plan. Presumably that \n     will lead to cuts in secondary areas like education, \n     transportation and social as well as scientific endeavors. \n     This symbolizes a threat to the belief of the founding \n     fathers in equality and perhaps makes a myth of the United \n     States offering fair chances for everyone, regardless of \n     status.\n       By decreasing the governmental funding of social programs, \n     like the free/reduced meal program offering meals to 20% of \n     food insecure students in Vermont, the living status of \n     numerous hard-working middle and lower class would drop. A \n     declining federal funding of universities and colleges \n     throughout the country would further increase the college \n     tuition for individuals, creating an unaffordable higher \n     education for hundreds of thousands of young, talented \n     Americans--a problem America already faces.\n       The social injustice created by enlarging the gap between \n     rich and poor, would weaken the unity of the United States as \n     much as decreasing the funding of America's world-\n\n[[Page S344]]\n\n     leading role in science and innovation, the key to economic \n     success and human progress itself. Former Secretary of Labor \n     Robert Reich states that due to the fact that ``Inequality \n     has become worse, the danger to the economy and democracy had \n     become worse.''\n       The public debt will be one of the major challenges for \n     United States politics in the near future. Facing it will \n     have to lead to changes of American policies and its lead in \n     world policy. Priorities have to be set and compromises have \n     to be made. Martin Luther King Jr. once said: ``A nation that \n     continues year after year to spend more money on military \n     defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching \n     spiritual death.'' It is the responsibility of every U.S. \n     citizen to prevent that in order to maintain the prosperity \n     and values for which America stands.\n\n\n               Sophia Seman, Essex High School (Finalist)\n\n       As our nation ages and evolves, the problems it faces \n     become more complex. Some of the greatest challenges we face \n     today are those of police brutality, a flawed naturalization \n     process, and the daunting cost of higher education.\n       In the past few months, cities in the US have erupted in \n     protests over police brutality. Starting in Ferguson, \n     marching feet have spread to New York and California. One \n     solution to the spreading mistrust in law enforcement is the \n     use of body cameras that would provide an account of each \n     interaction. While many speculate that this would be an \n     invasion of privacy, the departments that have tested these \n     devices decided the benefits outweigh the risks. Rialto, CA \n     has seen a ``60 percent reduction in officer use of force \n     incidents following camera deployment'' and an ``88 percent \n     reduction in number of citizen complaints''. The federal \n     government should issue categorical grants to any department \n     that opts to implement the use of this technology. The cost \n     to supply all the law enforcers with cameras may seem too \n     high, but eventually, the money saved in lawsuits would \n     counter the initial pay out.\n       This year, college students returned to school with \n     considerably lighter pockets, as state tuition climbed \n     another 2.9 percent. While many politicians realize the need \n     for a highly educated work force for the future economy, few \n     are willing to throw their weight behind the necessary \n     reforms to make it more affordable. If young adults are \n     expected to pay their way through college, they must have \n     viable options in student loans. Unfortunately, ``private \n     college loans are much cheaper than federal student loans \n     now''. It is the responsibility of our government to help \n     budding adults pay for higher education and mold themselves \n     into conscientious citizens by lowering federal interest \n     rates on loans.\n       The US has always been a nation of immigrants. However it \n     is the unfortunate American tradition that the newest wave of \n     immigrants is detested by those who have formed roots. Today \n     it is the Latinos who face a wave of prejudice. As much as it \n     pains some lawmakers to admit, we need the fresh faces and \n     new ideas as much as these prospective citizens need refuge \n     from the turmoil of their home country. It is time for a \n     renovation of the naturalization process. Because the US does \n     not have an official language and many new citizens site \n     English as ``one of the biggest obstacles'', the English \n     portion of the test should be eliminated. Questions \n     pertaining to civil rights should be emphasized on the Civics \n     Test, rather than superfluous ones about history, as citizens \n     should be more aware of their rights and responsibilities \n     than the War of 1812.\n       The most pressing issues facing the Union today are those \n     of police brutality, rising college and university costs and \n     the labyrinthine naturalization process. They demand quick, \n     effective solutions, such as police-worn cameras, lowered \n     interest rates on student loans, and a revised naturalization \n     test.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/21/senate-section/article/S344-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n   ORIGINALLY DECLARED ON JANUARY 23, 1995, WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN \n TERRORISTS WHO THREATEN TO DISRUPT THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS--PM 2\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nprovide for additional disclosure requirements for corporations, labor \norganizations, Super PACs and other entities, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the DISCLOSE \nAct of 2015.\n  Simply put, this bill would end the massive undisclosed spending in \nelections that is undermining public faith in our democracy, creating \nwhat one newspaper called ``a tsunami of slime.''\n  Today marks the 5-year anniversary of the Supreme Court's disastrous \n5-4 decision in Citizens United v. FEC. With that feat of judicial \nactivism, which will likely go down with Lochner v. New York as one of \nthe Supreme Court's worst decisions, the conservative bloc of the \nSupreme Court overturned the laws of Congress protecting our elections' \nintegrity, thwarted the will of the American people, and allowed \nunlimited anonymous corporate money to flood into our elections.\n  Worse still, even though the justices decided 8-1 that laws promoting \ndisclosure of outside spending were necessary and appropriate, \neverything that has happened since has shown a concerted effort to \nprevent and frustrate disclosure. So the billionaires and corporations \nspending tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars on elections can \ncontinue to do so with no public knowledge and no accountability.\n  The Citizens United decision hangs on a series of irretrievably \nflawed assertions. Among them is the premise that unlimited corporate \nexpenditures would be fine because there would be a regime of \n``effective disclosure'' that would ``provide shareholders and citizens \nwith the information needed to hold corporations and elected officials \naccountable for their positions and supporters.''\n  However, following Citizens United, that regime of ``effective \ndisclosure'' has completely broken down, with billionaires and \ncorporations spending unlimited secret money in elections. In the 2014 \nelections, the most expensive midterm elections in our history, with \nover $3.6 billion spent, the Washington Post reported that at least 31 \npercent of all independent spending was spent by groups that are not \nrequired to disclose their donors. And that doesn't even count spending \non so-called ``issue ads,'' which is also not reported.\n  The first line of defense for campaign finance laws is supposed to be \nthe Federal Election Commission. However, 5 years after the fact, the \nFEC just held a public meeting to consider rules to implement the \nCourt's decision in Citizens United, and incredibly, the commissioners \ndid not even consider rules to require disclosure.\n  That has left the problem largely to the Internal Revenue Service, \nbecause so many of the offending organizations are non-profits. And \nthey mangled this. First, they failed to investigate big non-profit \ngroups spending hundreds of millions of dollars on elections making \nwhat appeared to be illegal, material\n\n[[Page S350]]\n\nfalse statements about election spending on these IRS forms. Then the \nIRS singled out organizations for scrutiny based on words in their \nnames suggesting that they were politically active. Recently, the \nTreasury Department and the IRS proposed new rules to require \ndisclosure by 501(c)(4) groups. Along with fifteen of my colleagues, I \ncommended the effort to ensure disclosure by these non-profits. \nHowever, the IRS withdrew the proposed rules, and the latest reporting \nsays that new rules won't be ready for the 2016 elections, another \nfailure of disclosure.\n  The DISCLOSE Act would put some transparency into the ``tsunami of \nslime.'' The bill, which is unchanged from the version introduced last \nCongress, would require organizations spending money in elections--\nincluding super PACS and tax-exempt 501(c)(4) groups--to promptly \ndisclose donors who have given $10,000 or more during an election \ncycle. The bill includes robust transfer provisions to prevent \npolitical operatives from using complex webs of entities to game the \nsystem and hide donor identities. This is not a new idea. Many \nRepublicans, including several in the Senate, used to support \ndisclosure.\n  Senator Alexander has said, ``I support campaign finance reform, but \nto me that means individual contributions, free speech, and full \ndisclosure.''\n  ``I don't like it when a large source of money is out there funding \nads and is unaccountable,'' said Senator Sessions. ``To the extent we \ncan, I tend to favor disclosure.''\n  Or as Senator Cornyn put it, ``I think the system needs more \ntransparency, so people can more easily reach their own conclusions.''\n  Senator McConnell once summed it up nicely: ``Virtually everybody in \nthe Senate is in favor of enhanced disclosure, greater disclosure. \nThat's really hardly a controversial subject.''\n  And he was right--until Citizens United. Suddenly Republicans are \nfighting to keep the American people in the dark to protect their \nwealthy funders.\n  The high disclosure threshold and other provisions in the bill \nprotect membership organizations from having to disclose their member \nlists, and from having to disclose any donor who does not wish his or \nher contribution to be used for political purposes.\n  Our campaign finance system is broken. Immediate action is required \nto fix it. Americans of all political stripes are disgusted by the \ninfluence of unlimited, anonymous corporate cash in our elections, and \nby campaigns that succeed or fail depending on how many billionaires \nthe candidates have in their pockets.\n  Passing this law would remove the dark cloud of unlimited, anonymous \nmoney from our elections, and would prove to the American people that \nCongress is committed to fairness, equality, and the fundamental \nprinciple of a government ``of the people, by the people, and for the \npeople.'' As Republican former Federal Election Commission Chairman \nTrevor Potter has said, the DISCLOSE Act is ``appropriately targeted, \nnarrowly tailored, clearly constitutional and desperately needed.''\n  I thank our 35 cosponsors of this bill so far, and Representative Van \nHollen for introducing in the House, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the DISCLOSE Act of 2015.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 229\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. BLUNT (for himself and Mr. Inhofe) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by him to the bill S. 1, to approve the \nKeystone XL Pipeline; which was ordered to lie on the table; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING BILATERAL OR OTHER \n                   INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS REGARDING GREENHOUSE \n                   GAS EMISSIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) On November 11, 2014, President Barack Obama and \n     President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China \n     announced the ``U.S.-China Joint Announcement on Climate \n     Change and Clean Energy Cooperation'' (in this section \n     referred to as the ``Agreement'') reflecting ``the principle \n     of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective \n     capabilities, in light of different national circumstances''.\n       (2) The Agreement stated the United States intention to \n     reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by one-quarter by 2025 \n     while allowing the People's Republic of China to double its \n     greenhouse gas emissions between now and 2030.\n       (3) While coal fired electricity remains the least \n     expensive energy alternative, the reduction of coal use \n     because of the Agreement would result in a 25 percent \n     increase in electricity prices in the United States in 2025, \n     according to analysis conducted by the Energy Information \n     Administration.\n       (4) The people of China will not see similar electricity \n     price increases as they continue to use low cost coal without \n     limit for the foreseeable future, at least until 2030.\n       (5) Increases in the price of electricity can cause job \n     losses in the United States industrial sector, which includes \n     manufacturing, agriculture, and construction.\n       (6) The price of electricity is a top consideration for job \n     creators when locating manufacturing facilities, especially \n     in energy-intensive manufacturing such as steel and aluminum \n     production.\n       (7) Requiring mandatory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in \n     the United States while allowing nations such as China and \n     India to increase their greenhouse gas emissions results in \n     jobs moving from the United States to other countries, \n     especially to China and India, and is economically unfair.\n       (8) Imposing disparate greenhouse gas emissions commitments \n     for the United States and countries such as China and India \n     is environmentally irresponsible because it results in \n     greater emissions as businesses move to countries with less \n     stringent standards.\n       (9) Union members, families, consumers, communities, and \n     local institutions like schools, hospitals, and churches are \n     hurt by the resulting job losses.\n       (10) The poor, the elderly, and those on fixed incomes are \n     hurt the most by the President's promised increased \n     electricity rates.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n\n[[Page S354]]\n\n       (1) the Agreement negotiated between the President and the \n     President of the People's Republic of China has no force and \n     effect in the United States;\n       (2) the Agreement between the President and the President \n     of the People's Republic of China is a bad deal for United \n     States consumers, workers, families, and communities, and is \n     economically unfair and environmentally irresponsible;\n       (3) the Agreement, as well as any other bilateral or \n     international agreement regarding greenhouse gas emissions \n     such as the United Nation's Framework Convention on Climate \n     Change in Paris in December 2015, requires the advice and \n     consent of the Senate and must be accompanied by a detailed \n     explanation of any legislation or regulatory actions that may \n     be required to implement the Agreement and an analysis of the \n     detailed financial costs and other impacts on the economy of \n     the United States which would be incurred by the \n     implementation of the Agreement;\n       (4) the United States should not be a signatory to any \n     bilateral or other international agreement on greenhouse \n     gases if it would result in serious harm to the economy of \n     the United States; and\n       (5) the United States should not agree to any bilateral or \n     other international agreement imposing disparate greenhouse \n     gas commitments for the United States and other countries.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 79.

Mr. President, this week marks a somewhat dark \nmilestone, which is the 5-year anniversary of the Supreme Court's, in \nmy view, reprehensible decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election \nCommission. This was some fete of activism by the conservative bloc of \nthe Supreme Court. It overturned the laws of Congress, it overturned \nthe will of the American people, and it gave wildly outside influence \nover our elections to corporations and big-money interests, creating \nwhat one newspaper in Kentucky called a ``tsunami of slime.''\n  Well, 5 years on and the evidence is in. The evidence is in our \nelections, where this dam burst of outside cash that has wiped out \nprevious campaign spending records, and the evidence is in this \nChamber, where we once had a thriving bipartisan conversation on \nclimate change, and instead of that we have now been reduced to this \nKeystone XL Pipeline bill--a show of force from the fossil fuel \nindustry and virtual silence from the other side of the aisle on \nclimate change.\n  I will say that today marked an unusually bright spot in that \ndarkness when 98 out of 99 Senators voting voted that climate change \nwas real and not a hoax and when we came so close to an amendment that \nstated that climate change was real and caused by human activity that \nthe sponsor of the amendment had to vote against his own amendment in \norder to keep the number under 60 because there were enough votes at \none stage in the vote count for that bill to have passed even the \nfilibuster threshold. So that made it an interesting day today. But \nnormally we are in blockade.\n  The purpose of the effort that we have been on has been to fast-track \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline--a tar sands pipeline that may, at the present \noil price, be an economic zombie, basically a dead pipeline walking.\n  Canadian authorities say that the tar sands can't be extracted \nprofitably at under $85 a barrel. The report from the State Department \nsaid that the break price where they could take it out by train as an \nalternative to the pipeline was at $75 per barrel, and the price today \nis around $50 per barrel. So we really don't know whether this pipeline \nhas an economic future. What we do know is that if it were to operate, \nit would pass enough tar sands through it to unleash additional carbon \npollution equal to 6 million added cars on the road each year for 50 \nyears.\n  If we take a look at this conversation here, other than the votes we \nforced today, the effect of Citizens United on our politics is pretty \nplain to see. Citizens United has not expanded debate in the Senate; it \nhas crushed debate in the Senate. Why? Because since the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Citizens United, the big fossil fuel polluters and \ntheir network of associated interests have become among the biggest \nspenders--relying heavily, by the way, on undisclosed, untraceable dark \nmoney.\n  According to the Center for American Progress, oil, gas, and coal \ncompanies and electric utilities alone reported spending more than $84 \nmillion on the 2014 elections. And that is just what they reported. The \nindustry's undisclosed spending in that election through groups not \nrequired to disclose their donors or on so-called issue ads that don't \nneed to be disclosed--the total is estimated to be in the hundreds of \nmillions of dollars. Well, money talks, and in politics it talks plenty \nloud, and $100 million has a lot to say.\n\n[[Page S366]]\n\n  One example is Americans for Prosperity--a Koch brothers' venture--\ndisclosed election spending of $6.4 million to the FEC for last year's \nmidterm elections, but that group's own officials have boasted that the \nreal number is as much as $130 million--$130 million in just one \nelection by just one group. It is that kind of extravagant spending \nwhich has bought the Koch brothers a vast political network, with \nemployees in critical States, with voter bases tied into our consumer \ndata, with advertising and media-buying specialists. Indeed, that \nsophisticated Koch brothers electioneering capacity has now been \nreported in the general media to rival or exceed that of the Republican \nNational Committee. Think about that. A few very wealthy individuals in \nthe fossil fuel business--huge polluters--are now such big players in \nour politics that they rival our national parties. It is small wonder \nthat it is hard to have an honest conversation about carbon pollution \nin the Senate.\n  Most of it is hidden. The Washington Post has reported that at least \n31 percent of all independent spending in the 2014 elections--which \nwere, by the way, the most expensive midterm elections in American \nhistory. At least 31 percent of that was spent by groups not required \nto disclose their donors. The Washington Post also noted that the 31 \npercent doesn't even include those issue ads. They are also not \ndisclosed. So we don't know fully how bad the influence of the fossil \nfuel polluters is, but we sure know it is bad.\n  Interestingly, the same Supreme Court that decided Citizens United as \na part of that decision decided by a margin of 8 to 1 that disclosure \nof outside spending was necessary and appropriate. The majority said \nthis, and I will quote the decision:\n\n       Prompt disclosure of expenditures can provide shareholders \n     and citizens with the information needed to hold corporations \n     and elected officials accountable . . .\n\n  These intervening 5 years have seen a concerted effort to prevent and \nfrustrate disclosure. Dark money spending by so-called independent \ngroups with no disclosure requirements has more than doubled since \n2010.\n  Ludicrous factfinding by the Court's five conservative activists \nconcluded that corporate spending could not ever corrupt elections. It \nis laughable on its face, but that laughable conclusion also overlooks \na very clear fact: limitless, untraceable political money doesn't even \nhave to be spent to corrupt our democracy. It can corrupt through the \nthreat of spending or through the promise of spending. What Citizens \nUnited gave corporations and their political instruments the power to \ndo, it also gave them the power to threaten or promise to do, and we in \nthe public will never see those backroom corporate threats and promises \nor the deals that result. The candidate will know, the special \ninterests will know, but the public will be the ones left in the dark.\n\n  Some lobby groups are a little bolder. The Koch-backed Americans for \nProsperity openly promised to wipe out candidates who support curbs on \ncarbon pollution. The group's president said if the Republicans support \na carbon tax or climate regulations, they would ``be at a severe \ndisadvantage in the Republican nomination process. . . . We would \nabsolutely make that a crucial issue.''\n  The threat is plain. Step out of line and here come the attack ads \nand the primary challengers--all funded by the deep pockets of the \nfossil fuel industry, enabled by Citizens United and largely protected \nfrom disclosure, so the public cannot see what is going on.\n  The effect of Citizens United has been particularly clear in the \nSenate. There once was an active heartbeat of Republican activity on \nclimate change. Senator McCain ran for President on an active, robust \nprogram of addressing climate change. Senator Collins did a bipartisan \nbill on climate change. Senator Kirk voted in the House for the Waxman-\nMarkey cap-and-trade bill. Senator Flake wrote articles supporting a \ncarbon fee as long as the taxes were reduced elsewhere to offset the \nincreased revenue from the carbon fee and on and on. My first exposure \nto this was the Warner-Lieberman bill and the Warner was Republican \nSenator John Warner.\n  That has been a while. Since 2010, the year Citizens United was \ndecided, this honest debate about how we address this problem for the \nbenefit of the American people has flat-lined. Since 2010 the climate \nevidence has only become stronger. NASA and NOAA just officially \ndeclared 2014 the hottest year ever recorded--ever--easily breaking the \nprevious records, the agencies say.\n  But as the climate alarm bells grow louder, as the Earth sends her \nsignals to us through our scientists' measurements about what has \nhappened to the oceans, measuring the acidification of the oceans, \nabout what is happening in our atmosphere, measuring the carbon \nconcentrations in the atmosphere--as all that information has advanced, \nthere has been just silence in this building since then. Instead of \ntalking about what carbon pollution is doing to our atmosphere and \noceans, instead, No. 1, the first agenda of the new majority: We are \ntalking about letting polluters pump more tar sands crude, one of the \nmost toxic fossil fuels on the planet, out onto the global market. \nCitizens United did not enhance speech in our democracy. Instead it \nallowed wealthy special interests to suppress and silence real debate.\n  So I have filed an amendment to the Keystone bill to see what \ncorporate influence pervades this effort. My amendment would require \nany company that stands to make over $1 billion from the pipeline or \nfrom the development of the tar sands to disclose its campaign spending \nover $10,000 from the last election cycle and going forward. The public \nneeds to be able to connect the dots.\n  I am also reintroducing the general disclosure act, called the \nDISCLOSE Act, to require all groups spending on elections to report \ntheir large expenditures and their high-dollar donors. The Supreme \nCourt has said we cannot keep corporate interests from meddling in our \npopular elections. They are people, too, now. So now that the \ncorporations are people, too, let's at least show the voters who it is \nwho is trying to sway their votes. It is a pretty simple idea. It is \nwhat the Supreme Court Justices themselves prescribed, and it is an \nidea that Republicans over and over and over have supported in the \npast.\n  The fact we must face in the Senate is that polluter money has \npolluted our democracy, just as their carbon pollution has polluted our \natmosphere and oceans. So it is time to disclose. On climate change \nwhere we have an overwhelming scientific consensus, where we have the \nAmerican people, majorities of Democrats and Republicans, supporting \nstrong congressional action on climate, where we have American \nbusinesses small and large that see the folly of ignoring the looming \nrisk, and where we have the national security community, our Armed \nForces actively preparing to face the threat climate change poses to \nAmerican safety and international stability--here, by the way, just as \nan example, is the Department of the Army's high-level climate change \nvulnerability assessment. I don't think they are kidding us and I don't \nthink they are part of a hoax.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your patience this evening and I will \nconclude with the remark that I ordinarily conclude these speeches \nwith: It is time to wake up.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/21/senate-section/article/S366-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
