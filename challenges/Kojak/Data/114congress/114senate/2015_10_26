Madam President, I rise today to commemorate an important \nbut largely unheralded anniversary. Seventy years ago yesterday, \nPresident Harry Truman changed the design of the Presidential flag and \nseal. That moment, which is a small moment in the grand scope of \nAmerican history, was nevertheless very symbolic. I would like to \ndiscuss it.\n  First, some context on President Truman. Truman was a great wartime \nPresident. He fought bravely in World War I in France, and then he had \nto make very momentous decisions at the close of World War II. Some \nwould argue, and I think properly, that the decision on whether to use \natomic weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki might have been the single \nmost momentous decision ever made by a President. He wasn't even aware \nof the Manhattan Project and the development of the atomic weapons \nprogram until FDR died in April of 1945 and within a very few months \nhad to make the decision whether to use those weapons against Japan.\n  Nobody would question or challenge whether Harry Truman was a softy. \nIn fact, even after World War II, in March of 1947, America was war-\nweary, but he went to Congress and in an address to Congress said that \nwe need to continue to provide military and economic support to nations \nthat are battling against Soviet influence. In this case, it was the \nnations of Greece and Turkey. That began the Truman doctrine, the basic \nstrategic principle whereby the United States, for the next 40 years, \nwould sort of check off efforts by the Soviet Union to expand their \ninfluence. Harry Truman was a great wartime President.\n\n  Harry Truman did something on October 25, 1945, that was most \nunusual. He called the press into his office and said: Look what I have \ndone. He unveiled the fact that he had taken the seal and flag of the \nPresidency of the United States and redesigned them. That design is \nessentially the same today with the exception that two stars were added \nfor the States of Alaska and Hawaii that came in after the Truman \nPresidency.\n  The seal of the President, as everybody knows--if we look around the \nChamber, we can see some up on the wall here--was originally an eagle, \nand the eagle has two claws. In one set of claws the eagle is grasping \nthe arrows of war, and in the other set of claws, the eagle is grasping \nthe olive branches of peace and diplomacy. Prior to the Truman \nPresidency, the eagle faced toward the arrows of war. Harry Truman, \nthis great wartime President, changed the seal so the olive branches of \ndiplomacy would be in the right claw, the sort of preserved position, \nand the eagle would be facing toward the olive branches. When he did \nthis he said: ``This new flag faces the eagle toward the staff, which \nis looking to the front all of the time when you are on the march, and \nalso has it looking at the olive branch for peace, instead of the \narrows of war.'' Truman biographer David McCullough stated that Truman \nmeant the shift in the eagle's gaze to be seen as symbolic of a nation \nthat was on the march and dedicated to peace and diplomacy.\n  Significantly, right around the same time President Truman did \nsomething else that was notable and symbolical. He renamed the \nDepartment we think of as the Pentagon from the Department of War to \nthe Department of Defense, also symbolic of the Nation's postwar \ndedication to peace.\n  While we want to be the strongest--and we are the strongest military \nnation in the world, as the Presiding Officer knows so very well--we \nwant to always suggest to the world that our interest is not primarily \nwar; no, our interest is peace and prosperity for all.\n  We always have to preserve and advance America's military strength \nbecause we know the connection. Sometimes the better your military \nstrength, the more successful you can be diplomatically, but it is also \nthe case that the strength of your diplomacy can also add to the \ncredibility of your military might.\n  I wish to talk quickly about the olive branches of peace and \ndiplomacy and then the arrows of war. America has a great diplomatic \ntradition. Let's talk about recent Presidential history. President \nTruman went to Congress and said: Let's spend, in today's dollars, tens \nof billions of dollars to rebuild the economies of Japan and Germany, \nthe two nations that had been at war against the United States. Germany \nhad been engaged in two wars with the United States in the previous 30 \nyears. Japan had invaded the United States at Pearl Harbor, but \nPresident Truman said: Tomorrow is more important than yesterday. Let's \nspend dollars to rebuild these economies. It was controversial when he \nproposed it, but the Marshall Plan ended up being one of the most \nsuccessful things the United States has done from a foreign policy \nperspective.\n  Right after the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, President Kennedy \nengaged in negotiations with the Soviet Union to reduce the nuclear \nthreat, and the result was an agreement in 1963 to ban atmospheric \nnuclear tests, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.\n  President Reagan was actively engaged in trying to undermine the \npower of the Soviet Union and communism, but during those very vigorous \nand aggressive activities, he was also negotiating with the Soviet \nUnion on arms control agreements. Probably the paramount example of \nthat during the Reagan Presidency was the Intermediate-Range Nuclear \nForces Treaty in 1987 that he successfully negotiated.\n  I happen to believe that history is going to judge the recent Iran \nnuclear deal in the same way. It is an effort to make tomorrow more \nimportant than yesterday and to find--even in the midst of significant \nchallenges between the United States and Iran--a way to reduce nuclear \ntension. Diplomacy is always a judgment where we should try to let go \nsome of the baggage of the past and see if we can find a better way to \ntomorrow.\n  I am a little bit worried that the Truman legacy of putting peace and \ndiplomacy first is fraying in this body and maybe nationally. I hope by \nbringing to mind this anniversary today, it will remind us of our great \ndiplomatic history and the power of our diplomatic principles. A number \nof times in recent years we have seen bits of evidence of a fraying \ncommitment to diplomacy in this Chamber, in my view.\n  One of the great Truman institutions was the International Monetary \nFund which was designed to help nations work together on economic and \nmonetary policy issues. It is a great global institution. When you set \nup an institution like that in the 1940s, the challenge is that when \nnew nations emerge and rise, how do you incorporate nations that are \nnewly powerful into the Fund? The most recent and challenging example \nhas been the nation of China. As China has gotten more and more \nimportant, there were many who advised us to bring China more closely \ninto the Fund so they could assist nations throughout the world, but \nCongress refused to change the bylaws of the IMF to give China \nproportionate responsibility given its population and the strength of \nits economy. What did China do after we would not change the bylaws to \nallow them a proportionate place at the table? China established their \nown development bank completely separate from the IMF.\n  There is a debate going on right now in Congress about whether we \nshould reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank--now, this dates back to FDR's \nPresidency--a premier institution that helps American companies find \nexport markets abroad. Again, it is part of our broad diplomatic effort \nin outreach, and suddenly it is controversial after 80 years.\n  There are a number of U.N. treaties that we could profitably advance \nour interests on. The U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, if the \nUnited States had ratified that, we would have an additional diplomatic \ntool to challenge Chinese island building in the South China Sea.\n  The U.N. treaty on the rights of women and on the rights of those \nwith disabilities are treaties that would, frankly, reflect American \nvalues and American principles because we are the leaders in the world \nin these areas, and yet we will not ratify these treaties.\n  The prospect of trade deals is much less popular in Congress than \nthey were 15 years ago. Trade is going to happen, the question is \nwhether the United States will play a leadership\n\n[[Page S7481]]\n\nrole in writing the rules, and if we step back and don't play a \nleadership role, some other nations will, but these are getting more \nand more complicated in this body.\n  Finally, something I feel very strongly about is that it is hard to \nface the world with this strong diplomatic might when there are a lot \nof ambassadorial positions that are vacant. Especially in the last 6 or \n7 years we have seen efforts to block or delay ambassadorial \nappointments that have left key posts in many nations around the world \nvacant.\n  It sends a message to other countries. When they look at us, as the \nUnited States, not putting an ambassador in place, they basically \nconclude that the United States may not think we are important, and \nthat is a very bad signal to send to other nations, especially when \nmany nations that are allies have been without ambassadors for a while.\n  I am hoping we can reembrace on this 70th anniversary the wisdom of \nTruman, who said: The nation has to be vigorous and forceful and look \ntoward diplomacy first.\n  With respect to the arrows of war--I am on the Armed Services \nCommittee, and just like President Truman, I prefer diplomacy. I think \nwe should lead with diplomacy, but we have to be willing to use \nmilitary force. I voted for military force twice during my 3 years in \nthe Senate.\n  In 2013, in August, the President asked us to vote for military force \nagainst Syria to punish Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons \nagainst civilians. The only vote that was taken in either House was a \nvote in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I voted for it with a \nkind of foreboding and heavy heart because I knew there would be \nVirginians, some of whom I might know, who would be affected, but \nnevertheless I thought it was an important principle for America to \nstand for.\n  Since September of 2014, I have also been pushing to have Congress \ncast a vote to authorize the war against ISIL that has been going on \nfor 15 months. There is a lot of critique in this body--and I have \ncritique--about the way that war is being waged about strategic \ndecisions that the President is undertaking with respect to the war, \nbut I think at the end of the day it is hard to just be a critic. Under \narticle I of the Constitution, it is supposed to be Congress that \nauthorizes war rather than a President just doing it on his own.\n  Earlier I mentioned how the Truman olive branches of diplomacy and \narrows of war reinforce one another. Obviously, you can be a stronger \nnegotiator at the table in advancing a diplomatic solution if people \nunderstand that you have significant military capacity and the \nwillingness to use it in the appropriate instance. The more we can do \nand the better we can do to empower or military through wise budgeting, \nfor example--as we hope to find an end to sequester and a path \nforward--the stronger we will make our diplomatic effort. Similarly, \nthe reverse is also true. The more we are vigorous in going after \ndiplomacy, the more moral credibility we have in those instances where \nwe can say, when looking at the world, looking at our citizens, and \nlooking at our own troops, that we now think we need to take military \naction and we have exhausted the diplomatic alternatives first. That \nimproves the moral credibility behind a military effort. It enables us \nto make the case better to all about the need for a military effort, \nand often it even creates a better international justification for a \nmilitary effort.\n  I believe the Presiding Officer and I were together last week when \nformer Secretary Gates testified before the Armed Services Committee. \nIt was one of the best bits of testimony I have seen in my time in the \nSenate. He had a word of caution for us. He said: ``While it is \ntempting to assert that the challenges facing the United States \ninternationally have never been more numerous or complex, the reality \nis that turbulent, unstable and unpredictable times have recurred to \nchallenge U.S. leaders regularly since World War II.''\n  We do live in a very complex and challenging world, where we see \nchallenges that are known but also many unpredictable challenges. Other \nleaders of this country, since our first days, have lived in worlds \nthat looked equally as challenging and confusing to them. We are true \nto our best traditions if the United States does what Truman so \nemblematically suggested we should do and we push in a vigorous and \ncreative way all of the diplomatic tools at our disposal, and that \ninvolves diplomacy, but it also involves trade and humanitarian \nassistance. The United States is one of the most generous nations in \nthe world.\n  The strength of our moral example is something that stands as so \nimportant. If you live in a nation where journalists are being put in \njail, the U.S. freedom of the press stands as a moral example. If you \nlive in a nation where people are prosecuted because of their sexual \norientation, the United States stands as a great moral example. We are \nnot exemplary in everything. We have room to improve in everything, but \nwe are exemplary in so many things. People around the world still look \nat us, and that is in fact a diplomatic area of importance. Let's be \nexemplary and stand for the principles we expose.\n  Finally, I will say this. So many of the challenges we are facing now \nare challenges that at the end of the day are about diplomatic \nsolutions. In the Armed Services or the Foreign Relations Committees, \nwe are often talking about the vexing conundrum and humanitarian \ndisaster in Syria, but at the end of the day we hear it has to be about \na political solution to the civil war. There has to be a political \nsolution to the conflict in Yemen. There has to be a political solution \nto the decades-long conflict between the Taliban and the Afghanistan \nGovernment. To find a political solution, you have to have strong \ndiplomacy. Military action will not be enough to forge a political \nconsensus moving forward.\n  Ultimately, this was the message of what Harry Truman did 70 years \nago. This strong wartime President, who made some of the toughest \ndecisions that have ever been made by anybody in the Oval Office, \nrecognized that America was a great nation because when push came to \nshove, we would prefer, push, and advocate for diplomacy first knowing \nthat we would be militarily strong if we needed to be. It is my hope \nthat we in Congress will take a lesson from that anniversary and \ncontinue to pursue that same path.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to speak in favor of the \nCybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, and I urge my colleagues \nto support this much needed legislation. Nearly 3 months ago, the \nSenate was unable to find a path forward to adopt this important bill. \nLet's look at what has happened since the time that the Senate refused \nto proceed.\n  The fact is that our country has continued to endure a wave of \ndamaging and expensive cyber attacks. These incidents include the first \nmajor hack of Apple's popular App Store, the compromise of 15 million \nT-Mobile users due to a breach at Experian, and the exposure of data of \nup to 8,000 Army families due to improper procedures followed by the \nGeneral Services Administration. For the Army families who were \naffected, this sensitive information included medical histories, Social \nSecurity numbers, and child day care details.\n  Today, I renew my support for this bill in light of the continuing \nstate of cyber insecurity that affects information held in the public \nand private sectors.\n  Passing the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act would make it \neasier for public and private sector entities to share cyber threat \ninformation and vulnerabilities in order to lessen the theft of trade \nsecrets, intellectual property, and national security information, as \nwell as the compromise of sensitive personal information. It would \neliminate some of the legal and\n\n[[Page S7482]]\n\neconomic barriers impeding voluntary two-way information sharing \nbetween private industry and government. It is a modest but essential \nfirst step to protect networks and their information.\n  This bill would not in any way compromise our personal information. \nIts purpose is to help safeguard our personal information that breach \nafter breach, cyber attack after cyber attack has proven to be \nvulnerable.\n  While this bill promotes appropriate information sharing between the \ngovernment and the private sector--a good first step, as I have \nindicated--it unfortunately does little in its original form to harden \nthe protection of Federal networks or to guard the critical \ninfrastructure we rely upon every day. Thus, I have filed two \namendments to further strengthen our Nation's cyber security.\n  The first amendment is directed at improving the security of \nsensitive personal data that is stored on networks of Federal civilian \nagencies. The insecurity of Federal databases and networks has been \nevident for years. Inspectors general reports have warned of it. Yet, \nby and large, those calls for action have not been heeded by Federal \nagencies, and certainly the weaknesses in our Federal agencies' \nsecurity systems are underscored by recent breaches and intrusions.\n  In June, more than 20 million--20 million--current, former, and \nretired Federal employees learned that their personal data was stolen \nfrom the poorly secured databases of the Office of Personnel \nManagement. Since that time, we have learned that the personal emails \nof the Director of the CIA have been hacked. We have learned from the \nState Department's inspector general that the State Department is \n``among the worst agencies in the Federal Government at protecting its \ncomputer networks.'' This substandard performance at the Department of \nState continued even as an adversary nation breached the Department's \nemail system last year. According to the IG, compliance with Federal \ninformation security standards remains ``substandard'' at the State \nDepartment.\n  I know from my many years of service on the committee on homeland \nsecurity, where we worked on cyber security issues for literally a \ndecade, producing legislation in 2010 and 2011 that unfortunately was \nnot approved by this body, that this problem is long standing and it is \nonly growing worse. We ignore it at our peril.\n  This appalling performance in so many agencies and departments led to \nmy introducing bipartisan legislation with my colleague from Virginia, \nSenator Warner, as well as Senator Mikulski, Senator Coats, Senator \nAyotte, and Senator McCaskill, to strengthen the security of the \nnetworks of Federal civilian agencies.\n  Our bill has five elements, but the most important provision would \ngrant the Department of Homeland Security the authority to issue \nbinding operational directives to Federal agencies to respond in the \nface of substantial breaches or to take action in the face of an \nimminent threat to a Federal network. Although the Secretary of \nHomeland Security is tasked with a very similar responsibility to \nprotect Federal civilian networks, he has far less authority to \naccomplish this responsibility than does the Director of the National \nSecurity Agency for the dot-mil networks. We can no longer ignore the \ndamaging consequences of failing to address these issues.\n  Our amendment would fortify Federal computer networks from cyber \nthreats in many ways. The key elements, I am pleased to say, in our \nbill were incorporated into an amendment that has been filed by Senator \nCarper, along with the chairman of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Senator Johnson, and Senator Warner, my \nchief cosponsor of the bill we introduced, and, of course, myself.\n  Our amendment has been included in the managers' substitute \namendment, and I wish to thank Chairman Burr and Vice Chairman \nFeinstein for their willingness to include these much needed provisions \nto boost the security of the networks at Federal civilian agencies.\n  Just think of the kind of data that civilian agencies have in the \nFederal Government. Whether we are talking about the Social Security \nAdministration, the Medicare agency, the IRS, the VA or the Department \nof Defense, it is evident that millions of Americans--indeed, most \nAmericans--have personal data, sensitive data, such as Social Security \nnumbers, that are stored in these networks of Federal civilian \nagencies, and we have an obligation to protect as best we can that \ndata.\n  I have also filed another amendment to the cyber bill, amendment No. \n2623, that is aimed at protecting our country's most vital critical \ninfrastructure from cyber attack. This bipartisan amendment was \ncosponsored by Senator Coats, Senator Warner, and Senator Hirono.\n  The livelihood and well-being of almost every American depend upon \ncritical infrastructure that includes the electricity that powers our \ncommunities, the national air transportation system that moves \npassengers and cargo safely from one location to another, and the \nelements of the financial sector that ensure the $14 trillion of \npayments made every day are securely routed through the banking system. \nThose are just some examples of critical infrastructure. There are \nobviously many more.\n  Our amendment would have created a second tier of mandatory reporting \nto the government for the fewer than 65 entities identified by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security where damage caused by a single cyber \nattack would likely result in catastrophic harm in the form of more \nthan $50 billion in economic damage, 2,500 fatalities or a severe \ndegradation of our national security. In other words, only cyber \nattacks that could cause catastrophic results would fall under this \nreporting requirement.\n  For 99 percent of businesses, the voluntary information sharing \nframework established in the bill before us would be enough, and the \ndecision on whether or not to share cyber threat information should \nrightfully be left up to them. A second tier of reporting is necessary, \nhowever, to protect the critical infrastructure that is vital to the \nsafety, health, and economic well-being of the American people.\n  Under our amendment, the owners and operators of the country's most \ncritical infrastructure would report significant cyber attacks just as \nincidents of communicable disease outbreaks must be reported to public \nhealth authorities and to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention.\n  Think about the situations we have here. Does it make sense that we \nrequire one case of measles to be reported to a Federal Government \nagency but not a cyber attack that could result in the death of more \nthan 2,500 people? How does that make sense?\n  The threats to our critical infrastructure are not hypothetical. They \nare already occurring and increasing in frequency and severity. At a \nrecent Armed Services Committee hearing on cyber security, Senator \nDonnelly asked the Director of National Intelligence, Jim Clapper, what \nthe No. 1 cyber challenge was that he was most concerned about. \nDirector Clapper testified that, obviously, it was a large-scale cyber \nattack against the United States infrastructure.\n  In light of this No. 1 threat, how protected is our country? Well, I \nhave posed that very question to the Director of the NSA, Admiral Mike \nRogers. His answer, on a scale of 1 to 10, was that we are at about a 5 \nor 6. That is a failing grade when it comes to protecting critical \ninfrastructure, no matter what curve we are grading on.\n  Although I am very disappointed that the Senate will not consider the \noriginal amendment I filed, I do want to acknowledge that Chairman Burr \nand Vice Chairman Feinstein have worked closely with me on a compromise \nto begin to address the issue of cyber security risks that present such \nsignificant security threats to our critical infrastructure, and I am \ngrateful for their acknowledging that this is a problem that deserves \nour attention.\n  This new amendment, which is section 407 of the managers' amendment, \nrequires the DHS Secretary to conduct an assessment of the fewer than \n65 critical infrastructure entities at greatest risk and develop a \nstrategy to mitigate the risks of a catastrophic cyber attack. Let me \nstress two things. We are only talking about fewer than 65 entities \nthat have already been designated by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity as critical infrastructure where a catastrophic cyber attack \nwould cause terrible consequences.\n\n[[Page S7483]]\n\n  Second, let me again describe what we mean by a catastrophic \nattack. It means a single cyber attack that would likely result in $50 \nbillion in economic damage, 2,500 Americans dying or a severe \ndegradation of our national security. We are talking about significant \nconsequences that would be catastrophic for this country--consequences \nwe cannot and should not ignore.\n\n  There are plenty of cyber threats that cannot be discussed in public \nbecause they are classified--I know that as a member of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee--but in light of the cyber threat to critical \ninfrastructure described by Admiral Rogers and Director of National \nIntelligence Clapper in open testimony before the Congress, the bare \nminimum we ought to do is to ask to require DHS and the appropriate \nFederal agencies to describe to us what more could be done to prevent a \ncatastrophic cyber attack on our critical infrastructure.\n  One or two years from now, I don't want us to be standing here after \na cyber 9/11 chastising ourselves, saying: Why didn't we do more to \nconfront an obvious and serious threat to our critical infrastructure?\n  By including these two provisions in the managers' substitute \namendment, we are strengthening the protections for Federal civilian \nagencies and beginning--not going nearly as far as I would like but \nbeginning the vital task of protecting our critical infrastructure. We \nwill be strengthening the cyber defenses of our Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the managers' amendment and the \nunderlying bill. By passing this long-overdue legislation, we will \nbegin the long-overdue work of securing our economic and national \nsecurity and our personal information for generations to come.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON.

Madam President, I rise today to speak about the Takata \nairbag recall and the continued need for urgency in this area.\n  Last week the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \nannounced that they currently had--this figure will blow your mind--19 \nmillion vehicles and 23 million airbags under recall. So far, the \ncompletion rates for this recall are not very good. There is a national \ncompletion rate of some 22 percent, and for States such as Florida \nwhere there is high heat and humidity--that is suspected as part of the \nreason the components break down--the completion rate is just under 30 \npercent, meaning that people are not taking their cars in to fix the \nproblem that caused the recall in the first place.\n  Takata started running ads through the print media and social media, \nand Honda is running ads to get consumers to a dealer to replace their \ndefective airbags. I am also aware that to boost replacement inflators, \nthree other airbag manufacturers are helping to manufacture them.\n  So this Senator wants to take this opportunity to state that wherever \nthis message can be delivered to consumers, you better take your car if \nit is under recall and get it in to the dealer in order to get a \nreplacement airbag; otherwise, you are walking around with, in effect, \na grenade in the middle of your steering wheel or dashboard.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to show a number of items in \nthe Senate to illustrate what I am talking about with the airbags.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. To Members of the Senate, this is a deflated airbag that \nhas already exploded. If you can see, this part is the center of the \nsteering wheel. In this case, this happens to be a Honda; here is the \nletter ``h.'' This would be sitting right in front of you in the \nsteering wheel. When you have an accident, if it is of sufficient \nimpact, it is going to cause the airbag to inflate. This is designed as \na lifesaver. This explosive device inside the airbag, and the gas \ncompound in there is ammonium nitrate. If it is defective, when the \nexplosion occurs, the hot gases that are released from the compound \ncome out through these little holes around the side, and that inflates \nthe airbag. But what has happened and has caused almost 20 million cars \nto be recalled is that the hot gases are exploding in this device with \nsuch force that it is causing the metal to break and come out in the \ninflated bag with such force, tearing through the bag, as this \nparticular bag shows--it has a big hole in it. Here is the hole where \nthe metal came out. It is like a grenade exploding in front of you, in \nyour steering wheel, with shrapnel going into the people who are \ndriving or who are in the passenger seat with the dashboard airbag. We \nare finding out now that a few months ago there was the explosion of \nside airbags in some of the cars, in the doors. Lo and behold, that is \nthrowing out shrapnel as well.\n  I want to show the Senate what it is like when these inflators \nexplode. This is an inflator that was inside the device I just showed \nyou. This photograph is a blowup by the Battelle Institute for the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This is a blown-up \nphotograph of the inflator starting to inflate. What it is supposed to \ndo is shoot the gases out here, which inflates the bag I showed you, \nbut look what has happened. It is being ruptured in the side, throwing \nout metal. This is what it looks like under very fast photography. \nMetal fragments are coming out when it should have been just gas coming \nout to inflate the bag.\n  This is what one of those pieces of metal looks like. It is a shard \nof metal that is part of the inflator. Can you imagine that hitting you \nin the neck? Well, that is what happened to one of my citizens in \nFlorida, in the Orlando area. She ran into a fender bender in an \nintersection at a traffic light. Lo and behold, when the police got \nthere, they found her slumped over the wheel, and they thought it was a \nhomicide because her neck was slashed. They found out that what \nhappened was a piece of metal like this had lacerated her neck and cut \nher jugular vein.\n  Another one of my constituents, a fireman--a big, hulking guy, the \nkind who will pick you up, if you are disabled and in a house that is \nburning down, and carry you out safely to save you--well, he won't be a \nfireman anymore because one of those metal fragments hit him in the eye \nand he is blind in one eye.\n  Those are just two incidents of scores across the country, of which \nthere have been a handful of deaths.\n  If a jagged piece of metal can cause severe injury because it is \ncoming at you at high speed, don't you think that if you have one of \nthese vehicles that are under recall, you had better get it to the \ndealer to have it replaced?\n  Check to see if your car is under recall because sometimes people \ndon't get it in the mail or they don't open the mail. Go to \nwww.safercar.gov and put in your car's vehicle identification number--\nthe VIN number--and then you will see if your car is on a recall list.\n  Those that are on the recall list that I mentioned earlier \nunfortunately may not be the last to be recalled. The New York Times \njust reported that a study commissioned by Takata with Penn State \nUniversity shows larger issues with the use of ammonium nitrate in the \nairbag inflators. In addition, there was another incident just this \npast June where a Takata side airbag ruptured in a relatively new 2015 \nVolkswagen. And just a week ago, General Motors recalled vehicles that \nalso had defective Takata side airbags. It raises the question, are any \nof the Takata inflators safe?\n  Last week Senator Thune and I sent a letter to Takata asking for \nadditional documents and information regarding these side airbags. We \nalso asked more questions about the use of ammonium nitrate. Also, the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that it may \nexpand its recall to all the model year vehicles with Takata airbags.\n  NHTSA must use all of its tools under the law to maximize consumer \nprotection. These potential hand grenades, stored in the steering wheel \nor dashboard, must get off the road. The\n\n[[Page S7484]]\n\nAmerican driving public cannot afford any more wasted time.\n  Don't we think these corporations that are causing this outrageous \nsituation that has killed seven people in the United States and \nseverely injured dozens more--don't we think that they ought to be held \naccountable? If executives at Takata knew about their defective \nproducts, if they knew that and did nothing, or worse, if they covered \nit up, then they ought to go to jail. Not another fine, not another \nsettlement, somebody ought to be going to jail. Lying about a danger of \nthis magnitude is a criminal act.\n  We have a crisis of consumer confidence in the vehicle-safety area. \nCertainly that has been demonstrated with these Takata airbags.\n  What about General Motors' misinformation, lack of information, and \noutright deception about the defective ignition switches? And now what \nabout Volkswagen's deliberate efforts to lie about--and to cover up--\nemissions from its diesel vehicles?\n  A few weeks ago I sent a letter to Chairwoman Edith Ramirez of the \nFederal Trade Commission, asking them to crack down on Volkswagen's \nunfair and deceptive practices in connection with its ``clean diesel'' \nvehicle claims, and today I received a response. The Chairwoman of that \nCommission told me they are investigating the claims against \nVolkswagen, along with the Department of Justice and the Environmental \nProtection Agency. In her response she said: ``No reasonable consumer \nwould knowingly purchase a vehicle that he or she could not legally \ndrive.''\n  I agree. Don't we all agree? So it is time to get tough and to hold \nthese folks and these corporations accountable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today I rise as a staunch supporter of \nevery American's right to privacy. I rise because, like many Montanans, \nI have grave concerns about whether my personal information gets handed \nover to the government.\n  As the Senate debates the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, I \nstart by acknowledging the inherent conflict between the right to \nprivacy and national security. Some folks want to pretend this conflict \ndoesn't exist, but it does. Ask yourself this: How do we stop cyber \nterrorists from crashing our networks, stealing our personal \ninformation, and throwing our entire economy into a tailspin--an \neconomy that is dependent on technology? How do we do this without \nviolating your right to privacy and mine? How do we do this without \ngiving the Federal Government far-reaching authority to share the \npersonal information of law-abiding citizens?\n  These are tough questions that require thoughtful answers, and I do \nbelieve we can answer them. I do believe we can strike a balance that \nprotects our right to privacy and protects our Nation from threats. \nThat is why I want to offer my support for a couple of amendments \nsponsored by colleagues from both sides of the aisle.\n  The first amendment, from Senators Flake and Franken, provides the \nnecessary 6-year sunset for this legislation. That means that in 6 \nyears Congress would be forced to have another conversation about how \nwe ensure every American's right to privacy while also ensuring our \nnational security. These conversations are incredibly important, and we \nshould revisit them often. We should revisit them often because we know \nthat a government unchecked is dangerous. In a world where technology \nchanges faster than our laws, we cannot and must not give corporations \nand the Federal Government unbridled authority for generations to come.\n  We already know that several Federal agencies have engaged in \ninvasive surveillance of law-abiding Americans. They have utilized \nintrusive monitoring techniques--tracking our phone calls, listening to \nour conversations, gathering storehouses of personal information. They \nhave done this in the name of the PATRIOT Act, one of the worst pieces \nof legislation ever to come out of this body. It took a long time for \nthose agencies to own up to the fact that certain operations were far \nbigger in scope than what they had led Congress or the American public \nto believe.\n  The best thing we can do to try to prevent a repeat of those mistakes \nis to pass the amendment offered by my good friend Senator Wyden. This \namendment would improve cyber security and better protect privacy by \nreducing the amount of unnecessary personal information that would be \nshared about a possible cyber security threat. It seems like common \nsense to me, and I certainly appreciate Senator Wyden championing this \nissue.\n  As Members of Congress we all took an oath to the people of this \nNation to protect them from enemies both foreign and domestic, and we \nshould not give up our ability to check and balance this administration \nor for that matter the next one. That is why the Flake-Franken \namendment and the Wyden amendment are so critical, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support them when they come to the floor.\n  With that, Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I came back today and had really good \nnews over the weekend. I think a lot of people have gotten together on \nboth sides, in the House and the Senate, to do what we are supposed to \nbe doing.\n  I often refer to that old instrument called the Constitution, which \nsays there are two main things we are supposed to be doing here: One is \ndefending America, and the other is building roads and bridges. That is \nwhat we are supposed to be doing.\n  The Presiding Officer has heard me say before that my top priority as \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee is, and \ncontinues to be, passing a long-term highway reauthorization bill. The \nlast one we passed was in 2005. I was proud to be the author of it at \nthat time. It expired in 2009. Since that time, we have not had \nanything except short-term extensions. I have to remind my conservative \nfriends, because I am a conservative, that the conservative position is \nto have a long-term reauthorization bill, because the short-term costs \nabout 30 percent off the top. As a result, the industry stakeholders \nand local government leaders have lost faith in Congress's ability to \nprovide funding certainty to maintain and advance our surface \ntransportation and infrastructure. Ranking Member Barbara Boxer and I \nhave been fighting for a long period of time to change this and reverse \nthe trend of wasteful short-term patches.\n  On June 24, our committee--and this is very unusual for this to \nhappen. Our committee unanimously voted to advance to the Senate the \nDRIVE Act, which is a 6-year reauthorization bill. In July, the Senate \ngave strong bipartisan support by a vote of 65 to 34, a 2-to-1 \nmajority. Again, this is not something that normally happens with a \nmajor piece of legislation. It also included contributions from the \nSenate Commerce Committee and the Senate Banking Committee, so it is \nnot just the Environment and Public Works Committee. Other committees \nhave parts of this legislation also.\n  The Senate worked hard across party lines to put forward a solution \nfor our Nation's roads and bridges. We ended the summer by passing yet \nanother short-term patch in order to give more time for the House to \njoin our efforts. Unfortunately, we are now 3 days away\n\n[[Page S7485]]\n\nfrom facing another cliff and the two Chambers have not yet been able \nto conference a long-term transportation solution. I just talked to \nChairman Shuster of the House Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee. They marked up a 6-year reauthorization bill just this last \nThursday. I am proud to see that both Chambers are on similar pages.\n  Both bills recognize the need for a national freight program. We \napproach it just a little differently, but there is nothing that can't \nbe reconciled in a matter of minutes. Further, environmental \nstreamlining is absolutely necessary. Both bills are doing that. We \nplace a new focus on innovation which provides States with flexibility, \nas in my State of Oklahoma. When we give flexibility to the States, we \nget a lot more done. This idea that no good ideas are put to work \nunless they originate in Washington is just not true. Also, long-term \ncertainty, which we are very much concerned with, is there, and it is \nnow a reality. We are now one step closer to putting America back on \nthe map as a place to do business.\n  It is my understanding that the House intends to move Chairman \nShuster's 6-year reauthorization bill through the full House over the \nnext 2 weeks. I just spoke with him a few minutes ago. Unlike in years \npast, I expect a very short conference period. Because we still face \nthis important process, Congress will need one more extension to get us \nto the finish line. The finish line should be the 20th of November, and \nit can be done. When I say a very short conference period, it is \nbecause there is very little difference between the House bill and the \nSenate bill. I have talked to the likely conferees, and they are in \naccord with the idea that we can do this in a matter of hours, not \ndays. I realize there are a lot of moving discussions on larger deals \non the debt limit and budget caps; however, there is agreement that the \nsurface transportation bill can and will move on its own timeline.\n  The House will move a short-term extension to November 20 this week. \nThe ones I have talked to assure me that is going to happen. I hope the \nSenate passes it quickly so the House can move the T bill on \nthe floor and we can move to a quickly resolved conference. Due to the \nsimilarity in both bills, I am confident we can and should have this on \nthe President's desk by Thanksgiving.\n  If we fail to get this done by November 20, we are going to be faced \nwith two significant hurdles: First, Congress has other pressing \ndeadlines to address in December--to include December 11, when funding \nof the Federal Government expires, and December 31, when a host of \nimportant tax provisions will expire. Another December 31 deadline \nwould be the provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act.\n  I can remember in years past when we got dangerously close to \nDecember 31. One time the Big Four had to take it, and it was not even \na product of the committees. I was one of the Big Four. We were able to \npass it, but we came so close to December 31, it was scary. Here we \nare, in the middle of a bunch of wars, and all of a sudden we would \nhave provisions out there--reenlistment bonuses, hazard pay, and things \nthat would expire. Nothing would be worse than to have our kids in \ncombat facing that.\n  We are addressing these deadlines that will require Congress's \nundivided attention. Some of the solutions for these bills could \nresult, I fear, in Members attempting to siphon off the payoffs of the \nDRIVE Act. That is why this is important.\n  The second significant hurdle we face is that later this year the \nhighway trust fund will drop to a dangerously low level, as DOT \nSecretary Foxx has warned. At that point, agencies at the Federal and \nState level will begin to implement cash management procedures that \nsignificantly affect the States' construction seasons. In the majority \nof the United States, we would lose a construction season in States \nsuch as Iowa and in Northern States. Mark my words: A failure by \nCongress to enact a long-term bill by Thanksgiving will result in a \nloss of the 2016 construction season. Congress is going to return to \nits current pattern of short-term extensions. Again, short-term \nextensions syphon about 30 percent off the top. It is a terrible \noutcome that should be avoided at all costs. We have the opportunity to \ndo it now. By making industry and States continue to hold their breath \nand budgets, we rob taxpayers of cost-efficient project planning and \ncontinue to stall on launching major economy-boosting projects.\n\n  Look at my State of Oklahoma, which lost $63 million in construction \ndollars over the last few years as a direct result of inefficiency and \ncontracting uncertainty that comes from short-term extensions. I have \nused that figure of 30 percent off the top with some of my conservative \nfriends. I said: If you oppose a long-term extension, a long-term \nreauthorization bill, then you are saying that you want to have the \nliberal alternative, which is to lose 30 percent off the top.\n  With a fully funded long-term reauthorization, Oklahoma would \nactually see a savings of $122 million and millions more in efficiency \nsavings from long-term commitments and early completion savings from \ncontracts. This is something a lot of people don't realize. The \nstreamline you get--many of the NEPA requirements and the environmental \nrequirements can be offset if you are able to get to a long-term bill. \nBut you can't do it, you can't start any large projects--not any of \nthese big projects--the bridge projects and others you can't do on \nshort-term extensions. We haven't had an authorization bill since 2005, \nand I believe it is time for Congress to fulfill its constitutional \nduty to fund our roads and our bridges.\n  As I said earlier, I am confident that the Senate and House will work \ntogether to get this bill to the President's desk within the next few \nweeks. That is my wish for my counterpart on the House side, Chairman \nShuster--the best of luck in moving forward. He is now committed to \ndoing that. He is going to get this done. He kept his word in getting \nthe job done last Thursday, and now he is going to be able to get this \nbill up so that we can conference it together. I anticipate we can do a \nconference in a matter of a few hours. It wouldn't take the normal \ntime.\n  That is good news. It is good news to come back on a Monday and find \nthat we are going to be doing what the Constitution says we ought to be \ndoing, and that is roads and bridges.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It could not come \ntoo soon, because the Western District has been working without a \nsingle sitting Federal judge. That will finally change once Mr. Vilardo \nhas been confirmed. He will now begin to hear cases and tackle the \nbacklog that has been steadily building in the Western District. There \nare few more qualified to help take on this task than Larry Vilardo. \nThat is because Mr. Vilardo is a classic Buffalonian--hard working, \nsalt of the earth, honest, and grounded. He went to Canisius College \nand then took a brief detour out of Western New York to attend Harvard \nLaw School and clerk on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in Texas \nbefore returning home and becoming one of Buffalo's leading legal \nlights, practicing at a firm he cofounded.\n  Buffalo is where he was born, raised, and educated, and where he \nchose to raise his family. Buffalo is in his bones. They love him in \nBuffalo. When this vacancy occurred, I heard the voices in Buffalo \nchanting: Vilardo, Vilardo, Vilardo--not just the legal community but \njust about the whole community. Like so many other people from the \nregion, the city has made him tough, level-headed, fair, and decent.\n  As the first in his family to graduate from college, he adds an \nimportant element to the socioeconomic diversity of the court.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Cybersecurity Information Sharing Bill\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, tomorrow we will be turning to the cyber \nsecurity bill, which the Presiding Officer is familiar with as a member \nof the committee, and I wish to speak about my amendment No. 2621 to \nthat legislation. I also intend to address the amendments of our \ncolleagues Senator Franken, Senator Heller, and Senator Coons because I \nbelieve all four of these amendments seek to achieve the same goal, and \nthat goal--the goal of all four of these amendments--is to reduce the \nunnecessary sharing of Americans' private and personal information.\n  The Senate has had a robust debate on the cyber security bill over \nthe past week, and I think it is fair to say that Senators agree on a \nfair number of points. For example, the sponsors of the legislation \nhave now acknowledged that the cyber security bill we will shortly vote \non would not have prevented sophisticated cyber attacks, such as the \nTarget and Home Depot hacks, and it would not have prevented the theft \nof millions of personnel records at the Office of Personnel Management.\n  As for my part, I agree that sharing information about cyber security \nthreats is generally a constructive idea. If private companies identify \nsamples of malicious code or information that identifies foreign \nhackers, I would absolutely encourage them to share that information. \nHowever, I think companies should also take reasonable steps--and I \nunderline ``reasonable steps''--to remove unrelated personal \ninformation about their customers before sharing that data with the \ngovernment. It is important to understand that this legislation simply \ndoes not require companies to do that, and Senators can see that for \nthemselves. As Senators can see for themselves, on page 17 of the bill, \ncompanies are allowed to conduct only a cursory review of the \ninformation they provide and would only be required to remove data that \nthey know is personal information unrelated to cyber security.\n  When it comes to customers' personal information, the message behind \nthis bill is, when in doubt, hand it over. Once that data is shared--\nand this is not widely known--the Department of Homeland Security would \nbe required to send it on to a broad range of government agencies, from \nthe NSA to the FBI.\n  The amendment I have offered to the legislation we will vote on \ntomorrow would give companies a real responsibility for safeguarding \ntheir customers' information. It would say that in order for a company \nto receive liability protection before a company shares data with the \ngovernment, it has to make efforts to the extent feasible to remove any \npersonal information that is not necessary to identify or describe a \ncyber security threat. In my view, that would give this legislation a \nstraightforward standard that could give consumers real confidence that \ntheir privacy is actually being protected.\n  Let me give an example of how this might work in practice. Imagine \nthat a health insurance company finds out that millions of its \ncustomers' records have been stolen. If that company has any evidence \nabout who the hackers were or how they stole this information, of \ncourse it makes sense to share that information with the government. \nBut the company shouldn't simply say ``Well, here you go'' and hand \nmillions of its customers' financial and medical records over for \ndistribution to a broad array of government agencies, such as the FBI \nand the NSA.\n  The records of the victims of a hack should not be treated the same \nway information about the hacker is treated. Companies should be \nrequired to make reasonable efforts to remove personal information that \nis not needed for cyber security before they hand that information over \nto the government. That, in short, is what my amendment seeks to \nachieve.\n  The sponsors of the legislation have argued that my amendment would \nsomehow hold companies to an almost impossible standard. I say \nrespectfully that the language of this amendment is quite measured. \nCompanies are required to remove unrelated personal information and the \nlegislation specifically states ``to the extent feasible.'' The \nlanguage certainly doesn't require perfection; it creates a reasonable \nand flexible approach for companies to make a real effort to remove \nunrelated personal information about their customers instead of simply \nperforming the sort of cursory review that would be permitted under the \ncurrent language of the bill.\n  A quick reading through the list of the pending amendments to the \nbill will make it clear that I am not the only Member of this body who \nis concerned about the unnecessary sharing of personal information.\n  Our colleague from Nevada, Senator Heller, has a similar amendment \nthat would seek to create a stronger requirement for companies to \nremove personal information.\n  Our colleague from Delaware, Senator Coons, has crafted a very \nconstructive amendment that would strengthen the requirement for review \nby the Department of Homeland Security. His amendment would create a \nstronger obligation for the Homeland Security Department to filter out \nunnecessary personal information before passing cyber security data on \nto other parts of our government.\n  Senator Franken has drafted a strong amendment that would clarify the \nbill's definition of ``cyber security threat information'' to ensure \nthat it focuses on information about real threats.\n  It is important to remember that reducing unnecessary sharing of \npersonal information will make any information sharing program more \neffective and easier to focus on the genuine threats involved.\n  Finally, our colleague from Arizona, Senator Flake, has drafted an \namendment that would require the Congress to come back and review this \ninformation sharing approach after 6 years to evaluate how it has \nworked in practice and whether privacy protections ought to be \nstrengthened.\n  I have cited amendments by Democrats and Republicans. The Presiding \nOfficer knows that I feel strongly about working in a bipartisan way \nwhenever I possibly can, and that is why I thought it was important to \nmention, as we go through these amendments, that all of these \namendments I have described have sought to ensure this body would make \nit clear that cyber security is a very real problem. Cyber security, in \nterms of tackling it, which involves information sharing, can be very \nconstructive, and we ought to try to find ways to do it. Each of these \namendments is designed to make sure that when Americans hear about \ncyber security legislation--my colleague and I have discussed it--we \ndon't have millions of Americans walking away and saying: They are \nsharing all of this unnecessary personal and unrelated information; I\n\n[[Page S7487]]\n\nguess it is another one of those surveillance kind of bills.\n\n  We don't want that here. We want bills that are bipartisan, that deal \nwith very real threats--and certainly cyber security is one of them--\nbut we also want to make sure the rights of innocent people are \nprotected. With these amendments, we do that by ensuring that we have \nmore than a cursory approach to filtering out unrelated and personal \ninformation.\n  So it is my judgment that each of these amendments would be \nsignificant improvements to the bill, and I hope my colleagues will \nsupport all of them, as well as an amendment by our colleague from \nVermont Senator Leahy that would remove an unnecessary modification of \nthe Freedom of Information Act.\n  Let me close by saying it is not just Senators--and I have listed \nboth Democrats and Republicans tonight--it is not just Democrats and \nRepublicans in this body who have raised concerns about this bill's \ninadequate privacy protection; privacy advocacy groups from the \nAmerican Library Association to the Oregon Technology Institute have \ncome out against the bill. America's leading technology companies--\ncompanies that have to have expertise in both cyber security and \nprotecting the data of their customers--have opposed it as well. \nCompanies such as Apple, Dropbox, Twitter, Salesforce, Reddit, and Yelp \nhave all said that they oppose the legislation because it does not \ninclude adequate privacy protections. The trade association that \nrepresents Google and Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo!, Netflix, \neBay, and PayPal said: ``CISA's prescribed mechanism for sharing of \ncyber threat information does not sufficiently protect users' \nprivacy.''\n  Now, reflect if we might for a minute on what that means. These are \nAmerica's leading technology companies. They advantage America because \nthey are the envy of the world for their innovation and their way of \nserving customers and businesses not just in this country but around \nthe world. These companies have millions and millions of customers and \nhave spoken out publicly against the bill, in its current form, before \nthese amendments are considered. They sure know a lot about the \nimportance of protecting both cyber security and individual privacy. \nThe reason I say that is they have to manage that challenge each and \nevery day.\n  Customer confidence is the lifeblood of these companies, and the only \nway to ensure customer confidence is to convince customers that if they \nuse a product, their information is going to be protected from both \nmalicious hackers and from unnecessary collection by our government.\n  Last Thursday, a coalition of America's leading consumer groups \nbasically joined those major technology companies in announcing their \nopposition to the bill. They endorsed the pending consumer privacy \namendments, including the amendment I will offer, No. 2621.\n  In conclusion, I hope colleagues will listen to what these technology \ngroups and companies have said, and I hope our colleagues will support \nthe amendments that I and others, both Democrats and Republicans, will \nbe offering tomorrow. Let's work together to produce a bill that does a \nbetter job of dealing with both real cyber threats and the liberties of \nthe American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we will vote on the nomination of \nLawrence Vilardo to be a Federal district judge in the Western District \nof New York in Buffalo. He was first nominated in February, and his \nnomination was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice \nvote over 5 months ago on May 6. There is no reason why this highly \nqualified nominee should have waited so long for a vote. Despite having \none of the busiest caseloads in the country, with more criminal cases \nthan Washington, DC, Boston, or Cleveland, there is not a single active \nFederal judge in that district. The court has been staying afloat only \nthrough the voluntary efforts of two judges on senior status who are \nhearing cases in their retirement. It is about time that we confirmed \nMr. Vilardo to this vacancy.\n  Next week marks the 11th month that Republicans have been in the \nmajority in the Senate. During that time, only nine judicial nominees \nhave been confirmed. When Senate Democrats were in the majority during \nthe last 2 years of the Bush Presidency, we had already confirmed 34 \njudges by this same time. The glacial pace at which Republicans are \ncurrently confirming judicial nominees is an inexcusable failure to \ncarry out the Senate's constitutional duty of providing advice and \nconsent. It also has real and dire consequences for hard-working \nAmericans who seek justice but instead encounter lengthy delays in the \nFederal court system due to empty courthouses and overburdened courts. \nWe can and should take action right now to alleviate this problem by \nholding confirmation votes on the rest of the 13 judicial nominees \npending on the floor. A number of these pending nominees have the \nsupport of their Republican home State Senators; yet they continue to \nlanguish on the calendar without a vote.\n  If Republican obstruction continues and if home State Senators cannot \npersuade the majority leader to schedule a vote for their nominees \nsoon, then it is unlikely that even highly qualified nominees with \nRepublican support will be confirmed by the end of the year. These are \nnominees that members of the majority leader's own party want \nconfirmed, including those from Tennessee and Pennsylvania. And last \nweek, we had a hearing for two Iowa nominees, who I expect to be \nreported out of the Judiciary Committee soon as well. None of these \nnominees are likely to be confirmed by the end of the year if Senate \nRepublicans continue at this historically slow pace.\n  No Senator has raised any objections to the judicial nominees pending \non the floor. Every single one was reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee by unanimous voice vote. Each has the backing of their home \nState Senators, including Republican Senators. These nominees are \noutstanding, accomplished legal professionals who are ready to serve in \nour justice system. They have devoted time away from work and their \nfamilies to go through the rigorous nominations process. More than half \nof the pending Federal district and circuit court nominees would fill \nvacancies deemed to be ``judicial emergencies'' by the nonpartisan \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Instead of working to ensure \nthat all Americans have access to our Federal courts, Senate \nRepublicans continue to obstruct President Obama's judicial nominees in \na misguided effort to score political points against the President.\n  The number of empty judgeships has increased by more than 50 percent \nsince Republicans took over the majority. Their obstruction is \nreversing the hard-earned progress Senate Democrats made last Congress \nto drastically reduce the number of judicial vacancies. Making matters \nworse, the number of ``judicial emergency'' vacancies since Senate \nRepublicans took the majority has risen by 158 percent. These vacancies \nimpact communities across America, and it is doing the most harm to \nStates with at least one Republican Senator. Of the 66 current \nvacancies that exist, 49 of them--or more than 70 percent--are in \nStates with at least one Republican Senator.\n  One of those vacancies is an emergency vacancy on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit in Pennsylvania. Judge Luis Felipe \nRestrepo is nominated to fill the vacancy, and he has strong bipartisan \nsupport from his home State Senators, Senator Toomey and Senator Casey. \nAt Judge Restrepo's hearing, Senator Toomey stated that ``there is no \nquestion [Judge Restrepo] is a very well qualified candidate to serve \non the Third Circuit'' and underscored the fact that he recommended \nthat the President nominate Judge Restrepo. Once confirmed, Judge \nRestrepo will be the first Hispanic judge from Pennsylvania to ever \nserve on this court and only the second Hispanic judge to serve on the \nThird Circuit.\n  There is absolutely no reason to delay a vote on Judge Restrepo's \nconfirmation; yet his nomination has been\n\n[[Page S7488]]\n\npending on the floor for over 3 months. Since he was first nominated, \nJudge Restrepo's nomination has been pending for a staggering 348 days. \nThe national president for the Hispanic National Bar Association, which \nstrongly supports Judge Restrepo's nomination, wrote last week in the \nHuffington Post about the inexcusable delay in his confirmation. I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of this article be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Contrast Senate Republican's treatment of Judge Restrepo with \nPresident Bush's nominee to the third circuit, Judge Thomas Hardiman, \nwho was nominated in the last 2 years of the Bush Presidency. Judge \nHardiman was confirmed in nearly half the time Judge Restrepo has been \nwaiting, taking only 183 days from nomination to his confirmation. \nFurthermore, it took only 7 days for Judge Hardiman to receive a \nconfirmation vote once he was reported out of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. Judge Restrepo has been pending on the floor for 109 days--\n15 times longer than Judge Hardiman. I hope the Republican Senator from \nPennsylvania will implore his leadership to bring this highly qualified \nnominee up for a vote without further delay. Let us then turn to votes \non the rest of the 12 pending judicial nominees without further delay.\n  Shortly we will begin voting on Lawrence Vilardo to fill a judicial \nvacancy in the Federal District Court for the Western District of New \nYork. Since 1986, he has practiced as a named partner at the law firm \nof Connors & Vilardo, L.L.P., in Buffalo, NY. He previously practiced \nat Damon & Morey, in Buffalo, NY, from 1981 to 1986. The ABA standing \ncommittee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Mr. Vilardo ``well \nqualified'' to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Western \nDistrict of New York, its highest rating. He has the support of his two \nhome State Senators, Senator Schumer and Senator Gillibrand. He was \nvoted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote on May 6, \n2015. I will vote to support his nomination.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Huffington Post, Oct. 21, 2015]\n\n  The Current Senate Gridlock Is Hurting the Diversity of Our Justice \n                                 System\n\n                        (By Robert T. Maldonado)\n\n       Born in Medellin, Colombia and raised in the United States, \n     Judge L. Felipe Restrepo's life reads like a textbook case of \n     the American Dream. With a bachelor's from the University of \n     Pennsylvania and a law degree from Tulane, he set off on a \n     successful career in criminal defense and civil rights \n     litigation, eventually serving as a magistrate judge for 7 \n     years.\n       But Judge Restrepo's story of immigrant success seems to be \n     on hold for the moment. That's because he's been waiting \n     since November 2014, when President Barack Obama appointed \n     him to serve on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, to be \n     confirmed as an appeals court judge.\n       After a thorough due diligence process, the Hispanic \n     National Bar Association (HNBA) endorsed Judge Restrepo in \n     March 2015, but we didn't stop there. When we saw the lack of \n     progress on his nomination, the HNBA successfully pushed for \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold his nomination \n     hearing, and continues to push for a confirmation vote on the \n     floor of the Senate.\n       Unfortunately, Judge Restrepo's predicament isn't unique. \n     Two other HNBA-endorsed judicial candidates are stuck in the \n     political gridlock, and a total of 30 judicial nominees (two-\n     thirds of them women or minorities) await Senate confirmation \n     with little idea of when that will happen. According to the \n     judicial watchdog group Alliance for Justice, the Senate has \n     confirmed only 8 judges in 2015, the slowest pace in over 60 \n     years. Almost half of the vacancies on the federal bench have \n     been declared ``judicial emergencies,'' where the remaining \n     judges are overworked trying to make a dent into the backlog \n     of cases, sometimes in excess of 600 filings per judge.\n       The backlogs are having a real effect on the people and \n     businesses seeking recourse through the court system. As one \n     California district court judge put it:\n       ``Over the years I've received several letters from people \n     indicating, `Even if I win this case now, my business has \n     failed because of the delay. How is this justice?' And the \n     simple answer, which I cannot give them, is this: It is not \n     justice. We know it.''\n       Our state of justice is suffering and so is our economy. \n     The states where the backlogs and vacancies are the worst \n     (including Texas, New York, and Florida) happen to be where \n     large Latino communities reside. Given that President Obama \n     has nominated more female and minority candidates to the \n     federal bench than any other President, the delay in judicial \n     confirmations is also a delay in increased diversity, and \n     thus the quality of justice, in our nation's court system.\n       This manufactured crisis is the doing of Senate leaders who \n     prefer to score political points rather than fulfill their \n     constitutional obligations. Those same political leaders need \n     to know that by dragging their feet on these nominations they \n     are not only hurting the nominees but also the integrity and \n     diversity of our federal court system. Nominees like Judge \n     Restrepo have entire communities backing them in their \n     professional journeys, and come election time, they won't \n     hesitate to register their disapproval.\n       For their sake and the sake of our justice system, let's \n     end this judicial vacancy crisis.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Madam President, I would like to pay tribute \nto one of my constituents, who has recently retired from her position \nas a board of trustees distinguished professor at the University of \nConnecticut School of Social Work. Dr. Healy has served as a professor \nfor over 30 exemplary years, preparing new generations of social \nworkers for service in an increasingly diverse and global world.\n  Professor Lynne Healy has been an outstanding pioneer in the field of\n\n[[Page S7489]]\n\ninternational social work, making significant contributions with her \npublications and work in the classroom. Dr. Healy was instrumental in \nestablishing the University's Center for International Social Work \nstudies over 20 years ago. The center helps social workers develop a \nglobal perspective on human rights, human needs, social policy, and \nsocial work practice.

Res. 298\n\n       Whereas, on March 2, 1867, Congress enacted a naval \n     appropriations Act that authorized the Secretary of the Navy \n     to ``receive and accept a deed of gift, when offered by the \n     State of Connecticut, of a tract of land with not less than \n     one mile of shore front on the Thames River near New London, \n     Connecticut, to be held by the United States for naval \n     purposes'';\n       Whereas the people of Connecticut and the towns and cities \n     in the southeastern region of Connecticut subsequently \n     donated land and provided funding to establish a military \n     installation to fulfil the Nation's need for a naval facility \n     on the Atlantic coast;\n       Whereas, on April 11, 1868, the Navy accepted the deed of \n     gift of land from Connecticut to establish a naval yard and \n     storage depot along the eastern shore of the Thames River in \n     Groton, Connecticut;\n       Whereas, between 1868 and 1912, the New London Navy Yard \n     supported a diverse range of missions, including berthing \n     inactive Civil War era ironclad warships and serving as a \n     coaling station for refueling naval ships traveling in New \n     England waters;\n       Whereas Congress rejected the Navy's proposal to close New \n     London Navy Yard in 1912, following an impassioned effort by \n     Congressman Edwin W. Higgins, who stated that this ``action \n     proposed is not only unjust but unreasonable and unsound as a \n     military proposition'';\n       Whereas the outbreak of World War I and the enemy use of \n     submarines to sink allied military and civilian ships in the \n     Atlantic sparked a new focus on developing submarine \n     capabilities in the United States;\n       Whereas October 18, 1915, marked the arrival at the New \n     London Navy Yard of the submarines G-1, G-2, and G-4 under \n     the care of the tender USS OZARK, soon followed by the \n     arrival of submarines E-1, D-1, and D-3 under the care of the \n     tender USS TONOPAH, and on November 1, 1915, the arrival of \n     the first ship built as a submarine tender, the USS FULTON \n     (AS-1);\n       Whereas, on June 21, 1916, Commander Yeates Stirling \n     assumed the command of the newly designated Naval Submarine \n     Base New London, the New London Submarine Flotilla, and the \n     Submarine School;\n       Whereas, in the 100 years since the arrival of the first \n     submarines to the base, Naval Submarine Base New London has \n     grown to occupy more than 680 acres along the east side of \n     the Thames River, with more than 160 major facilities, 15 \n     nuclear submarines, and more than 70 tenant commands and \n     activities, including the Submarine Learning Center, Naval \n     Submarine School, the Naval Submarine Medical Research \n     Laboratory, the Naval Undersea Medical Institute, and the \n     newly established Undersea Warfare Development Center;\n       Whereas, in addition to being the site of the first \n     submarine base in the United States, Connecticut was home to \n     the foremost submarine manufactures of the time, the Lake \n     Torpedo Boat Company in Bridgeport and the Electric Boat \n     Company in Groton, which later became General Dynamics \n     Electric Boat;\n       Whereas General Dynamics Electric Boat, its talented \n     workforce, and its Connecticut-based and nationwide network \n     of suppliers have delivered more than 200 submarines from its \n     current location in Groton, Connecticut, including the first \n     nuclear-powered submarine, the USS NAUTILUS (SSN 571), and \n     nearly half of the nuclear submarines ever built by the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the Submarine Force Library and Museum, located \n     adjacent to Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, \n     Connecticut, is the only submarine museum operated by the \n     United States Navy and today serves as the primary repository \n     for artifacts, documents, and photographs relating to the \n     bold and courageous history of the Submarine Force and \n     highlights as its core exhibit the historic ship Nautilus \n     following her retirement from service;\n       Whereas, reflecting the close ties between Connecticut and \n     the Navy that began with the gift of land that established \n     the base, the State of Connecticut has set aside $40,000,000 \n     in funding for critical infrastructure investments to support \n     the mission of the base, including construction of a new dive \n     locker building, expansion of the Submarine Learning Center, \n     and modernization of energy infrastructure;\n       Whereas, on September 29, 2015, Connecticut Governor Dannel \n     Malloy designated October 2015 through October 2016 as \n     Connecticut's Submarine Century, a year-long observance that \n     celebrates 100 years of submarine activity in Connecticut, \n     including the Town of Groton's distinction as the Submarine \n     Capital of the World, to coincide with the centennial \n     anniversary of the establishment of Naval Submarine Base New \n     London and the Naval Submarine School;\n       Whereas Naval Submarine Base New London still proudly \n     proclaims its motto of ``The First and Finest''; and\n       Whereas Congressman Higgins' statement before Congress in \n     1912 that ``Connecticut stands ready, as she always has, to \n     bear her part of the burdens of the national defense'' \n     remains true today: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the long standing dedication and contribution \n     to the Navy and submarine force by the people of Connecticut, \n     both through the initial deed of gift that established what \n     would become Naval Submarine\n\n[[Page S7494]]\n\n     Base New London and through their ongoing commitment to \n     support the mission of the base and the Navy personnel \n     assigned to it;\n       (2) honors the submariners who have trained and served at \n     Naval Submarine Base New London throughout its history in \n     support of the Nation's security and undersea superiority;\n       (3) recognizes the contribution of the industry and \n     workforce of Connecticut in designing, building, and \n     sustaining the Navy's submarine fleet; and\n       (4) encourages the recognition of Connecticut's Submarine \n     Century by Congress, the Navy, and the American people by \n     honoring the contribution of the people of Connecticut to the \n     defense of the United States and the important role of the \n     submarine force in safeguarding the security of the United \n     States for more than a century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/26/senate-section/article/S7494-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2748.

Madam President, tomorrow we will vote on my amendment \nto the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, or CISA. I am proud to be \njoined on this amendment by Senators Leahy, Durbin, and Wyden, each of \nwhom has worked to try to ensure that any cyber legislation passed by \nthis body is effective and adequately safeguards the privacy and civil \nliberties of the American people.\n  My amendment tightens the definitions of the terms ``cyber security \nthreat'' and ``cyber threat indicator'' in the bill. These changes will \nhelp ensure that CISA's broad authorities are not triggered in \ncircumstances where no real cyber threats are present. This makes the \nbill more privacy protected and more likely to work effectively.\n  The amendment is supported by more than 30 civil society \norganizations, from the American Civil Liberties Union to prominent \nLibertarian groups like R Street. As I will describe, it addresses \nspecific concerns that have been raised by security experts, major tech \ncompanies, and even the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Under CISA, companies are authorized to monitor users online, share \ninformation with one another and with the Federal Government, and \ndeploy defensive measures--all to protect against ``cyber security \nthreats.'' Any action that may result in any unauthorized effort to \nadversely impact cyber security can be deemed a cyber security threat; \nthat is, may result. That sets the lowest possible standard for \ndetermining when actions under CISA are justified, and that is a \nproblem. It sets us up for the oversharing of information, or worse it \njeopardizes privacy and threatens to hinder our cyber defense efforts \nby increasing the noise-to-signal ratio.\n  My amendment would clarify that a threat is any action at least \nreasonably likely--reasonably likely--to result in an unauthorized \neffort to adversely impact cyber security. That definition gives \ncompanies ample flexibility to act on threats and ensures Americans \nthat CISA isn't a free pass to share people's personal information when \nthere is no threat.\n  CISA's definition of cyber threat indicator has also been criticized \nby security experts, by companies such as Mozilla and, again, even by \nDHS, which has called the definition ``expansive'' and said that \nexpansive definition heightens concerns raised by the bill.\n  My amendment addresses the two parts of the definition that experts \nhave suggested are the most likely to open the door to the sharing of \nextraneous information. First, as drafted, CISA would let companies \nshare people's communications if they believe that the files have been \nharmed in a cyber attack or could potentially--potentially--be harmed \nby a perceived threat. The latter is especially problematic. The range \nof information that could be shared as evidence of potential harm is \nvast, and, as experts have explained, unnecessary to the technical work \nof identifying cyber threats. My amendment continues to allow companies \nto share information that reveals harms caused by a cyber incident but \ndoesn't extend this to conjecture about hypothetical potential harms, \nwhich is unnecessarily broad.\n  Finally, my amendment eliminates a troubling loophole in the cyber \nthreat indicator definition. In addition to letting companies share \ninformation that reveals certain specified attributes or features of \ncyber threats, CISA also lets them share information that reveals ``any \nother attribute of a cybersecurity threat'' if the disclosure of that \nattribute is legal. Bill supporters claim that this final clause \nadequately limits the scope of this provision, but looking at whether \ndisclosure of a threat attribute is lawful is an unclear and unhelpful \nstandard. Privacy law is about protecting information, not threat \nattributes. So my amendment clarifies that companies can share \ninformation in this catchall category only if it is legal to share the \ninformation being provided. It is a technical change, but it matters.\n  This amendment represents a real effort to find common ground for \nmoving forward. Quite frankly, it doesn't do all the work that needs to \nbe done to limit the definitions in this act, but it makes necessary \nchanges--necessary changes--to improve the legislation, both for the \nsake of privacy and ultimately security.\n  I urge my colleagues to support amendment No. 2612.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/26/senate-section/article/S7496-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
