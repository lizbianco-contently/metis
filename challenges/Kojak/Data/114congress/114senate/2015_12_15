Mr. President, as my friend, the Republican leader, stated, \nwe are continuing to work toward a bipartisan compromise on the omnibus \nand tax extenders legislation. I have worked hard--we have all worked \nhard--to get to yes on this massive undertaking, this huge \nappropriations bill and this big tax bill. I have been involved on a \npersonal basis in every twist and turn of the way.\n  I want to say a word about the status. We all know that this \nagreement is not completed, but I have been so impressed with the \nendurance and the massive amount of experience that these men and women \nhave--both Democrats and Republicans. Senator McConnell and I had an \nevent last week. We sat next to one another. I sent him a note about \nhow impressed I was with one of his staff people who is working \nintimately with one of mine.\n  So I want to tell all the staff in all these buildings here on \nCapitol Hill who have been working on this night and day how much I \nappreciate their hard work and how the American people are so fortunate \nto have these good men and women working on their behalf. We find that \nmost everyone engaged and working here on Capitol Hill are not involved \nfor the money. They are involved because they want to do something to \nhelp change policy and to try to do what they can to be involved in \nwhat goes on in this great country. So I appreciate all they have done \nto this point.\n  I think we have done a good job as responsible legislators, working \nto find common ground and strike a balance that can pass Congress and \nbe signed into law by the President. But it is time for a reality check \non where we stand on things.\n  An agreement could be filed right now that covers most everything \nthat we have discussed and would keep the government funded fully for a \nyear. At this point, the only major outstanding issue is Republicans' \ninsistence on raising the export ban on crude oil.\n  We have made very clear to Republicans that if they insist on \nincluding the oil export ban, there must be included in this robust \npolicies to reduce our carbon emissions and encourage the use of \nrenewable energy. So for the past many days I have worked hard--as a \nnumber of others have--to strike the right balance. We have made \nmultiple offers to Republicans that were certainly doable, reasonable, \nand all Republicans had to do was say yes. Saying yes to any of the \noffers we put on the table dealing with renewables over the past few \ndays--especially the last 3 days--the ink would be dry, the entire \npackage would be filed, and we would be moving ahead on the floor. I \nmade it very clear to my Republican colleagues that there are offers \nout there that have been unanswered, and I hope they are answered very \nquickly.\n  I have appreciated getting to know the Speaker better than I did \nbefore. I found him to be available and someone who understands the \npolicy, and I am encouraged that last night he said when he had his \nteleconference with all of his Members that he thought we were going to \nhave a deal completed. I hope that in fact is the case.\n  Republicans can take yes for an answer. That is all they have to do. \nBut Congress is now faced with two clear paths forward. The first is \nvery simple: Pair the oil export ban with much needed policies to \nreduce our carbon emissions and build more renewable energy. The second \npath is that we move ahead on the government funding bill and tax \npackage without the package of oil and renewable policies. That would \nnot be my first preference, but we would have to live with it.\n  We don't have the legislative language yet on the tax package. This \nisn't pointing fingers at anyone adversely. It is simply the fact that \nwe need to get this done. We don't have the legislative language done \nyet. At this pace, we are going to be here through Christmas. We need \nto get that done now.\n  So these are the two choices. Either path forward will keep the \ngovernment open and funded. I certainly hope so. Republicans must \ndecide which they prefer.\n  If Republicans think reducing our carbon emissions and encouraging \nthe use of renewable energy is an unacceptable price to pay, we can \nmove the rest of the package without the oil export ban, but we need \nnot delay anymore. There is no reason to delay any further.\n  So I say to everyone who is listening here this morning: It is \ndecision time.\n  Mr. President, would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/15/senate-section/article/S8648-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 2 years ago Members of the Senate did \nsomething that doesn't happen very often. We broke through the gridlock \nand came together to pass meaningful bipartisan legislation that was \ncalled the Marketplace Fairness Act. Senator Mike Enzi, a Republican \nfrom Wyoming, has been the leader on this issue from the start. Senator \nLamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee, has been an invaluable \nally. Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a relatively new Member of the Senate but \na person with extraordinary knowledge of this field, joined me and 65 \nothers to pass legislation that would level the playing field for Main \nStreet businesses all across America and allow States and localities to \ncollect sales and use taxes that are already owed under the law.\n  Since that time--that glorious time 2 years ago--what has happened? \nNothing--the bill passed the Senate, went to the House, and \ndisappeared.\n  In the face of this obstruction, a bipartisan group of Senators have \nsaid we will oppose any long-term extension of legislation that would \ntake away a State's right to collect taxes on accessing the Internet \nunless we give States the ability to collect taxes on Internet sales \nthat are already owed.\n  The Internet Tax Freedom Act is a law which is going to expire with \nthe continuing resolution--which I would support--and it says that \nStates and localities cannot impose a tax on access to the Internet. I \nthink that is sound policy. But what we are asking in return is to \nallow those who use the Internet to make retail purchases to pay the \nsales taxes they already owe for their purchases. It is that simple. It \nis not fair to tie the hands of States and localities to collect the \nrevenue they need to fund law enforcement, public schools, \ninfrastructure, and other vital services without providing a path for \nStates and localities to replace the revenue if they choose.\n  The Marketplace Fairness Act levels the playing field for retailers \nby allowing States to treat all retailers--whether it is a brick-and-\nmortar store or online--the same when it comes to collecting sales and \nuse taxes. It is not a new tax. We are talking about existing taxes and \ntheir collection. In Illinois we have a quaint way of dealing with \nthis. I recall a few years ago, when I was doing my State income tax \nreturns, the bookkeeper called and said: Do you want to declare your\n\n[[Page S8649]]\n\nInternet purchases and pay the sales taxes you owe? I said: Of course I \nwant to pay the taxes I owe. How do you do that?\n\n  Well, you declare them on your State income tax return in Illinois. \nThere is no proof. It is your word, and the fact that you sign is what \nthe State goes by. I estimated my Internet purchases that had not been \nsubject to sales tax and paid the appropriate tax in Illinois. It turns \nout that very few people in my State who actually do make retail \npurchases over the Internet pay this tax. We are trying to change that. \nThe change is very simple: If you are an Internet retailer, such as \nAmazon--the largest in the United States--and I make a purchase for the \nholidays and I declare my ZIP Code at the end of my address, Amazon \nthen knows by my ZIP Code how much to be collected in sales tax. They \nassess me that with the purchase, take that amount and send it back to \nthe Illinois Department of Revenue for distribution. It is so simple \nthat there is basic software available, at a very modest cost, that any \nretailer can use to make that same calculation. There is nothing exotic \nor difficult in the process, but that is what is missing.\n  Amazon--I use them as an example--actually collects sales tax, and \nthey support our marketplace fairness bill, as do many other Internet \nretailers. The difficulty we have run into, though, is there is a \nresistance to giving fairer treatment to stores across America that are \ncollecting sales taxes every day against retailers on the Internet that \nmay or may not collect those taxes themselves.\n  What difference does it make? I have talked to some of the people who \nrun big chain stores, and they say it has reached a point that \nsomething has to be done. Consumers come into a store, a major store, \nand they ask to see certain products--running shoes, bicycles, flat-\nscreen TVs. They pick the one they like the best, write down all the \ninformation about it, and they are never seen again. Some of them do \nhave the nerve to return at a later date when they make their purchase \nover the Internet to the bricks-and-mortar store when they are \ndissatisfied with the product. Of course the bricks and mortar store \nhad nothing to do with the sale of the product. They are being asked to \nprovide some consumer relations on a product they didn't even sell.\n  What is happening? Take a look at the last Thanksgiving holiday \nweekend--one of the biggest retail weekends of the year. Early reports \nsuggest that the stores on Main Street and shopping malls across \nAmerica had flat sales compared to last year. How about Internet retail \nsales for that weekend? They were up significantly across America.\n  What we are looking for is parity and some equality. It is not fair \nto say to the store down the block that is paying the rent, paying the \nproperty taxes, and collecting the sales taxes that we are going to put \nthem at a disadvantage to their Internet competitors. Internet \nretailers benefit under our current system, sadly, because they don't \ncharge for sales tax--many of them don't. They have a 5-percent or 10-\npercent advantage over Main Street competitors. When you ask many of \nthese Internet retailers whether they want to continue the current \nsystem, they say: Of course, it gives us a break.\n  It is not fair, it is not right, and it should be changed. Products \nsold online seem cheaper when sales and use taxes are not collected at \nthe point of sale, but we all know that tax is still owed by the \ncustomers. Thousands of Main Street businesses have worked hard to grow \ntheir businesses. They employ local people. Now they have become \nnothing but show rooms because of this unfairness. Examples: Steve \nSahli from Play It Again Sports in Naperville, IL, knows this issue of \nshowrooming all too well. For more than 20 years, Play It Again Sports \nhas been serving the Naperville, IL, community. People come into the \nstore, they try out big-ticket items, use their phones sometimes to \ntake a picture, walk out the door, and buy the item online.\n  Soccer Plus in Palatine, IL, is an example of what happens when it \nbecomes too difficult to compete with online retailers because of their \nprice advantage. Two years ago, Soccer Plus went out of business. We \nlost good-paying jobs in Palatine, and Palatine lost a business that \nwas paying its property taxes, employing all the people, and sustaining \nthe services of that good city. There is nothing we can do for Soccer \nPlus now, but we can still help other retailers avoid that same fate.\n  Even with countless stories like these, the House of Representatives \nhas refused to address this issue. Numerous requests to the chairman of \nthe House Judiciary Committee to mark up e-fairness legislation from \nranking members and other members have not resulted in any action \nwhatsoever. The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee is calling \nfor regular order when it comes to e-fairness legislation but has \nrefused to even hold a legislative hearing on the only e-fairness \nlegislation to be introduced in the House. That was by Representative \nJason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah. He introduced the bipartisan \nRemote Transactions Parity Act. We have worked on a bipartisan basis in \nthe Senate with Congressman Chaffetz, Congressman Womack, and others to \ncome up with a bill that we think is fair that can pass. All we are \nasking for is a day in court--a legislative hearing, a markup, and \nbring the matter to the floor of the House. The chairman of the House \nJudiciary Committee has refused to work with us on this legislation. He \nhas his own approach. I disagree with it, but let's have the debate. \nLet's have the vote. Isn't that what Congress is supposed to be all \nabout? These calls for regular order are nothing more than veiled \nattempts to delay and obstruct in the House. Let's have regular order. \nLet's bring up the Chaffetz measure. If the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee in the House has his own alternative, let him offer that as \nwell.\n  While House leadership calls for regular order on legislation to \nlevel the playing field for Main Street retailers, they bypassed \nregular order by airdropping a permanent extension of the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act into a totally unrelated bill. It was a bill in Customs \nrelating to trade agreements. At the very last minute, they dropped in \nthis provision for the permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act.\n  The same Members of Congress calling for regular order on e-fairness \nlegislation skipped regular order when it came to the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act. Last week, the Customs reauthorization conference report, \nwhich reformed some of our Customs and trade law, was released. Many \nwere surprised to find deep in the bill on page 381 a brand new \nprovision that had nothing to do with Customs, nothing to do with \ntrade, has not had a recent hearing in the Senate and was dropped in at \nthe last minute in this bill--the permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act.\n  This provision wasn't in the bill that passed either the House or the \nSenate. It is what happens toward the end of the legislative session \nwhen things go bump in the dark. Internet Tax Freedom Act hasn't even \nbeen considered by this body. Yet there it was in a conference report \nmeant to resolve differences that had been debated for months.\n  I do not support the permanent extension of the Internet Tax Freedom \nAct in the conference report. I am going to oppose any other attempt to \nmove anything longer than the remaining 9-month extension of the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act until September 30, 2016. I support the merits \nof the legislation, but it is grossly unfair to speed this through with \nan airdrop in a conference report without any hearing and to do it at \nthe disadvantage of retailers and businesses across America.\n  A long-term extension of the Internet Tax Freedom Act should be \npaired with the Marketplace Fairness Act. We can make them both \npermanent law. Let's do it and do it together. Let me explain why. We \nshould not cut off States and localities at the knees by preventing \nthem from collecting tax revenues, by reducing Federal funding, and \nwithout also providing State and local governments the authority to \ncollect the taxes already owed. The Federal Government has cut funding \nfor States and local governments over the last several years in an \nattempt to put the Federal Government on the right fiscal path. Tough \ndecisions have had to be made. Many States and local governments are \nstruggling, even in my State. In a one-two punch, some in Congress want \nto increase this burden by permanently\n\n[[Page S8650]]\n\npreventing States and localities from imposing certain types of taxes \nwhile denying them the authority to collect sales and tax revenue that \nis already owed to them.\n  In 2015 alone, my State of Illinois will lose at least $390 million \nunder the Internet Tax Freedom Act. Chicago will lose $197 million. \nSpringfield will lose $6 million. How do we expect States and \nlocalities to fund first responders, firefighters, emergency services, \n911 dispatch, health care services, local road maintenance, and all the \nother services that support our community? Unlike the Federal \nGovernment, States and localities can't run deficits to continue these \nservices. The only option they have is to raise other taxes, such as \nproperty taxes, or to cut vital services.\n  There is a reasonable path forward. Congress should pass both a long-\nterm extension of the Internet Tax Freedom Act--which says we will not \nimpose State and local taxes on access to the Internet--and pass the \nMarketplace Fairness Act, which allows States to opt in so Internet \nretailers selling in their State will collect the sales tax due and \nremit to the States and localities.\n  I hope my colleagues in the House will work with me to do that. I \nwelcome the opportunity to have a serious dialogue about how to move \nboth pieces of legislation forward in an expeditious manner.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield to me for just a \nmoment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to my friend and colleague from \nVermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I hope both Senators and Members of the \nother body listened to what the distinguished senior Senator from \nIllinois just said. We all extol the virtues of Main Street America--\nsmall towns, big towns. I think of the businesses I go into every time \nI am home in Vermont. These are hard-working people. They are people \nwho support the Little League, the Boy Scout troops, help with all the \nvarious charitable drives. And they're being treated unfairly.\n  What the Senator from Illinois said is absolutely right. There are \ntwo different issues. Let's start leveling the playing field. Let's \nstart worrying as much about the citizens of our own community, the \npeople who make our communities work, as we do about some conglomerate \nthat none of us ever see, and our communities never see. So I am proud \nto say I strongly support what the Senator from Illinois has done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today our Nation is distracted by grave \nconcerns, by threats abroad and at home, by concerns about our economy \nand our people. I stand here today to call on us to continue to be \nfocused on something that is not currently at the top of the news but \non something that is a pressing and ongoing national concern. We need \nto be strictly and aggressively enforcing the terms of our nuclear deal \nwith Iran that we reached with a variety of our other international \npartners and that is currently moving forward. We need to push back on \nIran's bad and disruptive behavior, not just in its region but \nglobally, and give our administration and international agencies the \nresources and the nominees confirmed that will allow them to be \nsuccessful in enforcing our actions against Iran.\n  A few short months ago, if you asked anyone what topics would be at \nthe top of the list of America's foreign policy conversation or the \nupcoming Presidential campaign, you would have been hard-pressed to \nfind anyone who didn't mention the Iran nuclear agreement front and \ncenter. It completely centered the debate in this Chamber and around \nthe country last summer and fall. What a difference a few months can \nmake.\n  This morning many of us are deeply concerned about an alleged bomb \nthreat in Los Angeles that is causing hundreds of thousands of \nschoolchildren to be sent home mid-schoolday. And in response to the \nrecent and horrific attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, we are focused \non identifying weaknesses in our border security and in finding ways to \nprotect the American people without compromising our fundamental \nvalues.\n\n  We are rightly focused on expanding the U.S.-led coalition to defeat \nISIS and on finding a way to assist our allies in providing safe haven \nto some of the millions of refugees fleeing terror and chaos abroad. \nSadly, we are also distracted by a Republican Presidential primary in \nwhich a leading candidate has cast aside the Constitution in favor of \nincendiary rhetoric. That is why I rise today to make sure we remain \nfocused on one of America's most important challenges to the United \nStates and our key allies, including, centrally, Israel, which is \nenforcing the terms of the nuclear deal with Iran.\n  On September 1, after a long study and real reflection and \nsignificant debate, I ultimately announced my support for the Joint \nComprehensive Plan of Action, or the JCPOA, also known as the Iran \nnuclear agreement. Just over a week later, the review period ended and \nCongress failed to reject the deal, so it moved forward. The agreement \ntook effect a month and a half later on October 18, known as adoption \nday, when Iran agreed to give the International Atomic Energy Agency, \nor IAEA, dramatically expanded inspection and verification powers. We \nare now 3 months into the JCPOA, and I want to take this opportunity \ntoday to assess areas where the Obama administration and our \ninternational partners have done well over the past 3 months and to \nhighlight areas where we must do more.\n  Since adoption day, we have seen some progress and some real setbacks \non implementing the terms of the deal.\n  First the positives, and there are some. Iran has begun to \nreconfigure its plutonium nuclear reactor at Arak so it can no longer \nproduce materials necessary for a nuclear weapon. The government has \nalso started to dismantle its enrichment centrifuges and its \ninfrastructure that would have enabled it to use uranium as a nuclear \nweapon in the short term. The IAEA has also continued to make \npreparations to monitor and verify the deal and to increase its number \nof inspectors on the ground, to deploy modern technologies to monitor \nIran's declared nuclear facilities, and to set up a comprehensive \noversight program of Iran's centrifuge manufacturing facilities and its \nentire nuclear fuel cycle, from uranium mines, to mills, to enrichment \nfacilities.\n  These steps are promising, but by no means do they tell the complete \nstory of Iran's bad behavior since this deal was reached, nor do these \nfew positive steps indicate that implementing the terms of this deal \ngoing forward will be anything less than exceptionally difficult. In \nfact, not only will enforcement of this deal be incredibly tricky, but \nI believe how effectively and aggressively we enforce the JCPOA in \nthese early months and years will set the table for how we respond when \nIran commits violations later. Whether we respond now when Iran commits \nminor violations around the boundaries of the nuclear deal will send a \ncritical message to our allies and adversaries alike.\n  I am confident that the actions taken by the United States and our \nallies to counter and restrain Iran and the Middle East, especially in \nthese early months of the deal, will profoundly impact Iran's behavior \ngoing forward.\n  That brings me to less positive news. When I announced my support for \nthe JCPOA last September, I made it clear that it was based on a deep \nsuspicion of Iran, an inherent distrust of their intentions, and a \nclear-eyed commitment to aggressively oversee and enforce the terms of \nthe deal.\n  My concerns proved justified on October 22 when Iran concluded a \nballistic missile test in clear violation of U.N. Security Council \nResolution 1929. Those unlawful tests came just days after adoption day \nunder the JCPOA. Last week, before the U.N. Security Council could \nfinish their investigations and take any concrete actions, we heard \nreports of a second Iranian ballistic missile test on November 21.\n  I fear the Iranians are taking action after action in this area and \nothers to\n\n[[Page S8651]]\n\ndemonstrate that they are willing to flout international rules, \nregulations, and restrictions. And in the absence of our decisive \naction, these misdeeds by the Iranians will simply continue and \nescalate.\n  Today, a new report from the IAEA gives further justification to the \ndistrust shared by supporters and opponents of the nuclear deal. The \nIAEA report on the so-called possible military dimensions--or PMD--of \nIran's nuclear program found ``that a range of activities relevant to \nthe development of a nuclear explosive device were conducted in Iran \nprior to the end of 2003 as a coordinated effort, and some activities \ntook place after 2003.'' These activities included computer modeling \nthat took place as recently as 2009.\n  The PMD report details just how determined Iran has been to develop \nnuclear weapons capability. Iran developed detonators. Iran \nexperimented with explosives technology. Iran engaged in computer \nmodeling of a nuclear explosive. Iran even set up organizations \nspecifically dedicated to nuclear weapons activity. It is not hard to \nconnect those dots, and the IAEA did. That agency found that Iran \nengaged in efforts to demolish, remove, and refurbish facilities \nrelated to testing nuclear weapons components. Its government also \noffered misleading explanations of its past nuclear behavior.\n  It is equally important to note what the IAEA did not find. Iran's \nweapons program didn't advance beyond an exploratory stage. The IAEA \nfound no indication there was a whole undeclared nuclear fuel cycle in \nIran or that Iran held significant amounts of undeclared uranium.\n  Despite the ambiguous nature of this report, I think the take-away is \nclear: Iran's nuclear weapons-related activities and its sustained \ndetermination to hide and obfuscate its behavior reinforce our \njustifications for ongoing distrust of the Iranian Government and for \nthe strict monitoring and verification of the components of the nuclear \ndeal.\n  My colleagues and I have access to classified material, meaning we \nknow more than is publicly known about the extent and direction of the \nnuclear weapons program in Iran. But the IAEA report is important \nbecause it establishes a baseline for Iran's program, for our \nassessment of their breakout time, and for our knowledge of how far \nthey have gotten in weaponization. Knowledge of these efforts is \ncritical to our future enforcement of this deal.\n  The IAEA report also reaffirms that as implementation of the deal \nmoves forward, the international community must continue to seek and \nconsider information about Iran's past nuclear activity. In my view, \nthe IAEA must maintain its ability to continue reviewing any new \ninformation related to Iran's past nuclear weapons program, and we have \nto continue to assertively investigate any new accusations of Iranian \ncovert activity or malfeasance.\n  We have to continue to counter Iran's rogue actions--which only serve \nto isolate Iran on the world stage--by continuing to enforce sanctions \nwithout exception and be prepared to impose new sanctions if and when \nIran's behavior warrants it. For example, the U.S. Ambassador to the \nUnited Nations, Samantha Power, was right to immediately shine a \nspotlight on the recent ballistic missile test I recently cited and to \ncall for a U.N. Security Council investigation promptly. When that \ninvestigation is completed, the Security Council should act, but if it \ndoesn't, I hope and expect that the administration is ready to enforce \na series of unilateral American actions, including direct sanctions \nagainst those Iranians responsible for this violation. While these \nballistic missile tests are outside the parameters of the JCPOA, our \nresponse has to be strategic, and we have to make sure Iran knows it \ncan't continue to simply and blatantly disregard the international \ncommunity and the U.N. Security Council.\n  Since the announcement of the JCPOA, the Treasury Department has \ntaken steps to target Iran's malign activity in the region. In \nNovember, the Treasury Department designated three Hezbollah \nprocurement agents and four companies in Lebanon, China, and Hong Kong \nfor purchasing dual-use technology on behalf of Hezbollah. These \nsanctions followed actions in July against three senior Hezbollah \nmilitary officials in Syria and Lebanon who were providing military \nsupport to the Syrian regime and an additional Hezbollah procurement \nagent who served as the point person for the procurement and \ntransshipment of weapons and materials for the group and its Syrian \npartners for at least 15 years.\n  These designations also follow Treasury's actions during negotiations \nover the JCPOA when the Department utilized multiple authorities and \nsanctioned more than 100 Iranians and Iran-linked persons and entities, \nincluding more than 40 under its ongoing terrorism sanction \nauthorities.\n  In November, Treasury also participated in the U.S.-Gulf Cooperation \nCouncil Working Group on Iran, through which participants discussed our \njoint efforts to counter Iran's support for Hezbollah, for the Assad \nregime, and for other militant proxies in the region. That working \ngroup continues to improve information sharing and cooperation to take \njoint actions targeting Iran's support for terrorism and its other \ndestabilizing activities in the region and around the world.\n  In early December, Saudi Arabia agreed to designate 12 Hezbollah \nofficials for terrorism, further disrupting their ability to raise and \nmove funds around the gulf.\n  Implementing this agreement successfully will demand that we continue \nto develop discrete, clear, and public responses to minor Iranian \nviolations of the agreement. My view on this was shaped in no small \npart by advice I got from a dear, long-term friend in New York, \nMaurice, who told me about his experience decades ago negotiating a \ncomplex commercial deal with Iran. After 2 years of excruciating and \ndetailed back-and-forth negotiations, he told me they sat at the table \nto sign their agreement and begin their commercial partnership. After \nshaking hands across the table, the lead Iranian negotiator said: Now, \nmy friend, the negotiations begin in earnest.\n  All of us who have studied Iran's behavior and know the history of \ntheir work to conceal their nuclear weapons program and their work to \ndestabilize the region know that Iran will cheat on this agreement. \nThey will litigate the boundaries. They will find ways large and small \nto test us.\n  For example, the nuclear agreement bars Iran from enriching beyond \n3.67 percent. How will we respond if, for example, for a month Iran \nclaims it accidentally enriched to 4 percent? We are unlikely to snap \nback the full multilateral sanctions regime because such a move would \nhave little support in the international community for such a small and \ntransient infraction and could be perceived as an overreaction. But \ninaction is not an option either. In coordination with our allies, we \nmust develop a menu of responses that allow us to respond quickly and \nprecisely to minor violations of the deal because there are no real \nminor violations of the deal. Otherwise Iran will little by little eat \naway at the constraints of this agreement, and our deterrence and \ncredibility will collapse.\n  In addition to deploying sanctions more effectively and ratcheting \nthem up as necessary, the international community must also increase \nour efforts to push back against Iran's malign activity in the Middle \nEast. More specifically, we have to enhance our campaign of \ninterdicting Iranian weapons shipments and support to its proxies in \nSyria, Yemen, and Lebanon. Iran sends illicit arms shipments to \nterrorist groups such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis who pass \nthrough international waters, and under both domestic and international \nlaw, the United States maintains its authority to disrupt these \nshipments. We must use that authority to act and to demonstrate our \nwill. We must use that authority to work with our partners in the \nregion and our allies around the world to increase the tempo and scope \nof our interdiction efforts. Successful interdiction efforts not only \nget deadly weapons out of the hands of terrorists but also deter Iran \nand undermine its proxies throughout the Middle East.\n  We know we can be successful in this aspect of our enforcement \nbecause the administration has already successfully disrupted Iranian \nweapons shipments in recent months. Although many of us have been \nbriefed in a classified setting about encouraging developments in this \narea, I think it is important that we have at least one example that we \ncan share with our colleagues and the world.\n\n[[Page S8652]]\n\n  Please take a look at this picture to my left. In September, a raid \noff the coast of Yemen seized a large cache of Iranian arms destined \nfor the Houthi rebels who seek to undermine the legitimate Yemeni \nGovernment. This massive weapons shipment included a whole series of \nthe component parts of sophisticated TOW missiles, including 56 tube-\nlaunched, optically tracked, wire-guided TOW missiles and the \nassociated sights, mounts, tubes, battery sets, launcher assemblies, \nguidance systems, battery assemblies, and nearly 20 other sophisticated \nanti-tank weapons. I commend the administration for these efforts and \nfor this successful interdiction in international waters, but we cannot \nstop there.\n  Every month while Iran negotiates with the international community \nwith one hand, with the other hand it has been sending millions of \ndollars' worth of weapons to the murderous Assad regime in Syria, to \nHezbollah in Lebanon, and to the Houthis in Yemen. We must not stand by \nwhile Iran continues to spread its terror and destabilize this \nregion. Nor is it sufficient simply to increase our interdiction \nefforts. We must publicize these efforts when successful.\n\n  When an American smalltown sheriff pulls off a successful drug bust, \nwe better believe that sheriff is going to hold a press conference and \nput on the table the drugs and guns taken off the streets. Actions like \nthat send a simple signal to those who engage in the drug trade that \nthere is a sheriff in town who is actually going after bad actors and \nwho isn't going to tolerate this destabilizing and illegal activity.\n  I think the American people and the international community need to \nknow about Iran's bad behavior and our willingness to take effective \nactions to push back. Just as importantly, Iran needs to know that the \ninternational community remains serious about cracking down on its \nillegal arms shipments and its promotion of terror.\n  I am committed and I am willing and ready to help the administration \nincrease its interdiction efforts in any way I can. A shared commitment \nto this from my colleagues--a shared focus on this from my colleagues--\nis especially important today when many members of the administration \nand the American people are understandably focused elsewhere: on our \nPresidential election next year, on the global refugee crisis, and on \nrecent terrorist attacks and the conflict with ISIS.\n  These are busy times. As the holidays approach and as Congress nears \na massive budget deal, I see my colleagues and my constituents focusing \nless and less on Iran, but we must maintain our focus for the months \nand years to come. Given the 24/7 news cycle and the media's incessant \nfocus on the crisis of the moment, we will be tempted to turn our \nattention elsewhere.\n  Adoption day was not the end of the agreement with Iran. In fact, it \nsignified just the beginning. And we must think strategically about the \nMiddle East, which critically includes Iran as the central promoter of \nterrorism and source of destabilizing action in the region.\n  We must redouble our efforts to follow through on the most rigorous \nenforcement of the JCPOA or face terrible consequences. We have to \nscrutinize Iranian actions ever more closely for signs it is reneging \non its commitments. This JCPOA is set to last in principle for 15 years \nbut in some terms indefinitely. Congress must not waiver--not for 1 \nday--in our oversight of the implementation of this agreement.\n  Whether my colleagues supported or opposed the deal, we should put \nour differences about that aside and focus on enforcement. The deal is \ndesigned to deter Iran from evading or cheating on the deal while also \ncountering Iranian bad activity in the region. That is why I worked \nwith a group of my colleagues to introduce the Iran Policy Oversight \nAct in September. This bill, cosponsored by supporters and opponents of \nthe JCPOA, helps ensure the United States aggressively enforces the \nterms of the nuclear deal. The Iran Policy Oversight Act also provides \nsupport for our friends in the Middle East, most centrally our vital \nand steadfast ally, Israel.\n  I am pleased to hear the administration is working on negotiating a \nnew 10-year memorandum of understanding for Israel's security, and I am \npleased to hear that its assistance will continue to grow to ensure \nIsrael maintains its qualitative military edge.\n  In recent weeks, I have also had the chance to discuss the Iranian \ndeal and our intention to continue to enforce the sanctions that remain \non the books and to interdict and to push back against Iran's \ndestabilizing regional activities. When I was in Paris at the global \nclimate conference, I had the chance to discuss this issue with French \nGovernment officials and business leaders. I will continue these \nefforts in early January when I will travel with seven other Senators \nto the Middle East and to Europe to discuss our progress implementing \nthis nuclear deal and the challenges that remain.\n  I commend President Obama and his administration for engaging with \nCongress during the debate over the Iran agreement and in the months \nsince it took effect, but I urge the administration not to lose focus \nand to work with this Congress in the months ahead to ensure strict \nenforcement of the agreement.\n  But we in Congress have our part to do here as well, not the least of \nwhich is making sure the executive branch has capable and effective \nofficials, which is a crucial part of effective implementation. In \nrecent months, not only has the Senate not done its job, but this \nChamber's inaction and our apparent focus instead on Presidential \npolitics means we are increasingly making this Chamber less relevant in \nAmerican foreign policy.\n  The United States has a very qualified and capable leader in the \nenforcement of sanctions in Adam Szubin, who oversees the current \nimposition and enforcement of sanctions at the Department of Treasury. \nMr. Szubin worked under the Bush administration and under the Obama \nadministration. He is a dedicated, capable, seasoned career \nprofessional who has been widely complimented on a bipartisan basis by \nmembers of the Banking Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee on \nwhich I serve. He has been nominated to be the new Under Secretary of \nTreasury for Terrorism Financing--a position critical to the successful \nenforcement of the JCPOA--but his nomination has been on hold for \nmonths for no clear and publicly stated reason.\n  Adam Szubin's nomination is one of more than two dozen national \nsecurity-related nominations, including Tom Shannon, nominated to be \nthe Under Secretary of Political Affairs at the State Department. Tom \nShannon is a career Foreign Service officer and a determined, \ndedicated, nonpartisan professional who also would play a critical role \nin working with our allies and ensuring successful enforcement of this \nagreement.\n  Adam Szubin, Tom Shannon, and nearly two dozen other nominees have \nbeen blocked, seemingly for purely partisan reasons in this Senate. I \ncall on my colleagues to release their holds and to give the \nadministration the resources and the personnel it needs to do its job \nin enforcing this difficult deal.\n  The Senate's commitment to overseeing and enforcing the terms of this \ndeal must go beyond simply doing our job and giving the President's \nnominees an up-or-down vote. We have to do more. I stand ready to work \nwith this President and the next one to fully oversee the JCPOA. The \nlength of this agreement will transcend Presidential terms, and \nimplementing it should transcend politics as well.\n  We know Iran will seek every opportunity to push the limits of this \ndeal in an attempt to test our resolve. We must not let Iran relitigate \nthe terms of the deal and escape the boundaries of this deal and lay \nthe groundwork for its future development of a nuclear weapon. We must \ndeter them by holding them accountable.\n  When this President or a future President, Republican or Democrat, \nsuccessfully enforces this deal, I will be the first one to compliment \nthem for countering Iran's destabilizing activity in the region. And \nwhen the administration, current or future, isn't actively and \nvigorously enforcing this deal and pushing back on Iran, I will be the \nfirst to ask--to demand--that it do more.\n  The Iranian Government is paying close attention to everything we do, \nand I, for one, am determined to make sure that Congress, the \nadministration, and the American people are doing the same, to \ndemonstrate to Iran our determination and our will to deter them\n\n[[Page S8653]]\n\nand to closely and vigorously enforce this difficult deal.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/15/senate-section/article/S8653-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8653-S8654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BOYD MATHESON\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute, bid farewell, \nand, coincidentally, to wish a 1-day belated birthday to a truly \nextraordinary gentleman from Cedar Hills, UT, who is a dear friend, a \ntrusted partner, and one of the finest human beings I have ever known. \nFor nearly 4 years, Boyd Matheson has served my Senate staff ably and \nhonorably, first as State director and then for the last 3 years as \nchief of staff. He has served with special distinction on Team Lee, so \nmuch so that as far as my staff and I are concerned, we are all on Team \nBoyd. I can say with confidence and a great deal of gratitude that \nwithout Boyd Matheson I would not be here today.\n  I first met Boyd about 12 years ago when he and his wife Debbie and \ntheir five children moved into my neighborhood. They had just returned \nto Utah after spending more than a decade outside the State and in \nplaces as far away as Australia while Boyd was building his successful \nconsulting business. I could tell right away that Boyd felt at home in \nUtah, as well he should. After all, the State was settled by Boyd's \nancestors, who came to Utah in the 1850s in search of a place where \nthey could worship, believe, and live as they saw fit without fear of \npersecution.\n  While Boyd's ancestors helped settle the State in the 19th century, \nhis parents, who raised an impressive 11 children, helped populate our \nState in the 20th century. I soon got to know Boyd, who was active in \nmany of the same ecclesiastical and political causes in which I was \ninvolved, and I was immediately struck by his masterful command of the \nEnglish language. Boyd wasn't given to excessive speech, but when he \nspoke people listened. I noticed that everything Boyd said was at once \nprofound, disarming, inviting, persuasive, and informative--a rare \ncombination. Not much has changed since then. To this day, listening to \nBoyd speak is an uplifting experience for all who are fortunate enough \nto be present.\n  Although it would be several more years before I got to know Boyd \nvery well, I quickly identified him as someone whose opinion mattered \nto me and to others and whose skills as a communicator I deeply \nadmired. Whenever anyone I knew was in need of advice on how to \ncommunicate an important message, I referred them to Boyd, assuring \nthem with great confidence that this was a man who had an uncanny \nability not only to say the right things but also to say them in just \nthe right way.\n  For that very reason, when I began considering running for the \nSenate, Boyd was one of the very first people I called. As one who had \nnever previously sought or held public office, I knew that the odds \nwere highly stacked against me, to put it mildly. With an instinctive \ntrust in his judgment, I understood that I would need Boyd's help in \norder to have any plausible chance of winning.\n  I still remember the first of what would be countless conversations \nthat would take place over the next few months. I was on my way home \nfrom work late one evening when I placed the call. I wasn't sure \nwhether he would tell me I was out of my mind or whether he would \nprovide encouragement, nor was I even sure which answer I would prefer. \nNevertheless, I knew, regardless of his response, that I should listen \ncarefully to his assessment of my ideas.\n  To his credit, and consistent with his thoughtful, careful approach, \nhe didn't give me a definitive answer immediately. Instead, he asked \nfor time to think about it, suggesting that we continue to visit \nperiodically over the next few months, and this we did. In due time, we \nboth came to the same conclusion.\n  When I entered my Senate race in 2010, I asked Boyd to serve as my \ncommunications director. I knew that his distinctive vision for the \nfuture, his commitment to positive reform, and his unparalleled gifts \nfor communication would provide my campaign with the direction, clarity \nof purpose, and optimism it would need to have any chance of success.\n  I was right. Boyd was the perfect man for the job. He proved to be \nindispensable to the campaign, quickly earning an appropriate and very \ndescriptive nickname. We often referred to him not simply as Boyd but \nby his longer and appropriate nickname, which was ``Boyd to the \nrescue.''\n  You see, just weeks into the campaign my wife Sharon christened him \n``Boyd to the rescue'' because she noticed that he could solve just \nabout any problem, that his calming reassurance had a positive effect \non everyone around him, and that somehow things just went more smoothly \nwhen he was around.\n  With Boyd's help I was elected in November 2010. Then, when it was \nall over and I made plans to transition to Washington, I invited him to \njoin my Senate staff. While disappointed, I was not surprised that he \nopted to remain in Utah, returning to his career as a businessman and a \nconsultant, a career which I had rather rudely interrupted a year \nearlier.\n  You see, Boyd is not your typical chief of staff. Indeed, he is very \nunlike most of the people you will find in this town--or in any town, \nfor that matter--in the best and most admirable ways imaginable, Boyd \ndidn't ascend to his post by working his way up Washington's political \npecking order, biding his time until it was his turn. No, he spent the \nbulk of his career--which, I would add, is just still getting started--\noutside of politics, starting and running his own businesses to serve \nothers and to create true value in society, and he began doing this at \na very early age. In high school, Boyd ran sports camps where he taught \nkids in his community the fundamentals of how to succeed on the field, \non the court, and in life. This has been the Boyd Matheson business \nmodel ever since he was in high school and started his first business--\ninspiring, teaching, and helping those around him to succeed, though \nhis target audience has changed over time from youth athletes to \nbusiness executives, foreign dignitaries, long-shot political \ncandidates, and eventually, thankfully, this Senator from Utah.\n  Boyd agreed to join my campaign not because he had any political \naspirations or ambitions of his own; he just wanted to make a \ndifference. He knew that our country was headed down the wrong track \nand that his fellow Utahns and Americans in every State were facing \nchallenging times ahead. He wanted to help however he could, but it \nwasn't until he had spent a year crisscrossing the State and the \ncountry with my campaign that Boyd realized the magnitude of the \neconomic and social challenges facing the United States. He met \ncountless families and hardworking Americans anxious about their \ncountry's future and struggling just to keep up. He visited far too \nmany isolated, forgotten communities that were stuck in poverty with \nfew opportunities and even fewer reasons for hope. And he got a glimpse \ninto the political dysfunction plaguing and, at the same time, \nperversely enriching Washington, DC.\n  By the end of the campaign, I could tell that Boyd knew the road to \neconomic recovery and social revival in America would be long and \narduous, but I also knew he cared enough about his family, his \ncommunity, his State, and his country that he would do just about \nanything to be part of the solution. So when Boyd decided not to pursue \na job on Capitol Hill after the campaign, deep down I knew that, God \nwilling, he would be back.\n  Thankfully, God was willing and so was Boyd. If my first year in the \nSenate taught me anything, it was that I needed Boyd Matheson's help to \nsurvive in Washington. So on December 5, 2011, as my first year in \noffice was coming to a close, I decided to call him and ask him to take \na job as my State director. Here again, I wasn't sure what his answer \nwould be, but I knew I needed to ask. It was an offer I hoped he might \naccept. Not only had I given him ample time to forget about all the \nlate\n\n[[Page S8654]]\n\nnights and early mornings of the campaign, but the job I was offering \nhim would allow him to stay in Utah most of the time, at least for the \ntime being.\n  In the end, it was providence that sealed the deal. When I called \nBoyd to offer him the job, I was at the airport in Salt Lake City \ntraveling back to Washington after a weekend at home with my family. \nAfter a few minutes of small talk and catching up on the phone, Boyd \nasked me where I was at the moment. I told him I was at the airport.\n  ``Me too,'' he said, adding that he was on his way to Bangkok. \n``Which airport?''\n  ``Salt Lake City,'' I replied.\n  ``Me too,'' said Boyd. ``Which concourse,'' he asked.\n  ``D,'' I said.\n  ``Me too,'' Boyd repeated again. ``Which gate,'' Boyd asked, as we \nboth started looking around the crowded terminal.\n  Before I could respond, we had both spotted each other sitting with \nonly a few chairs between us in the waiting area adjacent to gate 6.\n  We continued the conversation in gate D-6 in person and then via text \nmessage once we boarded our respective flights--mine to Washington and \nBoyd's to Thailand. Eventually he accepted the offer, convinced that \nour chance encounter in the airport that day was, as his wife Debbie \nwould later put it, an ``inspired connection.''\n  It was inspired, indeed, but the connection was not just between Boyd \nand me; it was a connection between a man and his moment, between Boyd \nand the countless people whose lives have been forever changed because \nof his faithful service over the last 4 years. And no one has been more \nblessed than I have.\n  Boyd has been my constant ally, spiritual coach, advocate, speaking \nsurrogate, and friend. In addition to his many skills and attributes, \nso many of which are well-known to anyone who has interacted with my \noffice, Boyd possesses a deep and genuine concern for others. Coupled \nwith his freakishly intuitive sixth sense, this makes Boyd the \nconsummate friend and indispensable teammate.\n  For reasons I don't entirely understand but appreciate more than he \ncan possibly know, Boyd has the extraordinary ability to know when, \nwhere, and how he is most needed long before anyone else does, long \nbefore the person who needs him knows.\n  Years ago I lost track of how many times Boyd had sensed that I was \nworried about something and then he immediately called or texted--\ninvariably with exactly the right words that addressed my concerns.\n  This, of course, is not part of the chief of staff job description in \nmy office; it is just what Boyd does, not only for me but for everyone \nhe knows. I can't count the number of times he has stepped in to help \nme, my family, and my staff in moments of need without having been \nasked and often at great personal sacrifice.\n  Considering how hard he works to help others, many of us who know and \nwork with him often ask: Does this man ever sleep?\n  This, in turn, has sparked a number of half-joking suggestions among \nmy staff that Boyd Matheson is actually a vampire, one who survives on \nDiet Coke rather than blood and rarely, if ever, sleeps. When we ask \nhim whether he will ever take the rest that he needs and most certainly \ndeserves, he relies on a well-worn response, saying, ``I have promises \nto keep, and miles to go before I sleep.'' The literary world \nrecognizes these as the words of Robert Frost, but my family, my staff, \nand I will always attribute them to Boyd. By word and by deed, he made \nthese words his anthem.\n\n  Needless to say, Boyd has kept his promises and has more than earned \nhis right to sleep. Yet, somehow, knowing Boyd as I do, I doubt he will \nhold still for long. Boyd Matheson at his core is a passionate \nreformer. He is exactly the kind of reformer with exactly the kind of \ncourage and convictions that are so badly needed but too often in short \nsupply here in Washington.\n  Boyd is, in the words of essayist William George Jordan, one of the \nreformers of the world:\n\n     . . . its men of mighty purpose. They are men with courage of \n     individual convictions, men who dare run counter to the \n     criticism of inferiors, men who voluntarily bear crosses for \n     what they accept as right, even without the guarantee of a \n     crown. They are men who gladly go down into the depths of \n     silence, darkness, and oblivion, but only to emerge finally \n     like divers--with pearls in their hands.\n\n  Ask Boyd what pearls he has found in Washington and he will tell you, \nwithout pause or hesitation, ``the people.'' It is the people he will \nmiss the most, which is exactly the kind of answer you would expect \nfrom Boyd--a man who genuinely cares about people. No matter who you \nare or how your path happened to cross with his, Boyd listens to and \nlearns from you, he inspires and teaches you, and he always sees the \nbest in everyone, challenging each of us to do the same.\n  I am most fortunate to know Boyd Matheson and to call him my friend. \nI am most thankful for his sacrifice and that of his wife Debbie and \ntheir five children, who have seen on so many occasions the sacrifice \nof this great man in the service to me, to my staff, and to others. The \npeople of Washington, DC, are going to miss Boyd Matheson, and the \npeople of the great State of Utah will be lucky to have him back.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have had the honor of being the ranking \nDemocrat for the U.S. Senate on the Helsinki Commission. I work with \nSenator Wicker, who is the Senate chairman of the Helsinki Commission. \nThe two of us have worked very hard on many issues.\n  As I am sure everyone here knows, the Helsinki Commission is the \nimplementing arm for U.S. participation in the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe--the OSCE. It is probably best known \nfor its human rights basket. It does deal with security, military \nsecurity. It does deal with economic and environmental security. But I \nthink it is best known for its human rights and the impact human rights \nhave on the security of the OSCE region.\n  In March of this year, the president of the Parliamentary Assembly of \nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Mr. Ilkka \nKanerva, appointed me to serve as the assembly's first special \nrepresentative on anti-Semitism, racism, and intolerance. Since that \ntime, I have focused my work on the urgent issue of anti-Semitism and \ncommunity security, anti-Muslim bigotry, and discriminatory policing. \nSo let me share with my colleagues the work I have done this year on \nbehalf of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly and on behalf of all Members \nof the Senate.\n  My appointment came after horrific back-to-back terrorist attacks in \nParis and Copenhagen in January and February. In both instances, Jewish \ninstitutions were targeted--a kosher supermarket in Paris and a \nsynagogue in Copenhagen. In both instances, some symbol associated with \nfree speech was also attacked. In Paris, a murderous rampage was \nunleashed against the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. In \nCopenhagen, a conference on free speech, where a Danish cartoonist was \namong the speakers, was attacked.\n  I subsequently visited both cities, along with Senator Wicker and \nRepresentative Aderholt, fellow members of the Helsinki Commission. \nFollowing our trip, I authored Senate provisions to increase State \nDepartment funding to combat anti-Semitism and other forms of \ndiscrimination in Europe and cosponsored Senator Menendez's resolution \non anti-Semitism. That resolution supports national strategies to \ncombat and monitor anti-Semitism and hate crimes, including training \nlaw enforcement and collecting relevant data. I am pleased that our \nState Department has advanced many of the efforts outlined in these \nlegislative provisions through OSCE and civil society initiatives.\n  I have also focused on the problem of discriminatory policing. This \nsummer, Hungary's Commissioner for Fundamental Rights issued an \nimportant report on community policing in Hungary's second largest \ncity, Miskolc. He\n\n[[Page S8655]]\n\nconcluded that police had participated in mass, raid-like joint \ncontrols, executed with local government authorities, public utility \nproviders, and other public institutions, without explicit legal \nauthorization and predominantly in segregated areas inhabited mostly by \nRoma. In short, police targeted Roma for harassment, fines, and daily \nindignities.\n  For those of us who listened to Attorney General Holder present the \nDepartment of Justice's report on Ferguson last March, the Hungarian \nCommissioner's report has the feeling of deja vu--many differences, to \nbe sure, but similar in that critical community confidence in law \nenforcement has been abused and damaged.\n  I have sought to address these issues with several pieces of \nlegislation, including S. 1056, the End Racial Profiling Act; S. 1610, \nofficially named the BALTIMORE Act, Building and Lifting Trust in Order \nto Multiply Opportunities in Racial Equality, and S. 2168, the Law \nEnforcement Trust and Integrity Act. Among other provisions, these laws \nwould ban racial profiling by State and local law enforcement, \nestablish mandatory data collection and reporting, and address the \nissues of police accountability and building trust between police \ndepartments and communities by providing incentives for local police \norganizations to voluntarily adopt performance-based standards to \nreduce misconduct.\n  In the OSCE, where discriminatory policing issues have been \ndocumented from the United Kingdom and France to Russia, I have urged \nthe chair-in-office to hold a high-level meeting on racism and \nxenophobia focused on concrete action.\n  Following the most recent tragedies in Paris and San Bernardino, \nthere has been a backlash of hatred directed against the asylum \nseekers, immigrants, and Muslims in many OSCE countries, often fueled \nby populist or extremist parties, such as Le Pen in France, UKIP in \nGreat Britain, the True Finns in Finland, Swedish Democrats, Austrian \nFreedom Party, or Golden Dawn in Greece. Worse still, this kind of \nxenophobia bleeds into the discourse of mainstream parties. As such, I \nwill add an increased focus on prejudice and discrimination linked with \nthe migration and refugee crisis to my priorities.\n  In addition to focusing on anti-Semitism and discriminatory policing \nand the anti-Muslim backlash, I will also look at the protection of \nmigrants and refugees, as that is becoming an area of discrimination \nthat is troubling in the OSCE region--including in our own country of \nthe United States. I am particularly troubled by the spike in violence \nin our own country directed at houses of worship and community \ncenters--fueled by escalating anti-Muslim discourse. In Palm Beach, FL, \nvandals broke all the windows at the Islamic Center, ransacked the \nprayer room, and left bloody stains throughout the center. That cannot \nbe tolerated in our country. A number of mosques have reported \nreceiving death threats or messages of hate. A pig's head was thrown at \na Philadelphia mosque, shots were fired at a mosque in Connecticut, and \na fake bomb was left at a Virginia mosque not far from where we are \nhere today in the U.S. Capitol.\n  I disagree in the most emphatic way possible with those who would \nhave us call for excluding people from this country based on their \nfaith, and limiting political participation based on religion. That is \nnot who we are. Those are not our values.\n  The images of Jewish refugees on SS St. Louis turned away, port after \nport, many of whom ultimately perished in death camps, and the image of \nAmerican citizens, including children, imprisoned in internment camps \nsolely because of their race, are dark corners of our own history. We \nmust be careful not to retread that path. It is one reason I question \nthose who describe terrorism as a Muslim problem. Such statements \nprevent our communities from working together against a common threat. \nThe slaughter of schoolchildren in Columbine, the massacre of \nchurchgoers in Charleston, and the Oklahoma City bombings were not \nWhite problems just because the perpetrators were White; neither should \nthe attacks in Paris and San Bernardino be distilled as Muslim \nproblems.\n  Radicalization is a very real problem that currently tries to exploit \nthe Muslim community, but it is our problem--Muslims Jews, Christians, \nWhites, Latinos, Blacks, all Americans--to all come together to solve \nthis problem.\n  When I see the young people who engaged in these horrible acts, I \nquestion why they were susceptible to such great untruths that would \nallow them to harm themselves and others. No family should have to lose \ntheir mother, son, or cousin to mass shootings. No family should have \nto live with the fear that their loved ones were the perpetrators of \nmass violence. We must work together to guard against such ideologies \nthat would steal our young people from us.\n  Given that the United States is historically a nation built upon \nimmigration and the tenets of religious freedom, Americans have long \nlived alongside others and have seen people of different faiths live \ntogether in peace. Muslims have lived in America since the colonial \ndays and served under the command of George Washington. There are an \nestimated 5,900 Muslims who currently serve in our armed services \ndefending our country and our way of life. When the Supreme Court ruled \nthis summer in favor of a young Muslim woman who allegedly suffered \nemployment discrimination because of her head scarf, Justice Scalia \nannounced the 8-to-1 decision, noting, ``This is really easy.'' Neither \nimmigrants nor Muslims are new to our shores.\n  Islam is also not new to Europe. Europe's own historic relationship \nwith the rest of the globe has set the stage for ties that have long \nserved as the backbone of prosperity for the Western world. Europeans \nhave created a presence throughout the world--and that is a two-way \nstreet. Many countries in the OSCE region, including our own, therefore \nhave a learned history of integration that can be useful in addressing \nthe increasing diversity stemming from the refugee crisis and changing \ndemographics.\n  Given the conflicts that have forced mass displacement and migration, \nwe should support long-term inclusion and integration efforts at the \nnational, regional, and local level throughout the OSCE region--\nespecially with the leaders of humanitarian efforts for Syrian and \nother refugees--such as what is being done today in Turkey, Germany, \nSweden, Austria, and OSCE partner states such as Jordan and Lebanon. \nThey are taking on tremendous burdens for the refugees because they \nknow it is the right thing to do. They need partners, including the \nUnited States.\n  The successful integration of immigrants and refugees--including \naccess to quality housing, education, employment, and public services--\nfacilitates meaningful intellectual, economic, and other contributions \nof migrants and refugees that are especially critical for children. \nThese are areas in which our nations should exchange experts and \ninformation.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced provisions in the Senate for a Joint \nAction Plan between the United States and the European Union to \nformulize and coordinate public and private sector anti-discrimination \nand inclusion efforts. We need diverse coalitions working together to \naddress the momentous threats we face today. This includes leading by \nexample by providing factual information about refugees and immigrants \nand publicly addressing narratives of hate. It is in that spirit that I \nwill continue to work with other parliamentarians and with the \nadministration to combat anti-Semitism, racism, and other forms of \nintolerance in the United States and elsewhere in the OSCE region. I \nwill do that as the special representative of the OSCE Parliamentary \nAssembly, and I will do that as a U.S. Senator.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the weekend, countries meeting in \nParis signed a broad new climate agreement. President Obama called the \nagreement a success. He said it was a ``strong agreement.''\n  Despite the fanfare, let's keep some things in perspective. There are \nimportant parts of this agreement that can\n\n[[Page S8656]]\n\ndo a great deal of damage to American jobs and the American economy. \nThat should be and is a big concern to the American people. Parts of \nthe agreement can do damage to our jobs and our economy. At the same \ntime, important parts are not binding on other countries. The American \npeople are right to wonder if the White House has signed yet another \nterrible deal just to try to shore up the President's legacy.\n  Earlier this year, President Obama was so anxious, so desperate to \nget a deal with Iran over its nuclear program that the President signed \na terrible deal. Since then, the International Atomic Energy Agency \nsaid that Iran has ``seriously undermined'' the agency's ability to \nverify what Iran has done. Here we are again. It is another bad deal, \nand other countries that signed it are already ignoring it.\n  India is the world's third largest emitter of carbon. The agreement \nwas on Saturday. This agreement tied plans to meet their emissions \ntargets to getting U.S. taxpayer dollars. Then on Monday--just \nyesterday--India said it has plans to double its coal output by 2020. \nIs that what President Obama calls, in his mind, a success?\n  A Gallup poll came out yesterday that showed that the American \npeople's biggest concern is not climate change; it is terrorism. Only 3 \npercent of all Americans said that pollution or the environment was the \nmost important problem facing America today.\n  President Obama says climate change is our biggest threat. President \nObama continues to put a priority on things that he expects to help his \nlegacy, not on the issues the American public actually are concerned \nabout. As elected representatives, we should not allow the President to \nbuy a legacy for himself using American taxpayer dollars. I am willing \nto sit down with any Democrat who wants to work on a realistic, \nresponsible, and achievable plan to make American energy as clean as we \ncan, as fast as we can, without raising costs on American families. \nThat should be our goal: coming together to find a real solution, real-\nworld solutions, things that work, not just signing a symbolic \nagreement that does not solve anything, something that may make the \nPresident feel good but doesn't actually do good.\n  Democrats and Republicans in the Senate can do it. Just look at all \nwe have accomplished this year working together. It has been a very \nproductive year in the Senate. I am not the only one saying it. Last \nWednesday, U.S. News & World Report said: ``There's reason for optimism \non Capitol Hill ahead of a looming deadline to pass a trillion-dollar \nomnibus funding measure.'' The magazine asked: ``What is behind it?'' \nWell, they said: ``After years of partisan gridlock, Congress has \nseemingly regained its ability to get things done.''\n  After years of partisan gridlock, Congress has seemingly regained its \nability to get things done. The bipartisan policy committee said the \nsame thing recently. They pointed out that the House and Senate have \nboth made important progress this year. They said: ``Both chambers have \nreinvigorated a robust committee process.''\n  Getting committees back to work is essential to getting Congress back \nto work, and that is what Republicans have done this year. So far this \nyear, the total number of days worked is up from last year by almost an \nadditional 3 weeks of work on the Senate floor. This is in comparison \nto when Harry Reid was in charge. We have been considering a lot more \namendments this year as well. For all of last year, there were only 15 \nup-and-down votes on amendments--15 for the entire year. So far this \nyear, we have voted on over 200 amendments. These are amendments both \nby Democrats and Republicans. These are opportunities for individual \nSenators to stand up, offer their ideas, and be heard--ideas that they \nthink will make America better, make legislation better, not just what \nthe leader of the party wants, Senator Reid, who blocked so many \namendments--not just what Senator Reid might think is best for the \nPresident, no; what the American people think is important.\n  So when you look into the substance of what we have done, the news is \neven better for the American people. So far this year we passed major \nlegislation that has been helping Americans all across the country. We \npassed an important law on Medicare to make much needed reforms and to \nreauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program. We passed the \nfirst multiyear highway bill since 2005. We passed the longest \nreauthorization of the highway trust fund in almost a decade.\n  These aren't just short-term patches for a few months or a year. That \nis what happened when the Democrats were in charge. These are long-term \nfixes that create the certainty and the stability our economy needs. \nThis year the Senate passed the most significant education reform since \n2002. We passed an important human trafficking law. We passed a budget. \nCan you imagine that? There hasn't been a budget passed in both Houses \nof Congress since 2009. We passed one this year.\n  As chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, I can tell you that we \nhave made a lot of progress this year on legislation to improve the \nlives of people across Indian Country. We passed a measure that will \nhelp make crucial and long overdue improvements on roads on tribal \nlands. Last week we passed legislation that helps give tribes more \neconomic opportunities. It gives them more control over developing \ntheir natural resources.\n  Republicans are eager to work with Democrats and to produce \nlegislation the President will sign. We are proud of the \naccomplishments of this year. At the same time, we are not afraid to \nchallenge President Obama's most misguided and dangerous policies. That \nis why the Senate passed legislation repealing ObamaCare to ease \nAmericans' pain under this law. We passed a measure on the Keystone XL \nPipeline to create jobs, energy security, and economic growth, and we \nput that bill on the President's desk to force him to finally make a \ndecision.\n  We challenged President Obama's job-crushing energy regulations by \nvoting to block his power plan and his devastating rules on waters of \nthe United States. I wish to point out, looking at a headline from \nyesterday's New York Times, that EPA broke the law with regard to \npushing their water rule. The EPA broke the law, which is this issue of \nthis whole waters of the United States. The EPA must be held \naccountable--accountable for breaking the law, accountable for misuse \nof government funds. We will hold this administration accountable.\n  Of course we also oppose the President's nuclear deal with Iran. We \nhave shown the American people we can get things done, and there is a \nviable alternative to the reckless policies coming out of the White \nHouse.\n  Looking back on what we have been able to do this year, I think there \nis real reason for optimism. The Senate doesn't need to be the place of \ngridlock that it had become under Harry Reid. In 2016 the Senate will \nbe taking more votes on important legislation and on amendments. There \nwill be more debates, more consideration of ideas from both sides of \nthe aisle. That is what the American people have sent us to do. That is \nwhat they expect from us. The American people have seen it is possible \nto govern and that not everything in Washington is broken. It takes \nleaders who are committed to getting things done and committed to \nlooking out for the best interests of the American people.\n  This is the end of the year, but it is not the end of this Congress. \nIt is not the end of what the Senate can do to make the lives of the \nAmerican people better. We have done a lot. There is still a lot of \nwork to be done over the next month and the next year. We will continue \nto work to relieve the burden and the expense of excess government \nregulations, to reduce the power of unelected, unaccountable Washington \nbureaucrats, and to return to the States and to the people more of the \ncontrol that belongs to them. The goal is to give people at home the \npower to make their own decisions about what is best for them, their \ncommunities, and their families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/15/senate-section/article/S8656-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8656-S8657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF ROBERTA JACOBSON\n\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I rise to urge consideration of the \nPresident's nominee for Ambassador to Mexico. I do so for two simple \nreasons: One, this is a critical position, vacant since\n\n[[Page S8657]]\n\nJuly, and, two, Roberta Jacobson is highly qualified for this position. \nHer nomination deserves our attention. I do so as a Senator from a \nborder State and as a Senator who believes we have a constitutional \nduty to advise and consent.\n  We have a distinguished candidate ready to serve. We have strong \nsupport for her on both sides of the aisle. What we need is an up-or-\ndown vote. The L.A. Times has called Roberta Jacobson ``among the most \nqualified people ever to be tapped to represent the U.S. in Mexico.''\n  She has impressive experience, including important work on the Merida \nInitiative, fighting drug trafficking and organized crime in Mexico. \nShe has served ably as State Department Assistant Secretary for the \nWestern Hemisphere, working to improve relations in our hemisphere and \nto engage Cuba--opening opportunities for Americans after over 50 years \nof a failed U.S. policy.\n  She was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with \nbipartisan support. Yet the weeks go by and still we wait.\n  Our relations with Mexico are critical--affecting our economy, \naffecting our security. Mexico is working with us to stop those who \ncross our southern border illegally. Mexico is our third largest \ntrading partner. One million American citizens live in Mexico. It is \nour top tourist destination, with millions of U.S. visitors every year. \nMy State shares a border with our neighbor to the south. We also share \na cultural heritage. The trade that grows every year--hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in goods and services--move between our Nations. \nOver 36,000 jobs in my State depend on United States-Mexico trade. This \nincreased trade is an engine of economic growth. Exports from New \nMexico to Mexico have soared from over $70 million a year to now $1.5 \nbillion 15 years later.\n  In New Mexico we know how important this partnership is. We need a \nstrong ambassador in Mexico City--working on trade, on border security, \nand on cultural ties between our Nations. We need an ambassador to work \nwith Mexico and other Central American countries to address immigration \nissues, to help resolve the migrant crisis, to crack down on border \nviolence and drug trafficking. This is clear to both sides of the \naisle, especially to those of us from border States. As someone who has \nworked with Roberta on multiple issues, I know she is the right person \nfor this job.\n\n  I especially want to thank my Republican colleague, Senator Jeff \nFlake, for his efforts. He is concerned, as I am, that this cannot \nwait. As Senator Flake said recently:\n\n       It's crunch time now. Once you get into next year, it's \n     easier to just put them on hold until the next president \n     assumes office in 2017.\n\n  I hope that will not happen. I hope we will listen to Senator Flake \nbecause it is crunch time and because we do need to get this done.\n  What is holding up her nomination? It isn't her qualifications. It \nisn't concerns about how she would be able to carry out her duties as \nAmbassador. The problem is rooted in something else--something that \nshould have no bearing on whether she is confirmed: Presidential \npolitics and policy differences with the administration over her work \non Cuba.\n  This year, the world celebrated the reopening of diplomatic relations \nbetween the United States and Cuba. As the Assistant Secretary for the \nWestern Hemisphere, Roberta helped negotiate this shift. We have begun \na 21st century relationship with Cuba--one I am convinced will bring \nfreedom and openness. I congratulate the President for leading this \nhistoric change.\n  A few Senators disagree with his Cuba policy, and so they are \nblocking Roberta Jacobson's confirmation to serve as Ambassador to \nMexico.\n  Unfortunately, this is just one example of how the rules are being \ntwisted and misused. She is one of the many qualified nominees whose \nconfirmations are on hold. Many of them wait because one or two \nSenators want to make a political point or extract political pain. Not \nhappy with the President? Block his nominee. Not OK with a policy? Keep \nthe seat vacant.\n  The real aim is the administration. No matter how qualified, the \nnominee is just an easy target.\n  Meanwhile, the backlog grows: 19 judges, half a dozen ambassadors, \neven a top official at the Treasury Department whose job is to go after \nthe finances of terrorists. That position is vacant as well.\n  We are on track for the lowest number of confirmations in three \ndecades. We now have 30 judicial districts with emergency levels of \nbacklogs. At the beginning of the year, we had 12. Thousands of people \nare waiting for their day in court because there is no judge to hear \nthe case. Important work for the American people is left undone.\n  When we fail to do our job, when we fail to give these nominees a \nvote up or down, our government fails too.\n  This is not just the President's team. It is our team. It is \nAmerica's team--working on trade and security, moving our economy \nforward, seeing that justice is done.\n  These vital posts should not go unfilled.\n  I urge my colleagues to allow us to move these nominations forward \nnow.\n  I do not believe the Constitution gives me the right to block a \nqualified nominee, no matter who is in the White House. I say that \ntoday, and I have said it many times before.\n  A Republican President may have nominees I disagree with. That is \nmost likely so. But the people elect a President. They give him or her \nthe right to select a team to govern.\n  Today--right now--the majority leader can call a vote to confirm \nthese nominees, yet he chooses not to. We changed the Senate rules to \nallow a majority vote, but that does no good if they remain blocked. \nThat is what is happening in this Congress. The line gets longer and \nlonger of perfectly qualified nominees who are denied a vote and are \nunable to serve.\n  So I am not sure who wins here, but I know who loses. The losers are \nthe American people. The losers are the men and women who cannot get a \nday in court, because there is no judge to hear their case.\n  The losers are American citizens, businesses, and workers who rely on \nour embassies and other public servants. The room is empty, and the \nwork is not done--all because one Senator says no, and the majority \nleader says OK.\n  Nominees should be judged on their merits, not on feelings about a \nPresident someone may not like or a policy someone may not approve. \nThey are public servants in the executive branch, on our courts. They \nserve the people of this country.\n  Too often now that service goes begging because one Senator wants to \nmake a point and will gum up the works to do it. That is not governing; \nit is a temper tantrum.\n  So I say to my colleagues: Let's get serious. Let's stop these games. \nGive nominees the consideration they deserve. Give the American people \na government that works.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL.

Mr. President, last year we made a promise to the American \npeople. If we were elected to the majority, we would get Washington \nworking again for American families. Republicans in the Senate have \nbeen focused on putting our country on not just another course but a \nbetter course. This will allow us to begin rebuilding the trust of \nhard-working taxpayers who have seen their government become less \neffective and less accountable.\n  Over the course of this year, as the Senate got back to work, the \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S8658]]\n\npeople got to see something that had been missing from this side of the \nCapitol over the past 8 years; that is, an open and transparent \nlegislative process. This included Members from both sides of the aisle \noffering, debating, and ultimately voting on amendments to not just our \nbalanced budget resolution and reconciliation proposal but to a whole \nhost of legislative measures. Leader McConnell promised this, it is \nhappening, and bills are passing because people on both sides of the \naisle are having an opportunity to represent their constituents, to get \nvotes on amendments.\n  The previous year we had 15 total votes on amendments. This year we \nhave already had 192 votes on amendments, and the year is not over. So \ninstead of allowing political points and partisan gridlock to take \nprecedence over responsible governing, we are once again doing the \npeople's business, and the Senate Budget Committee played an important \nrole.\n  We had the first balanced budget in 14 years. Yes, Congress this year \napproved its first balanced 10-year budget since 2001. Americans who \nwork every day to provide for their families and pay their taxes \nunderstand that it is time for the Federal Government to live within \nits means, just as they do. Hard-working taxpayers know they can't live \non borrowed money, and neither can our Federal Government. This \nbalanced budget approved by Congress shows these families that if they \ncan do it, so can we. Our goal is to make our government more \nefficient, effective, and accountable. If government programs are not \ndelivering results, they should be improved, and if they are not needed \nthey should be eliminated.\n  A balanced budget would also help America tame its exploding debt, \nwhich today totals almost $19 trillion. Every dollar spent on interest \non our debt is another dollar we won't be able to use for government \nservices, for individuals in need or another dollar that won't be \navailable for taxpayers for their own needs. Washington must live \nwithin its means, just as every hard-working family does every day, and \nwe have to deliver a more effective and accountable government to the \nAmerican people that supports them when it must and gets out of the way \nwhen it should.\n  To get our country and economy back on track, Americans must be \nallowed to spend more time working to grow their businesses or to \nadvance in their jobs instead of worrying about taxes and inefficient \nand ineffective regulations. We want to empower our job creators to \nfind new opportunities to expand our economy and, most importantly, \nassure that each and every American has the opportunity to find a good-\npaying job and a fulfilling career.\n  This is why the balanced budget also provided for repeal of the \nPresident's unprecedented expansion of government intrusion into health \ncare decisions for hard-working families and small businesses. Our goal \nis to lift the burdens and higher costs ObamaCare has placed on all \nAmericans.\n  ObamaCare is saddling American households with more than $1 trillion \nin new taxes over the next 10 years, and according to the Congressional \nBudget Office, ObamaCare will cost taxpayers more than $116 billion a \nyear. For every American, ObamaCare has meant more government, more \nbureaucracy, and more rules and regulations, along with soaring health \ncosts and less access to care.\n  The budget reconciliation legislation passed by the Senate will \neliminate more than $1 trillion in tax increases placed on the American \npeople, while saving more than $400 billion in spending. Most \nimportantly, this bill begins to build a bridge from the President's \nbroken promises to a better health care system for hard-working \nfamilies across the country.\n  The Senate Budget Committee is an important resource for facts and \ninformation about the congressional budget process and the economy. \nThat is why my committee recently began publishing its budget bulletin \nagain, to provide regular expert articles by committee analysts on the \nissues before Congress relating to the budget, deficits, debt, and the \neconomy. This year the bulletin has addressed the highway trust fund \ndebate; defense spending, BCA caps, and OCO special funding; \nreconciliation and the Byrd Rule; budget enforcement and points of \norder; the appropriations process, which is the spending bills; the \ndebt limit debate; and the 2016 continuing resolution.\n  Another important part of the committee's work is to increase \noversight and transparency surrounding congressional spending. This is \nwhy I directed the Congressional Budget Office to release regular \nreports tracking the budgetary impact of enacted legislation against \nthe fiscal year 2016 balanced budget resolution the Republican Congress \napproved. I have provided these reports after each recess work period \nin order to provide a status update on Congress's progress achieving \nthe budget resolution plan.\n  Regularly providing information such as this will help foster fiscal \ntransparency in the Federal spending process, and over time it will \nencourage a heightened awareness in the importance of complying with \nthe budget. It will also help ensure that Congress remains focused on \nfiscal responsibility.\n  The recent omnibus spending and debt deal clearly illustrates that \nthe Federal budget process is in serious need of reform, which is why \nthe Senate Budget Committee this year has also focused on fixing our \nbroken budget process.\n  Instilling the Federal budget process with regular action and \npredictability, active legislative oversight and spending transparency \nare critical to strengthening our democracy and reducing our Nation's \nunsustainable spending and debt.\n  We often talk about the threat America's growing debt poses to our \neconomy and our future, but the growth in Federal regulations also \nposes a threat to long-term economic growth and job creation. The \ncommittee this year has been working to shine a light on these \nregulations and the burden they have on each and every American. It is \ncritical for lawmakers and hard-working Americans to understand the \ntrue cost of regulations that are being issued by the administration. \nTaming our ``regulation nation'' will help ensure that the Federal \nGovernment works for the people, instead of people working for the \ngovernment.\n  These aren't the only things that the Senate accomplished. I was \nproud to be a part of the Finance Committee's efforts to replace the \ndoc fix so that doctors could be paid properly and Medicare recipients \nwould be able to see doctors, also to enact trade promotion authority \nlegislation, to increase trade that increases dollars to the United \nStates, and also to finance the highway trust fund. I was proud to be a \npart of the effort of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nand I commend my chairman for his work on those bills.\n  Today I also want to acknowledge Senator Cochran's work to lead the \nAppropriations Committee in reporting all 12 appropriations bills for \nthe first time since 2012. Incidentally, they stayed within the budget \non those, and most were bipartisan. It is the first time all 12 \nappropriations bills have been voted out of committee since 2012. I \nwant to thank Senator Murkowski for her work on energy issues, \nincluding the Keystone Pipeline bill, and Senator Cornyn, for his \nefforts to protect victims of trafficking.\n  I was also proud to work this year on some issues important to my own \nState of Wyoming by pushing back on the administration's Clean Power \nPlan and waters of the United States rule, primarily designed to \neliminate the use of coal and drive up the price of electricity in this \ncountry, which in essence will cost the average American a lot more for \ntheir electricity. Just as importantly, it will send jobs overseas \nwhere the energy costs less.\n  This year Congress also corrected a problem that the 2012 highway \nbill created for Wyoming, and I commend Senator Barrasso for his \nefforts on that. I also want to thank Senators McCain and Isakson for \ntheir work to support our troops and our veterans. I appreciate Senator \nMcCain working with me to ensure small businesses have the help they \nneed to compete for Federal contracts.\n  This isn't an exhaustive list. There are several more things. We \npassed over 80 bills this year. But these are some of the things we can \nbe proud of. The Senate is under new management,\n\n[[Page S8659]]\n\nand these accomplishments and others still to come show hard-working \ntaxpayers that Republicans in the Senate are working to deliver a more \neffective and accountable government, a government for the people and \nby the people that supports them when it must and gets out of the way \nwhen it should. We have made great progress this year, but there is \nstill more to be done. By working together, we are proving that we can \ndeliver real solutions and real progress that the American people want \nand deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/15/senate-section/article/S8659-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8659-S8660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TAX BREAK PARITY\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, here is where we are. The Republicans are \nholding the government spending bill and tax breaks for businesses \nhostage unless they can attach a rider to these bills to allow Big Oil \nto export American oil overseas to the highest foreign bidder. Ten days \nbefore Christmas, Republicans want to give Big Oil the biggest of all \nChristmas presents by lifting the crude oil export ban, and they keep \nsaying no to long-term extensions of the wind and solar tax breaks and \nprotections for consumers as part of the deal. Lifting the oil export \nban would be a disaster for our economy, our climate, and for our \nnational security. We should have tax break parity.\n  Let me tell you where we are right now. In America the oil industry \ngets approximately $7 to $8 billion a year in tax breaks. It is \ninteresting because $7 to $8 billion is what the wind and solar \nindustry receives each year--pretty even: wind and solar; oil--$7 to $8 \nbillion every year in tax breaks.\n  We keep hearing from the other side: Let's have a level playing \nfield; let's have all of the above. Well, what are they asking for \nright now?\n  Here is what they are asking for. The oil tax breaks will continue \nforever, and the wind and solar tax breaks will phase out over the next \n3 to 5 years. This is on top of the windfall which the oil industry \nreceives from the exportation of the oil that otherwise would stay here \nin the United States. Under that scenario, the losers are going to be \nU.S. consumers because we will be exporting the oil that is already \nhere in our own ground, so that the oil industry can get a higher price \noverseas. It will hurt our national security because we still import 5 \nmillion barrels per day. Can I say that again? We still import 5 \nmillion barrels of oil a day. We still import 25 percent of all our \noil. Some of the countries we import that oil from you may have heard \nof--Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Algeria, Nigeria. We are still \nimporting oil, and we are still exporting men and women over to the \nMiddle East to protect those cargo ships of oil, bringing it to the \nUnited States. We don't have a surplus of oil in the United States. We \nhave a deficit of 5 million barrels of oil per day. So that is a \ndangerous policy. On top of that, I will just say that the whole \nethanol subsidy program in the United States is premised upon the fact \nthat we do not have energy independence and we need ethanol to get $1.3 \nbillion dollars' worth of tax breaks a year--biodiesel.\n\n  Well, that whole program starts to get called into question if we are \nalready going to declare energy independence here, even as we still \nimport 5 million barrels a day. Our domestic refiners will be hurt by \nthis unless there are proper protections built in in the Tax Code for \nthose refiners. Otherwise, as that crude oil goes overseas, it is going \nto call into jeopardy the viability of the oil refineries across the \nEast Coast, Midwest, and West Coast of the United States of America.\n  On the environment, if Brookings Institution is correct and upwards \nof 3 million barrels of oil will be exported by the year 2025, that is \nthe equivalent of 150 coal-burning plants of additional pollution going \nup from our own soil.\n  Some people question: Well, will that really happen? Let me give you \nsome other numbers. The Energy Information Administration says that the \ndeveloping world and its expanding economy are going to require 10 \nmillion additional barrels of oil by the year 2025. The expanding \neconomy is going to require 20 million barrels of new oil by the year \n2035.\n  What Big Oil in America wants is a piece of that action. They want to \nbe able to export into that market, and they will do so by drilling on \nAmerican soil, not to reduce our own dependence upon imported oil but \nto sell it because the price on the global market is higher--much \nhigher than the price they could get in America.\n  Is that truly a good policy, given what we are seeing about the \nstability of the Saudi government? Well, just look at the governments \nall across the Middle East from which we import oil. Is this really a \ngood idea? I don't think so. I think it goes to the heart of our \nnational security.\n  What happens to the Big Oil industry over the next 20 years is that \nthey pick up about $500 billion in new tax revenues; that is with a \n``b,'' $500 billion. They keep their $7 billion in tax breaks every \nyear over a 20-year period. That is $140 billion more.\n  Meanwhile, the solar and wind tax breaks expire; they run out. The \nrumors are they run out over the wind in 3 years. Well, the young \ngeneration is the green generation. They think wind and solar are the \nfuture. They don't think fossil fuels are the future.\n  The whole world, 195 countries, just gathered and signed an agreement \nto move away from a fossil era to a low-carbon, clean-energy future. So \nif there was going to be a deal out here, then there should be some \nequality. If you don't take away the tax breaks from oil and gas, then \ndon't take away the tax breaks for wind and solar--a level playing \nfield, all of the above. Have a competition so that we can know at the \nend of the day--which is what I think is going to happen--that \nrenewables are actually the future. It is a tale of two tax breaks: one \nfor Big Oil and one for the renewable industry.\n  As I stand on the floor, this is still an unanswered question, but I \ndo know this: The Republicans are pledging that if their Presidential \ncandidate wins in 2016, then in 2017 that Presidential candidate is \ngoing to take off the books the clean power rules that President Obama \nhas promulgated. They are going to review the fuel economy standards \nthat push us to 54.5 miles per gallon by the year 2025, which is still \nthe largest single reduction of greenhouse gases in one stroke that any \ncountry in the world has ever actually announced. They are also saying, \nobviously this week, that they are going to allow the wind and solar \ntax breaks to expire. So just as the world meets, we have the \nannouncements about what their goals are on this issue.\n  I think the world expects more from us, but I actually think the \nyoung people of our country expect more from us. They truly think this \nis the future; this is the revolution: more efficient vehicles, \npowerplants that have fewer emissions, tax breaks for wind, and solar \nfor fuel cells--the future. It is not having 150 new powerplants of \ncoal equivalents of oil being drilled for in our country without some \ncorresponding, permanent, long-term tax breaks that would offset it. \nNo, it is just the opposite. They are saying: We are coming after the \nPresidential election for the reductions in greenhouse gases from \npowerplants. We will take those rules off the books. We are going to \nreview the fuel economy standards. We will take those off the books, \nand we will make sure there is never again a permanent tax break for \nwind and solar. That is where we are in the same week that the world \njust met in Paris to announce the global solution to a global warming \nproblem.\n  So I say equality; I say keep it the same. If you want to keep oil, \nif you want to keep natural gas tax breaks, keep them. But don't take \naway ours; that is, not mine but those who believe in a low-carbon, \nclean-energy future for our planet. The United States must be the \nleader. We are the innovation giant. We are the country that the world \nis looking for in order to find these solutions.\n  We passed laws that created this cell phone in 1996. Until then it \nwas the size of a brick, and people didn't have one in their pocket. \nThen, 8 years later, a new cell phone came along. By the way, 600 \nmillion people in Africa have them because we innovated; we went first.\n  We can do the same thing in the energy sector, but there has to be \nsome fair treatment that is put in place, especially when the oil \nindustry receives such an incredible bonanza of those breaks here--$500 \nbillion in new revenues. From my perspective, it is undermining our \nnational security because\n\n[[Page S8660]]\n\nwe shouldn't be exporting oil when we are still importing it from \ndangerous places on the planet, and they keep all their tax breaks.\n  From my perspective, I look at the Republican mantra from 6 to 7 \nyears ago. It was ``Drill Here, Drill Now, Pay Less.'' They were \nsaying: The more we drill here, the more energy independence we are \ngoing to have. They are replacing it this week with ``drill here, \nexport there, pay more'' here at home. That is their new slogan. \nEverything they had said about why we should be drilling here is now \nmade obsolete by their commitment to now ensure that oil gets exported. \nThere are two prices: There is an OPEC price for global oil, and there \nis a Texas price for American oil. It is always cheaper here. They want \nto get it off into ships to get the OPEC price on the global market. I \nunderstand that.\n  What I don't understand is how we can leave behind--with tax breaks \nthat are phasing out and the rumors that the wind tax break expires \nover the next 3 years--those new technologies that are branded ``Made \nin America,'' such as these cell phone technologies, these smartphone \ntechnologies that have revolutionized countries and continents all \nacross the planet.\n  I come to the floor to say I understand why Big Oil wants this. It is \nabout as great a Christmas gift as any industry would ever have \nreceived.\n  In return, I hope before we adjourn that we can find a way of being \nmore generous--much more generous--to those other companies, those \nother technologies that are the future. I hope the promises Republican \nPresidential candidates are making that they are going to come back and \ntake the clean powerplant rules off the books--that they are protected \nbecause we have the tax breaks. It still signals to industries that \nthey are our future and the past is just a memory, that there is a new \n21st century vision that America is going to lead, that the promises \nPresident Obama made in Paris on behalf of the American people are, in \nfact, going to be met, and that our policies are going to reflect the \nwords the President spoke.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for this time.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, from voting to repeal ObamaCare to passing \nthe first long-term Transportation bill in a decade and the first joint \nbalanced budget in 14 years, Senate Republicans have worked hard this \nyear to fulfill our promise to get Washington working again for \nAmerican families.\n  While some of our efforts have been blocked by Senate Democrats or by \nthe President, we have still managed to get a lot done. I am \nparticularly proud of some of the legislation we passed this year that \nwill benefit South Dakota families and businesses as well as families \nand businesses across the country. One bill that I have been working on \nfor a long time--a bill that will mean a lot to South Dakota's farmers \nand ranchers--is the legislation the House passed last week, the \nSurface Transportation Board reauthorization bill.\n  The Surface Transportation Board is responsible for helping to ensure \nthe efficiency of our rail system by addressing problems and \nadjudicating disputes between railroads and shippers. Unfortunately, it \nhas been clear for several years now that the Surface Transportation \nBoard needs to work better. This became particularly apparent in 2013 \nand 2014 when a sharp increase in shipping demand and harsh winter \nweather conditions combined to create massive backlogs in the \navailability of railcars for grain shipping which, in turn, caused \nstorage issues for farmers across the Midwest.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture found that the rail backlog \nlowered the price of corn, wheat, and soybeans in the upper Midwest. It \nforced shippers to pay record-high railroad-car premiums--in the \nneighborhood of 28 percent to 150 percent above the previous average \nlevels--for roughly 65 consecutive weeks.\n  The Surface Transportation Board legislation that Congress sent to \nthe President last week will help prevent another situation such as \nthis in the future. The bill, which I spearheaded, makes a number of \nsignificant reforms to the Board. For starters, it establishes the \nnumber of Board members and establishes a more collaborative process \nthat will allow members to work together to identify and solve problems \nas they emerge. The bill also provides the Board with the investigative \nauthority to address rail service issues even if an official complaint \nhas not been made. This will allow and encourage the Board to be more \nproactive when it comes to addressing problems in our Nation's rail \nsystem.\n  The bill also increases transparency by requiring the Surface \nTransportation Board to establish a data base of complaints and to \nprovide quarterly reports with key information to facilitate the \neffective monitoring of service issues. Finally, the bill improves the \ncurrent process for resolving disputes between railroads and shippers.\n  Right now, disputes can take multiple years and literally millions of \ndollars to resolve, putting a tremendous burden on shippers and on \nrailroads as well. The legislation we developed improves this process \nby setting timelines for rate reviews, expanding voluntary arbitrary \nprocedures, and requiring the Surface Transportation Board to study \nalternative rate review methodologies to streamline and to expedite \ncases. It requires the Surface Transportation Board to maintain at \nleast one simplified, expedited rate review methodology. These changes \nwill increase efficiency throughout the rate review process.\n  South Dakota farmers and ranchers depend on our Nation's railroads to \nbring their goods to market. They also depend on our Nation's highways. \nThis year I was proud to work with my colleagues in the Senate on the \nfirst long-term Transportation bill in a decade.\n  Over the past several years, Congress made a habit of passing \nnumerous short-term funding extensions for Federal transportation \nprograms. Over the past several years of short-term extensions, the \nlatest, I think, was No. 38. That was an incredibly inefficient way to \nmanage our Nation's infrastructure needs, and it wasted an incredible \namount of money. It also put a lot of transportation jobs in jeopardy.\n  When Congress fails to make clear how transportation funding will be \nallocated, States and local governments are left without the certainty \nthey need to authorize projects or to make long-term plans for \naddressing various transportation infrastructure needs. That means \nessential projects, construction projects, get deferred. Necessary \nrepairs may not get made, and the jobs that depend on these projects \nand repairs are put at risk.\n  The Transportation bill we passed this month changes all that. It \nreauthorizes transportation programs for the long term, and it provides \n5 years of guaranteed funding. It means States and local governments \nwill have the certainty they need to invest in big transportation \nprojects and the jobs that they create. That, in turn, means a stronger \neconomy and a more reliable, safer, and effective transportation \nsystem.\n\n  As chairman of the commerce committee, I spend a lot of time working \nwith committee members on both sides of the aisle to develop the \nTransportation bill's safety provisions. Our portion of the bill \nincludes a host of important safety improvements, including \nenhancements to the notification process to ensure that consumers are \ninformed of auto-related recalls, and also important reforms at the \ngovernment agency responsible for overseeing safety in our Nation's \ncars and trucks.\n  Another important success for South Dakota this year was the final \napproval of the expansion of the Powder River Training Complex--the \nmilitary training airspace over South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, \nand Wyoming. The expanded airspace approved by the Air Force and the \nFederal Aviation Administration will allow our air men and women to \ncarry out critical training in conditions that more closely resemble \ncombat missions. After working with the Air Force on this project for \nnearly 9 years, I was proud to see this expansion finally completed and \neven more delighted to see the first large-force training exercise take \nplace at the expanded Powder River Training Complex just this month. \nForty-one aircraft took part in the exercise, including the B-1 bombers \nfrom Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota.\n\n[[Page S8661]]\n\nThe expanded training complex will save Ellsworth $23 million per year \nin training costs by reducing the need for the B-1 bombers to commute \nto other places, such as Nevada and Utah, for training.\n  Supporting our men and women in uniform--like our airmen at \nEllsworth--is one of the most important jobs we have as Members of \nCongress.\n  This year I am proud to report that the Senate passed a national \ndefense authorization bill that incorporates a number of critical \nreforms that will expand the resources available to our servicemembers \nand strengthen our national security. The National Defense \nAuthorization Act for 2016 tackles waste and inefficiency at the \nDepartment of Defense and focuses funding on our warfighters rather \nthan on the Pentagon bureaucracy.\n  The bill also overhauls our military retirement system. Before this \nbill, the system limited retirement benefits to servicemembers who had \nserved for 20 years or more, which means huge numbers of military \npersonnel, including many veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nretired after years of service without having accrued any retirement \nbenefits. The National Defense Authorization Act replaces this system \nwith a new retirement system that will ensure that the majority of our \nNation's servicemembers receive retirement benefits for their years of \nservice to our country even if they have not reached the 20-year mark.\n  The bills I have discussed today are just a few of the \naccomplishments of the Republican-led Senate. Over the course of this \nyear, we have passed a number of significant pieces of legislation that \nwill benefit Americans for years to come.\n\n  We have worked hard to help our Nation's veterans by expanding access \nto mental health resources, reducing wait times for medical care, and \nincreasing the number of providers who can serve veterans. We voted to \nrepeal ObamaCare and start the process of moving toward the real health \ncare reform Americans are looking for: an affordable, accountable, \npatient-focused system that puts individuals in control of their health \ncare decisions. We passed legislation to contain the out-of-control \nbureaucracy at the EPA and legislation to begin the process of \nsafeguarding Medicare and Social Security by putting them on a more \nsustainable financial footing going forward. We passed cyber security \nlegislation to protect Americans' privacy and a major education reform \nbill that puts States, parents, teachers, and local school boards--not \nWashington bureaucrats--in charge of our children's education.\n  While we may have accomplished a lot this year, we know there is \nstill a lot more that needs to be done. Americans are still suffering \nin the Obama economy, and our Nation continues to face terrorist \nthreats at home and abroad.\n  Whether it is enacting pro-economic growth policies at home or \nensuring that our military has the resources it needs to protect us \nfrom threats abroad, Republicans will redouble our efforts to make sure \nWashington is meeting the needs of American families and addressing the \nAmerican people's priorities. We plan to spend the second year of the \n114th Congress next year the way we have spent the first: fighting to \nmake our economy stronger, our government more efficient and more \naccountable, and our Nation and our world safer and more secure.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one of the brightest bright spots at \nthe Paris climate talks last week was the robust corporate presence. \nLeading businesses and executives from around the world were there in \nParis to voice their support for a strong international climate \nagreement. That brings me here today for the now 122nd time to say that \nit is time for America's leading corporations and their lobbyists to \nbring that same message here to Washington to help Congress wake up.\n  Let me use an example of two of the good guys. The two biggest drinks \ncompanies in America are Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. Coke and Pepsi both \nsigned this public letter urging strong climate action in Paris:\n\n       Dear U.S. and global leaders:\n       Now is the time to meaningfully address the reality of \n     climate change. We are asking you to embrace the opportunity \n     presented to you in Paris. . . . We are ready to meet the \n     climate challenges that face our businesses. Please join us \n     in meeting the climate challenges that face the world.\n\n  And it is not just that public letter; Coca-Cola's Web site says it \nwill reduce CO2 emissions by 25 percent and that to do so, \n``Coca-Cola will work to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions across its \nvalue chain, making comprehensive carbon footprint reductions across \nits manufacturing processes, packaging formats, delivery fleet, \nrefrigeration equipment and ingredient sourcing.''\n  Coca-Cola also says: ``We continue to partner with peer companies, \nbottling partners, NGOs, governments and others in addressing our \ngreenhouse gas emissions and encouraging progress in response to \nclimate change.''\n  Pepsi's Web site heralds what it calls ``its commitment to action on \nclimate change'' and announces that it has signed both the Ceres BICEP \nClimate Declaration in the United States and the Prince of Wales's \nCorporate Leaders Group Trillion Tonne Communique in the UK. These \ncommitments, they say, ``are part of PepsiCo's overall strategy to \naddress climate change by working across its business and with global \nleaders.''\n  Here is Indra Nooyi, chairman and CEO of PepsiCo:\n\n       Combating climate change is absolutely critical to the \n     future of our company, customers, consumers--and our world. I \n     believe all of us need to take action now.\n\n  I have corresponded with these companies about climate change, and \nhere is what they have said in their letters to me.\n  In March 2013, Coke said:\n\n       We recognize that climate change is a critical challenge \n     facing our planet, with potential impacts on biodiversity, \n     water resources, public health, and agriculture. Beyond the \n     effects on the communities we serve, we view climate change \n     as a potential business risk, understanding that it could \n     likely have direct and indirect effects on our business.\n       As a responsible global company, with operations in more \n     than 200 countries, we have a role to play in climate \n     protection. . . .\n\n  Then in May 2014:\n\n       The Coca-Cola Company has strongly stated that climate \n     change is happening and the implications of climate change \n     for our planet are profound and wide-ranging. It is our \n     belief that climate change may have long-term direct and \n     indirect implications for our business and supply chain and \n     we recognize that sustainability is core to our long-term \n     value. . . . Climate protection is a key component of our \n     business strategy.\n\n  In August of this year:\n\n       Coca-Cola joined twelve other corporations at the White \n     House pledging our support for the American Business Act on \n     Climate [Pledge]. Climate protection has been a key focus of \n     Coca-Cola for decades.\n\n  In a letter of February 2013, Pepsi said:\n\n       PepsiCo applauds your efforts to address climate change by \n     focusing Congressional attention on the issue. . . . At \n     PepsiCo, we recognize the adverse impacts that greenhouse gas \n     emissions have on global temperatures, weather patterns, and \n     the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural \n     disasters. These impacts may have significant implications \n     for our company. . . . Accordingly, responding to climate \n     change is integrated into PepsiCo's business strategy.\n\n  In September of this year, Pepsi wrote:\n\n       We look forward to providing further support on the ``Road \n     to Paris''--demonstrating that actions by business in climate \n     are not only good for the environment, but good for business.\n\n  That is all great stuff. Here is where it gets a little strange. Coke \nand Pepsi have a trade association, the American Beverage Association, \nthat lobbies for the soft drink industry, and they also support the \nbusiness lobbying group, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Indeed, the \nAmerican Beverage Association sits on the board of the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce and contributes to it a lot of money.\n\n[[Page S8662]]\n\n  Here is the official position of the American Beverage Association on \nclimate change from its Web site:\n\n       Each of America's beverage companies has set goals to lower \n     our emissions over time while continually improving \n     efficiency. And our companies have pledged to work with \n     government leaders, environmental organizations, and other \n     businesses to ensure these emission reductions are happening \n     throughout the United States.\n\n  They even have the Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable. But do \nthey lobby us about this in Congress? I have never seen any sign of it. \nWhen the American Beverage Association thought Congress might impose a \nsoda tax to fund health care, then they lobbied like crazy--nearly $30 \nmillion worth of lobbying expenditure. They know how to lobby when they \nwant to. But on climate, I have never seen it.\n  As for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, everyone in Congress knows that \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce is dead set against Congress doing \nanything serious about climate change. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is \na very powerful lobby group, and its power in Congress is fully \ndedicated to stopping any serious climate legislation. They are \nimplacable adversaries of climate action, and we see their hostility \neverywhere.\n  At one point, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wrote to me to say I \nmischaracterized its position on climate change. ``Even a cursory \nreview of our stated views on climate change,'' wrote Chamber of \nCommerce President and CEO Tom Donahue, ``shows that the Chamber is not \ndebating the existence of climate change or that human activity plays a \nrole.''\n  Well and good, but here is what I wrote back.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nmy full letter at the end of my remarks.\n  I wrote back:\n\n       I am in politics in Washington, and I see the behavior of \n     your organization firsthand. There is no way to reconcile \n     what I see in real life around me with the assurances in your \n     letter that you treat the climate problem in any way \n     seriously.\n\n  I then offered a list of the many ways the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nactively opposes climate legislation and concluded:\n\n       In every practical way in which your organization brings \n     pressure to bear on the American political process, I see you \n     bringing it to bear in line with the big carbon polluters and \n     the climate denial industry. And given the powerful and \n     relentless way in which you bring that pressure to bear on \n     our system in the service of your own First Amendment rights, \n     I hope you will accept that I have the right to express my \n     own views under that same First Amendment.\n\n  In sum, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has a terrible record on climate \nchange. It is Coke and Pepsi's adversary on getting anything done. So \nwhy is Coke and Pepsi's American Beverage Association on the board of \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce?\n  The result is that Coke and Pepsi take one position on climate change \nin their public materials and in Paris and throughout their internal \ncorporate effort, but here in Congress, where the rubber meets the road \non legislating and where the lobbying meets our legislative efforts, \ntheir lobbying agencies don't support their position. I actually wonder \nhow well they know in the executive suites of Coke and Pepsi that their \nposition is not supported by the lobbying effort they support.\n  Let me be clear. I am not here to ask that companies such as Coke and \nPepsi take a different position on climate change than what they \nbelieve. I am here to ask companies to line up their advocacy in \nCongress with what they believe. My ask is simple: Match your advocacy \nin Congress with your policy. Don't outsource your advocacy to entities \nthat take the opposite position from you--not on an issue of this \nmagnitude. This is too important an issue for great American companies \nto say one thing when they are talking to the public and have their \nlobbying agencies say something completely different when they come to \nCongress.\n  I have asked Coke and Pepsi about this discrepancy between their \npolicy and these organizations' advocacy, and here is what they say. \nFrom Pepsi:\n\n       The Chamber is an important partner for PepsiCo on critical \n     tax and trade matters. However, our positions on climate \n     change have diverged.\n\n  From Coke:\n\n       The Coca-Cola Company belongs to a wide range of \n     organizations through which we gain different perspectives on \n     global and national issues; however these groups do not speak \n     on our behalf.\n\n  Well, if their positions have diverged and these organizations don't \nspeak for them on this issue, why keep supporting one of the leading \npolitical opponents of meaningful climate action? If you insist on \nsupporting the entities that lobby against you on climate change, then \nthe question becomes this: What are you doing in Congress to lobby \nback? What are your countermeasures to dispel the voice of these \nagencies that you are supporting?\n  Climate change is not just any other issue. It is so big an issue \nthat the world's leaders just gathered in Paris to address it in the \nlargest gathering of world leaders in history. It is so big an issue \nthat it has its own page on Coke's and Pepsi's Web sites and, indeed, \non the Web sites of most major American corporations. It is so big an \nissue that our former Pacific commander, Admiral Locklear, said it was \nthe biggest national security threat we face in the Pacific theater. To \nuse Admiral Locklear's exact words, climate change ``is probably the \nmost likely thing that is going to happen . . . that will cripple the \nsecurity environment, probably more likely than the other scenarios we \nall often talk about.''\n  Around here in Congress, the bullying menace of the fossil fuel \nindustry is everywhere. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is their vocal \nadvocate. If companies such as Coke and Pepsi don't push back against \nthis group that they fund, that choice has real consequences here. That \nchoice says to Congress: ``This issue isn't really serious to us.'' \nThat choice says to the individual Members over here: ``If you cross \nthe fossil fuel boys, don't count on us to have your back.''\n  I recently received a letter from ExxonMobil. It says:\n\n       ExxonMobil has for a number of years held the view that a \n     ``revenue-neutral carbon tax'' is the best option. . . . [A] \n     carbon tax could help create the conditions to reduce \n     greenhouse emissions in a way that spurs new efficiencies and \n     new technologies.\n\n  This is ExxonMobil.\n\n       The revenue-neutral carbon tax could be a workable policy \n     framework for countries around the world--and the policy most \n     likely to preserve the ability of every sector of society to \n     seek out new efficiencies and new technologies.\n\n  ExxonMobil may say that in their letter, but let me say as the author \nof the Senate's revenue-neutral carbon-fee bill, I can assure you that \nbill is getting zero support from ExxonMobil. ExxonMobil is playing a \ndouble game, with statements such as they made in the letter to me on \nthe one hand, but on the other hand all of its massive lobbying clout \ndirected against doing anything serious on climate.\n  I suggest that it is the same with the other companies. They may have \nenough happy talk about climate change being serious to get them \nthrough a cocktail party at Davos, but the full weight of their \nindustry lobbying leverage, through the Chamber and the American \nPetroleum Institute and a slew of other front groups, is leaned in hard \nagainst climate legislation, including revenue-neutral carbon fees. We \nshould perhaps expect better of them. But we should certainly expect \nbetter of other companies that don't have ExxonMobil's massive conflict \nof interest.\n  To be fair to Coke and Pepsi, they are not alone. Congress is heavily \ninfluenced by corporations. That is no news flash. What my colleagues \nhere all know is that virtually zero of that corporate influence is \nbrought to bear in support of climate action. Even companies with good \ninternal climate policies, even companies that are leaders in what they \nare doing within their companies and within their supply chains on \nclimate change shy away from this issue in Congress.\n  The result is that, on one side, the fossil fuel industry maintains a \ndesperate grip on Congress to stop any climate action. They lean on \nCongress hard to get their way. On the other side, the rest of \ncorporate America has virtually nothing to say in Congress on climate \nchange. Maybe they do on their Web sites, maybe in their public \nrelations, certainly through their sustainability departments, and in \nsome cases from their CEOs. But from their lobbyists and from the trade \nassociations and the lobbying organizations that represent them here in \nCongress, the silence is deafening.\n\n[[Page S8663]]\n\n  The corporate effort in Congress to get something done on climate \nchange rounds to zero. I am in Congress, and I am here to say we need \nyou guys to show up. I get that it is never convenient to stand up to \nbullies. It is always easier if they just go away, but the fossil fuel \nbullies are not going away. So it is either stand up to them or keep \nletting them roll Congress.\n  If what Coke and Pepsi and other corporations say publicly are the \nthings they really believe, then it should be important to them that \nCongress not get rolled by the guys who are working against what they \nbelieve. This should not be too big an ask for the corporations that \nstood up in Paris: Do the same thing in Congress. Do the same thing in \nCongress. Do the simplest and truest of things: Stand up for what you \nbelieve.\n  It is time to wake up, but it is also time to stand up, and what a \ndifference you will make.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       ExxonMobil Corporation,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 2, 2015.\n     Hon. Edward J. Markey,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard Blumenthal,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Elizabeth Warren,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: As to your question about Donors Trust and \n     Donors Capital, we had never heard of these organizations \n     until you brought them to our attention. We do not provide \n     funding to them.\n       At ExxonMobil we too have been following the deliberately \n     misleading stories regarding our company published by the \n     climate activist organization InsideClimate News and by \n     various media outlets. If you are interested in our response, \n     please visit our corporate blog: http://\nwww.exxonmobilperspectives\n.com.\n       From the very beginning of concern about climate change, \n     ExxonMobil scientists and engineers have been involved in \n     discussions and analysis of climate change. These efforts \n     started internally as early as the 1970s. They led to work \n     with the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and \n     collaboration with academic institutions and to reaching out \n     to policymakers and others, who sought to advance scientific \n     understanding and policy dialogue.\n       We believe the risks of climate change are serious and \n     warrant thoughtful action. We also believe that by taking \n     sound and wise actions now we can better mitigate and manage \n     those risks. But as policymakers work to reduce emissions, it \n     is critical to recognize the importance of reliable and \n     affordable energy in supporting human progress across society \n     and the economy.\n       Sound tax, legal, and regulatory frameworks are essential. \n     With sound policies enacted, investment, innovation, and \n     cooperation can flourish. In our view, policy works best when \n     it maintains a level playing field; opens the doors for \n     competition; and refrains from picking winners and losers.\n       When considering policy options to address the risks of \n     climate change, we urge you to draw from the best insights \n     from economics, science, and engineering. The U.S. has \n     achieved remarkable reductions in not just greenhouse gas \n     intensity measures, but in absolute levels of carbon dioxide \n     emissions as a result of large-scale fuel switching from coal \n     to natural gas for electricity generation. Thoughtful \n     regulatory initiatives directed to both energy and building \n     efficiency standards, as well as continued improvements in \n     emissions levels related to industrial processes, have also \n     contributed to the reduction in the nation's greenhouse gas \n     emissions.\n       As you consider additional policy options, such as putting \n     a more direct cost on carbon to incentivize different \n     choices, we suggest that these policies ensure a uniform and \n     predictable carbon cost across the economy and allow \n     competitive market forces to drive solutions. We believe this \n     approach will maximize transparency, reduce complexity, and \n     promote global participation.\n       You are probably aware that ExxonMobil has for a number of \n     years held the view that a ``revenue-neutral carbon tax'' is \n     the best option to fulfill these key principles. Instead of \n     subsidies and mandates that distort markets, stifle \n     innovation, and raise energy costs, such a carbon tax could \n     help create the conditions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \n     in a way that spurs new efficiencies and new technologies. \n     The revenue-neutral carbon tax could be a workable policy \n     framework for countries around the world--and the policy most \n     likely to preserve the ability of every sector of society to \n     seek out new efficiencies and new technologies.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Theresa M. Fariello,\n                                Vice President, Washington Office.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/15/senate-section/article/S8663-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8663-S8665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PRESIDENT'S STRATEGY TO DEFEAT ISIS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, just yesterday President Obama went to the \nPentagon for a long overdue meeting with his national security \nadvisers. During that meeting or shortly thereafter, he made this \nstatement: ``We are hitting ISIL harder than ever.'' Unfortunately, the \nPresident failed to acknowledge the simple fact that his strategy \nagainst ISIL--or ISIS, as it is more frequently called--is simply not \nworking.\n  This is pretty hard to get right, but at least our leaders should \nhave the humility to recognize reality, and when things aren't working \nout so well, reconsider and make some midcourse changes so they do \nwork--not this President. I have said repeatedly that the President \nneeds to tell Congress and the American people about his comprehensive \nstrategy to defeat this terrorist enemy, and he has to do more to give \nour military the flexibility and resources they need to accomplish the \nmission. It is simply wrong to ask our military to accomplish something \nand not give them the freedom, flexibility, and resources they need in \norder to accomplish it.\n  That is why when the President talks about airstrikes--I know of no \nmilitary leader who believes that you can defeat this terrorist army in \nSyria and Iraq by airstrikes alone. Nobody. Yet that seems to be the \nonly tactic this President is using. So the President needs to tell the \nAmerican people the truth about the realities on the ground in Iraq and \nSyria. He needs to listen and take advice from the military leadership \nhe has at the Pentagon and on his own staff. Above all, he needs to \nlearn not to be ashamed of American leadership.\n  It is absolutely true that America doesn't necessarily need to fight \nthe wars for other countries in the region that ought to be engaged in \nthe fight themselves, but the fact is there is no one else on the \nplanet who can lead like the United States of America. We have to \norganize it, we have to lead it, and we have to support it if we expect \nother people to be the boots on the ground to fight those wars, but the \naction we are seeing currently from this administration does not match \nthe very serious threat we face, and it is a threat that has gotten \nworse, not better, under the President.\n  CIA Director John Brennan recently estimated that before President \nObama prematurely pulled all U.S. troops out of Iraq, without any sort \nof transition at all, the predecessor of ISIS, known as Al Qaeda in \nIraq, had ``maybe 700-or-so adherents left.'' This is the CIA Director, \nnominated by President Obama and confirmed by the Senate. He said, \nbefore the President pulled the plug in Iraq, there were about 700 or \nso adherents left in Al Qaeda in Iraq, the predecessor of ISIS. If we \nfast forward that to today, according to the New York Times, just a few \nmonths ago, he said: ``Nearly 30,000 foreign recruits have now poured \nin to Syria, many to join the Islamic State, a doubling of volunteers \nin the last 12 months. . . .''\n  Nearly 30,000 foreign recruits, a doubling of volunteers in just the \nlast 12 months, these are pretty amazing and concerning numbers but \nmore often they demonstrate how out of touch the President's remarks \nare when he says ISIS has been contained or we are hitting them harder \nthan we ever have before. It is simply not working. Clearly, we need \nthe President to execute an effective military strategy that results in \nboth the physical destruction of ISIS and the complete rejection of \ntheir bankrupt ideology--not just in the Middle East but around the \nworld, including here at home.\n  Frequently, when various pundits react when they hear people like me \nsaying the President doesn't have an effective strategy, they say: OK. \nWhat is your strategy? First of all, I am not the Commander in Chief, \nbut we did make some constructive suggestions to\n\n[[Page S8664]]\n\nthe President. Nine other Republican Senators joined me in a letter, \nwhere we recommended six specific military options that if brought to \nbear on ISIS, would go a long way toward achieving his stated goal of \ndestroying this terrorist army. First, it would take the handcuffs off \nthe U.S. military and let our troops do what they have trained to do \nand what they have volunteered to do. Increasingly, we need a strategy \nthat doesn't just handle the fight over there. We need a strategy to \nhandle the fight here at home because of the danger of foreign \nfighters, of fighters going from the United States to the fight in the \nMiddle East and then returning or people going to Europe. In \nparticular, one concern has been raised by many of our Democratic \ncolleagues is the use of the visa waiver, where you don't actually \nneed--the 38 countries where you can travel to the United States \nwithout actually getting a specific visa or having to be interviewed by \na consular officer at one of our embassies. This is a potential \nvulnerability for the United States.\n  The third area beyond the fight over there, beyond the danger of \npeople exploiting the flaws in our screening system within immigration, \nwhether it is fiance visas, whether it is a visa waiver or whether it \nis refugees--there is a third area the FBI Director talked about last \nweek when he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He talked \nabout homegrown terrorists--people like the ones in San Bernardino who \ndid actually travel to the Middle East and come back--but he also \nincluded people in the United States, American citizens. I must admit I \nappreciated the FBI Director's understanding of the threat that ISIS \nposes, including their attempts to inspire people in this country to \nbecome terrorists and commit acts of violence.\n  This Senator was astonished that the Department of Homeland Security \nwould have a policy preventing the United States from screening the \nsocial media use by foreign nationals who are attempting to use our \nimmigration system to come to the United States. In the instance of the \nfemale shooter in San Bernardino, it was revealed that using social \nmedia, she had posted things that should have been an alert--if our \nimmigration officers were doing their job--to the fact that she was \nlikely to be a jihadist and be a threat here at home.\n  Another threat we are going to have to deal with that Director Comey \nand the Deputy Attorney General raised is the use of encryption as a \nchallenge that hinders the FBI's counterintelligence efforts against \nthese ISIS-inspired extremists. Encryption applications are available \non your cell phone, and some of the companies--Apple, for example--\nmarket them because people want to keep their communications private. \nWe all understand that, but an encrypted message--one that is incapable \nof being unlocked--is one that can't be used to respond to a court \norder when somebody in law enforcement goes to court and says: We have \nprobable cause to believe a crime was committed, so we want to execute \nthis search warrant. As Director Comey confirmed, increasingly using \nencryption is part of terrorist trade craft.\n  I was shocked--because I hadn't heard it before--to hear Director \nComey talk about how encryption impacted an investigation in my home \nState of Texas. He said many will remember that back in May, two men \nattempted to attack people at an event northeast of Dallas in Garland, \nTX. He said that fortunately the quick and effective response of law \nenforcement officials in the area stopped the men from making their way \ninto the conference center, keeping them from inflicting more harm. We \nnow know the attack was at least inspired by ISIS. In fact, according \nto media reports, ISIS quickly claimed responsibility for the attack.\n  Shockingly, Director Comey said last week before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee that the FBI had 109 encrypted messages with a terrorist \noverseas as part of this investigation of the Garland incident. \nAccording to the FBI Director, that is 109 messages the FBI still \ndoesn't have access to because they are encrypted and they can't even \ncrack it given a court order showing probable cause that it might lead \nto further evidence in this investigation. He pointed out that these \nsorts of encrypted communications are part of terrorist trade craft. In \nfact, there is reason to believe that within terror circles, they \nunderstand which of these devices and which of these apps are encrypted \nand thus make it less likely that they will be discovered when they are \nconspiring against Americans either here or abroad.\n  It troubles me that the men and women charged with keeping us safe \ndon't have all the information they need. I think that is a subject on \nwhich we need to have a more serious conversation. I think that is why \nDirector Comey mentioned that last week, and that is why the Deputy \nAttorney General came to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee \nto raise the concern, so we can have the kind of debate we always have \nin America when it is a balancing of privacy and security.\n  I commend the Director for engaging Congress on this critical issue, \nbut what it points out is that the President and this administration \nneed to have a three-pronged strategy when dealing against a terrorist \nthreat: As I mentioned, over in Syria and Iraq, unhandcuff our military \nand make sure they have a strategy that will actually work over and \nabove just airstrikes; second, try to make sure we enhance our \nscreening system for immigration for people who come into the United \nStates so we don't inadvertently allow someone into our country who has \nthe intention of doing us harm; and third, do more to come up with a \nplan to deal with people being radicalized right here in the United \nStates, not the least of which, I would hope the Department of Homeland \nSecurity voluntarily reverses their policy of not screening social \nmedia communications which are in the public domain. I mean, there is \nno expectation of privacy on the part of people posting things in a \npublic domain such as Twitter or Facebook, particularly things like \nTwitter. I know you can restrict access, but most people communicate \nwith their friends, family, and anybody else who happens to want to \nhave a conversation with them on social media.\n  We can all agree that the threat of ISIS to the United States is \nbroad and real. Sadly, we were reminded in San Bernardino and in \nGarland last May of this fact.\n  Last week, both in a letter I sent to the President and here on the \nfloor, we sought to make some constructive suggestions to begin to have \nthat conversation, which was long overdue, about what an effective \nstrategy to carry out the President's stated goal of degrading and \ndestroying ISIS would actually look like. I hope the President listens. \nUnfortunately, so far experience has taught us he is not necessarily \nprimed that way. But I hope he will reconsider in light of the \nincreased public concern about terrorist activity in the United States. \nCertainly, public opinion polls have shown that is the No. 1 issue of \nconcern to the American people, and as the leader of the U.S. \nGovernment and as Commander in Chief, I hope he will have the humility \nand the common sense to say that what we are doing now is not working \nthe way it should. We can do better. We can do more.\n  Certainly, if the President would work with us in a bipartisan and \nbicameral fashion, I know we would support a strategy that I think \nMembers of Congress felt had a reasonably decent chance of working. But \nright now the President seems stuck on this same inadequate strategy of \njust bombing missions. These airstrikes are necessary but not \nsufficient to get the job done over there. It certainly is incomplete \nwhen you look at the threat in terms of exploiting our immigration \nsystem and in terms of homegrown radicalism. We haven't heard the kind \nof plan that we need to hear from the President of the United States \nthat we are willing to work with him on. We need to hear from him what \nhe is willing to do to help keep the American people safe and to fight \nand win this war against Islamic radicalism.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, according to press reports, this \nadministration may be just weeks away from lifting sanctions on Iran. \nThis is despite Iran's recent actions that indicate they have little \nintention to comply with the terms of the agreement called the Joint \nComprehensive Plan of Action, also known as the Iran nuclear deal. Most \nrecently, the International Atomic Energy Agency released the final \nreport on the possible military dimensions of the Iranian nuclear \nprogram. It is quite clear Iran was less than cooperative with the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. For some reason, despite Iran's \nstonewalling, the President seems intent and confident that they know \nthe extent of Iran's past nuclear weaponization work.\n  It is important to remember the evolution of the importance of this \ninformation. In April 2015, Secretary Kerry stated in an interview that \nIran must disclose its past military-related nuclear activities as part \nof any final deal. His words on this matter were unequivocal.\n  He stated:\n\n       They have to do it. It will be done. If there's going to be \n     a deal it will be done. It will be part of the final \n     agreement. It has to be.\n\n  Just a few weeks later, when it was clear President Obama's \nadministration was ready to surrender to Iran's demands on this issue, \nSecretary Kerry said that we didn't need a full accounting of Iran's \npast activities. He said the U.S. intelligence agencies already had \n``perfect knowledge'' of Iran's activities.\n  Just a few days ago, the International Atomic Energy Agency released \ntheir report, which was supposed to be a comprehensive overview of \nIran's nuclear program and their past military dimensions of that \nprogram. Because of Iran's obstruction, the report is far from \ncomprehensive--as we were promised.\n  The International Atomic Energy Agency report essentially concludes \nwhat many of us have known for a very long time. Iran was working \ntoward developing nuclear weapons capability and they have continually \nlied and continually misled the international community regarding that \nprogram. The International Atomic Energy Agency also concluded that \nIran's nuclear weapons program was in operation until 2009, several \nyears later than many believed.\n  President Obama repeatedly stated that the nuclear agreement was \nbased on unprecedented verification. Yet it is very clear from the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency report that Iran had no intention of \ncooperating with the requirement that they come clean on their nuclear \nprogram. In many areas, the International Atomic Energy Agency \nindicated that Iran provided little information, misleading responses, \nand even worked to conceal portions of that program.\n  Many of the questions around the Parchin military facility remain \nunanswered. This report from the International Atomic Energy Agency \nstates:\n\n       The information available to the Agency, including the \n     results of the sampling analysis and the satellite imagery, \n     does not support Iran's statement on the purpose of the \n     building. The Agency assesses that the extensive activities \n     undertaken by Iran since February 2012 at the particular \n     location of interest to the Agency seriously undermined the \n     Agency's ability to conduct effective verification.\n\n  An effective verification was what we were promised. The Iranians \nwere actively working to cover up and destroy any evidence of their \nweaponization efforts at Parchin. On many occasions, Iran refused to \nprovide any information or simply reiterated previous denials. Iran \nrefused to cooperate and instead continues to deceive the international \ncommunity on the military dimensions of its nuclear program. Some may \nwonder why we should even care about this. It matters because a \ncomplete and accurate declaration of all nuclear weapons activity is a \ncritical first step in the verification regime and the safeguard \nprocess that the International Atomic Energy Agency will be asked to \nenforce and something we put our confidence in. I shouldn't say ``we'' \nbecause I didn't vote for it--but something this country puts its \nconfidence in this Agency's ability to enforce. There must be a \nbaseline declaration to ensure effective international monitoring going \nforward.\n  It also matters because President Obama entered into an agreement, \nalong with our allies, to provide sanctions relief in exchange for Iran \ngiving up its efforts to develop nuclear weapons. It matters because it \nis clear we do not have ``perfect knowledge''--which we were promised--\nof what Iran is up to, as Secretary Kerry has claimed. It also matters \nbecause since the agreement was finalized, Iranian leadership has not \nchanged their behavior. If anything, they have increased their \nhostility. Here are some examples of hostility: On October 10, Iran \nlaunched a long-range ballistic missile. This is clearly in violation \nof Security Council Resolution 1929. Then, on November 21, Iran \nlaunched another ballistic missile.\n  It is clear that Iran has no intention to comply with the ballistic \nmissile restrictions of this deal. These are blatant violations. How \nare we supposed to have any faith in this agreement or Iran's intent to \ncomply? Iran did not comply with the International Atomic Energy \nAgency. They have continued to test ballistic missiles. They continue \nto hold Americans hostage. A Washington Post reporter has been \nimprisoned for more than 500 days and was recently convicted of \nunspecified charges in a sham trial. Iran has no intention to honor any \nof their obligations under this deal. It is naive to think otherwise. \nAs a recent Wall Street Journal editorial put it, ``The larger point is \nthat the nuclear deal has already become a case of Iran pretending not \nto cheat while the West pretends not to notice.''\n  I hope President Obama and his administration finally wake up and \nquickly recognize Iran's track record of noncompliance. Iran cannot and \nshould not be rewarded with sanctions relief. The international \ncommunity should not reward Iran with sanctions relief while Iran \ndoubles down on its confrontational and uncooperative behavior. They \nshould not be given hundreds of billions of dollars while continuing to \ndefy and deceive the international community.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am on the floor this afternoon to \ntalk about S. 579, which is called the Inspector General Empowerment \nAct, but it really ought to be called ``Let the inspectors general do \ntheir jobs.''\n  As I look back on my time as a State auditor and I think of all I \nlearned about how government works well and how government behaves \nbadly, I have a special point of respect for inspectors general because \nof the work I did as an auditor. I believe they are our first line of \ndefense against waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer dollars. We should \nbe helping them every way we can to do their jobs.\n  I want to thank Senator Johnson, the chairman of the committee I \nserve on that has primary jurisdiction on government oversight, and I \nwant to thank Senator Grassley for his long championing the cause of \ninspectors general and the GAO and all of the noble public servants who \nare out there every day trying to uncover government behaving badly.\n  This bill serves three main purposes. It provides additional \nauthority to inspectors general to enhance their ability to conduct \noversight investigations. It reforms the process by which the Council \nof the Inspectors General integrity committee investigates accusations \nagainst IGs, which is very important. IGs need to be above reproach. \nAny whiff of politics, any whiff of unethical conduct, any whiff of \nself-dealing--we have to empower the Council of the Inspectors General \nto deal with that in a way that is effective.\n  It restores the intent of the 1978 Inspectors General Act to ensure \nthat IGs have timely access to documents they need to conduct good, \ncomprehensive oversight audits and investigations.\n\n[[Page S8666]]\n\nMany of the provisions are authorities that the IGs have been seeking \nfor a long time, and most of them are beyond noncontroversial.\n  I wish to focus on one section of the bill for a minute and explain \nhow critical its provision is to congressional overseers and for the \ntaxpayers. The main issue I wish to talk about today is the section of \nthe bill that ensures IGs have access to all agency documents. The \nInspector General Act, which was passed in 1978, explicitly grants \naccess to ``all records, reports, audits, reviews, documents, papers, \nrecommendations, or other material.''\n  For the last 37 years, we lived in a world where ``all'' meant all. \nBut this summer, the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel \nissued an opinion that allows agencies to withhold documents from the \ninspectors general. Other than national security concerns, intelligence \nconcerns, and statutes that explicitly restrict disclosure of documents \nto IGs, all of which are addressed by this bill, there is absolutely no \nreason that IGs should have their access to documents restricted. There \nis no universe in which the Inspector General Act should be interpreted \nto mean anything less than what it says. They have to have access to \nthe documents or they can't do their work. It really isn't any more \ncomplicated than that.\n  The convoluted legal reasoning that is being implemented by the \ncounsel at the Department of Justice is a big step backwards for \neffective oversight of our government. We can't expect them to do their \njobs well without fear or favor if they can't get access to the \ninformation that is vital to their work.\n  When the auditors in my office came back with an access issue, my \ninstruction to them was this: Well, get on your ``dog with a bone \nact,'' because if they are trying to withhold documents from you, there \nis something in those documents we need to see.\n  I think if every agency knows that the inspector general has access \nto documents, it will have a deterrent effect on people behaving badly \nwith taxpayer money or engaging in self-dealing or other activities \nthat frustrate taxpayers and heighten the level of cynicism that, \nfrankly, right now is breaking my heart in this country about our \ngovernment.\n  I join with my Republican colleagues today in asking unanimous \nconsent for this bill to be brought up. We have worked on it for years. \nIt is time. I appreciate the hard work of both on this, and I stand \nshoulder to shoulder with them trying to get this one across the finish \nline.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \npass S. 579, the Inspector General Empowerment Act of 2015. I want to \nthank Senator McCaskill for her hard work on this and her support and \nSenator Grassley for his many years as a real champion of this cause, \nas well as the other bipartisan cosponsors of this legislation and for \nthe work their staff have done on this very important issue.\n  In 1978 Congress created a crucial oversight partner for all of us--\ninspectors general. They are independent watchdogs embedded in each \nagency, accountable only to Congress and the American people. That is \ncrucial. They are the American people's eyes and ears, and they are our \nbest partner in rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse. As an example, in \nfiscal year 2014 alone, inspectors general identified $45 billion in \npotential savings to the taxpayer.\n  What this bill aims to do is to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse by \nincreasing accountability and ensuring transparency. The bill exempts \ninspectors general from time-consuming and independence-threatening \nrequirements such as the computer matching and paperwork reduction \nstatutes. It allows inspectors general to compel the testimony of \nformer agency employees or Federal contractors and grant recipients in \nsome administrative misconduct or civil fraud cases.\n  Too often we lose crucial information or have to end an investigation \nbecause the bad actor either leaves Federal employment or is a \ncontractor or grantee and under current law cannot be subpoenaed. For \nexample, the State Department inspector general oversees the $10.5 \nbillion the agency obligates in grants every year yet cannot compel \ntestimony of the grant recipients even in the event of suspected fraud \nor misconduct. He can only require current agency employees to speak to \nhis team, which can result in an incomplete or one-sided investigation. \nIf we care about oversight and accountability, inspectors general must \nbe able to compel relevant testimony. In addition to these authorities, \nthe bill requires inspectors general to publish reports within 3 days \nto ensure transparency and accountability.\n  I want to spend a little bit of time on the transparency aspect of \nthis. Like many places around the country, we have seen some real \nproblems with the VA health care system. There was a scandal in the \nTomah facility in Tomah, WI. The result of that tragedy was that people \ndied. I will never forget a call that I made to the surviving daughter \nof Mr. Thomas Baer, a veteran who went to the Tomah facility seeking \ncare with stroke-like symptoms. Thomas Baer sat in the waiting room for \n2 or 3 hours. He suffered a couple of strokes and died. I talked to his \nsurviving daughter, Candace Baer, and I will never forget the fact that \nshe said to me: Senator, had I only known, had I only known there were \nproblems with the Tomah VA health facility, I never would have taken my \nfather there, and my father would be alive today. That is how important \ntransparency and accountability is. That is what this bill restores to \nthe inspectors general.\n  Finally, the bill reiterates that inspectors general should have \naccess to all agency documents necessary to do their job, unless \nCongress expressly denies that access by statute. The bill not only \nmaintains current authorities for certain agency heads to keep \ninspector general work if it is necessary to preserve the country's \nnational security interests, it actually enhances those authorities.\n  In sum, this is a bipartisan commonsense cause. We all want \ninspectors general to be able to do their jobs well. That is why this \nbill was unanimously approved by my committee--the Senate Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs. It is why it has 14 \nbipartisan cosponsors representing Committees of the Judiciary, \nAppropriations, Armed Services, Energy and Natural Resources, and the \nSenate Intelligence Committee.\n  Even retired Senator John Glenn has asked my committee to take action \nto ensure inspectors general have access to documents. In the letter he \nwrote to my committee and to the House oversight committee, Senator \nGlenn says: ``The success of the IG Act is rooted in the principles on \nwhich the Act is grounded--independence, direct reporting to Congress, \ndedicated staff and resources, unrestricted access to agency records, \nsubpoena power, special protections for agency employees who cooperate \nwith the IG, and the ability to refer criminal matters to the \nDepartment of Justice without clearing such referrals through the \nagency.''\n  This is the heart of what the Inspector General Act asked for. This \nis what this bill restores. I cannot imagine anything controversial \nabout wanting inspectors general to have access to the people and the \ndocuments they need to do their jobs. Americans deserve an accountable, \ntransparent, and effective government. This is one tangible thing that \nwe can do to help achieve that common goal.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass S. 579 today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan excellent article that appeared in the New York Times, as well as \nthe letter we received from Senator John Glenn.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 27, 2015]\n\n    Tighter Lid on Records Threatens to Weaken Government Watchdogs\n\n                          (By Eric Lichtblau)\n\n       Washington.--Justice Department watchdogs ran into an \n     unexpected roadblock last year when they began examining the \n     role of federal drug agents in the fatal shootings of unarmed \n     civilians during raids in Honduras.\n       The Drug Enforcement Administration balked at turning over \n     emails from senior officials tied to the raids, according to \n     the department's inspector general. It took nearly a year of \n     wrangling before the D.E.A. was willing to turn over all its \n     records in a case that the inspector general said raised \n     ``serious questions'' about agents' use of deadly force.\n       The continuing Honduran inquiry is one of at least 20 \n     investigations across the government that have been slowed, \n     stymied or\n\n[[Page S8667]]\n\n     sometimes closed because of a long-simmering dispute between \n     the Obama administration and its own watchdogs over the \n     shrinking access of inspectors general to confidential \n     records, according to records and interviews.\n       The impasse has hampered investigations into an array of \n     programs and abuse reports--from allegations of sexual \n     assaults in the Peace Corps to the F.B.I.'s terrorism powers, \n     officials said. And it has threatened to roll back more than \n     three decades of policy giving the watchdogs unfettered \n     access to ``all records'' in their investigations.\n       ``The bottom line is that we're no longer independent,'' \n     Michael E. Horowitz, the Justice Department inspector \n     general, said in an interview.\n       The restrictions reflect a broader effort by the Obama \n     administration to prevent unauthorized disclosures of \n     sensitive information--at the expense, some watchdogs insist, \n     of government oversight.\n       Justice Department lawyers concluded in a legal opinion \n     this summer that some protected records, like grand jury \n     transcripts, wiretap intercepts and financial credit reports, \n     could be kept off limits to government investigators. The \n     administration insists there is no intention of curtailing \n     investigations, but both Democrats and Republicans in \n     Congress have expressed alarm and are promising to restore \n     full access to the watchdogs.\n       The new restrictions grew out of a five-year-old dispute \n     within the Justice Department. After a series of scathing \n     reports by Glenn Fine, then the Justice Department inspector \n     general, on F.B.I. abuses in counterterrorism programs, \n     F.B.I. lawyers began asserting in 2010 that he could no \n     longer have access to certain confidential records because \n     they were legally protected.\n       That led to a series of high-level Justice Department \n     reviews, a new procedure for reviewing records requests and, \n     ultimately, a formal opinion in July from the department's \n     Office of Legal Counsel. That opinion, which applies to \n     federal agencies across the government, concluded that the \n     1978 law giving an inspector general access to ``all \n     records'' in investigations did not necessarily mean all \n     records when it came to material like wiretap intercepts and \n     grand jury reports.\n       The inspector-general system was created in 1978 in the \n     wake of Watergate as an independent check on government \n     abuse, and it has grown to include watchdogs at 72 federal \n     agencies. Their investigations have produced thousands of \n     often searing public reports on everything from secret \n     terrorism programs and disaster responses to boondoggles like \n     a lavish government conference in Las Vegas in 2010 that \n     featured a clown and a mind reader.\n       Not surprisingly, tensions are common between the watchdogs \n     and the officials they investigate. President Ronald Reagan, \n     in fact, fired 15 inspectors general in 1981. But a number of \n     scholars and investigators said the restrictions imposed by \n     the Obama administration reflect a new level of acrimony.\n       ``This is by far the most aggressive assault on the \n     inspector general concept since the beginning,'' said Paul \n     Light, a New York University professor who has studied the \n     system. ``It's the complete evisceration of the concept. You \n     might as well fold them down. They've become defanged.''\n       While President Obama has boasted of running ``the most \n     transparent administration in history,'' some watchdogs say \n     the clampdown has scaled back scrutiny of government \n     programs.\n       ``This runs against transparency,'' said the Peace Corps \n     inspector general, Kathy Buller.\n       At the Peace Corps, her office began running into problems \n     two years ago in an investigation into the agency's handling \n     of allegations of sexual assaults against overseas \n     volunteers. Congress mandated a review after a volunteer in \n     Benin was murdered in 2009; several dozen volunteers reported \n     that the Peace Corps ignored or mishandled sexual abuse \n     claims.\n       But Peace Corps lawyers initially refused to turn over \n     abuse reports, citing privacy restrictions. Even after \n     reaching an agreement opening up some material, Ms. Buller \n     said investigators have been able to get records that are \n     heavily redacted.\n       ``It's been incredibly frustrating,'' she said. ``We have \n     spent so much time and energy arguing with the agency over \n     this issue.''\n       The Peace Corps said in a statement, however, that it was \n     committed to ``rigorous oversight'' and has cooperated fully \n     with the inspector general.\n       Agencies facing investigations are now sometimes relying on \n     the Justice Department's opinion as justification for denying \n     records--even records that are not specifically covered in \n     the opinion, officials said.\n       At the Commerce Department, the inspector general this year \n     shut down an internal audit of enforcement of international \n     trade agreements because the department's lawyers, citing the \n     Justice Department's guidance, refused to turn over business \n     records that they said were ``proprietary'' and protected.\n       The Environmental Protection Agency's inspector general has \n     reported a series of struggles with the organization over its \n     access to documents, including records the agency said were \n     classified or covered by attorney-client privilege. And \n     investigators at the Postal Service, a special Afghanistan \n     reconstruction board, and other federal agencies have \n     complained of tightened restrictions on investigative records \n     as well.\n       Hopes of a quick end to the impasse have dimmed in recent \n     days after the Obama administration volunteered to restore \n     full access for the Justice Department's inspector general--\n     but not the other 71 watchdogs.\n       Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, asked about the issue at \n     a House hearing last week, said the proposal was intended to \n     ensure, at least at the Justice Department, ``that the \n     inspector general would receive all the information he \n     needed.''\n       But watchdogs outside the Justice Department said they \n     would be left dependent on the whims of agency officials in \n     their investigations.\n       ``It's no fix at all,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley, \n     Republican of Iowa, who leads the Judiciary Committee.\n       In a rare show of bipartisanship, the administration has \n     drawn scorn from Democrats and Republicans. The Obama \n     administration's stance has ``blocked what was once a free \n     flow of information'' to the watchdogs, Senator Patrick J. \n     Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary \n     Committee, said at a hearing.\n       A Justice Department spokeswoman, Emily Pierce, said in a \n     statement on Friday: ``Justice Department leadership has \n     issued policy guidance to ensure that our inspector general \n     gets the documents he requests as quickly as possible, even \n     when those documents are protected by other statutes \n     protecting sensitive information. The department is unaware \n     of any instance in which the inspector general has sought \n     access to documents or information protected from disclosure \n     by statute and did not receive them.''\n       Nowhere has the fallout over the dispute been felt more \n     acutely than at the Justice Department, where the inspector \n     general's office said 14 investigations had been hindered by \n     the restricted access.\n       These include investigations into the F.B.I.'s use of phone \n     records collected by the National Security Agency, the \n     government's sharing of intelligence information before the \n     2013 Boston Marathon bombings, a notorious gun-tracing \n     operation known as ``Fast and Furious'' and the deadly \n     Honduran drug raids.\n       In the case of the Honduran raids, the inspector general \n     has been trying to piece together the exact role of D.E.A. \n     agents in participating in, or even leading, a series of \n     controversial drug raids there beginning in 2011.\n       Details of what happened remain sketchy even today, but \n     drug agents in a helicopter in 2012 reportedly killed four \n     unarmed villagers in a boat, including a pregnant woman and a \n     14-year-old boy, during a raid on suspected drug smugglers in \n     northeastern Honduras. They also shot down several private \n     planes--suspected of carrying drugs--in possible violation of \n     international law.\n       An investigation by the Honduran government cleared \n     American agents of responsibility. But when the inspector \n     general began examining the case last year, D.E.A. officials \n     refused to turn over emails on the episodes from senior \n     executives, the inspector general's office said. Only after \n     more than 11 months of back-and-forth negotiations were all \n     the records turned over.\n       The D.E.A. refused to comment on the case, citing the \n     investigation. A senior Justice Department official, speaking \n     on the condition of anonymity because of the continuing \n     review, said the refusal to turn over the records was the \n     flawed result of ``a culture within the D.E.A.'' at the \n     time--and not the result of the Justice Department's new \n     legal restrictions.\n       Mr. Horowitz, the inspector general, said the long delay \n     was a significant setback to his investigation. He now hopes \n     to complete the Honduran review early next year.\n       In the meantime, the watchdogs say they are looking to \n     Congress to intervene in a dispute with the administration \n     that has become increasingly messy.\n       ``It's essential to enshrine in the law that the inspector \n     general has access to all agency records,'' said Mr. Fine, \n     who is now the Pentagon's principal deputy inspector general. \n     ``The underlying principle is key: To be an effective \n     inspector general, you need the right to receive timely \n     access to all agency records.''\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 23, 2015.\n     Hon. Ron Johnson,\n     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n         Affairs.\n     Hon. Jason Chaffetz,\n     Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.\n       Dear Senator Johnson and Representative Chaffetz: Since the \n     enactment of the Inspector General Act in 1978, the \n     Inspectors General have provided independent oversight of \n     government programs and operations and pursued prosecution of \n     criminal activity against the government's interests. \n     Recommendations from IG audits have led to improvements in \n     the economy and efficiency of government programs that have \n     resulted in better delivery of needed services to countless \n     citizens. Investigations of those who violate the public \n     trust to enrich themselves at the expense of honest \n     taxpayers, of contractors who skirt the rules to illegally \n     inflate their profits, and of others who devise criminal \n     schemes to defraud the government have led to billions of \n     dollars being returned to the U.S. Treasury.\n       The success of the IG Act is rooted in the principles on \n     which the Act is grounded--independence, direct reporting to \n     Congress, dedicated staff and resources, unrestricted access \n     to agency records, subpoena power, special protections for \n     agency employees who cooperate with the IG, and the ability\n\n[[Page S8668]]\n\n     to refer criminal matters to the Department of Justice \n     without clearing such referrals through the agency. We \n     considered these safeguards to be vital when we developed the \n     Act and they remain essential today. No other entity within \n     government has the unique role and responsibility of \n     Inspectors General, and their ability to accomplish their \n     critical mission depends on the preservation of the \n     principles underlying the Inspector General Act.\n       In recent years, IGs have experienced challenges to their \n     ability to have independent access to records and information \n     in their host agencies. Broad independent access to such \n     records is a fundamental tenet in the IG Act and to \n     compromise or in any way erode such access would strike at \n     the heart of important law. In short, full and unfettered \n     access is vital to an IG's ability to effectively prevent and \n     detect fraud, waste, and abuse in agency programs and \n     activities.\n       The Inspector General Act has stood the test of time. The \n     billions of dollars recovered for the government and the \n     increased efficiency and effectiveness of government programs \n     and operations are a testament to the Act's continued \n     success. Any action that would impair the IG's ability to \n     achieve their mission--particularly the denial of full and \n     independent access to agency records and information--would \n     have an immeasurable adverse impact and severely damage their \n     critical oversight function. For this reason, I urge you to \n     take action to protect the independent access rights of \n     Inspectors General.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       John Glenn,\n                                     United States Senator (Ret.).\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to compliment \nSenator McCaskill and Senator Johnson for their leadership in bringing \nthis bill out of their committee--a committee I don't serve on but a \nbill that is very important to the oversight work of this Senator, and \nI hope every Senator considers it to be very important. I would say \nthat I agree with everything they have said. I want to emphasize what \nthey said, and I want to take a few minutes to do that because I feel \nstrongly about this piece of legislation.\n  There is an important principle here--a very important principle--\nthat we ought to keep in mind, because it is an insult to 100 Senators \nand 435 Members of the House of Representatives when legislation is \nwritten and it is explained very clearly what that legislation is \nsupposed to accomplish: that an inspector general would have access to \nall records. Then we have a lawyer in the Office of Legal Counsel in \nthe Department of Justice--one person making an interpretation of a law \nthat is contrary to congressional intent--that one person out of 2 \nmillion people in the executive branch of government can override the \nwill of 535 Members of Congress. That will was expressed way back in \n1978.\n  This is just a little different quote from a letter Senator Johnson \nhas already talked about from a respected Member of this Senate for 24 \nor maybe 30 years, Senator John Glenn of Ohio, who was very much \ninterested in making sure that we had strong oversight by Congress and \nthat within the executive branch, they had strong oversight that the IG \nwould do within a specific department.\n  Senator John Glenn of Ohio was one of the chief architects of this \nlegislation. He said: ``Full and unfettered access is vital to an IG's \nability to effectively prevent and detect waste, fraud, and abuse in an \nagency's programs and activities.''\n  Here we are with what Senator John Glenn said when he was a Member of \nthis body and this legislation passed. Then we have one lawyer out of 2 \nmillion executive branch employees interpreting a statute contrary to \ncongressional intent and then overriding it--in other words, giving \nCabinet heads opportunities to avoid doing what the inspector general \nlaw says and what an inspector general needs to do to do their job: \nhave access to all records.\n  Senator McCaskill made that clear. Senator Johnson made that clear. \nThis is a bipartisan effort coming unanimously out of this committee, \nthat this is an egregious attack on the powers of Congress and we can't \nlet one person out of 2 million people in the executive branch of the \ngovernment get away with it. Yet we seem to have some problems getting \nit passed. I don't understand it. You try to explain that to the people \nof this country, whether it is in New York City or whether it is in Des \nMoines, IA. There is no way this can be justified, that one lawyer out \nof 2 million people in the executive branch of government can issue an \nopinion and override the Congress of the United States.\n  I intend to go into some detail about how I feel about this \nlegislation, if my colleagues haven't come to that conclusion already. \nTo ensure accountability and transparency in government, Congress \ncreated inspectors general, or IGs, as our eyes and ears within the \nexecutive branch. That is the foresight of one famous Senator and \nastronaut by the name of John Glenn. But IGs cannot do their job \nwithout timely and independent access to all agency records. That is \nwhy this bill is called ``all means all.'' Agencies cannot be trusted \nnot to restrict the flow of potentially embarrassing documents to the \nIGs who oversee them. If the agencies can keep IGs in the dark, then \nthis Congress will be kept in the dark as well.\n  When Congress passed the Inspectors General Act of 1978, the Congress \nexplicitly said that IGs should have access to all agency records. \nInspectors general are designed to be independent but to also be part \nof an agency. Inspectors general are there to help agency leadership \nidentify and correct waste, fraud, and abuse. What Cabinet head \nwouldn't want somebody in their department to have access to all \nrecords that show that maybe that department isn't spending money \naccording to congressional intent or maybe not following the law the \nway Congress intended? It ought to be welcome by any administration \nhead.\n  Fights between an agency and its own inspector general over access to \ndocuments are a waste of taxpayers' money and personnel time. The law \nrequires that inspectors general have access to all agency records--\nprecisely, by the way, to avoid these costly and time-consuming \ndisputes. However, since 2010, a handful of agencies, led by the FBI--\nand I respect the FBI, but in this case I don't--has refused to comply \nwith this legal obligation.\n  The Justice Department claimed that the inspector general could not \naccess certain records until--guess what--department leadership gave \nthem permission to do it, even though the law says they are entitled to \nall documents. Requiring private approval from agency leadership for \naccess to agency information undermines inspectors general \nindependence. That is bad enough, but it also causes wasteful delays.\n  After this access problem came to light, Congress took action. So we \nhave the 2015 Department of Justice Appropriations Act declaring--this \nis Congress again declaring--that no funds should be used to deny the \ninspector general timely access to all records. In other words, just \nthis year--or last year when the appropriations bill was passed for \n2015--we had Members of Congress saying that this lawyer, out of 2 \nmillion executive branch employees, who is frustrating the will of \nCongress is wrong.\n  This new law directed the inspector general to report to Congress \nwithin 5 days whenever there was a failure to comply with this \nrequirement. In February alone, the Justice Department's IG notified \nCongress of three separate occasions in which the FBI failed to provide \naccess to records requested for oversight investigations. IGs for the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, and the \nPeace Corps have experienced similar stonewalling.\n  Then, in July, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel--that \nis this one lawyer out of 2 million employees--the Office of Legal \nCounsel released a memo arguing that we did not really mean ``all \nrecords'' when we put those words in the statute. Here we have somebody \nin the Justice Department--one person out of 2 million employees--\ntrying to tell 535 Members of Congress what they meant when they said \n``all'' means all. So let me be clear. We meant what we said in the IG \nact: ``All records'' really means all records.\n  I told my colleagues about the Department of Justice Appropriations \nAct responding to this a year ago. Well, 1 week after this report was \nissued, that the Office of Legal Counsel issued its awful legal \nopinion, Senator Mikulski and Senator Shelby--both outstanding members \nof the Committee on Appropriations--sent a letter to the Justice \nDepartment correcting the Office of Legal Counsel's misreading of\n\n[[Page S8669]]\n\nthe appropriations rider, also known as section 218. I would like to \nread from the Mikulski and Shelby letter:\n\n       We write to inform you that the OLC's interpretation of \n     section 218 is wrong and the subsequent conclusion of our \n     committee's intention is wrong. We expect the department and \n     all of its agencies to fully comply with section 218 and to \n     provide the Office of Inspector General with full and \n     immediate access to all records, documents, and other \n     materials in accordance with section 6(a) of the Inspectors \n     General Act.\n\n  So we wrote a statute in 1978. We have no problems with it until this \nperson--one lawyer out of 2 million executive branch employees--writes \nan opinion saying ``all'' doesn't mean all. Then we have Members of the \nbody who are insulted by that interpretation, and these Members write: \nNo money in this appropriations bill can be used to carry out that \nOffice of Legal Counsel opinion. And, if they would have listened to \nthe members of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Johnson and \nSenator McCaskill would not have to work so hard to correct a bad \nopinion, contrary to congressional intent, that was written by the \nOffice of Legal Counsel.\n  I applaud my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, particularly \nSenators Mikulski and Shelby, for standing up for the inspectors \ngeneral.\n  In early August I chaired a Judiciary Committee hearing on the Office \nof Legal Counsel opinion and the devastating impact it is already \nhaving on the work of inspectors general across the country. Remember, \nthe Office of Legal Counsel is in the Justice Department. Well, we had \na Justice Department witness before our committee disagree with the \nresults of the Office of Legal Counsel opinion and actually support \nlegislative action to solve the problem.\n  So following the hearing, 11 of my colleagues and I sent a \nbipartisan--I want to emphasize bipartisan--as well as bicameral letter \nto the Department of Justice and the entire inspectors general \ncommunity. In this letter, the chairs and ranking members of the \ncommittee of jurisdiction in both the House and the Senate asked for \nspecific legislative language to reaffirm that ``all'' means all. As \nthe witness from the Justice Department said, there ought to be \nlegislative language to correct this awful interpretation by one lawyer \nout of 2 million employees in the executive branch, overriding 535 \nMembers of Congress.\n  It took the Justice Department 3 months to respond to this letter, \nand its proposed language was far too narrow to actually override this \nOffice of Legal Counsel opinion. However, the inspectors general \ncommunity responded to our letter within 2 weeks. In September, a \nbipartisan group of Senators and I incorporated the core of this \nlanguage into the bill we are talking about today, S. 579. It is \nentitled the ``Inspector General Empowerment Act of 2015.'' In total, \n13 colleagues have joined me on this bill: Senators Johnson, McCaskill, \nErnst, Baldwin, Carper, Cornyn, Lankford, Collins, Ayotte, Kirk, \nMikulski, Fischer, and Wyden. It is bipartisan.\n\n  I am grateful to each of them for standing up with me for inspectors \ngeneral. I especially want to thank Senators Johnson and McCaskill, as \nI have already done, but do it again for working closely with me on \nthis legislation from the very beginning and for their work in getting \nthis bill through their committee.\n  Let me tell you what this bill does. The Inspector General \nEmpowerment Act includes further clarification that Congress intended \nIGs to have access to all agency records, notwithstanding any other \nprovision of law, unless other laws specifically state that IGs are not \nto receive such access.\n  Let me be clear. The purpose of this provision is to nullify and \noverturn this awful decision that this one lawyer in the Department of \nJustice out of 2 million-plus Federal employees in the executive branch \nissued this opinion. These words, notwithstanding any other provision \nof law, are key to accomplishing that goal, but the bill does much more \nthan overturning the OLC opinion, which has been roundly criticized by \nboth sides of the aisle. It bolsters IG independence by preventing \nagency heads from placing them on arbitrary and indefinite \nadministrative leave. It promotes transparency by requiring IGs to post \nmore of their reports online, including those involving misconduct by \nsenior officials that the Justice Department chose not to prosecute.\n  Also, the bill equips IGs with tools they need to conduct effective \ninvestigation, such as the ability to subpoena testimony from former \nFederal employees. When employees of the U.S. Government are accused of \nwrongdoing or misconduct, IGs should be able to conduct a full and \nthorough investigation of those allegations. Getting to the bottom of \nthese allegations is necessary to restore public trust. God only knows \nhow much restoration of public trust in the government in Washington we \nhave to restore. Unfortunately, employees who may have violated that \ntrust are often allowed to evade the IGs inquiry by simply retiring \nfrom the government. So the bill empowers IGs to obtain testimony from \nemployees like that.\n  (Ms. AYOTTE assumed the Chair.)\n  Similarly, the bill helps IGs better expose waste, fraud, and abuse \nby those who receive Federal funds. It enables IGs to require testimony \nfrom government contractors, subcontractors, grantees, and subgrantees. \nCurrently, most IGs can subpoena documents from entities from outside \ntheir agency. However, most cannot subpoena testimony, just documents--\nalthough there are a few agencies that can. For example, the inspector \ngeneral for the Defense Department and the Department of Health and \nHuman Services already have that authority. The ability to require \nwitnesses outside the agency to talk to the IG can be critical in \ncarrying out an inspector general's statutory duties or recovering \nwasted Federal funds.\n  The IG community recently provided me with numerous examples of \nactual, real-life cases that illustrate the need to subpoena witnesses.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a document that lists these accounts.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Inspectors General & Testimonial Subpoena Authority\n\n\n               the use of testimonial subpoena authority\n\n Examples of when Testimonial Subpoena Authority Would Have Been Useful\n\n       Below are examples where subjects of IG oversight could \n     have been served with testimonial subpoena's by an Inspector \n     General:\n       1. Among a number of schemes identified during a \n     multiagency OIG investigation, Target owner of small \n     businesses submitted overlapping small business proposals to \n     two federal agencies and obtained funding for both projects, \n     approximately $500,000 from each agency. During the course of \n     the projects, the work funded by one of the agencies was \n     falsely reported out in project reports to both agencies. \n     National Science Foundation (NSF) OIG requested interviews \n     with the Target owner and two of his company's employees, and \n     they initially agreed through counsel to be interviewed.\n       However, during the first of the interviews, an employee \n     confessed to having destroyed company timesheets and created \n     new company time sheets in response to an IG subpoena, and \n     informed NSF OIG that he did so at the Target's request. \n     After that interview, the Target declined to be interviewed. \n     In addition, a fourth employee declined to be interviewed \n     about his timesheets and work performed, which would have \n     been relevant to the fraud scheme. NSF OIG's inability to \n     compel testimony negatively impacted our ability to pursue \n     the obstruction and other potential charges against the \n     Target and company employees.\n       2. In a matter involving a very senior level Securities and \n     Exchange Commission (SEC) executive, instances of serious \n     administrative misconduct were being investigated. During the \n     pendency of the investigation, which had been declined \n     criminally, the executive resigned and refused to cooperate \n     any further. As a result, the investigation was completed \n     without all of the investigative steps completed that would \n     have indicated whether the misconduct was simply the result \n     of a ``bad actor,'' or whether there are more systemic issues \n     that should be addressed by the agency. A testimonial \n     subpoena would ensure that the necessary investigative steps \n     could be completed. This is particularly important in an \n     agency like the SEC where employees are able to leave rather \n     quickly for private sector jobs (the proverbial ``revolving \n     door'').\n       3. The Peace Corps awarded a $1.5 million contract to a \n     small business under the 8(a) Business Development Program, \n     which is intended to provide eligible small disadvantaged \n     businesses additional opportunities to obtain certain \n     government contracts. The 8(a) Program requires that eligible \n     small businesses perform a significant portion of the \n     contract; however, an investigation disclosed that the small \n     business did not comply with that requirement. Instead, the \n     small business allowed a large subcontractor to perform \n     nearly all of the work. Because\n\n[[Page S8670]]\n\n     Peace Corps was not in a direct contractual relationship with \n     the subcontractor actually performing the work, OIG had no \n     recourse to obtain statements of the subcontractor.\n       4. During a criminal investigation conducted by the \n     Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) OIG of allegations \n     involving a CPSC Assistant General Counsel representing a \n     company obtain contracts to provide supplies to the DoD, \n     records were obtained from the CPSC, Department of the Army, \n     and DoD regarding several of the alleged (accused eventually \n     pled guilty to them) offenses. However, additional offenses \n     could not be proven as CPSC OIG had no authority to require \n     US based members of the foreign company to submit to \n     interviews or provide testimonial information. CPSC OIG \n     requested interviews with both senior managers and agents of \n     the company in question, and although they initially agreed \n     to be interviewed all later declined.\n       5. During the course of a review conducted after Fast & \n     Furious, DOJ OIG wanted to interview a former U.S. Attorney \n     in Arizona. When asked for a voluntary interview with the \n     then retired U.S. Attorney declined. DOJ OIG had no way to \n     reach the retired U.S. Attorney to elaborate on prior \n     statements he had made.\n       6. In a Farm Credit Administration OIG case where a senior \n     staff member retired during an investigation, it was \n     subsequently discovered he/she had changed official \n     documents, impersonated an official and committed libel and \n     slander, before retiring during the middle of an \n     investigation on other matters. The former government \n     employee was not receptive to interview post retirement and \n     due to his retirement from government service, there was no \n     recourse.\n       7. Peace Corps OIG, in the course of performing an audit of \n     one of the largest agency contracts, discovered that an \n     unauthorized subcontractor was performing the majority of the \n     work under the contract. The contract was misidentified as a \n     fixed-price contract, did not include an IG audit clause, and \n     the subcontractor was not in a direct contractual \n     relationship with Peace Corps. Peace Corps OIG was hindered \n     in examining potentially false or fraudulent billing by \n     having to rely solely on documentary subpoenas.\n       8. NSF OIG conducted an investigation of two professors, a \n     husband and wife, who both served as Principal Investigators \n     at a U.S. university and received grant funds from multiple \n     federal agencies. The Targets also had full time tenured \n     positions at a foreign university and used federal funds to \n     travel to that foreign country, without disclosing their \n     affiliation in either grant proposals or the U.S. university. \n     During the investigation, the Targets declined, through \n     counsel, to be interviewed. The case was declined by the U.S. \n     attorney's office, and ultimately by the state attorney \n     general's office. NSF OIG's inability to interview these \n     Targets negatively affected NSF OIG's ability to obtain all \n     relevant evidence to effectively pursue grant fraud charges \n     against the Targets.\n       9. The Farm Credit Administration OIG was advised of a \n     contractor who was paid by the agency for contract services \n     it had not provided. Attempts to contact a company \n     representative by mail and telephone were not productive \n     (telephone messages were not returned; certified mail not \n     answered). Fortunately, OIG was able to prevail upon the FBI \n     who had contacts with the company representative. Had the \n     contractor not responded to the FBI contacts, the OIG would \n     have had little recourse in obtaining information from the \n     contractor regarding recovery of the funds. There was a \n     scarce amount of information regarding bank accounts to \n     subpoena for financial records. A testimonial subpoena would \n     have been instrumental under those circumstances.\n       10. In three other small business grant-fraud cases pursued \n     by NSF OIG, three Targets declined to be interviewed \n     regarding apparent fraud schemes that had been identified. \n     Having testimonial subpoena would have provided an important \n     tool to more effectively pursue these cases.\n       i. The first Target faked letters of support for his \n     proposals, applied for duplicate proposals to multiple \n     federal agencies, listed his in-laws (over 90) as company \n     employees, and paid for his wife's business facility with \n     federal funds. Target declined to be interviewed, negatively \n     affecting NSF OIG's ability to fully investigate the matter.\n       ii. The second Target provided financial reports to NSF \n     that did not match his company's expenditure ledger for the \n     award and appeared to include personal expenditures. The \n     Target initially agreed to be interviewed but canceled such \n     interviews on multiple occasions, negatively affecting NSF \n     OIG's ability to fully investigate the matter.\n       iii. The third Target made up a fake investment company to \n     support a matching award from the agency, and the individual \n     who purportedly signed the investment letter as CFO did not \n     sign the letter and never heard of the fake investment \n     company. The Target initially agreed to be interviewed by NSF \n     OIG, but terminated the interview early on after \n     understanding the implications of the NSF OIG investigation. \n     Since then, he has declined to even comply with a subpoena \n     for documents.\n\n\n      a case study: DOD IG's use of testimonial subpoena authority\n\n       Testimonial subpoena authority, found at Sec. 8(i) of the \n     Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended, 5 U.S.C. App., was \n     originally provided by Sec. 1042 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act of 2010, 111 Pub. L. 84.\n       Testimonial subpoena authority has never been delegated, \n     but has always been retained/exercised personally by the DoD \n     IG.\n       Internal procedures mandate that before a testimonial \n     subpoena is issued: (1) the witness, who cannot be a Federal \n     employee, must have declined a voluntary interview, (2) the \n     interview must be expected to produce information needed to \n     resolve critical issue(s) or corroborate essential facts, and \n     (3) the information sought cannot reasonably be obtained \n     through any other means.\n       Sec. 8(i)(3) of the IG Act requires the DoD IG notify the \n     Attorney General seven days before issuing a testimonial \n     subpoena. This notice requirement has not hindered the DoD \n     IG's use of its testimonial subpoena authority.\n       To date, since 2010, the DoD IG has considered a total of \n     eight testimonial subpoena requests, all in connection with \n     administrative investigations:\n       Two requests were considered but denied because they failed \n     to meet the internal procedures criteria.\n       One request, associated with the Retired Military Advisor \n     (RMA) administrative re-investigation, was authorized by the \n     DoD IG and served on the witness, a former Assistant \n     Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs.\n       Two requests, also associated with the RMA administrative \n     re-investigation, were authorized by the DoD IG but not \n     served on the witnesses, a former Secretary of Defense and a \n     former DoD General Counsel, because the witnesses belatedly \n     agreed to be interviewed voluntarily.\n       One request, associated with an internal administrative \n     review of a DCIS investigation, was authorized by the DoD IG \n     and served on the witness, a former DoD Deputy Inspector \n     General for Investigations/ Acting Chief of Staff.\n       One request, associated with an Audit Policy review of \n     DCAA, was authorized by the DoD IG but not served on the \n     witness, a former DCAA Director, because the witness \n     belatedly agreed to be interviewed voluntarily.\n       One request, associated with an IPO evaluation of the \n     transfer of ITAR controlled technology by MDA to NASA, was \n     authorized by the DoD IG but not served on the witness, a \n     former NASA contractor, because the witness belatedly agreed \n     to be interviewed.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Claire McCaskill,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley and Senator McCaskill: The Project On \n     Government Oversight (POGO) is a nonpartisan independent \n     watchdog that champions good government reforms. POGO's \n     investigations into corruption, misconduct, and conflicts of \n     interest achieve a more effective, accountable, open, and \n     ethical federal government. Recognizing the vital role that \n     Inspectors General (IG) play, POGO has investigated and \n     worked to improve the IG system since 2006. This work \n     includes multiple reports on the IG system, maintaining an IG \n     vacancy tracker, and working with Congress to incorporate \n     needed reforms in the Inspector General Act of 2008. In light \n     of this work, we are writing to thank you for introducing the \n     Inspector General Empowerment Act of 2015, and to urge \n     Congress to quickly pass this important legislation.\n       Inspectors General can make all the difference when it \n     comes to creating a better government, but Congress needs to \n     ensure that IGs have access to all the information they need \n     to do their job effectively. Federal agencies have begun to \n     unreasonably challenge IGs' statutory right to access agency \n     data in attempts to prevent embarrassing events from coming \n     to light. It is essential that Congress act quickly to pass \n     the Inspector General Empowerment Act of 2015 to prevent the \n     overbroad interpretation of restrictions on IG authority from \n     becoming accepted law, allowing current and future waste, \n     fraud, and abuse to remain hidden.\n       In order to serve as the eyes and ears of Congress, an IG \n     office must have an unrestricted view of the agency it \n     oversees. This principle is enshrined in Section 6(a)(1) of \n     the Inspector General Act, which states that each IG office \n     shall have ``access to all records, reports, audits, reviews, \n     documents, papers, recommendations, or other material . . . \n     which relate to programs and operations with respect to which \n     that Inspector General has responsibilities under this Act.'' \n     It seems crystal clear that ``all'' means all, but some \n     agencies have fought back against that idea.\n       The most blatant rejection of ``all means all'' can be \n     found in the July 2015 opinion by the Department of Justice's \n     (DOJ) Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) that improperly limits IG \n     access and caters to agency resistance to necessary \n     oversight. If left unchallenged, this opinion will allow \n     agencies' incorrect interpretation of Section 6(a)(1) to \n     become de facto law. The OLC's opinion states that the \n     unfettered access afforded by Section\n\n[[Page S8671]]\n\n     6(a) of the Inspector General Act is superseded by specific \n     restrictions on the dissemination of Title III, grand jury, \n     and FCRA information. The OLC concluded, for instance, that \n     the IG office may not be entitled to obtain these records \n     when conducting financial audits and other administrative and \n     civil reviews that are only tangentially related to DOJ's \n     criminal and law enforcement activities. POGO disagrees with \n     this interpretation because it rests upon a clear misreading \n     of the common language Congress made clear in the law.\n       Congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle have \n     rightly condemned the OLC's opinion, according to which ``all \n     records'' does not mean ``all records.'' POGO believes this \n     OLC opinion makes a mockery of the entire IG system: these \n     offices cannot possibly be effective watchdogs on behalf of \n     Congress and the American public if agencies restrict IG \n     access and force them to negotiate with agency leaders for \n     access on a case-by-case basis. Agency records provide the \n     raw materials IG offices need to fulfill their statutory \n     responsibilities. The very purpose of having an independent \n     IG is undermined if the office has to seek the agency's \n     permission in order to carry out its mission. Unless Congress \n     acts quickly, this OLC opinion will gut the IG system and \n     prevent meaningful oversight.\n       While many federal agencies handle records that are highly \n     sensitive and legitimately withheld from public \n     dissemination, that does not mean they should be withheld \n     from IG offices, or by extension from Congress, both of which \n     offer independent oversight and recommendations to improve \n     agency operations. Secret agency programs are particularly \n     susceptible to waste, fraud, and abuse, but IG offices cannot \n     uncover or correct these problems without access to agency \n     records. Agency actions that deny access to those records \n     violate our system of checks and balances, and do so unduly, \n     as IGs have proven they can responsibly handle sensitive \n     information.\n       For example, the DOJ Office of the Inspector General (OIG) \n     has shown that it can effectively and responsibly oversee the \n     most sensitive DOJ operations without jeopardizing law \n     enforcement actions. It has reviewed grand jury materials and \n     other sensitive records when it examined the FBI's potential \n     targeting of domestic advocacy groups, the FBI's efforts to \n     access records of reporters' toll calls during a media leak \n     probe, the President's Surveillance Program, and the firing \n     of U.S. Attorneys, among other important and high-profile \n     cases.\n       Congress needs to clarify that IG offices must be granted \n     access to all agency records notwithstanding any other \n     existing or future law or any other prohibition on \n     disclosure, including but not limited to: 1) the federal \n     rules of criminal procedure; 2) Title III; 3) the FCRA; and \n     4) laws such as the Kate Puzey Act that restrict the \n     dissemination of personally identifiable information. In \n     addition, Congress should specify that agencies do not waive \n     the attorney-client or other common law privileges when \n     records are turned over to IG offices. The Inspector General \n     Empowerment Act of 2015 addresses this issue and corrects the \n     troublesome OLC memo. However, until Congress passes the \n     bill, that memo can be and has been used to block oversight.\n       The bill also addresses other improper challenges to IG \n     access. Under the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection \n     Act (CMPPA), IGs must get approval from agency leaders in \n     order to match the computer records of one federal agency \n     against other federal and non-federal records. The Inspector \n     General Empowerment Act of 2015 would exempt IG offices from \n     the CMPPA so they can access records at other agencies \n     without getting approval from the very officials they are \n     supposed to oversee. Additionally, under current law, IGs can \n     only compel testimony from federal employees. This means that \n     former federal employees, contractors, or grant recipients \n     can refuse to testify before an IG in the course of an \n     investigation. This bill would provide IGs with testimonial \n     subpoena power over these individuals, and allow for fuller \n     and more effective oversight of federal programs and \n     agencies.\n       In the light of the erroneous July OLC opinion, it is \n     urgent that Congress act now to make sure IGs have the \n     ability to function as intended. Not correcting this \n     precedent now will cripple current and future IGs and in turn \n     limit Congress's and the public's ability to oversee the \n     executive branch and hold it accountable.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Danielle Brian,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, the Project on Government Oversight is \na nonpartisan, independent watchdog that has been advocating good \ngovernment reforms for decades. In this letter the Project on \nGovernment Oversight expresses its support for this bill in general and \nfor provisions that equip inspectors general with the authority to \nrequire testimony. Let it be clear that the bill also imposes \nlimitations on the authority of IGs to require testimony.\n  There are several procedural protections in place to ensure that this \nauthority is exercised wisely. For example, the subpoena must be \napproved by a designated panel of three other IGs. It is then referred \nto the Attorney General. For those IGs who can already subpoena \nwitnesses' testimony, I am not aware of any instances in which it has \nbeen misused. In fact, the inspector general for the Department of \nDefense has established a policy that spells out additional procedures \nand safeguards to ensure the subjects of subpoenas are treated fairly. \nI am confident the rest of the IG community will be just as scrupulous \nin providing appropriate protection for the use of this authority. You \nsee, we all win when inspectors general can do their jobs. Most \nimportantly, the public is better served when IGs are able to shine \nlight in the government operation and stewardship of taxpayer dollars.\n  In September we attempted to pass this important bill by unanimous \nconsent. It has been nearly 3 months since leadership asked whether any \nSenator would object. Not one Senator has put a statement in the Record \nor come to the floor to object publicly. At the August Judiciary \nCommittee hearing, there was a clear consensus that Congress needed to \nact legislatively and needed to overturn this Office of Legal Counsel \nopinion that one person out of 2-plus million employees in the \nexecutive branch overruled this 1978 act that the inspector general \nought to be entitled to all information. Every day that goes by without \nfixing the opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel is another day that \nwatchdogs across government can be stonewalled.\n  At that hearing, Senator Leahy said this access problem is ``blocking \nwhat was once a free flow of information'' and Senator Leahy called for \na permanent legislative solution. Senator Cornyn noted that the Office \nof Legal Counsel opinion is ``ignoring the mandate of Congress'' and \nundermining the oversight authority that Congress has under the \nConstitution. Senator Tillis stated that the need to fix this access \nproblem was ``a blinding flash of the obvious'' and that ``we all seem \nto be in violent agreement that we need to correct this.''\n  However, some Members raised concern about guaranteeing IGs unchecked \naccess to certain national security information. Fortunately, we were \nable to agree on some changes to the bill that addressed those \nconcerns, without gutting the core of the bill. We made these \nconcessions so the bill can pass by unanimous consent. This Senator \nthanks my colleagues who worked with me to arrive at this compromise.\n  As we move forward, it is important to note the following: First, I \nam not aware of a single instance in which an IG has mishandled any \nclassified or sensitive operational information. IGs are subject to the \nsame restrictions on disclosing information as everyone else in the \nagency they oversee.\n  Second, the Executive orders restricting and controlling classified \ninformation are issued under the President's constitutional authority. \nNaturally, this bill does not attempt to limit that constitutional \nauthority at all. It just clarifies that no law can prevent an IG from \nobtaining documents from the agency it oversees unless the statute \nexplicitly states that IG access should be restricted. No one thinks \nthis statute could supersede the President's constitutional authority.\n  Third, there is already a provision in law that allows the Secretary \nof Defense to prohibit an Inspector General review to protect vital \nnational security interests and to protect sensitive operational \ninformation. We agreed to clarify that already existing provision to \ninclude the ability to restrict access to information as well as to \nprevent a review from occurring. However, we kept the language in that \nprovision that requires notification to Congress whenever that \nauthority to restrict an IG's access to information is exercised.\n  After making these changes, we attempted to hotline the revised bill \nlast week. Since then, no Senator has publicly stated any other \nconcerns. The cosponsors have worked hard behind the scenes over the \npast 3 months in good faith to accommodate the concerns of any and all \nMembers willing to work with us. Now the time has come to pass this \nbill. We all lose when Inspectors General are delayed or prevented from \ndoing their work.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up for Inspectors General, overturn the \nOffice of Legal Counsel opinion, and restore the intent of the \nInspector General Act. All IGs should have access and timely \nindependent access to all agency records. The most important thing\n\n[[Page S8672]]\n\nis the principle that not one lawyer--that any one lawyer in the \nDepartment of Justice or any agency of government doesn't have a right \nto override the opinion of the Congress expressed in a statute so \nclearly as this is expressed.\n  Madam President, at this time I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 68, S. 579, the \nInspector General Empowerment Act of 2015; I further ask consent that \nthe Johnson substitute amendment be agreed to; that the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider \nbe considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. May I ask on whose behalf the minority leader is \nobjecting? Is it on his own behalf or on behalf of another Senator?\n  Mr. REID. Other Senators are concerned about it, and I made the \nobjection on my behalf.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will not question what the minority leader just said, \nbut it seems to me we ought to know who that Senator is besides the \nminority leader because Senator Wyden and I have worked very hard over \nthe last 10 years, and we finally got done what we thought was a very \ngood measure for this body; that the people who put holds on \nlegislation ought to be made public, and there has been nothing in the \nRecord. So why don't these people have guts enough to put in the Record \ntheir reasons and who they are? The public has a right to know that.\n  Mr. REID. I am it.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. No.\n  Mr. JOHNSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I want to rise and voice my \ndisappointment. This is a very commonsense piece of legislation that \nhas strong bipartisan support. Senator Grassley has worked tirelessly \non this and certainly our committee has as well. We cannot get a \nsimple, commonsense bipartisan piece of legislation passed by the \nSenate--and then the insult of not even hearing what the objection is.\n  What is the objection to giving the inspectors general the tools they \nneed to provide the accountability and the transparency to safeguard \nAmerican taxpayer money?\n  I cited my example of the Potomac Healthcare system, the Potomac VA \nhealth care system, where because an inspector general was not \ntransparent because the VA inspector general held 140 reports on \ninspections and investigations, the family of Thomas Baer did not \nrealize there were problems. They took their father to that health care \nfacility and their father died of a stroke because of neglect. That is \nhow important this is. Yet we cannot even hear the reason behind the \nobjection as to why they would not allow this very commonsense piece of \nlegislation to pass.\n  This is very disappointing.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise today to revisit an issue that \nsome in this body I am sure, no doubt, would probably not want to \nrevisit. My intention is not to cause any of my colleagues discomfort, \nbut this is an issue--and the Presiding Officer knows more than most--\nthat needs to be discussed, and the Presiding Officer has done a great \njob of discussing it. I think it has become pretty clear to most \nAmericans and many Members of this body that this body made a mistake a \nfew months back, a mistake with significant consequences for our \nsecurity, for the security of the Middle East, and certainly a mistake \nas it relates to some of our own American citizens. For the first time \nin U.S. history on a national security agreement of major importance, \nthe mistake that was made was the Congress of the United States moved \nforward to approve an agreement not on the basis of a bipartisan \nmajority, which is the history of this country, but on the basis of a \npartisan minority in both Houses. Of course, I am talking about \nPresident Obama's Iranian nuclear deal that will very soon--as early as \nnext month, according to the terms of the agreement--be sending tens of \nbillions of dollars to the biggest sponsor of terrorism in the world.\n  There are many things that are going on in this body right now. We \nare looking at the spending bills, and there is a lot of concern about \nterrorism. As a matter of fact, polling is showing that right now \nterrorism is ranking as the highest concern for Americans--higher even \nthan the economy--given the attacks in California and what is happening \nwith ISIS.\n  Amidst all of these challenges, however, the implementation of the \nObama administration's nuclear deal with Iran is looming on the horizon \nand is not being talked about enough in this body. It is critical that \nwe keep our eye on Iran--still the world's largest state sponsor of \nterrorism--particularly now. Why is it so critical now? Because, as I \nnoted, as early as next month, in January, tens of billions of dollars \nof sanctions relief will be pouring into the country of Iran according \nto the terms of the agreement.\n  I commend my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Menendez. I was \npresiding last week in the Senate, and once again he gave another \noutstanding speech on American foreign policy, on American national \nsecurity, on what is going on with Iran, what is going on with their \nactivities destabilizing the Middle East, what is going on with their \nactivities which are as we speak violating the Iran U.N. Security \nCouncil resolutions.\n  Yes, I know we debated this issue for a long time on the Senate \nfloor, and I am sure some of my colleagues who voted on this deal are \ndone and they don't want to talk about it anymore.\n  Mr. President, if you recall, one of the arguments to support this \ndeal, one of the arguments the President was making was that--we were \ntold this deal would change Iran's behavior. President Obama stated \nthat the deal ``demonstrates that if Iran complies with its \ninternational obligations, then it can fully rejoin the community of \nnations.'' The words of the text of the agreement even state that the \nUnited States is ``expressing its desire to build a new relationship \nwith Iran.'' And, of course, Secretary Kerry, in hearings and in \nprivate briefings with the Senate, noted that he thought--and you saw \nhis actions--that the agreement would establish a much more positive \nand constructive relationship between Iran and the United States. So \nthat was one of the arguments for the deal we voted on. How is that \nworking out? Well, I think we have gotten a new relationship with Iran, \nall right, but it is worse than the old one.\n  Since the signing of the Iranian deal, Iran has taken deliberative \nsteps, definitive steps that continue to undermine the security \ninterests of the United States and our allies and those of our citizens \nin almost every region,\n\n[[Page S8673]]\n\nin almost every realm. Every action the Iranians have taken has seemed \nto want to increase tension between us, Iran, and some of our allies.\n  I wish to provide some examples. Almost as soon as the ink was dry on \nthis agreement, the Iran regime and its leaders continued doing what \nthey typically do: chanting ``Death to America.'' And more \nspecifically, the Ayatollah Khamenei predicted that the Zionist \nregime--of course he is referring to Israel--will be ``nothing'' in 25 \nyears. It is another one of his references to wiping Israel off the \nmap--after the agreement. Then he stated, of the 25-year period, \n``Until then, struggling, heroic, and jihadi morale will leave no \nmoment of serenity for the Zionists.'' That is the leader of the \ncountry we did this deal with--after we signed the agreement. So it is \nstill certainly provocative in that regard.\n  How about its funding of Hezbollah, one of its terrorist proxies \naround the world? It is still full speed ahead. There are estimates of \nup to $200 million a year. That continues after the signing.\n  How about abiding by U.N. Security Council resolutions, such as the \none that prevents the Quds Force commander, General Soleimani, from \ntraveling? Well, we know that was violated. As a matter of fact, \nSoleimani went to Moscow to meet with Putin to discuss arms transfers, \nlikely in violation of the U.N. Security Council resolution--the \nresolution that bans conventional weapons from being imported to Iran. \nSo that was another violation, and they are likely planning another \none.\n  Let me remind this body about the Quds Force commander. This is what \nformer U.S. Army Chief of Staff GEN Ray Odierno said about him:\n\n       Qassem Soleimani is the one who has been exporting malign \n     activities throughout the Middle East for some time now. He's \n     absolutely responsible for killing many Americans. In fact, I \n     would say the last two years I was there the majority of our \n     casualties came from his surrogates, not Sunni or al Qaeda.\n\n  This is the person who is negotiating with Putin to trade arms--\nlikely in violation of another U.N. Security Council resolution.\n  What about his troops? Well, we have seen an increase of Iranian \ntroops in Syria. General Dunford, the current Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, predicted that there are about 2,000 troops in Syria \nhelping to lead the fight to save Assad and working with the Russians \nto do that.\n  How about Iran's compliance with U.N. Security Council Resolution \n1929, which bans its ballistic missile program? Remember that issue? We \ndebated that issue on the floor. General Dempsey, the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs, said that under no circumstances should we agree to \nlifting that ban, but we did in the deal. Now we are learning that Iran \nhas tested not one but two ballistic missiles on October 11 and \nNovember 21 in likely--almost certain--violation of U.N. Security \nCouncil Resolution 1929. In my view, that is a violation of the Iran \nagreement.\n  This is what our Ambassador to the U.N. stated. She said that the \nmissiles Iran tested only months after we passed the agreement are \n``inherently capable of delivering a nuclear weapon.'' So they are \ntesting missiles with that capability. This should concern all \nAmericans. What should really concern all Americans right now is that \ndespite Ambassador Power's statement, it appears the Obama \nadministration is looking to do nothing on this violation of the U.N. \nSecurity Council resolution.\n  This is how my colleague from Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Bob Corker, put it:\n\n       Iran violates U.N. Security Council resolutions because it \n     knows neither this administration nor the U.N. Security \n     Council is likely to take any action. Instead, the \n     administration remains paralyzed and responds to Iran's \n     violations with empty words, with condemnation, and concern.\n\n  As I mentioned, last week my colleague from New Jersey, Senator \nMenendez, gave an outstanding speech on this issue on December 8, and \nhe noted--similar to Senator Corker--that the Obama administration's \nreaction has been muted, almost one of silence.\n  Mr. President, there is more. A report from the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency, which we were all anticipating, just recently came out \nand stated that Iran pursued nuclear weapons in secret until 2009--\nlonger than previously believed. So the country we are doing this deal \nwith, at least according to the IAEA, has been lying to the world.\n  Iran has been caught lying and cheating. It is testing ballistic \nmissiles against the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 and others; \nit is still funding global terrorism; it is sending thousands of troops \nto Syria to prop up Assad; it has sent the man with the blood of \nthousands of American soldiers on his hands to Russia to talk about \narms trading, in likely further violation of U.N. Security Council \nresolutions; and, of course, it is still chanting ``Death to America'' \nand talking about wiping Israel off the face of the Earth--all since \nthe Obama administration signed the Iranian nuclear agreement.\n  There is one more outrage, perhaps the worst one, in my view. In a \ndirect affront to the United States and our citizens, Iran is still \nholding five Americans against their will in that country. Think about \nthat. Many of us who closely watched the negotiations thought surely, \nsurely Secretary Kerry--who had enormous leverage; the entire world was \naligned against Iran--would surely use that leverage to get our \ncitizens free, or maybe if he wasn't going to do it as part of the \ndeal, there would be some kind of side agreement after the signing that \nthey would be quietly released. But, like everything else since the \nsigning of this agreement, the American hostage situation in Iran has \nactually gotten worse.\n  I wish to read the names and describe a little bit about the \nAmericans who are currently being held in Iran.\n  Amir Hekmati of Michigan, a U.S. marine, was detained in Iran in 2011 \nwhile visiting Iranian relatives and was sentenced to 10 years in \nprison for espionage--a U.S. marine who proudly served his country. I \nam a marine. We don't leave our fellow marines on the battlefield, but \nevidently the Obama administration has not learned that lesson.\n  Saeed Abedini of Idaho, a Christian pastor, was detained in Iran in \n2012 and sentenced to 8 years in prison on charges related to his \nreligious beliefs. Again, an American is languishing in Iranian jail \nright now, a pastor.\n  Robert Levinson of Florida, a former official of the FBI, disappeared \nin 2007. Iran's leaders denied knowledge of Levinson's whereabouts or \nany involvement in his disappearance.\n  Most recently, Siamak Namazi, a Dubai-based businessman, was arrested \nafter the signing of this Iranian nuclear deal--after the signing--was \narrested by the Iranian Government while visiting relatives in \nIran. Right now, any charges against him are unknown. That happened on \nOctober 15.\n\n  Of course, Jason Rezaian of California--a journalist for the \nWashington Post, who was credentialed as a journalist by the Government \nof Iran--has been detained for over 500 days and recently--again, after \nthe signing of the agreement with President Obama--was sentenced to an \nundisclosed prison for an undisclosed term for espionage.\n  That is five Americans right now. I don't have to remind my \ncolleagues that it is the holiday season. It is a time for families and \nloved ones to come together, to be with each other. But what about the \nfamilies of these Americans? Who is thinking about them?\n  Secretary Kerry and President Obama should be on the phone every day \nworking for their release, but that is clearly not happening. As the \nWashington Post editorial board put it recently:\n\n       Iran appears content to allow Mr. Rezaian and the other \n     Americans to rot in prison indefinitely, even as the regime \n     collects more than $100 billion in sanctions relief and is \n     granted the role it has long sought as a regional power. That \n     should not be an acceptable outcome.\n\n  That is the Washington Post. That is the Washington Post editorial--\n``That should not be an acceptable outcome.'' No, it shouldn't. It \nshould not.\n  All of this begs some very obvious questions. Given Iran's consistent \nprovocative actions against U.S. interests and our citizens since the \nsigning of the Iran deal and given that one of the promises of the \ndeal--better relations with Iran, more constructive behavior from \nIran--has proven to be utterly\n\n[[Page S8674]]\n\nfalse, why in the world are we moving full steam ahead with the lifting \nof sanctions as early as next month? Think about that. Why indeed are \nwe getting ready to release tens of billions of dollars to the world's \nbiggest sponsor of state terrorism when we know the additional money \nwill only embolden Iran? Just think how they are acting now. When they \nhave tens of billions of dollars to further their terrorist activities, \nit will embolden them to act in even more nefarious ways against our \ninterests and those of our allies and, most importantly, those of \nAmerican citizens.\n  Another question: Why aren't the President and Secretary Kerry at a \nminimum telling the Iranians they won't see one dime--one dime--of the \nbillions and billions of dollars we are set to hand over to the \nIranians until all five Americans are released from prison? Why aren't \nwe using that leverage? That leverage is going to go away as soon as we \nrelease that money.\n  Why are we getting ready to release tens of billions of dollars to \nIran when it is clear they are going to simply violate this agreement? \nThat is not just my view. Former Senator and Secretary of State Hillary \nClinton was quoted as saying just last week that it is not if, but \nwhen, Iran will violate President Obama's nuclear agreement.\n  Just last week she stated: ``They are going to violate it.'' Former \nSenator, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton knows a little about \nthe issue. She helped negotiate it. ``They are going to violate it,'' \nshe said. ``They are going to violate it, they are going to be \nprovocative about it, and we need to respond quickly and very \nharshly.'' That is the former Secretary of State.\n  Well, I agree with the former Secretary of State--the Iranians are \ngoing to violate this agreement. In fact, it is very likely the \nIranians have already violated this agreement with their U.N. Security \nCouncil resolution violations.\n  So what should we do?\n  First, for any Americans listening, watching, who care about this \nissue, I urge you to call the President, call the Secretary of State, \ncall the White House, call the State Department. Tell them something \nthat I believe the vast, vast majority of Americans agree with: Our \ngovernment should not be relieving Iran of any sanctions while it \ncontinues to illegally hold five Americans hostage. We should demand of \nour President that he should not allow tens of billions of dollars to \nflood into the biggest terrorist regime in the world while our citizens \nlanguish in Iranian jails. This is simple, and it is just wrong.\n  We need to light up the switchboard. Let President Obama know. Here \nis the number to the White House switchboard: (202) 456-1414. Call the \nPresident and tell him you think it is fundamentally wrong to let five \nAmericans languish in prison while we are getting ready to send the \nbiggest terrorist regime in the world tens of billions of dollars.\n  Call John Kerry. Here is the number to the State Department \nswitchboard: (202) 647-4000. Tell him: Mr. Secretary, get on the phone. \nRelease these prisoners; release our citizens or don't give Iran any of \nthe billions of dollars they think they are going to get next month.\n  Second, I agreed with my colleague Senator Menendez when he gave his \nspeech last week that we need to keep the leverage against Iran by \ntightening the full range of sanctions available to us to penalize Iran \nfor violating U.N. Security Council resolutions, as they have done \nwithin the last month. In his speech he also said we need to \nreauthorize the Iran Sanctions Act. I agree with him, and this body \nshould take action to do just that.\n  Finally, I am working to get support for a simple bill that would \nprevent the President from lifting sanctions until Iran is no longer \ndesignated a state sponsor of terrorism and until Iran releases our \nfive citizens who are languishing in their jails.\n  With all due respect to my colleagues who voted for this agreement, I \nbelieve this body made an enormous mistake by allowing the President's \nnuclear agreement to move forward. Iran's actions since the signing of \nthis agreement--day after day, against the interests of the United \nStates and our citizens--have made this 100 percent clear.\n  This mistake can be undone. We don't have to allow Iran access to \ntens of billions of dollars in sanctions relief while they continue to \ndestabilize the Middle East, while they continue their robust expansive \nterrorist activities throughout the world. And we certainly--and this \nis a message for the President of the United States and the Secretary \nof State. We certainly don't have to allow them the tens of billions of \ndollars while Iran retains and detains Americans on trumped-up charges \nin Iranian jails, with no prospect for release. As the Washington Post \nput it, ``That should not be an acceptable outcome.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/15/senate-section/article/S8674-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

I want to thank him and thank Senator \nThune, Senator Nelson, and Senator Manchin, as well as Senator \nFeinstein and Senator Reed, for the improvements they have made to the \nbill. But I feel, with all due respect, that problems remain.\n  We have an effective medical certification system now which, \nunfortunately, this bill undermines, in my view. This bill replaces it \nwith an untested framework, making it easier for people with dangerous \nmedical conditions to fly. There is really no medical certificate \neffective to deal with potential medical problems. I am gravely \nconcerned that this bill may lead to an increase in the number of \naviation accidents.\n  My hope is--since it has 69 cosponsors, and the will of the Senate \nnow is apparently to move forward--that we can perhaps improve it in \nthe course of the FAA reauthorization. I hope some of these issues can \nbe addressed in that process. I hope my colleague Senator Inhofe will \nwork with me to keep the policy proposals outlined in this bill in mind \nas we go forward with the FAA reauthorization bill--and that is \nscheduled to be sometime next year--so that further improvements can be \ngiven due consideration.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his hard work on this \nbill, and I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2928) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To clarify the administrative authorities and to improve the \n                        physician certification)\n\n       On page 37, line 12, after the period, insert the \n     following: ``I certify that I am not aware of any medical \n     condition that, as presently treated, could interfere with \n     the individual's ability to safely operate an aircraft.''.\n       On page 40, line 6, insert ``and signed by the physician'' \n     after ``followed''.\n       On page 48, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n       (l) Authority to Require Additional Information.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Administrator receives credible or \n     urgent information, including from the National Driver \n     Register or the Administrator's Safety Hotline, that reflects \n     on an individual's ability to safely operate a covered \n     aircraft under the third-class medical certificate exemption \n     in subsection (a), the Administrator may require the \n     individual to provide additional information or history so \n     that the Administrator may determine whether the individual \n     is safe to continue operating a covered aircraft.\n       (2) Use of information.--The Administrator may use credible \n     or urgent information received under paragraph (1) to request \n     an individual to provide additional information or to take \n     actions under section 44709(b) of title 49, United States \n     Code.\n\n  The committee-reported amendment in the nature of a substitute, as \namended, was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 571), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 571\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Ten years ago, on the light aircraft, we actually had \nthis language--even stronger than it is now. In that period of time, \nthere hasn't been one accident that can be related to a third-class \nmedical. I think the time has proven itself in 10 years.\n  To respond, I would be very happy to work with the Senator from \nConnecticut on problems that may rise that I don't envision right now. \nI appreciate very much his cooperation and also his staying around this \nlate at night.\n  Thank you so much.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to an \noutstanding Arkansas educator, Meghan Ables, who was named the 2016 \nArkansas Teacher of the Year.\n  In nearly 13 years of teaching, Meghan's work in the classroom has \nmade a difference in the lives of students in the Stuttgart School \nDistrict. While she has taught a variety of subjects at Stuttgart High \nSchool, she currently serves as an English and journalism teacher. She \nhas added reading and writing opportunities at the school by \nreestablishing its monthly magazine, The Bird Banner, and helping \nlaunch its studio, Ricebird Television.\n  Meghan challenges her students to use their skills to improve their \ncommunity. Her journalism class partnered with Arkansas Children's \nHospital as well as the local police and fire departments to raise \nawareness about safe driving.\n  Meghan's commitment to education also inspires those who work with \nher to do their best to encourage further development in the classroom. \nShe has led professional development activities for using literacy \ntechniques in the classroom, presented for the Literacy Design \nCollaborative, LDC, and provided Teacher Excellence and Support System, \nTESS, training to her colleagues.\n  The Arkansas Teacher of the Year program, part of the National \nTeacher of the Year program, recognizes teachers around the State for \ntheir teaching excellence. This truly is a major accomplishment in \nMeghan's career and something for which she can be very proud. Her \noutstanding contributions to education, the Stuttgart School District, \nand her students proves she is well deserving of this recognition.\n  I would like to offer my congratulations to Meghan Ables for her \ndetermination, devotion, and commitment to her students and to \neducation. I am encouraged by her efforts to inspire our next \ngeneration of leaders and her drive to help them succeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/15/senate-section/article/S8682-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8682-S8683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOE SIMON, JR.\n\n Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, today I would like to honor a \nNorth Dakotan who is among the longest serving fire department \nvolunteers in my State, keeping his community safe from fires and other \nthreats for more than 65 years. That is a rare distinction in public \nservice. The name Joe Simon, Jr., of Thompson, ND, has been on the \nvolunteer firefighters' roster since his high school days when his \nfather was fire chief.\n  Joe served for 36 years as the chief of the Thompson Fire Department. \nDuring that time, it was Joe's responsibility to keep the department \nfully staffed, manage training and medical duties, and work on grants \nto help keep the department running. Though Joe has retired as chief, \nhe is still actively involved with department, helping with monthly \nchecks of equipment and going on fire calls.\n  According to his friend, George Hoselton, it was under Joe's \nleadership that the Thompson Fire Department got its first set of the \nJaws of Life rescue system--a major purchase for a volunteer \ndepartment. After a college student died in an accident along the \nhighway near Thompson because no Jaws of Life were available, Joe led \ndoor-to-door fundraising efforts to buy the lifesaving equipment. The \ncommunity, today comprised of just a thousand North Dakotans, \ncontributed enough money that the Thompson Fire Department was able to \npurchase the Jaws of Life and a rescue vehicle needed to carry the Jaws \nof Life and other equipment, says George. And that is what Joe is best \nat: working hard, bringing folks together, and making his community \nsafer.\n  Joe's volunteerism at the Thompson Fire Department over more than 60 \nyears has made the department a model for other communities around the \nState and country. Thompson Fire Department has taught classes to share \nits practices with other fire departments in the region and has long \nled the way in improving its volunteers' skills and safety. Under Joe's \nleadership, the department secured one of the earliest automatic \ndefibrillators in the State of North Dakota. Joe also helped get \nmedical first response units up and running at other volunteer \ndepartments in the region and was instrumental in getting 911 and \nemergency first responder radio systems set up in Grand Forks County. \nService is a way of life in Joe's family. His wife, Sue, has been an \nEMT with the Thompson Fire Department for 27 years, which puts her in \nsecond place in seniority.\n  After studying at the University of North Dakota, Joe has spent his \nlife in Thompson helping to grow and support the community in many \nways. For 36 years, he worked as the head of the Agricultural \nStabilization and Conservation Service in Grand Forks. Outside of his \nfirefighting duties, Joe has been actively involved in American Legion \nbaseball, Thompson High School football, and almost any other sporting \nevent in town. Every Memorial Day, Joe puts out flags in nearby \ncemeteries, and reads a list of the honored dead--all of the veterans \nburied at four cemeteries around Thompson.\n  Friend and fellow firefighter George says that Joe ``gets the biggest \nsmile on his face when he helps someone. That makes his day.''\n  Volunteers make up 96 percent of North Dakota's firefighters. They \nhave other jobs but continue to give back, building stronger and safer \ncommunities and supporting the very fabric of our State. North Dakotans \nknow that each of us has to step in to help our family and neighbors \nduring tough times, and our first responders know that better than \nmost. It is North Dakotans like Joe who epitomize why our State is such \na unique and wonderful place filled with dedicated individuals who put \nothers before themselves.\n  Thank you, Joe, for your tremendous service to your community and for \nyour tireless efforts to keep communities throughout North Dakota \nsafe.\n\n[[Page S8683]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/15/senate-section/article/S8683-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL HAROLD GREGORY ``HAL'' MOORE, JR.\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize retired \nLTG Harold ``Hal'' Moore of Auburn, AL, for his lifetime of service to \nthe United States of America.\n  LTG ``Hal'' Moore is best known as the lieutenant colonel in command \nof the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, at the Battle of Ia Drang, \nin 1965 during the Vietnam war and as the author of ``We Were Soldiers \nOnce . . . and Young.'' This book explores the weeklong Battle of Ia \nDrang where Hal served as the battalion commanding officer and led his \ntroops personally. It is a magnificent book evidencing his courage, \nleadership, brilliance, and that of his regiment. I read it years ago \nand have not forgotten it.\n  Encircled by enemy soldiers and with no clear landing zone that would \nallow them to depart, Moore managed to persevere despite overwhelming \nodds. Moore's belief that ``there is always one more thing you can do \nto increase your odds of success,'' along with the courage of his \nentire command, are credited with this victory. Hal used the concepts \nof air assault organization and employment that he and his troopers \nlearned during their time at Ft. Benning, GA, for the first time in \nactual combat.\n  Moore then took the lessons he learned from this initial battle and \nhelped instruct future troopers on how to better employ the tactic, \nsaving countless lives going forward. During the Battle of Ia Drang, \nMoore was referred to as ``Yellow Hair'' by his troops, for his blond \nhair, and as a tongue-in-cheek tribute referencing GEN George Armstrong \nCuster, commander of the same 7th Cavalry at the Battle of the Little \nBighorn just under a century before.\n  For his actions, Hal was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the \nsecond highest military decoration of the U.S. Army. After the Battle \nof Ia Drang, Moore was promoted to colonel and subsequently took \ncommand of the 3rd Brigade, commonly referred to as the Garry Owen \nBrigade.\n  After his service in the Vietnam war, Moore served in various \nassignments until his retirement from the Army, as a lieutenant general \non August 1, 1977, after completing 32 years of active service. Today \nhe remains an ``honorary colonel'' of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry \nRegiment.\n  Along with the book he wrote, Hal is remembered in the 2007 book \nwritten by his volunteer driver, ``A General's Spiritual Journey,'' and \nin the 2013 biography by author Mike Guardia, ``Hal Moore: A Soldier \nOnce . . . and Always.'' Moore has also been designated a Distinguished \nGraduate by the West Point Association of Graduates and has a 3-mile \nstretch of Highway 280 in Lee County, AL, named in his honor.\n  Lieutenant General Moore splits time between Auburn, AL, and Crested \nButte, CO. He continues to involve himself in his community. I am proud \nto call LTG Harold ``Hal'' Moore a fellow Alabamian and to acknowledge \nand celebrate his long and distinguished life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/15/senate-section/article/S8683-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 2:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 808.
