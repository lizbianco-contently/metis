Mr. President, it has been 6 years since the flawed \nhealth care policies of ObamaCare were signed into law. Six years \nlater, my office continues to receive stories from Kentuckians who are \nreeling from the negative effects of this partisan law.\n  For instance, take the heartbreaking story from one middle-class \nhusband and father of two from Covington who suffered a heart attack at \nthe age of 42. Under ObamaCare, this Kentucky dad has seen his health \ncare premium triple and his deductible increase to, as he put it, a \n``ridiculous'' amount. He said he struggles to afford his medicine--\nwhich he says costs upward of $1,000 a month--as he and his family \nstruggle to survive week to week.\n  Put simply, he says, ObamaCare is a ``terrible blight on the health \ncare system'' that has resulted in more ``expensive, watered down, \nunaffordable health care for the middle class.'' Unfortunately, too \nmany American families have had similar experiences under this \nadministration's partisan law because from the start this health care \npolicy was built on a mountain--a mountain of higher costs and broken \npromises, which only seem to grow larger by the day.\n  When it comes to ObamaCare, costs in the exchange are higher than its \nchampions expected. A recent study found that ObamaCare exchange \nindividual market enrollees experienced higher medical costs than \npeople insured through employer-provided coverage: 19 percent higher in \n2014 and 22 percent higher last year. When it comes to ObamaCare, it \nsimply does\n\n[[Page S2466]]\n\nnot work like its champions promised either. As a result, we have seen \nincreasing numbers of insurers pull out of the ObamaCare marketplace \naltogether.\n  Just last week, we learned that the Nation's largest health insurer \nwill join the list, withdrawing from all but a ``handful of States'' \nnext year, including Kentucky. What this means is that Americans in my \nhome State and across much of the Nation are likely to face even fewer \nhealth insurance options. According to one analysis, if this insurer \nwithdrew from the exchange market altogether, nearly 2 million \nmarketplace enrollees would be left with only 2 insurers, while more \nthan 1 million more would be left with only 1.\n  Fewer choices could also mean even higher premium costs. As one \nexpert put it, either insurers will drop out or insurers will raise \npremiums. This only adds to the many Kentuckians who have already seen \ntheir premiums spike under ObamaCare, like the retired police officer \nwhose premium increased to nearly $5,000 a year, which he ``simply \ncannot afford'' or the Kentuckian whose rate tripled, leaving him \nuninsured and leaving him to pay a fine at the end of the year.\n  Not surprisingly, the insurance industry's chief spokesperson--who is \na former top Obama administration official, by the way--is bracing the \npublic for even more premium increases in the year to come. The \nadministration's answer? More money from taxpayers. Whether they call \nit a risk corridor or a premium subsidy or a reinsurance mechanism, the \nsource is still the same, the American taxpayer.\n  So the bottom line is this: Americans continue to be unfairly hurt by \na health care law that was forced on them through backroom deals and is \nliterally littered with broken promises. Too many have seen their \npremiums and deductibles skyrocket. Too many have suffered from tax \nincreases and lost coverage. Now too many are set to face even fewer \nchoices and significant price hikes in the year to come.\n  Middle-class families have endured the broken promises and failures \nof ObamaCare for far too long. It is past time for Democrats to own up \nto the many disappointments of this law and help us move toward better \nhealth care policies for our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/senate-section/article/S2466-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I want to take just a minute to talk about \nthe tragedy that struck the Capitol Police yesterday. At 5 a.m., United \nStates Capitol Police Officer Pat Millham was working out in the gym. \nHe suffered a massive heart attack. Those who were present in the gym \nat the time rushed to his aid. They used a defibrillator three times \nbefore his heart started beating again. He was then flown to a nearby \nhospital and had surgery late last night.\n  He was revived. That is very good. He is a 28-year veteran of the \nCapitol Police. He has served in a variety of very important positions: \na member of the criminal investigations unit, academy instructor, and \nhe even worked on the hostage negotiation team.\n  He is an outstanding police officer by all accounts. The Department \nhas recognized his performance and honored Officer Millham with the \nService Medal and Commendation Award. He is well-liked by all of his \ncolleagues and has a great sense of humor. He is currently a member of \nthe Department's mountain bike patrol that we see around here. There \nare not a lot of mountains, but there are a lot of hills around this \nCapitol complex.\n  He is in very good shape. That is what you have to be to be a patrol \nofficer on a bicycle. That is what makes what happened yesterday so \nshocking. I cannot imagine what a difficult time it has been for Pat \nand his wife Heidi and their two children at college, Skylar and \nSavannah. Heidi recently retired from the United States Capitol Police.\n  I hope they know the entire Senate and House family wishes Officer \nMillham a speedy recovery, and I express my personal appreciation and \nadmiration to all of the Capitol Police for all they do and all the \npersonnel who make the Capitol Police jobs functional. We look forward \nto having Officer Millham back at full health very quickly.\n  Mr. President, where are we on what is happening on the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/senate-section/article/S2466-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have recently been talking quite a \nbit--because, frankly, unless we talk about it people won't know what \nhappened--about how productive we have been over the last year and a \nhalf in advancing legislation that benefits the American people, which \nis, of course, the reason why they sent us here.\n  I say we have been talking about it, because if we don't talk about \nit, maybe they will never learn, and even if we talked about it, some \nof them may never believe it. But the fact of the matter is that we \nneed to talk about what we are doing here for the people we represent.\n  Of course, nothing happens in the Senate or in Congress or in \nWashington unless it is done on a bipartisan basis. But leadership \nmatters. Leadership matters.\n  We have seen with the new Republican majority in the 114th Congress, \nunder Senator McConnell and Speaker Ryan now, that we have been able to \npass some important legislation. This includes legislation to combat \nthe epidemic of opioid abuse throughout our Nation. We passed an \nimportant piece of legislation called the Comprehensive\n\n[[Page S2467]]\n\nAddiction and Recovery Act to deal with it.\n  But I want to talk about another aspect of the prescription drug \nproblem or issue and reflect on some bipartisan legislation we passed 6 \nyears ago--obviously, with people on both sides of the aisle and in \nboth Chambers--when we came together to tackle another issue related to \nprescription drugs. This had to do with the fact that many prescription \ndrugs are filled. They will sit in medicine cabinets and perhaps be \nsubject to pilfering by people for whom they were not prescribed or be \ndisposed of in a way that is bad for the environment. We found that the \ngrowing use of prescription drugs for nonmedical uses is particularly a \nproblem among teenagers. When people take drugs for recreational or \nother purposes that have not been prescribed for them, unfortunately \nthe consequences can be fatal.\n\n  We noticed that some State and local law enforcement agencies have \nhad success with drug take-back programs. The programs allowed people \nto turn in their leftover prescription drugs, limiting the chances that \nthese drugs would get into the hands of someone who doesn't need them \nor that they would hurt them.\n  I remember in Austin, TX, shortly after we passed this legislation in \n2010, going to one of the locations where the take-back program was in \nuse, and people were bringing garbage sacks full of prescription drugs \nthey had in their home. In some instances, they had a relative who had \nbeen ill and passed away. They had all of these prescription drugs that \nwere sitting there, and they didn't know what to do with them. Do you \nflush them down the toilet? Do you put them in the garbage can? What do \nyou do? Fortunately, we provided a mechanism for people to deal with \nthese unneeded drugs.\n  We focused our efforts on making it easier for Federal agencies to \ntake and dispose of some of the most dangerous drugs, including \nopioids, and finding a way to encourage more communities to do the \nsame.\n  The legislation we passed in 2010 was the Secure and Responsible Drug \nDisposal Act, and it gave law enforcement officials the flexibility \nthey need to be able to build these programs. Like most legislation \nnobody has ever heard of, it passed Congress unanimously. But just \nbecause we didn't fight like cats and dogs doesn't mean it is not \nworthwhile. I am thankful that this week we will be able to highlight \nthe importance of legislation like this to address our Nation's \nprescription drug epidemic.\n  Today, folks on Capitol Hill can hand in any unused prescription \nmedication they have as part of Federal take-back day. That is today. \nOn Saturday, we will get a chance to see this in action across the \ncountry through the National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day. Take-back \ndays not only highlight the problem of prescription drug abuse, they \nhelp local communities take control of the problem by rallying the \ncommunity to turn in drugs that are either unwanted or expired and to \nmake sure they are safely disposed of.\n  I look forward to going back home to Texas for national take-back day \nthis weekend, where I will have a chance to join local law enforcement \nand city leaders in Dallas and Austin and Walgreens pharmacy--all \nworking together to help highlight this important initiative. I \nencourage all of my colleagues to do the same.\n\n\n                   United States-Mexico Relationship\n\n  Mr. President, separately, I want to talk for a moment about another \nmatter of importance, and that is the importance of our Nation's \nrelationship with our neighbor to the south. Coming from Texas, which \nhas 1,200 miles of common border with Mexico, I often observe that this \nis a relationship from which we cannot get a divorce. We are bound \ntogether as countries, contiguous countries, and frankly our well-being \ndepends in part on how well Mexico is doing. We know that Mexico, like \nthe United States, has its own unique challenges.\n  As the largest exporting State in the country, Texas exported $95 \nbillion worth of goods to Mexico just last year--$95 billion to Mexico \njust last year. In fact, Mexico is our largest export market, and it is \nthe second largest export market of the United States. The truth is, \nMexico and its economy are very important to our economy and how we do \nas a country.\n  In today's globalized world, we must continue to support our economic \npartnership with Mexico and find ways to build on it and certainly not \ndo anything to undermine it. That is why I prioritized efforts such as \nthe Cross-Border Trade and Enhancement Act, legislation I have \nintroduced with my colleague in the House, a Democrat by the name of \nHenry Cuellar. I worked with him a lot on border-related and especially \ntrade-related issues. This bill would help reduce wait times and \nupgrade infrastructure at our border ports of entry.\n  I bet most people don't realize that the single largest land port of \nentry into the United States is Laredo, TX. If you come with me to \nLaredo sometime, you will see semis and tractor-trailers stacked up \nliterally for hours trying to get across the International Bridge, \nengaging in the kind of trade that helps support American jobs and \nhelps our economy.\n  It is important that we move goods and people more efficiently, \nsafely, and legally, and grow our trading relationships with partners \nlike Mexico. The fact is, 6 million American jobs depend on binational \ntrade with Mexico--things we send there and things they send here. A \nlot of the jobs that used to go to China because they could produce \nthings in a manufacturing process that was cheaper because of lower \nwages and the like--because of the benefit of the proximity of Mexico, \nmany of the maquiladoras and other manufacturing facilities in Mexico \nare integral to North American manufacturing.\n  Our relationship with Mexico, as complicated as it can sometimes be, \ngoes well beyond impressive trade statistics. Mexico is a key partner \nfor the United States as we work to keep our country safe and to help \nthem deal with the challenges they have from a law enforcement \nstandpoint.\n  Mexico is critical to our joint goals of countering and interdicting \nillegal substances entering the United States from across the border. \nWe know the supply is huge, and unfortunately the demand in the United \nStates is huge, and our Mexican friends always remind us of that. Every \ntime we are critical of them, they say: Well, if it weren't for the \ndemand in the United States, the supply wouldn't be there. They have a \npoint.\n  We have also worked with Mexico in trying to stem the tide of illegal \nimmigration. I know most people may not quite accept that, but the fact \nis, Mexico has stepped up and dealt with immigration across its \nsouthern border from countries such as in Central America--some of the \nmost challenging environments in this hemisphere. We have seen that \nmanifested in the tens of thousands of unaccompanied children who come \nfrom Central America, across Mexico, and into the United States, ending \nup on our doorstep. But Mexico has worked with us to try to stem that \nflow of illegal immigration from Central America.\n  We have worked together to try to help make sure our border is not an \neasy target for terrorists and other bad actors seeking entry to our \ncountry.\n  There is no doubt that these shared challenges are just that--\nchallenging. But what should be crystal clear to all of us is that we \ncan't address them without working with Mexico. We can't ignore it. As \nI said earlier, we can't get a divorce. We have to work this out \nbecause our futures are joined together in many important respects. \nThat is why I say that the success of the United States depends in part \non Mexico's success, and we should diligently look for ways to grow \nthat partnership for the good of both countries. One practical way we \ncan do that is by confirming a U.S. Ambassador to represent us in \nMexico City.\n  Roberta Jacobson was nominated last summer, and I believe she is \nqualified to represent us in this key relationship. Our bilateral \nrelationship is simply too important to the people of Texas and to the \npeople of the United States to leave this position unfilled. We have to \nget somebody representing the United States in Mexico City to advocate \non behalf of the United States for all of the reasons I mentioned \nearlier--trade, security, immigration. Otherwise, I don't think we are \ngoing to be able to make the kind of progress we all would like to see, \nand we certainly can't afford to let our relationship with Mexico go \nstagnant. That is one of the risks of not having an ambassador there.\n\n[[Page S2468]]\n\n  I was really glad to hear my friend, the junior Senator from Florida, \ncall the U.S.-Mexico relationship one of the most important ones we \nhave. He said that yesterday on the floor. I share his optimism that \nthis impasse over the confirmation of Ms. Jacobson can be resolved \nsoon. I certainly think it is time we come together to move her \nnomination forward. Here in the waning days of the Obama \nadministration, it is very important that we have this important \nambassadorship filled for all of the reasons I mentioned earlier.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time in \nquorum calls until 12 noon be evenly divided between the two parties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This is the first appropriations bill of the year. \nIt is the earliest date an appropriations bill has been acted on in the \nSenate since 1974. If it goes through in the regular order, it will be \nthe first Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill that has \ndone so since 2009. More than 80 Senators have contributed policy \nsuggestions and amendments to the bill on both sides of the aisle. In \naddition to that, we have dealt with 17 amendments on the floor. Now we \nare ready to end debate and move in our process toward a final solution \non the bill.\n  I believe this bill was put on the floor because Senator Feinstein \nand I have a good history of working together, and the expectation was \nthat we would find a way to do that. Let me say the problem--and I will \nleave time for Senator Feinstein or the Democratic leader or perhaps \nSenator Cotton or others who may want to say something.\n  An issue has arisen over an amendment offered by Senator Cotton. He \ndid that after the administration made an announcement over the weekend \nthat it would be purchasing heavy water from Iran. Heavy water by \nitself is not much. It is just water. It is in drums. It doesn't hurt \nanybody. It is not dangerous. It is distilled water, and it is used \nprimarily for two reasons: one, for scientific instruments--we use it \nfor fiber optics and other scientific reasons--and it can be used to \nmake plutonium. So it was a part of the agreement between the United \nStates and Iran.\n  Senator Cotton--and I will characterize his amendment with his \npermission--sought to do two things. One was to say you couldn't use \nany appropriated funds for the fiscal year 2017--the one we are working \non now--to buy more heavy water from Iran. The second thing he sought \nwas to do something about Iran's business of selling heavy water. What \nwould the implications be about that for our own national security? \nRemember, this is a decision by the U.S. Department of Energy that was \nannounced over the weekend without any notification to the chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee or to the Intelligence Committee or to \nthe Armed Services Committee. So you have a U.S. Senator who is on the \nball, and he says: OK, this is an issue I would like to do something \nabout.\n  Our friends on the other side have raised an objection, especially \nSenator Feinstein, for whom I have the greatest respect. So today, in \ntalking with the Democratic leaders, I asked: May I talk with Senator \nCotton and see if he will modify his amendment in a way that might be \nacceptable so that we can go on with the appropriations process and not \nblow it up?\n  It was blown up last year because we put controversial water language \nin the bill, and instead of bringing it to the floor and voting on it \nand letting the President veto it and then bringing it back, the \nDemocrat majority decided we just wouldn't bring the bill to the floor.\n  This year I talked to the Democratic leaders. They wrote Senator \nMcConnell a letter, and we all agreed to try to have an appropriations \nprocess. What they said to me was, no controversial riders in \ncommittee. So I went through my whole committee with Senator Feinstein, \nand we persuaded many Senators to leave their controversial amendments \noff the bill in committee, and we said to them: You can bring them up \non the floor when they have 60 votes. If you can get 60 votes, you can \nput it in the bill, and if the President of the United States doesn't \nlike it, he can veto it. Then it takes 67 votes to override it.\n  Here we are, early in the process in April, moving ahead, and all of \na sudden I understand that the Democratic minority is going to block us \nfrom going forward because they don't like the Cotton amendment.\n  Let me say this, Mr. President, and I will stop my remarks. I think \nSenator Cotton has acted responsibly. He acted as soon as he knew about \nthe Department of Energy's decision. He has listened to the objections \nthat were raised by the other side. He has amended his own bill. He has \noffered for it to be adopted by voice vote. He has offered for it to be \nvoted on at 60 votes.\n  As I said, he has modified it. He has completely taken out the part \nthat could limit American businesses from getting licenses to buy heavy \nwater from Iran. That is to be discussed at a later time. He has left \nin only the part that says you can't use fiscal year 2017 money to buy \nheavy water from Iran. But the Department can use prior year \nappropriated money, and it can use revolving fund money. It can buy all \nthe heavy water Iran has if this President or the next President wants \nto. I think that is a very reasonable step, and I would ask the \nDemocratic leader and the whip and Senator Feinstein, all of whom I \nwork with very well and for whom I have great respect, if they are \ndetermined to block the bill at noon. But let's keep talking about this \nbecause I think it is the basic constitutional framework of our U.S. \nSenate to do our job on appropriations, and Senators should be allowed \nto offer germane amendments.\n  When confronted with an objection on the other side, if they say \n``well, 60 votes'' or ``voice vote'' or ``I will modify my amendment,'' \nthat ought to be respected, and we should go ahead. Then if the \nPresident at the end still feels he wants to veto the bill, that is the \nway our process works. He vetoes it.\n  If we don't do this, we are going to end up with an omnibus bill. \nSenators won't have a chance to participate in it, and then the \nPresident will have to veto it in an omnibus bill at the end of the \nyear. That is not the kind of process that earns the respect of the \nAmerican people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have the deepest respect, without any \nquestion, for the Senator from Tennessee, who is my friend, and, of \ncourse, Senator Feinstein is already legendary as a figure in \nDemocratic politics and politics of this country. But I have some \nreservation, for lack of a better description, about my friend, the \nsenior Senator from Tennessee talking about the appropriations process.\n  I was on the Appropriations Committee from the first day I came to \nthe Senate, and I loved my service on the Appropriations Committee. For \nthe last 8 years under President Obama, the Republicans have done \neverything they could--I am trying to find a pleasant word--to mess up \nthe appropriations process--everything.\n  For those who understand the Senate, everyone should know we didn't \nask that there be cloture on a motion to proceed. We are as cooperative \nas we can be on everything we have done during the time we have been in \nthe minority, which is more than a year now.\n  I would suggest to my friend that cloture will not be invoked on this \nbill\n\n[[Page S2469]]\n\nin 2 or 3 minutes. If there is some proposal that the Republicans want \nto come back with that is reasonable and doesn't have a poison pill in \nit, fine; we are willing to move forward on this. For someone to give \nme the statement ``Well, you know, it is germane''--the world is \ngermane on this bill. I did this bill for 15 years. I did it. I know \nwhat is in this bill. Just about everything is germane. They have all \nkinds of defense stuff, energy and water--it is a big, big important \nbill, and this amendment by the Senator from Arkansas is nothing more \nthan an effort to sidetrack the work we are doing here.\n  The Republicans are in the majority. I hope that it doesn't last that \nlong, but that is where we are. It is up to them to move this process \nforward. We have tried our best to cooperate.\n  I suggest to my friend from Tennessee to see what happens and come \nback with something this afternoon. We have said on many occasions over \nthe last 24 hours, we will vote right now on final passage of the \nbill--as it stood before this amendment was offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. COTTON. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, as the Senator from Tennessee has said, \nthe administration announced that they were purchasing heavy water from \nIran on Friday night. On the first legislative day back on Monday, I \nproposed an amendment which is germane to the bill and thereby entitled \nto a simple majority threshold vote.\n  I have offered to give a voice vote to the Democrats so they don't \nhave a record vote. I have offered to put it at a 60-vote threshold \nbecause there are 60 Senators who do not believe that the U.S. \ntaxpayers should be subsidizing Iran's heavy water industry.\n  This morning, as Senator Alexander said, I offered to revise my \namendment, yet here we are. The Democrats are going to vote no on \ncloture, objecting to an amendment that is not pending and is not \nincluded in this legislation.\n  I, too, do not want to see the appropriations process end. I want to \npass this bill. I want to move on to the next appropriations bill, and \nI am committed to continue working in good faith with the Senator from \nTennessee and the Senator from California to try to reach some \nsolution, whether on this bill or any other, that we can move forward \non in an orderly fashion and pass all of our appropriations bills, as \nwell as ensure that the U.S. taxpayer is not subsidizing a critical \ncomponent of Iran's nuclear industry, which, I may add, we are not \nrequired to do under the nuclear agreement with Iran.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I speak for a few minutes prior to the cloture \nvote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, we have the Democratic leader on the \nfloor and the chairman of the Energy and Water Development \nAppropriations Subcommittee. I want him, particularly, to know how very \nmuch it has meant to me to work with him to try to reverse the \ndeterioration of order of this body.\n  That deterioration of order was the inability to pass an \nappropriations bill on its own and go back to what is called regular \norder. I have watched the Appropriations Committee lose prestige over \nthe years. I have watched something happen that never happened in the \nearly years. Members would vote for a bill in committee. They would \ncome out, and they would sustain it on the floor.\n  So the Appropriations Committee gained, I think, a prestige and an \nhonor in this body. I think it has been very wounded. So the ability of \nSenator Alexander, my chairman, and myself to try to restore that order \nby sitting down and working out problems--and seeing that he gives, I \ngive, we put together a bill, and we believe that bill can get through \nthis body and that we can conference that bill successfully--is a \nreally big deal to change the nature of this body, and we can show that \nwe can get our job done.\n  Well, into this climate, which is so amicable and so positive, comes \nan amendment. I go to the White House. I pick up the phone. I call the \nChief of Staff. I say: This is an amendment. It may affect the Iran \ndeal. I would like to know what the administration's position is. The \nword back is that the administration will veto this bill if these words \nare in it.\n  So I began to learn a little bit about heavy water--what it is and \nwhat it is not--and how this all came about. So I understand the \nadministration's problem with it, because it destroys something they \nare trying to do with the Iran agreement; that is, to show Iran a legal \npathway with which it can proceed to go into the family of nations in a \nmoderate way.\n  Iran happens to have a foreign minister whom I have known for at \nleast 15 years. I know he believes in this Iranian agreement. I know he \nwanted to take Iran in another direction. I know it because he proposed \nan earlier plan when he was Ambassador to the United Nations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent for such time as I may \nconsume. I will be short.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I have no objection if I can have the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. So, to make a long story short, this body discussed \nthe joint agreement. We agreed that the President should go ahead and \nimplement this agreement. Now, there are difficult problems because \nIran is emerging and wanting to come into the family of nations in a \npositive way. They have to get this heavy water out. The heavy water is \nout. It is sitting in a store room in Oman.\n  Iran desires to sell it, just as India sells heavy water. Canada has \nsold heavy water to us. That heavy water is used for peaceful purposes, \nas the chairman said, for fiber optics, for medical research. Our \nNational Labs are interested in it, and there are many companies that \nwould use it to improve fiber optics and that kind of thing.\n  So it is a way of removing proliferation from the country. This is \nsuddenly on our Energy and Water bill. I believe we have the votes to \nnot enter into cloture at this time. I guess what I want to say is my \nvery deep regret to my chairman. I don't want it to end this way. I \nwant us to continue to work together. I truly believe that there is \nmore in the interests of this country that we can do appropriations \nbills in regular order, with concurrence on both sides of the aisle, \nthan the value of this amendment.\n  This amendment has raised hackles all over. So why can't it be left \nfor another day? Why does it need to be on an appropriations bill? Why \ncan't we have the ability to do one bill in this body that does not \nhave a poison pill on it, to set an example for future bills? This was \nthe bill--Senator Alexander and I both know that--that was supposed to \ndo that. Why can't a Member see this? Maybe he is a new Member. Maybe \nhe does not understand what the years have been like.\n  Why can't he wait for another time? I have been here 24 years. I have \nwaited for another time plenty of times, because someone said: Your \namendment won't go well with the bill. Don't do it now. We may help you \nlater.\n  I did it. Why destroy our chances? Because that is exactly what is \nhappening.\n  So I just want Chairman Alexander to know how very sad I am that we \nare at this point. I believe it is not necessary to be at this point. I \nbelieve we could show that we could do it. I would say that if cloture \nis not granted, we stand ready to continue to work to try to get a \nbill. But I would so appreciate it if a new Member could recognize this \nand say: Oh, I wanted to do this. It is my right to do it.\n  All of that I admit, but what you are doing is going to disturb our \neffort to produce a series of appropriations bills without poison pill \nriders.\n  I will predict that there will be more on other bills. Our effort, \nwhich the majority leader began with the Democratic leader--was to be \nable to put together a process where we could produce bills.\n  Please, think about that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n[[Page S2470]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I will make brief concluding remarks \nand then we can vote. We are not debating the Iran agreement here \ntoday. This is the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill of \nthe Appropriations Committee. We are not even debating the Cotton \namendment. It is not even part of the bill. Senator Cotton has filed an \namendment that could be part of the bill if the Senate decides to adopt \nit in our debate after we adopt cloture. He has done that.\n  Just to repeat, over the weekend, the U.S. Department of Energy, \nwithout any consultation with anybody in the Senate that I know about--\nwithout the Intelligence, Armed Services, or Foreign Relations \nCommittees--decided it was going to buy heavy water from Iran. The \nSenator from Arkansas introduced an amendment on the subject.\n  My understanding of the way the Senate is supposed to work is that we \nsave the controversial amendments for the floor. If you can get 60 \nvotes, you pass them. Then, as Senators, if the issue is an important \nissue about which we disagree, we vote on it and we accept the vote. \nSometimes we win, and sometimes we lose.\n  We also listen to each other. So if the other side says this is an \nespecially difficult issue for us, we try to accommodate that. So the \nSenator from Arkansas has said that he will take 60 votes, although he \nis entitled to 51. He can force a 51-vote vote on this issue if he \nchose to do that, under parliamentary rules.\n  He said: I will take a voice vote. He does not have to do that. Then \nthis morning he said: I will modify my amendment. I will eliminate all \nof the part about licenses. That is the second sentence of this very \nsimple amendment. We will reserve that for discussion by the Armed \nServices, Foreign Relations, and other committees. So all that his \namendment says is that you can't use money from this fiscal year to buy \nheavy water from Iran--except that the Department of Energy has \npotentially millions of dollars it could use from other years to do \nthat, and it has a revolving fund it could use.\n  In effect, if this President or the next President wanted to continue \nto buy heavy water from Iran, it could do so. So I think the Senator \nfrom Arkansas is entirely within his rights, whether he has been here 2 \nyears or 20 years. I think he is entitled to come up and ask for a \nvote. I think he has bent over backwards in offering three or four \ndifferent ways to accommodate the concerns of the others.\n  I think it would be a real shame if we came up with yet one more \nreason not to have an appropriations bill after we have done all of \nthis work, 80 Senators have made their contributions, and we have \nadopted 17 amendments.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I enter a motion to reconsider the \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I think we have come up with yet \nanother definition of obstruction today. Our Democratic friends are \ngoing to prevent the passage of an energy and water appropriations bill \nbecause of an amendment that is not yet pending to the bill in yet a \nnew way to blow up the appropriations process.\n  Our Democratic colleagues were great at dysfunction when they were in \nthe majority, and they are pretty good at it when they are in the \nminority. No matter what the issue--no matter what the issue--there is \nsome new and creative way to try and throw a monkey wrench into the \ngears.\n  I heard over and over and over again that there was broad support on \nboth sides of the aisle for getting the appropriations process moving \nagain. The Senator from Arkansas has been extraordinarily reasonable. \nHe has offered to modify his amendment. He has offered to consider it \nin some other context. Our chairman, Senator Alexander, has been \nworking on this for 24 hours. It ought not to be this hard to pass an \nenergy and water appropriations bill that would be good for the country \nand that most of us support.\n  So I just moved to reconsider my vote, and we need to continue to \ntalk about this because this is a ridiculous place for the Senate to \nbe--ridiculous. We are all adults. We have all been elected by the \npeople of our various States to come and act responsibly.\n  We are not going to give up on this bill, and when we finish this \nbill, we will go to a couple more appropriations bills. I think we have \na collective responsibility in the Senate--Democrats and Republicans--\nto work our way past this snag and figure out the way forward, so we \nwill have time to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I would like to say a word in response \nfrom the Democratic side.\n  First, I cannot think of two colleagues I admire more than Senator \nAlexander and Senator Feinstein. They are honorable people. It has been \na pleasure to work with them and even to consider issues where we \nopposed one another because I knew it would be done in a professional \nand courteous way. They have spent more hours than I can calculate \nconstructing one of the most important appropriations bills--the Energy \nand Water appropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S2471]]\n\n  This bill was brought to the floor first by Senator McConnell for \ngood reason. We wanted to set a template, a model, for finishing the \nappropriations process, and I respect that. I have been honored to \nserve on the House Committee on Appropriations and now on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, and I think it is a very important \nassignment. It has been many years since we have done our work in the \nway it was supposed to be done.\n  Without a budget resolution, we took the budget agreement, moved \nforward with the bills. There were countless opportunities for the \nminority, the Democrats, to slow down this process, to make it more \ndifficult, to make it more complicated, and to demand votes and delays \nof 30 hours after 30 hours. We did not do that because we were trying \nto be positive and constructive.\n  I will not reflect on our experience in the majority, but I would say \nin response to the Republican leader, they broke the record in terms of \nfilibusters on the floor of the Senate when the Republicans were in the \nminority. We don't want to go back to that era and we don't want to \n``get even.'' That isn't what this is about.\n  There were basically two or three things guiding us in the process \nthat I thought everyone signed up for, and I believe they did. One of \nthem was balance between defense and nondefense spending overall; \nsecond, that each one of the bills hits a number that can be explained \nand rationalized based on the budget agreement; and third, the \ncontentious issue of poison pills. These are subjects that are so \ncontroversial that if they are included in a bill, it becomes \nimpossible to either pass it on the floor or expect the President to \nsign it.\n  So we thought, if we are going to exercise our opportunity with an \nappropriations process that works, those three things have to apply. I \ngive credit to both Senator Alexander and Senator Feinstein for \nproducing a bill in subcommittee that met those tests and didn't \ninclude any great controversial items, going through full committee \nwith exactly the same outcome, and bringing it to the floor.\n  We were this close to the finish line--this close to the finish \nline--when yesterday the Senator from Arkansas, as is his right to do, \noffered an amendment. That amendment was offered around noon yesterday \nand the whole conversation changed. It was an amendment related to the \nDepartment of Energy, yes, but it was an amendment of great controversy \nbecause it was an amendment related to the President's agreement with \nIran to stop them from the development of nuclear weapons.\n  Everyone knows what that was about. Every Republican opposed the \nPresident's agreement and four of ours on the Democratic side. It was a \nhighly controversial and volatile subject for many months and continues \nto be on the Presidential trail. To bring this amendment into the bill \nat the last moment, as it was, is to invite a debate and a controversy \nwhich was not in the bill up to that point.\n  Now, was it the right of the Senator from Arkansas to do it? Yes. But \nI would just say that my experience in appropriations is, you would say \nto your colleague who had the right to offer an amendment: Let me just \nsay in advance, this is going to slow down--it may even stop this bill. \nAfter all the work we have put into it, please don't offer that \namendment, and if you do, I will have to oppose it.\n  Those are the basics for kind of going forward on a bipartisan basis \nto bring this bill to a conclusion.\n  We just had a procedural vote, and a few Republicans joined us, but \nthe overwhelming majority of Democrats said we can't move forward on \nthe bill until we resolve this basic question: If Senators will be \nallowed to offer amendments on the floor that are relevant to the bill \nand are controversial, we invite poison pills up to the very last \nmoment when a bill can be considered.\n  There has to be a better way. We have to prove to America that we can \nget things done in its best interests. That means some Senators cannot \noffer every amendment they would like to offer. That is just part of \nthe restraint which we ask of Members who are consciously trying to \nhelp us be constructive in the Senate.\n  I hope we can get back on track. The conversations are civil, as they \nshould be between honorable people who are trying to work this out, and \nthey need to continue. The underlying bill is very important. It is \nimportant to my State and to many other States. But let's finish this \nbill in the right way, in a bipartisan fashion, in a calm fashion, not \nin a confrontational fashion. We can do that. I am sorry we can't do it \nthis morning. I hope we will all work together to achieve that goal as \nquickly as possible.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I would like to compliment my colleague \nfrom Illinois. He hit the nail on the head. I will be brief.\n  The Republican leader said this is a new level of obstruction. I \ndon't know if it is a new level of obstruction; he has been pretty good \nat it over the years. But certainly, if we wanted to obstruct these \nbills, we wouldn't have let the motion to proceed go forward. We would \nhave done 17 other things that were done time and time again in the \npast.\n  The way to stop this, I would say to the Republican leader, is very \nsimple: Either prevail on Senator Cotton not to offer his amendment--no \none is doing that. He has a right to do it. But in the old days, as \nSenator Durbin said, the way the appropriations process worked, the \nchair of the subcommittee would say: Don't offer your amendment because \nit will be defeated and we will help defeat it because it will blow up \nthe bill. Plain and simple. That is still an option.\n  We didn't offer the Cotton amendment. We could have offered our \nversion of Cotton amendments to blow up this bill. We did not. Whether \nor not that was his intent--and I will not doubt the sincerity of my \nfriend from Arkansas. But it was offered by the other side, and the \nonus is on the other side to fix this. The way to fix it is one of two: \nEither prevail on the Senator from Arkansas to pursue his goal here--\nthat is certainly his right, but don't do it using the appropriations \nprocess as a hostage to move forward on his bill--or tell him that if \nhe offers the bill, Republicans will vote against it as well. Then we \ncan move forward.\n  That was how it used to work. When I was a junior Member and I wanted \nto offer amendments, some of them controversial, I would go to our \nchair or ranking member--depending on whether we were in the majority \nor minority--and say: I want to offer this amendment. The chair would \nconsult with the other side, and they would come back and say: We, the \nmajority/minority, cannot support this amendment. Then I wouldn't offer \nit. It would lose. That is the way the process used to work.\n  I don't begrudge any individual--the centrifugal forces in our \npolitics have pulled things apart, so it is much harder for Members on \nboth sides of the aisle to do it. But let's not turn that around. The \nobstruction and the failure to deal with obstruction is not coming from \nthis side, it is coming from the other side, and they have an onus to \nfix it.\n  One more point before my good friend--and I love him--from Tennessee \ncomes forward. Whatever we did, the President said he was going to veto \nthis. So the idea that this bill would go forward and we would spend \nall this time on it and then have the President veto it--that doesn't \naccomplish the goals that I know my good friends, the chair of the \nsubcommittee and the ranking member of the subcommittee, want to \npursue. The onus is on us to do it before we get to that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of Senator \nSchumer, Senator Durbin, and Senator Feinstein, for whom I have great \nrespect.\n  The people who can figure this out are on the floor, and we ought to \nbe able to, is the bottom line. I suspect a big part of the problem is \ntiming. The administration apparently decided to do this over the \nweekend. We are in the middle of this bill. Senator Cotton would say \nthat he moved as quickly as he could. And there is no question that \nthis is an issue which raises lots of temperatures on both sides of the \naisle. There is no doubt about that.\n\n[[Page S2472]]\n\n  We have to have a balance. Senators have a right to take important \nissues and present them in an appropriate way here in the Senate. In \njust this bill, there are several times when I was one of only one or \ntwo or three Republicans who voted for amendments just so we could get \nthe amendments through and we could keep the bill going. I know how \nthat works, and I intend to keep doing it.\n  But I would say to my Democratic friends: I hope we can put our minds \ntogether and think of some way to allow Senator Cotton to make his \npoint, to achieve what is an important objective and do it in a way \nthat, A, is acceptable to the Democratic side, and B, doesn't have the \nproblems that are associated with the timing. This came up on us all of \na sudden. There are several reasons for that which we don't need to go \ninto, but let's see if we can't work it out. I would certainly like to \ndo that. I would like for Senator Feinstein and myself to be able to \nset a good example for the rest of the Senate and get our bill through.\n  The only other thing I would say that is a little different from what \nthe Senators from New York and Illinois said is that I don't really \nagree that if the President threatens a veto, we should stop our work. \nI think we would only be here about half a day a week. It is fine for \nthe President to veto a bill if he feels he needs to, and he can send \nit right back. We consider that and we consider that it takes 67 to \noverride it, and what often happens is we take something out or change \nsome provision and send it back to him. So just because the President \nsays he will veto a bill I don't think means the Senate should stop its \nwork.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Of course.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I understand that every time the President says \n``veto,'' we shouldn't freeze in our tracks, but it would be a lot \nbetter if we could avoid that situation because we want this bill to \npass and be signed into law.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I agree with the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I will not weigh in on this issue, but I \nmight later. I am here for a different purpose. I did serve previously \nin the Senate several years ago, and this is my second time back. My \nexperience with the amendment process was a pleasant one then. Any \nSenator at any time could offer an amendment to any bill, and it would \nbe discussed and debated and voted on, and we accepted the fact that it \nwas either a yea or a nay. It was part of a process that sometimes \nstarted here, sometimes started in the House, but it is a process that \ngoes through many iterations.\n  So to determine that something at one step in the process takes the \nbill down ignores the fact that this bill will go over to the House of \nRepresentatives; they will debate it, and they will add things and \nsubtract things; and then we will go to a conference to resolve the \ndifferences even before it gets to the President's desk.\n  Unfortunately, what has happened here is that on anything the \nPresident of the United States doesn't like, he simply says: I am going \nto veto it, so drop it.\n  So I agree with the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander, in saying \nthat if that is the process and the way this Senate is going to \noperate, we might as well just close the place down. We can maybe show \nup just to show people that we showed up for work. But we are not going \nto accomplish anything on this floor if that is the case.\n  The responsibility falls not just on us to do the job we were elected \nto do but also falls on the President to not try to torpedo a bill--\nthere are multiple dimensions--because one amendment gets passed with \nthe will of the Senate, including bipartisan support, but the President \ndoesn't like it and therefore shuts the whole thing down.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Madam President, I am here for the 40th-something week to talk about \nthe waste of the week, and I will do that now. The other issue is being \nvery ably handled by Senator Alexander, who is a veteran here and knows \nhow to work through these conundrums.\n  With a Federal debt that is over $19 trillion and growing, it is \nfitting to take a long look at every penny the Federal Government \nappropriates to ensure that hard-earned taxpayer dollars are not \nwasted. I have been down here week after week with examples of waste.\n  Today, for my 41st edition of ``Waste of the Week,'' I would like to \nbring attention to an app the Transportation Security Administration \npaid IBM more than $47,000 to develop. ``App'' is a new word in our \nlexicon. We all carry around these new devices with which we can push a \nbunch of buttons and, by certain applications, access or do things that \nmake life easier: monitor traffic on the road, getting the latest \nballgame scores, checking on the weather. I have a whole bunch of apps \non here.\n  I heard about an app that had been developed for the Transportation \nSecurity Administration called a randomizer app, and it does just two \nthings. Very simply, it points an arrow to the right or to the left. \nNow, we might say, why would anybody need an app--a device--that \nrandomizes an arrow to the right or an arrow to the left? Well, let's \ntake a look at this picture here.\n  This is obviously a TSA agent. We have all been through this. This is \na line at the airport. Those of us who go home every weekend--I go back \nto Indiana on Thursday night or Friday--are very familiar with these \nlines because we have to go through the security process.\n  This is a TSA agent using this app. As we can see, it is a screen and \nit has a big arrow.\n  When you walk through Reagan National Airport to go home every week--\nas I know the Presiding Officer does to go back to Iowa--there are \nseveral lanes you can go down. Almost always there is a transportation \nsecurity agent or someone associated with the process standing at the \nbeginning of the lines and, with an arrow, saying ``Take this one'' or \n``Take that one.'' Well, I don't know about the details, but for some \nreason, they didn't want that to be an individual decision, so they \ncalled up IBM and said: We need to develop an app that will allow us to \nhave a screen that has an arrow pointing to the left or to the right. \nAnd it needs to be random; it can't be controlled by this person.\n  For whatever reason, it needs to be random. OK. Maybe there is a \nrational reason TSA needs to do that for security purposes, and without \ndivulging what that is or knowing what that is, I won't get into that, \nbut obviously it doesn't take a lot of money to develop a screen that \nhas an arrow to the left, an arrow to the right, and a little bit of \nsoftware running in the background randomizing so that you can't figure \nout whether it is going to be left or right. It does it all by itself.\n  I wondered, how much would this cost? So we did a little research. \nWhat we found is that this is such a simple application that it can be \ndeveloped by a developer of apps within a 10-minute period of time.\n  So taxpayers paid $47,000 to build an app that had an arrow pointing \none way or the other. Now, $47,000 is minuscule compared to what we \nwaste around here, and I have a chart here that shows well over $160 \nbillion of waste, fraud, and abuse tallied up during my 40 visits to \nthe Senate floor to talk about the various ways the government wastes \ntaxpayer dollars. But this one baffles me because something which is so \nsimple and which takes 10 minutes to produce costs $47,000--well above \nthe average income for the average worker in Indiana and in many cases \nsignificantly more than the TSA agent who is holding it is paid \nannually for the work they do.\n  So here we are once again. People might ask: Well, could we have done \nthis in an easier way? Well, how about flipping a coin? That is random. \nTails, go in this lane; heads, you are in this lane. How about drawing \nfrom a hat? The TSA person standing at the line can have a hat with a \nwhole bunch of slips of paper in it that say ``left'' and ``right.'' Go \nahead, put your hand in, and pull it out.\n  What does it say?\n  Left.\n  That is over there.\n  What does it say?\n  Right.\n  That is over here.\n  Maybe we can do what I do with my grandkids. I put my fists behind my\n\n[[Page S2473]]\n\nback, and I will have one or two fingers extended. They all get excited \nand so forth. The brother is elbowing his little sister so she won't \nwin, and the third child is crying, maybe, because they are not letting \nher play.\n  So I say: OK, Charlie, is it a one or a two?\n  Two.\n  Charlie: Yay, I won.\n  His sister starts crying.\n  No, no. You are going to get your chance.\n  All right, Maggie, you pick a one or a two.\n  Anyway, we may go through each. I have 10 grandkids, so this takes a \nlong time when we have family reunions.\n  Any one of those processes could be used, and I don't think it would \ncost $47,000. It wouldn't be $4.70. It is just something we could do.\n  I used to serve as the lead Republican on the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Homeland Security. I know how difficult it is for the \nHomeland Security Subcommittee to fund the critical elements they need \nto fund and the programs they need to fund in order to keep us secure. \nEvery penny counts, and every dollar counts in this regard.\n  This type of egregious waste has got to stop. Perhaps it is time for \nTSA to precheck--we are all familiar with precheck, another thing we \nhave to go through--these programs before we fund them. As we continue \nto determine funding levels for various government programs and \nagencies, we must remember projects such as TSA's randomizer app. This \nis yet another example of why minimizing waste, fraud, and abuse will \ngo a long way to restore trust in government decisions as to how our \ntax money is spent.\n  I just realized I missed out on naming one of my grandchildren who I \nplay this with, and that is Avery--the sister of Charlie--who wants to \nmake sure that she is in the game also. I will not go through the other \nseven. I will save those for another time.\n  Let me note that we add more money--ever more money and examples of \ntaxpayer waste. We are up to $162,277,955,817. This is big money. It is \nnothing to laugh about. This is a small example. We have had examples \nin the billions of dollars. We owe it to the taxpayer. We owe it to the \nhard-earned tax dollars that are earned by hard-working taxpayers to be \nas efficient and effective with the spending of their money as we \npossibly can. Once again, this is the waste of the week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Fighting Wildfires\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, according to the Forest Service--and we \nchecked with them this morning--there is right now an 11,000-acre fire \nburning in the Shenandoah National Park in Virginia. This is just \nApril, not the time when one normally thinks you are going to have \nfires when the fire season is on. But there is a fire burning in the \nShenandoah National Park in Virginia that has already cost more than $3 \nmillion. This is the second largest fire in Shenandoah National Park \nhistory.\n  I have come to the floor this afternoon to once again make the case \nfor the Senate, on a bipartisan basis--Democrats and Republicans--to \ncome together to fix this dysfunctional system of fighting fire in \nAmerica. I am going to describe it, but let me talk first a little bit \nabout the consequences.\n  In the American West, we used to talk about the seasons in a way that \nAmericans had done for decades and decades: harvesting crops in the \nfall, skiing in the winter, fishing during the spring salmon runs, and \ncamping in the summers. We fought fire during the wildfire season. But \nwhen Americans in the West talk about the seasons now, they are talking \nabout the seasons of yesteryear. That is because the wildfire season \nraging across our forests and special places is no longer limited to a \nsingle time of the year.\n  Fighting fires has become a continuous battle virtually year-round \nthroughout the country. That is why this fire burning in the Shenandoah \nNational Park ought to be a wake-up call once again to everyone to \nunderstand how important it is to fix this broken system of fighting \nfire, because the funding system for doing so is leading to dysfunction \nthroughout the Forest Service and contributing to the breakdown of the \nnational forest management that is needed to prevent catastrophic \nwildfires in the first place.\n  According to the Forest Service, 1.4 million acres have already \nburned across America this year. That is more than twice the 10-year \naverage for this time of year. These numbers show, in my view, how \nimportant it is that urgent action be taken to fix the way we fund \nwildfire fighting operations. This is something that Senator Crapo and \nI have been working on for some time.\n  With the support of scores of organizations, well over 200, a \nsignificant number of bipartisan Senators and a significant number of \nbipartisan House Members have all joined in this effort, because it is \nnot just the West that has been impacted. Forest Service work in States \nthat manage timber sales, stream restoration, trail maintenance, and \nrecreation get shortchanged when money has been diverted to fighting \nwildfires.\n  I was particularly struck last year when we had the good fortune of \nhaving the senior Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, join as a \ncosponsor of our legislation. The reason he did so is because this \nabsolutely dysfunctional system of fighting fires has resulted in \nimportant priorities for New York State not being in a position to \nsecure the funding they need. That is because the rising costs of \nfighting fires keeps raiding all these other programs in the Forest \nService that are needed to help prevent fires down the road.\n  The raids take place two different ways. Certainly, in my part of the \nworld, we are very troubled by the fact that you have prevention \ngetting short shrift. Then it gets really hot and dry. We have lots of \nthunderstorms in our part of the world, and all of a sudden we have an \ninferno on our hands. Then what happens is the agencies end up \nborrowing from the prevention fund to put the fire out, and the problem \ngets worse because you have repeatedly shorted the prevention program.\n  This is what is called fire borrowing, and it happens not just in the \nWest. That is why the senior Senator from New York wanted to be a \ncosponsor of our legislation, because programs that were important in \nNew York State, thousands and thousands of miles away from the forests \nof eastern and central Oregon--those were a problem for programs he \ncared about and to secure their funding as a result of this \ndysfunctional system, just like it has been for people in the West.\n  It is time for the Congress to find a solution to ensure that, one, \nwildfires can be fought; and, two, to control the cost of fighting \nthese wildfires by better preparing our forests and making them \nhealthier.\n  I am very pleased that the chair of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, the committee I had the honor of chairing in the past, \nSenator Murkowski, and Ranking Member Cantwell are committed to working \non this issue, and I wanted to once again reaffirm my commitment. I \nknow Senator Crapo shares this view to work with them to find a \nsolution to wildfire funding that can pass in this Congress.\n  I certainly have some ideas, and I am very interested in welcoming my \ncolleagues' ideas and I have been for some time.\n  For example, last year in the summer, it was pretty clear that it was \ngoing to be a tough fire season. What I and others essentially sought \nto do was to find a way to get our colleagues working together to try \nto find some common ground and get this resolved. We couldn't quite get \nit done. We are now going to be at this day in and day out, week in and \nweek out. Senator Crapo and I will be working with our colleagues and \ntheir staff on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and on the \nBudget Committee and with Members from the other body to find a \nsolution that works for all sides of the issue.\n  We saw last summer that this was going to be a problem. A big group \nof us got together and said we have to get it resolved. We couldn't \nquite thread the needle. This time we have to make sure that gets done. \nThere are not a lot of certainties in life, but the fire season is one \nof them, and the Congress simply cannot let this problem continue.\n  I wanted to come to the floor, particularly today, to take note of \nthe fact that the fire in the Shenandoah\n\n[[Page S2474]]\n\narea ought to be a wake-up call to everybody. If they are having one of \nthe biggest fires they have ever had this early in April, that is a \nsignal of what is to come. It has been the story of summer after \nsummer. Now we are learning, as I indicated earlier--and it appears it \nis not just in the West--that we are thinking about the seasons and \ntalking about the seasons of yesteryear because now it is fire season \nall year round.\n  My colleague is here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, the most important words in the crafting \nof our Constitution are the first three words: ``We the People.'' With \nthose three words, the Founders described what the government of our \nnew Nation was all about.\n  As President Lincoln later summarized, it is a government of the \npeople, by the people, and for the people. In fact, even in the \ncrafting of the Constitution, the Founders put special emphasis upon \nthose three words, putting them in supersized font before all the \ndetails that were to follow.\n  Periodically, I will come to the floor to talk about issues that are \nclosely related to the ``we the people'' vision of our Constitution and \nour responsibilities under the Constitution. This week, I rise to \naddress the responsibility of the Senate and its advice and consent \nrole under the Constitution.\n  The President's duty is to nominate a Supreme Court nominee when \nthere is a vacancy. That responsibility is written very clearly into \nthe Constitution. It says that ``he shall nominate, and by and with the \nAdvice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the \nsupreme Court'' in article II, section 2 of our beloved Constitution.\n  The Senate then has the responsibility to provide advice and consent, \nas required, and over time it has been understood that we need to vet \nthe nominee, determine whether the nominee is fit to serve in the post \nhe or she will serve in, which is particularly important in the Supreme \nCourt. That is how this esteemed Chamber, our beloved Senate, has \noperated for more than 200 years.\n  In fact, we need to go back now and understand how this design was \ncreated. I have come to the floor before and read from Hamilton's \nFederalist Paper 76 that summarizes a conversation that was taking \nplace over the nomination process. Some folks--in crafting the \nConstitution--thought that responsibility should be solely with what \nthey referred to as ``the assembly,'' which is this body, the Senate. \nThe reason they argued that is, it would be a balance to the power of \nthe President in the executive branch if the assembly, the legislative \nbranch, were to make the appointments. However, they then realized that \nthose appointments would probably never get done because there would \nlikely be a lot of horse trading and the most qualified person probably \nwouldn't be nominated. Instead, it would most likely be the friend of \none Senator traded for the friend of another Senator, and that didn't \nmake sense. They said: No, it would make more sense to invest the \nresponsibility for the quality of the individual in a single \nindividual. As the expression goes, the buck stops here. It stops at \nthe President's desk. The President would have the responsibility to \nnominate individuals to serve in the executive and judicial branches \nand will bear the public responsibility for the credibility and quality \nof those nominations, but in that conversation, they also thought that \nwas too much power for the President to have. What if the President \nstarts to appoint friends or those with little experience or those of \nunfit moral character? There needs to be some kind of check, so in that \nregard then came the role of the Senate to give advice and consent. In \norder to do that, the nomination would go before this body for debate \nand then this body would vote on that nominee.\n  The words that were the key words Hamilton used in describing the \nresponsibility was to determine whether the individual was ``of unfit \ncharacter''--fit character, unfit character. Did that nominee have the \nqualifications necessary for the job and the personal characteristics \nrequired to fulfill the job effectively?\n  Well, here we are and President Obama has fulfilled his \nresponsibility under the Constitution. He has nominated Judge Merrick \nGarland. We now have our responsibility in the Senate to vet this \nnominee, examine Judge Garland's record, examine any aspect of his \nwritings or his previous court decisions, and determine whether Judge \nGarland is a fit character or unfit character. That is our \nresponsibility in the Constitution.\n  A number of my colleagues across the aisle--my Republican \ncolleagues--have said: We don't want to fulfill our responsibility \nunder the Constitution. We are just going to ignore the responsibility \nthat has been vested in the Senate of the United States. They are in \nthe majority, and a nomination can't go to a committee for a hearing \nand determine whether an individual is of fit character or unfit \ncharacter without the majority making it happen. The nomination can't \ncome to the floor without a majority vote in committee so it can then \nbe put forward for our consideration. Unfortunately, the job strike of \nthe majority party in the Senate--failing to fulfill its responsibility \nunder our Constitution--is now imposed on this entire body.\n  If we were within the usual timeline, we would be holding a hearing \non Judge Garland this week. Since 1975, the average time from \nnomination to committee hearing has been about 42 days, but instead the \nleadership has said: We are not going to honor our responsibility. I \nfind that deeply disturbing. Each and every one of us stood before this \nbody and took an oath to fulfill our responsibilities under this \nConstitution, and that is what we should be doing right now.\n  I say to my colleagues: Do your job. After a bit of reflection on the \nimportance of how our government functions, one would think there would \nbe a bit of reflection upon what we owe to maintain the integrity of \nour institutions and that this decision to go on a job strike would \nhave been reversed.\n  I have talked to colleagues who are, quite frankly, somewhat \nembarrassed because they have been asked to toe the line, and they \ndon't feel it is right that they should be, in fact, failing to fulfill \ntheir responsibility, but there is a lot of pressure on them. We need \nto set aside political pressure when it comes to the integrity of our \ninstitutions.\n  Since the 1980s, every person appointed to the Supreme Court has been \ngiven a prompt hearing and a vote within 100 days of their nomination. \nThis chart shows three different phases as to the vacancies. Sometimes \nthose vacancies have been longer or shorter in terms of before a \nnomination occurs. The red bar shows the start of the nomination \nprocess and the green bar shows the time before a vote is taken, which \nis the period of consideration. In every case, the red and green bar \ntogether are 100 days or less. This dates all the way back to Justice \nSandra Day O'Connor.\n\n  It has now been 100 days. How many days are there between now and \nwhen the next President takes office? What is the math? Well, there are \n268 days. So for anyone who comes to this floor and says there isn't \ntime, that individual is making a case with no foundation because the \nrecord shows that from the time the nomination was made until a vote, \ntime and time again--under Democrats or under Republicans--it has been \nless than 100 days. Yet we have more than 260 days left before the next \nPresident takes office.\n  There are other folks who have come to the floor of this Chamber and \nhave invented this new principle called the job strike during the last \nyear that a President is in office. They act as if there is something \nin the Constitution which gives this Senate permission not to do its \njob during the last year a President is in office. Well, I encourage my \nfriends to pull out and read the Constitution, find that clause, and \nbring it to the floor because it does not exist. The Constitution \nanticipates that each of us will fulfill our responsibilities \nthroughout the entire length we serve until we exit office, that a \nPresident will serve and work through all 4 years of his or her term, \nthat a Senator will serve and work through all 6 years of his or her \nterm. There is no vacation in the Constitution for the last year. There \nis no special permission to fail to do your constitutional\n\n[[Page S2475]]\n\nresponsibility in the last year of a term. That simply doesn't exist.\n  Many Supreme Court Justices have been confirmed in the final year of \na Presidency, and so for those who come to this floor and argue that \nthere is some historical precedent, that precedent doesn't exist \neither. Republican and Democratic Presidents have issued nominations \nregardless of the party in control of the Senate and the Senate, \nregardless of the party of the President, has done its job in case \nafter case after case throughout time. Until this moment, the Senate \nhas vetted the nominees, individual Senators have met with the nominee, \nthe nominee's record has been exposed, thereby giving the public the \nopportunity to give us their input, and we would have voted in \ncommittee and on this floor.\n  (Mr. BARRASSO assumed the Chair.)\n  If we look to the recent past, Justice Kennedy was confirmed in the \nlast year of President Reagan's final term. By the way, the Senate was \ncontrolled by Democrats. The Democratic leadership didn't say: We are \ngoing to go on a job strike and not vet the candidate and not hold a \nvote and not fulfill our responsibility. No, they honored their \nresponsibility under the Constitution and so should every Senator \ntoday.\n  This is a black mark on the record of the Senate. Think about what it \nwill lead to. For example, let's say the job strike we are engaged in \nis purely for political reasons in an effort to pack the Court with \nmore conservative Justices. Let's say it succeeds in delaying a \nnomination until the next Presidency, and the next President nominates \nsomeone on the far edges and way out of the mainstream, then what does \neach party do? Do they say: Well, the other party worked to pack the \nCourt and refused to do their job, and, now, because the consequences \nwould be so destructive and so partisan to the Court, we will refuse to \ndo our job but only because of what preceded it? That is not a \nconversation we should ever have. That is not a dialogue we should ever \nhave in this Chamber of action to politicize the Court, pack the Court, \nfollowed by reaction to try to blunt the impact of the initial action, \nfollowed by reaction, back and forth. This will deeply undermine the \nintegrity of the Supreme Court of the United States. Let me tell you, \nthe Court is already in trouble. The activist Court decisions of the \nfar right, trying to write legislation through Court decisions to \nchange the fundamental understandings of how our Nation operates, have \nalready deeply politicized the Court.\n  Citizens United turned the fundamental premise written into our \nConstitution on its head. Our Constitution was written all about, ``We \nthe People.'' Jefferson talked about the mother principle; that we \ncould only claim to be a republic to the degree that the decisions \nreflected the will of the people and that in order for that to happen, \ncitizens had to have an equal voice. His vision was one of the town's \nsquare, where there was no cost to participate. Everyone had a chance \nto stand and have their say.\n  Lincoln talked about the equal voice principle for citizens. The \nfundamental premise in a republic is to express the will of the people. \nPeople have to have the ability to participate in roughly equal \nproportion, but now the town square is for sale. It is the television, \nthe Internet, the Web sites, the radio, and our Court has decided it is \nOK for the very rich to buy it up and destroy the equal voice principle \nthat our Founders so cherished.\n  This activist Court on the far right has decided to undermine those \nimportant first three words of the Constitution: ``We the People.'' \nThis has produced a great cynicism in America because once this massive \nconcentration of money buys up the town square, buys up the airwaves, \ninfluences elections, it is no longer ``We the People,'' it is ``we the \npowerful'' and ``we the privileged.'' Wouldn't it be wonderful not to \nhave had the Supreme Court decisions that have undermined the integrity \nof our Supreme Court, but we have them and now the majority in this \nbody wants to further damage the Supreme Court, further politicize the \nSupreme Court, and that is a huge mistake. We should go in the other \ndirection. We should invest in the integrity of the Supreme Court. That \ndoesn't mean a nominee gets automatically passed through this body \nbecause we have a job under the Constitution. We have a responsibility \nto vet the nominee. We have the responsibility, as Hamilton said, to \njudge if the nominee is unfit or fit. But how can you have that \njudgment if we do not hold hearings? How can you have that judgment if \nthe committee does not vote? How can you have that judgment if there is \nnot a debate on the floor of the Senate? How can you have that judgment \nif there is not a vote on this floor?\n\n  So I say to my colleagues: End your job strike that is so out of sync \nwith the tradition of the Senate. End your job strike that is so \ndamaging to the Supreme Court's integrity. End your job strike that is \nso damaging to the ``we the people'' principles of our Nation. Do your \njob. Do your job. Hold the hearing. Meet with the nominee. Exercise \nyour vote. Do your job.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Merrick Garland\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the nomination \nof Merrick Garland to the United States Supreme Court and to urge my \ncolleagues to grant timely consideration to the President's nominee.\n  I recently had the pleasure of meeting Chief Judge Garland, as have \nmany of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I encourage all \nSenators to meet the nominee because I suspect that they will find, as \nI did, that the rumors are true; he is an exceptionally qualified \nnominee.\n  Since joining the DC Circuit, Chief Judge Garland has been recognized \nas one of the best appellate judges in the Nation. His reputation for \nworking with colleagues to identify areas of agreement and to craft \nstrong consensus decisions is well earned.\n  After meeting Judge Garland and discussing the way that he approaches \nhis role as a judge and as a chief judge, I am pleased to agree with my \ncolleague and friend Senator Hatch, who described Judge Garland in 1997 \nin this way:\n\n       I believe Mr. Garland is a fine nominee. . . . I know of \n     his integrity. I know of his legal ability. I know of his \n     honesty. I know of his acumen. And he belongs on the court.\n\n  Senator Hatch is right. He was talking about, of course, the DC \nCircuit--the second court in the Nation, really.\n  Before Judge Garland was nominated, the White House reached out to me \nand to many of my colleagues, especially those on the Judiciary \nCommittee, to ask the type of nominee whom I hoped President Obama \nwould put forward or whether I had any particular names in mind. I \ndidn't. My only recommendation was that the President nominate someone \nwhose intellect, experience, and demeanor would be apparent during a \nhearing and would cause the American people who watched the \nconfirmation hearing to say: I want nine of those on the Supreme Court. \nThis is what I told the White House.\n\n  Now that I have met Judge Garland, I will set about the task of \nreviewing Judge Garland's full record and all of his opinions. I will \nset that aside, but the American people deserve to meet him and decide \nfor themselves whether he is qualified to sit on the highest Court in \nthe land. The American people deserve a hearing.\n  In my view, confirmation hearings also serve a broader purpose. \nHearings aren't just an opportunity for the public to get to know the \nnominee and discover how he or she views important issues; open, public \nhearings provide an opportunity for the American people to learn about \nthe Supreme Court's jurisprudence and to demystify the Court's role in \nour democracy. Hearings also allow our constituents to see and judge \nfor themselves how and whether their government is working, whether we \nare doing our jobs.\n  Before any of us knew whom the President would nominate, Senate \nRepublicans wasted no time in refusing to fill the vacancy until after \nthe election. The majority leader said that ``this vacancy should not \nbe filled until we have a new President.'' The Republican members of \nthe Judiciary Committee gathered behind closed doors\n\n[[Page S2476]]\n\nand vowed to deny the eventual nominee a hearing. Many Republicans \nrefused to even meet with the nominee. They said it didn't matter who \nthe President nominated. This was about principle.\n  This type of obstruction marks a historic dereliction of the Senate's \nconstitutional duty. Since 1916--for the past 100 years--the Senate \nJudiciary Committee has fulfilled that duty by holding hearings. \nNonetheless, Senate Republicans stood firm in their opposition.\n  But within a day of Judge Garland's nomination being announced, some \nRepublicans began to change their tune. Once they discovered that the \nPresident had nominated a consensus candidate--a judge who had earned \nthe praise of so many Republican Senators during the course of his \ncareer--their calculus began to change.\n  Now my Republican friends are tying themselves in knots trying to \nexplain to the American people how they plan to move forward. Quite a \nfew Republican Senators broke ranks and agreed to meet Judge Garland \nprivately while nonetheless maintaining that the Senate should not \ngrant the nominee an open, public hearing. It would seem that some of \nmy colleagues believe they--not the public and not their constituents--\ndeserve the opportunity to meet and to question the nominee.\n  A few Republicans said that they would consider Judge Garland and \neven vote to confirm him in the lameduck session--but only if Democrats \nwin the White House. That is a very odd sense of what the principle is \nhere. I guess the thinking behind that is the Republicans are afraid \nthat should the election not go in the direction they prefer, then the \npeople shouldn't decide. They should decide unless they decide the \nwrong thing. That is the odd principle that I have heard in the \nJudiciary Committee when we have had business meetings, where members \ncome in and make a statement and then leave. I hear a lot of \ncontradictory stuff. Obviously, the theory is that should a Democrat be \nelected to the White House, they might eventually face a nominee who \nhasn't earned quite as much bipartisan praise, so then we will do \nGarland. That is absurd. That has nothing to do with principle. This \nhas nothing to do with principle, and it never did. This is about \npolitics.\n  The Supreme Court is too important, too central to our system of \ndemocracy to let it fall victim to partisan politics. It has been just \nover 1 month since President Obama nominated Judge Garland to fill the \nvacancy caused by the death of a Justice. During that month, the effect \nof allowing a vacancy to persist has been made clear. The eight-member \nCourt has deadlocked twice, handing down two 4-to-4 decisions. \nPermitting a seat on the Supreme Court bench to remain vacant means \nthat, in some cases, the Court is not able to fulfill its core function \nof resolving the splits among the courts of appeals and serve as a \nfinal arbiter of our laws. The Court isn't able to do its job.\n  I think we have to go through our history and look at when Justice \nMarshall was appointed in the last weeks, I believe, of that \nadministration.\n  I hope my Republican colleagues are finally coming to the \nunderstanding that they have an obligation to fill this vacancy. \nMembers of the Senate and of the Judiciary Committee in particular have \nan obligation to do our jobs, to get to work.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Defend Trade Secrets Bill\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this afternoon the House of Representatives \nis poised to pass the Defend Trade Secrets Act, bringing this critical \nproposal one step closer to becoming law. Over the past few months, \nSenator Coons and I have witnessed a groundswell of support for our \nbill, which will strengthen the ability of American companies to defend \ntheir most valuable information from theft.\n  Businesses, both large and small, and lawmakers, both Republican and \nDemocrat, have rallied around our legislation, providing the impetus we \nneed to pass this key intellectual property bill. Passage of the Defend \nTrade Secrets Act marks not only a watershed moment for the \nintellectual property community, it also represents a victory for the \nAmerican people.\n  To appreciate the significance of this legislation, we must first \nunderstand the importance of trade secrets in American industry. Trade \nsecrets are the lifeblood of our economy. In simple terms, trade \nsecrets are the groundbreaking ideas that give businesses a competitive \nadvantage. They range from unique production and manufacturing \nprocesses to food recipes and software codes.\n  This critical form of intellectual property is not only invaluable to \nindividual business owners, it is also directly responsible for \ncreating millions of jobs in our country. But a lack of Federal legal \nprotection leaves trade secrets vulnerable to theft and oversight that \ncost the economy billions of dollars each year.\n  Two years ago, Senator Coons and I set out to fix this problem \ntogether. From the very beginning, we sought the input of business \nowners and job creators so that we could better understand the \nobstacles facing American industry and chart a path forward for reform. \nThe Defend Trade Secrets Act is the culmination of our work.\n  Under current law, companies have few legal options to recover their \nlosses when trade secrets are stolen. For example, if a disgruntled \nemployee steals a Utah company's confidential information and leaks it \nto a competitor in another State, attorneys must navigate a complex \nlabyrinth of State laws just to bring suit. This cumbersome process can \ntake weeks, which is an eternity in a trade secrets case. During this \ntime, the likelihood that valuable intellectual property falls into the \nwrong hands increases every day, as does the potential for permanent \ndamage to the company.\n  Our bill solves this problem by creating a uniform Federal law that \nbusinesses can turn to when their trade secrets are stolen. This \nFederal standard keeps companies from getting bogged down in State laws \nby allowing business owners to take their case directly to a Federal \ncourt. Essentially, our legislation removes an unnecessary and time-\nconsuming layer of bureaucracy, buying businesses precious time to \nrecover stolen information. By providing America's businesses with the \nability to protect their most valuable information in Federal courts, \nthey will be better equipped to safeguard trade secrets and increase \ntheir competitiveness.\n  The President has expressed strong support for our legislation, which \nhe intends to sign into law shortly after it passes the House.\n  The Defend Trade Secrets Act is not only a win for the intellectual \nproperty and business communities, it is also an example of what \nCongress can accomplish when we put party politics aside and find \ncommon ground. Indeed, it is always easy to make things look hard, but \nit is impossible to make things look easy.\n  Today's House passage of the Defend Trade Secrets Act truly embodies \ncountless hours of negotiations and hard work. I wish to recognize \nthose who made passage of this bill a reality, including Chairman Bob \nGoodlatte, Representative Doug Collins, and Representative Jerrold \nNadler. They were indispensable in shepherding this legislation through \nthe House.\n  I also wish to thank Senators Grassley, Leahy, Graham, Feinstein, \nFlake, Whitehouse, and many others for their contributions to this \nbill. Likewise, I thank my dear friend Senator Coons for joining me in \ncoauthoring this bill. He has been an invaluable partner throughout \nthis process.\n  Enacting meaningful public policy in the midst of a toxic \nPresidential campaign is no small accomplishment. With the imminent \npassage of the Defend Trade Secrets Act, our Nation has cause for \ncelebration.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S2477]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         College Affordability\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I actually come to the Senate floor to \ntalk about the urgent need to help make college more affordable for \nAmerican families.\n  Earlier this year, I launched a comment form on my Web site \nencouraging people to share their struggles to afford college and how \ntheir student debt is affecting them. Since then, I have heard from so \nmany students and families from my home State of Washington and across \nthe country. By sharing these stories, I hope we can all come together \nto work on ways to bring down college costs and make sure students can \ngraduate from college without the crushing burden of student debt.\n  I recently heard from a young woman named Katy. She is a junior \nstudying psychology at Gonzaga University in Spokane, WA. Katy said she \nalways knew that attending college was going to be financially \ndifficult, although it never occurred to her to let that stand in her \nway. Because her parents were not in a position to help her out \nfinancially, and because she couldn't afford to make regular tuition \npayments, she has had to take on a large amount of student loans, and \nshe wasn't able to live with her parents, so she has also had to plan \nand pay for room and board for all 4 years.\n  Now, here is a typical workweek for Katy. Katy works 12 hours a week \nas part of the Gonzaga Student Body Association. At least 2 nights a \nweek, and usually on weekends, she makes hundreds of calls on behalf of \nthe Gonzaga Telefund. On most weekend nights, she is not out with her \nfriends and family. Instead, she is babysitting for some extra cash to \nput toward her textbooks. On top of all that, she is also a math tutor, \nwhich, until recently, was a paid position before the department's \nbudget was cut, but she has kept tutoring anyway as her way to give \nback. That is just who she is. Of course, that is all on top of being a \nfull-time student as well.\n  Let me be clear. Katy is very glad to be investing in herself and her \nfuture. She knows it is tough work and she appreciates that, but she, \nlike millions of other students, is just looking for a little relief. \nIn her own words, she admits ``it's a constant stressor thinking of how \nto pay for life while at college, and how I'm going to pay for all of \nthis after I graduate.''\n  Students like Katy aren't alone. Across the country, the yearly cost \nof tuition and room and board at a public 4-year institution is 5\\1/2\\ \ntimes what it was in the early 1980s, and to afford those skyrocketing \npricetags, people are turning to student loans to cover the cost. \nToday, Americans across the country hold a total of $1.3 trillion in \noutstanding student loan debt.\n  In my home State of Washington, the average college student owes more \nthan $24,000 in student debt. Think about what that debt means for our \nstudents. These students are doing everything right. They are investing \nin their futures. Many of them are the first in their families to go to \ncollege, but when it is time to look for that first job, just starting \nout, they are already in the red.\n  I have been so glad to work with other Senate Democrats on \nlegislation actually called ``In the Red'' that would help students \nlike Katy. Our bill would give students the chance to attend community \ncollege tuition-free. It would make sure the amount of Pell grants \nkeeps up with the rising cost of college, and it would let borrowers \nrefinance their student debt to today's lower rates. Our bill is fully \npaid for by closing corporate tax loopholes that only serve to benefit \nthe biggest corporations and the wealthiest few.\n  This issue for me is personal. When I was young, my dad was diagnosed \nwith multiple sclerosis. Within a few short years, he couldn't work any \nlonger. Without warning, my family had fallen on hard times. I have six \nbrothers and sisters, and thankfully all of us were able to go to \ncollege with help from what is now called Pell grants, and my mom was \nable to get the skills she needed to get a job. She had been a stay-at-\nhome mom. She needed to go to work, and she got that job through a \nworker training program at Lake Washington Vocational School with \ngovernment help.\n  Even through those hard times, our family never lost hope that with a \ngood education, we would be able to find our footing and earn our way \nto a stable, middle-class life. This country has never turned its back \non my family, and today we can't turn our backs on the millions of \nfamilies just like mine who need a path forward to afford college and \npay back their student debt.\n  I hope we can pass this bill and pave the way for lower college costs \nand less student debt. I hope we can work together to give students and \nfamilies some much needed relief. Let's make sure they know we will \nnever let up and that we will always have their backs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                               Venezuela\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I wish to speak about two separate topics. \nThe first is Venezuela.\n  Venezuela is a country in our hemisphere in total crisis, total \nchaos, and that is because of a number of things: failed leadership, \nfailed economic policies, a complete societal breakdown, human rights \nabuses, and now a de facto political coupe that has plagued the country \nfor about 15 years. This all started with Hugo Chavez and has now \ncontinued with Nicolas Maduro, his successor.\n  Let's talk about the first cause of the disaster that has now \nbefallen the people of Venezuela--failed leadership. For over 15 years \nnow, Venezuela has been ruled by two strongmen who have mismanaged the \ncountry with an iron fist, have squandered its vast wealth and natural \nresources, they have imprisoned political opponents, they have \ncorrupted all of the country's political institutions to ignore the \nwill of the people and to entrench their power.\n  By the way, this failed leadership has only gotten worse because the \nsuccessor to Hugo Chavez is a completely incompetent person. On top of \nthe fact he is a strongman, he is incompetent. He does not know what he \nis doing. The result is this very wealthy country, with a highly \neducated population, is being led by someone who, quite frankly, isn't \nqualified to lead anything, much less a nation of the stature of \nVenezuela.\n  The second cause is failed economic policies. Venezuela suffers from \nshortages across the board. For example, there are shortages of \nmedicine and medical equipment, which means--and this is not an \nexaggeration--people are literally dying because their doctors cannot \nprescribe drugs that aren't available, and the hospitals and the \nclinics don't have the equipment needed to conduct surgeries. When you \nspeak to medical professionals in Venezuela, they will tell you there \nare simple medications that could save the life of an individual, but \nthey can't do anything about it. I had someone tell me today they asked \na doctor: What do you do when one of your patients is about to die? And \nhe said: Nothing. We comfort them as they die. We don't have basic \nmedicines to deliver to them.\n  Unlike the case of Cuba, by the way, where they are saying it is \nbecause of the embargo by the United States--which of course is \nridiculous and is another topic for another day--there is no embargo on \nVenezuela. There are no sanctions on Venezuela and its people. So as a \nresult, there is no explanation for this.\n  The supermarkets are bare. The shelves are completely bare. People \nthere cannot buy food or even basics such as toilet paper, toothpaste, \ntoothbrushes--anything.\n  In addition to the government's political censorship effort, its \neconomic policies also help censor in the sense that there are \nshortages of paper that independent newspapers need to print their \neditions. So here is another Machiavellian move the government has \nmade. There is a shortage of paper, and so they make sure the \nindependent press has no access to paper. If you don't have paper, you \ncan't print a newspaper.\n  Things are so bad in Venezuela, economists earlier this month \ncompared Venezuela to Mugabe's Zimbabwe of 15 years ago. The reason \nthat is an\n\n[[Page S2478]]\n\nunbelievable comparison is because, as I said earlier, Venezuela has \none of the largest, if not the largest, oil reserves in the world; they \nhave a highly educated population; they have a well-established \nbusiness class of professionals; and last year their economy shrank by \n5.7 percent, and this year it will shrink by another 8 percent. This is \na country that now has rolling blackouts--an energy-rich country that \nhas rolling blackouts. It has gotten so bad that today their so-called \nPresident, the incompetent Nicolas Maduro, announced that government \nemployees are only going to work 2 days a week, Mondays and Tuesdays. \nGovernment offices will be open only 2 days a week because they aren't \nturning on the lights. This is the state of one of the richest \ncountries in the world and one of the richest countries in our \nhemisphere.\n\n  They have had a total societal breakdown. Economic misery begets \ndesperation, and we are seeing that reflected in the lawlessness that \nplagues Venezuela. Crime rates are among the highest in the hemisphere, \nparticularly the murder rate. It stems from the top, at the highest \nlevels of leadership. When an incompetent thug is running a country--\nsomeone whose government intimidates opponents by using what they call \ncolectivos, which are nothing more than street gangs, to ride around on \nmotorcycles, causing all kinds of mayhem, shooting and attacking \npeople--it only contributes to the lawlessness. Caracas, Venezuela, \nwhich is a beautiful city, is one of the most dangerous places in the \nworld, comparable with war zones in terms of the murder rate. It is \nbasically every man and woman for himself and herself in Venezuela.\n  They have atrocious human rights abuses. Since the government's \ncrackdown on demonstrators and political opponents began in February of \n2014, dozens of innocents have been killed, thousands have been beaten \nand targeted for intimidation, and hundreds have been jailed, including \nLeopoldo Lopez, who has been a political prisoner now for more than 2 \nyears.\n  We need to demand the release of all 115 political prisoners in \nVenezuela and respect their rights and those of their families. I heard \nanother horrifying story today. Most political prisoners are men. When \ntheir wives go visit them in prison, their wives are strip searched by \nmale guards as an ultimate act of humiliating them. This is the \nsituation in Venezuela.\n  Last, but not least, we have a de facto political coup by the Maduro \nregime. This country faces a real political and constitutional crisis. \nMaduro has stacked the country's supreme court with his loyalists, and \nthe supreme court is basically nullifying every law the Congress there \npasses.\n  The opposition won the election in the last cycle. By the way, they \nwon because the discontent with the government is so massive that they \ncouldn't steal the election. It was so big that not even they could \nsteal the election from them, so they sat this new Congress. He has \nstacked the supreme court, and the supreme court is literally \nnullifying law after law--doing it not for judicial reasons but for \nblatantly political ones.\n  Maduro basically ignores the law. The congressional branch there will \npass a law with a veto-proof majority, and he just ignores it. Imagine \npassing a law out of the House, out of the Senate, and sending it to \nthe President. He can't veto it, and so he just ignores it or refuses \nto do it.\n  That is the situation in our own hemisphere. The result is an \nincredible disaster--of deep interest to us, by the way, because of all \nthe uncertainty it is causing in the region. So what can we do about \nit? First of all, it is in our national interest. The current situation \nis happening in our own hemisphere. It threatens to destabilize the \nregion. It creates more pressure on our neighbors and our strategic \nallies, such as Colombia, where Venezuelans have been fleeing to. This \ncreates migratory pressures on the United States. The lawlessness is \nfueling organized crime, including drug cartels, which senior \ngovernment officials in Venezuela have established links to, which \nimpacts our entire region.\n  For these reasons and more, the United States has an interest in \nmaking sure Venezuela does not spiral further out of control.\n  The first thing we should do is we should be active at the \nOrganization of American States as it considers the situation in \nVenezuela, and they should ask that voting members recognize the \nhumanitarian and political crisis in Venezuela.\n  The United States should ask our allies in the region, countries that \nreceive an extensive amount of aid from this country--Haiti, Colombia, \nthe Central American nations, our neighbors up north in Canada, among \nothers--to support this effort. Right now we are about to give hundreds \nof millions of dollars to countries in Central America, in the Northern \nTriangle, the Alliance for Prosperity. I think that is a good idea, but \nwe should ask them to support what I hope we will try to do at the OAS. \nThe same with Haiti. We have poured millions of dollars into Haiti's \nreconstruction. We should use that as leverage to ask them to support \nsomething happening at the OAS.\n  What has happened in Venezuela is nothing short of a coup d'etat, a \nde facto coup, and the Organization of American States--if it has any \nreason to exist anymore, it should be to defend democracy in the \nregion. It is the reason we have an Organization of American States. We \nwill soon find out whether that organization is even worth continuing \nto exist if it cannot pronounce itself collectively on the outright \nviolation of democracy in a nation that purports to be a democratic \nrepublic.\n  Sanctions. We have to impose sanctions on human rights violators--not \nsanctions on the people of Venezuela, not sanctions on the government, \non human rights violators, many of whom steal money from the Venezuelan \npeople and invest it in the United States.\n  On the front page of the Miami Herald yesterday was a story that one \nof the individuals linked to the petroleum industry with the Government \nin Venezuela, a billionaire--and you become a millionaire with these \nlinks by basically stealing the money--is the secret developer behind a \nmajor development in Miami, FL, in my hometown, in my home State. \nTravel to Florida, come down there, and let me know--any of my \ncolleagues--and I will show you where these people live, and I will \nshow you the money they have stolen from the Venezuelan people, and \nthey are living the high life on weekends in Miami. You will see them \neverywhere. That is why we imposed sanctions on them. There will be an \neffort here, I hope, in the next day or so to extend those sanctions \nfor another 3 years.\n  Finally, I hope the United States uses our megaphone to highlight the \ncorruption in the institutions of the Government of Venezuela. That \nshould not be tolerated.\n  There is also a humanitarian component to this. We should help make \nsure the Venezuelan Government is not stealing or otherwise standing in \nthe way of the Venezuelan people getting the medicines and food they \nneed.\n  For far too long, the issues in this hemisphere have been ignored by \nadministrations in both parties, by this administration. We can no \nlonger ignore this. I hope we give Venezuela and the Western Hemisphere \nthe attention and the priority they merit. It is in our national \ninterests to do so.\n\n\n                              Puerto Rico\n\n  Mr. President, I want to briefly discuss the issue of Puerto Rico and \nthe debt crisis Puerto Rico is facing. The island faces a major \ndeadline coming up. A $422 million debt payment is due on May 1, which \nis this Sunday. If this deadline isn't met, it is going to cause some \nserious problems, and not just for the people of Puerto Rico--who, \nlet's not forget, are American citizens--but also for millions of \nothers throughout the United States. Today I will focus on one example \nof an American community that would be very negatively impacted, and \nthat is the city of Jacksonville in my home State of Florida.\n  Jacksonville is a port city, so its residents, businesses, and \nfamilies depend in large part on trade. A recent article in the Florida \nTimes-Union detailed exactly how close the relationship is between \nPuerto Rico and the shipping industry in Jacksonville.\n  In 2009, as much as 75 percent of the goods coming in and out of \nPuerto Rico flowed through the ports in Jacksonville, which brought \nabout $1 billion worth of economic impact to the city. In just the past \nyear, between October and March, JAXPORT has seen a 32-\n\n[[Page S2479]]\n\npercent increase in cargo tonnage from the island. But this trend is \nlikely to reverse if fiscal conditions in San Juan do not improve soon.\n  If Puerto Rico misses its payment on May 1 and its debt crisis \nfurther escalates, its economy is going to stagnate even more than it \nalready has, and the harm is going to be passed on to any community \nlike Jacksonville that has a significant economic stake in the island's \nwell-being. We have already seen a massive exodus of professionals and \nothers from Puerto Rico because of a lack of economic growth. They will \nlikely continue leaving and heading to Florida and other places on the \nmainland, which will further cripple the island's economy and reduce \nthe demand for trade.\n  So what can we do about all this? Some have suggested that Washington \ncan deliver a silver bullet solution to help Puerto Rico out of its \ndebt. This simply isn't true. The reality is that nothing Washington \ndoes will be effective until Puerto Rico and its government leaders \nturn away from decades of failed policies. Their tax rate continues to \nbe too high, government regulations are stifling, and they are spending \nmore than they take in. I don't care if you are an island, government, \nbusiness, or family--if you spend more than you take in and you do it \nfor long enough, you are going to have a debt problem. That is what is \nhappening here in Washington, and that is what is happening in Puerto \nRico. Anytime your economy isn't growing, you are going to have a \nfurther problem, and no restructuring is going to solve that until they \nrestructure the way they spend money. Bankruptcy protection isn't going \nto solve it, either, at least not without serious fiscal reforms from \nSan Juan. Otherwise, if we grant bankruptcy protection, Puerto Rico \nwill simply go bankrupt again not far down the road.\n  That does not mean Washington should do nothing. All of us need to \nrealize that this is an American crisis. It is taking place in an \nAmerican territory. It impacts the people of Puerto Rico, who are \nAmerican citizens. The impact will not be contained on the island; it \nwill spread to cities like Jacksonville and other communities \nthroughout the mainland United States.\n  So we need to take the irresponsible leadership in Puerto Rico \nseriously. We need to urge them to get their affairs in order. But we \nshould also look closely at what we can do here in the Senate, which \nmay mean taking up some of the ideas currently being worked on by House \nleadership. We can also help Puerto Rico by doing the same things \nnecessary to help the rest of the American economy. This means passing \npro-growth policies at the Federal level, including tax and regulatory \nreform. It means we need to stop spending more money than we take in.\n  In closing, the leadership in San Juan must view the deadline this \nSunday as a wake-up call. They must show their willingness to get their \nfiscal house in order. If they don't, our options in Washington will be \nvery limited and won't have support from taxpayers.\n  But I think this is a wake-up call for us. The notion that somehow \nthis issue with Puerto Rico will figure itself out is not true. The \nnotion that somehow this issue with Puerto Rico is not that important, \nthat we can put it to the side because it is not a State, is not true. \nPuerto Rico is a territory of the United States. Its people are U.S. \ncitizens. Its people, by the way, on a per capita basis serve in the \nArmed Forces of the United States at levels as high or higher than any \nethnic or geographic group in the country.\n  The people of Puerto Rico deserve our voice, and they deserve our \naction. I commend leaders in the House for trying to do something \nresponsible on this. I understand the majority leader has said that \nonce the House acts, the Senate will look at it very carefully. I know \nwe have leaders here doing that as well. I urge that work to continue. \nWe cannot ignore this crisis, and neither can the leaders in San Juan. \nI hope we can find a solution sooner than later for what Puerto Rico is \nfacing with its fiscal crisis, which this Sunday we are going to be \nreading about when they miss their debt payment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                  NATO\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we haven't discussed foreign policy issues \non the floor for a while. It is not because all is quiet on the eastern \nfront. It is not. As we know, what is happening in the Middle East and \nin Europe--the migration issue, Syria, across Northern Africa--is that \nthere are major issues that are ongoing and that affect the United \nStates in a number of ways, not only economically but strategically, \nand leave us vulnerable to threats to ``take down America'' in one way \nor another.\n  Obviously, we are in the middle of a heated campaign, which hopefully \nwill be resolved in terms of our nominees in a short amount of time. \nBut we do have to recognize the next President, whoever that President \nmight be, is going to be facing some extraordinary challenges relative \nto foreign policy and national security issues. Making America great \nagain--whatever it is that defines phrase--a new leader will have to \ndeal with a number of very difficult challenges.\n  This past Monday, President Obama delivered a speech in Germany in \nwhich he discussed the future of the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization, NATO. He said that NATO must be prepared to carry out its \ntraditional missions while at the same time meeting the newly emerging \nthreats to the alliance.\n  That was revealing to me and, frankly, welcoming because we have not \nheard anything from the President along those lines in my memory, but \nhis recognition and his statement in that regard defines where we are; \nthat is, we need to be prepared to carry out traditional missions \nthrough NATO while at the same time meeting the newly emerging threats \nto the alliance. We see these newly emerging threats to the alliance we \nare in almost every day.\n  The President also noted that Europe has been complacent about its \nown defense and called on our allies to do more. I welcome this renewed \nattention to NATO. It also gives us the opportunity to respond to those \nwho believe NATO has outlived its usefulness, is too expensive, and \nshould be done away with. Such a view needs a rebuttal.\n  It is not necessary nor correct to claim that NATO has no problems or \nits role has not changed or its future is clear. NATO does face \nchallenges and has--in defining its mission, securing its resources, \nand providing the leadership that the world requires. But to deny that \nalliance's obvious value is, in my opinion, a major mistake. Such a \njudgment surely cannot be based on any real understanding of what NATO \nis or what it has accomplished, much less of what it can become and, \ncandidly, what it must become, given the level of crisis and conflict \nso present in Europe, the Middle East, and in Africa.\n  I have been a strong supporter of the alliance and the transatlantic \nsecurity relationship throughout my public life. NATO's proud past and \nenduring importance were a constant presence during my service as a \nU.S. Senator and as U.S. Ambassador to Germany for 4 years following 9/\n11. Since returning to the Senate, the alliance has remained a keen \ninterest to me.\n  Contrary to the notion that NATO has served its purpose and is no \nlonger needed or is no longer a viable organization, NATO has survived \nand thrived for half a century because it has proven itself to be an \nadaptable, flexible, and effective organization.\n  I think many of us know the alliance began all the way back in 1949 \nwith the principle motive of protecting Western Europe from the threat \nof Soviet aggression. But many forget that the founding document, the \nWashington treaty of 1949, does not mention the Soviet Union. Instead, \nits founding treaty laid out the core values of the West, which values \nthe alliance was designed to protect.\n  I want to state that again. What was trying to be accomplished \nthrough this alliance of NATO, all the way back to 1949, was a values-\nbased organization that enabled the alliance and gave the\n\n[[Page S2480]]\n\nalliance those values which the alliance was designed to protect. It is \nexactly because the alliance was and remains values-based that it has \nbeen able to adapt to a changing strategic environment with newly \ndefined missions and membership. The vital and permanent need to \nprotect our shared values survived the collapse of the Soviet Union and \nthe threat it represented and has enabled the alliance to define and \nconfront the major threats and modern threats that we face today.\n  As NATO adapted to the post-Soviet world, the clearest proof of its \nfoundation as a community of values was the process of enlargement. At \nthe beginning of that process, few in the administration or Congress \nsaw NATO enlargement as having very much to do with actually enhancing \nthe military capabilities of the alliance. When the first countries \nwere proposed for membership via the Partnership for Peace program, it \nwas not only because of the military contributions those newly \ndemocratic nations could bring; rather, the most explicit motivation \nfor extending the prospect of membership to the countries of what we \nthen called Eastern Europe was to persuade them to make the political \nand economic changes that would make them worthy and complimentary \nallies. We were trying to cement in the democratic revolutions that \noccurred in these former Soviet-controlled states and make those \nchanges permanent.\n  We were extending NATO's democratic values--along with its security \numbrella--and we required prospective members to accept them and \ninstitutionalize those democratic values. That process continues today. \nNATO was and remains a political instrument of enormous persuasive \npower with historic consequences.\n  But are shared values enough to maintain the vitality and the \nrelevance of a military alliance? For those new member countries \nthemselves, the appeal of alliance membership was the vast military \ncapabilities of the club they were about to join. They sought actual \nenhanced security in a still dangerous world, not just a political \npartnership of values.\n  Now, in the wake of renewed Russian aggression, most especially in \nUkraine and its illegal annexation of Crimea, the objective military \ncapabilities of the alliance have become even more relevant. This \nrenewed threat resulted in NATO, in effect, hitting the pause button on \nredefining NATO's post-Soviet missions. For many alliance members on \nRussia's periphery, it was ``NATO--Back to the Future.''\n  Russian behavior has once again provoked profound anxiety among our \nallies on Russia's periphery, especially the Baltic states, Poland, and \nRomania. In response, NATO has taken on new missions intended to \nreassure our allies, discourage Putin's aggressive designs, and renew \nNATO's urgent relevance. All of this has a heritage for NATO's founding \nin the Soviet era, but it also is a new and, in many ways, more \ncomplicated response. While Russia is not the enemy it once was, it \ncertainly is no friend to the NATO nations. It is perhaps a necessary \npartner in some places, but it is a dangerous obstacle in others.\n  In restating and reinforcing NATO's role in opposing Russian \naggression, NATO needs to be creative and firm, active and present. It \ncannot be done on the cheap. This renewed mission emphasizes again the \npersistent issue of lagging resources. It has long been a problem that \nthe great majority of NATO membership countries do not meet the \nalliance standard of the 2 percent of their GDP, gross domestic \nproduct, for defense.\n  Although it is true that robust defense of the transatlantic region \ndoes require a greater commitment of resources than most European \ncountries have been willing to accept in the past, it is not true that \nU.S. taxpayers have simply been required to make up the difference.\n  The Department of Defense says that the direct U.S. contribution to \nNATO is about $500 million a year, the largest share of NATO's budget, \nclearly, but not out of line with our comparative gross domestic \nproduct--compared to other European nations. It is true that NATO \nrelies on the national assets of its members for operations, and in \nthat regard, our portion is the largest. But our portion reflects our \nspending for the entire military, which has global responsibilities. In \nother words, if there were no NATO, those military expenditures \npresumably would be the same, if not larger, since our allies are \ncontributors to our collective security as well.\n  In any case, the growing anxiety about Russian behavior seems to be \ngenerating some real progress on this resources front. Secretary \nGeneral Stoltenberg said this week that five NATO members now meet the \n2-percent requirement, while it was only two countries just a few years \nago. Further, defense spending has increased in real terms in 16 of the \n28 countries since 2014. Clearly, it is a wake-up call for NATO. What \nhas happened on their borders, the periphery of Russia, has awakened \nNATO to the belief that it needs to strengthen our military, strengthen \nNATO's resources, and for those countries to live up to their \nobligations in providing the necessary resources.\n  Nevertheless, and having said this, we cannot be relaxed about \nmeeting the resources gap. Despite the recent uptick, there has been a \nlong and dramatic decline in European defense budgets for two decades \nbefore 2014, not to mention a significant absence of constituent \nsupport for defense expenditures in most NATO countries.\n  It is a battle of these nations who are dealing with slow or no \ngrowth--GDP stagnant--to come to the decision to meet the 2 percent \nobligation that they have under the NATO treaty. They have other issues \nat home, migration simply being one of them, and a number of other \ndomestic issues that have restrained them. But now the threat has \nbecome more real, and now the realization of how to address the threat \nhas become more vital and necessary.\n  In his June 2011 farewell speech on NATO's future, Defense Secretary \nBob Gates famously said that our European allies were and had been \n``apparently unwilling to devote the necessary resources or make the \nnecessary changes to be serious and capable partners in their own \ndefense.'' He declared that NATO faced ``the real possibility of a dim, \nif not dismal, future.''\n  But the response to this danger, now especially in the wake of \nRussian invasion and annexation of a neighbor--this is not the time to \ncall for NATO's abandonment, but to press ahead in validating NATO's \nrelevance, then finding the necessary resources. I believe that process \nis under way, as I have just described.\n  Given the new threats to NATO's eastern border states, our allies are \nfinding greater support for making larger commitments to their own \nsecurity. Another pressing reason to solve the resources problem is the \nhost of new requirements this modern alliance needs to face.\n  Since the period of enlargement and the euphoria of democratic \nrevolutions, NATO has made repeated attempts to define its new \nmissions. The most recent strategic concept of January 2010 makes the \nalliance's newly global and political roles more explicit. It has \nidentified numerous new transnational threats that a modern military \nand political alliance must confront. These include nuclear \nproliferation, cyber threats, terrorism, political instabilities, and \nmissile capabilities.\n  No one can argue that these global threats are not the core of modern \nsecurity challenges. Similarly, no one can dispute that the most \neffective and powerful alliance in world history should and must \norganize itself to confront them. And most certainly, no responsible \nleader should look at these threats and conclude an alliance built to \nconfront them should be abandoned. Let me restate that. No responsible \nleader, now or in the future, should look at these threats and conclude \nthat an alliance built to confront these problems and challenges should \nbe abolished. Modern NATO activities extend well beyond Europe. These \ninclude combating piracy off the Horn of Africa, operational and \ntraining support for the African Union in Ethiopia, air policing of \nEurope's borders against Russian incursions, growing cyber defense \nalliance capabilities, expanded special operations capabilities and \nactivities, development of a NATO response force for rapid reaction \noperations on land and sea, expanded joint intelligence, surveillance \nand reconnaissance operations, and expanded\n\n[[Page S2481]]\n\njoint exercises to improve the alliance and member-state readiness. \nThat is a big challenge, but that challenge is one that needs to be \naddressed.\n\n  In terms of more traditional warfighting, NATO has taken on missions \nin Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Libya, and continued challenges \nwill need to be addressed. It is not yet clear to me whether ISAF, the \nAfghanistan mission, will go down as a success or not, but it is \nclearly in the balance and needs to be carefully monitored.\n  It is clear that the Libya operation revealed numerous alliance \nshortcomings and was not a model of alliance coherence and cohesion. \nRather, Libya was an example of failure at the political level to \ndefine the new NATO. The correct response to both, new challenges and \nadmitted failure, is better leadership, better vision, and creative new \nthinking, along with the resources to carry out those goals.\n  I have suggested that these could be best applied in response to the \nSyria disaster, especially with the humanitarian catastrophe and the \nmigrant crisis. I proposed that NATO could have helped member-state \nTurkey get control of its Syrian border to stop the flow of jihadists \ninto and out of Syria.\n  It is clear to me that the uncontrolled flood of refugees from Syria \ncould best be handled by creating safe areas in and near Syria so that \nthe Syrian people can remain there under safe and humane conditions. \nBuilding on NATO's Bosnia experience, the Alliance could be critical to \nproviding the security for such areas on the ground and in the air. \nThis would not be fighting the war in Syria but protecting the \npopulations of U.N. designated areas. Difficult? You bet, but it has \nbeen done before, and NATO is the only possible organization that is in \na position to do it.\n  Although I emphatically believe that NATO continues to have enormous \nvalue to U.S. interests and global stability, I do concede that it \nneeds a new vision of its role. That is clearly a work in progress and \nwill have some false starts and failures along the way. How it turns \nout will not only be a function of resources, as I have discussed, but \nalso an issue of leadership. On that score, I have some concerns. \nFrankly, I am worried.\n  The Obama administration seems to be guiding us toward a dangerous \ndeference to others to address emerging global security challenges that \nare and will be threats to our own national security. The most alarming \nexample is our acquiescence to Russia's vigorous engagement in Syria. \nRussia basically hijacked our paltry efforts to bring the Syrian \ndisaster under control, inserted its military forces to change the \ndynamic on the ground, and guided the political process toward their \nends. It has all been a sad display of American incompetence and \nimpotence. The United States and its allies are paying the price for \nthis failure of engagement.\n  After reading President Obama's recent and lengthy interview on \nforeign policy that was published in the Atlantic Monthly, I can tell \nhe has not drawn the correct conclusions from the foreign policy \nfailures in recent years in Libya, Syria, Ukraine, Russia, and \nelsewhere. For me, we have abdicated America's traditional leadership \nrole. For the alliance, I fear this could be the beginning phase of our \ndisengagement from Europe, which, if it continues, will be at our \nperil. Without firm U.S. leadership of NATO, we will begin to see the \ncommitment of our allies weaken. They simply do not have the muscle or \nthe financial capability to support a NATO coalition without U.S. \nleadership. Without the right kind of leadership, the importance of the \ntransatlantic security relationship and the continued robust presence \nof U.S. forces in Europe will begin to lose advocates, as perhaps has \nalready occurred among those who do not support our efforts.\n  If Americans come to see NATO's value in financial terms--bang for \nthe buck--we will lose sight of its real value in the proper terms of \nnational security, American reliability, and the eternal appeal of our \ncommunity of values--in other words, the values beyond price that must \nbe preserved if we are to prevail against our adversaries.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about why all of us \nare here. The primary role of Congress is to responsibly fund the \nFederal Government. To do that, we must set clear national priorities \nthat we can financially support. All too often, the process of setting, \nand then sticking to these national priorities has become a purely \npolitical exercise, not a function of governing. It is the No. 1 \ncomplaint I hear when I travel back to my home State of Georgia.\n  Coming from the business world, I clearly see two interlocking crises \nwe face as a country. First, we have a global security crisis. The \nworld may be more dangerous right now than at any point in my lifetime. \nInterlocked with that is our national debt crisis that threatens the \nability we have to defend our country today.\n  As we begin the appropriations process, let's take an honest look at \nwhat we are appropriating for. One of our top national priorities is to \nprovide for the national defense. It is one of only 6 reasons 13 \nColonies got together in the first place; that is, to provide for the \nnational defense. However, under Presidents Carter, Clinton, and Obama, \nwe saw three different periods of disinvestment in our military. Our \n30-year average of defense spending has been 4.2 percent of GDP. \nFollowing the Carter administration, the Reagan administration recapped \nthe military. Then, we had another decline. You see the buildup in the \nsurge in Afghanistan and Iraq, behind two wars.\n  We have been at war for 15 years. I believe in many cases we have \nburnt out our equipment, and in cases we are beginning to do that with \nour personnel, with longer tours and more difficult assignments in this \nhybrid war we are facing today.\n  Then you see under this administration a further decline, now to 3.1 \npercent of GDP. This is the lowest point since the Vietnam War, and the \nirony of that is that we are still spending $600 billion of $4 trillion \ntotal spending of the Federal Government on our military. The irony is \nthe 30-year average of 4.2 percent, which is a hundred basis points \nbelow what we're currently spending--that's almost $200 billion--in a \n$19 trillion economy.\n  The question is how do we determine the priorities to keep a strong \nmilitary? To make sure we can fulfill one of six reasons we came \ntogether as a country.\n  We are about to have the smallest Army since World War II, the \nsmallest Navy since World War I, and the smallest and oldest Air Force \never. How can this be? The world is more dangerous right now than at \nany time in my lifetime.\n  We see increased aggression from traditional rivals, Russia and \nChina. We also see the rise of ISIS, partly because of our own \nintransigence. They have to be stopped now, or we are going to have to \ndeal with them later here. Boko Haram, Al Qaeda, ISIS--all of these \nthreats are beginning to be interconnected and pose threats not just in \nthe Middle East, but around the world.\n  Finally, we have nuclear threats from rogue regimes, like North Korea \nand Iran, and emerging, game-changing technologies, such as cyber \nthreats, which nations like Russia are using for hybrid warfare right \nnow in Eastern Europe. There is an emerging arms race in space. This is \nwhy our women and men in uniform need to have the tools and resources \nto complete their missions around the world.\n  This fiscal crisis is jeopardizing our ability to actually fund the \nmissions being asked of our military today. Let me give two examples. \nJSTARS is a\n\n[[Page S2482]]\n\nfleet of planes, 16 in number. These planes in total have over 1 \nmillion hours of service. They were used when the Air Force bought them \nto start with some 30 years ago. They were flown by commercial \nairlines, such as Air India and Pakistan Air, around the world. Today \nthey fly missions providing critical intelligence, surveillance, and \nreconnaissance--ISR--ground targeting, and battlefield command and \ncontrol capabilities to all branches of our military in multiple \nregions of the world. The problem is they have outlived their useful \nlife and they are being replaced--or the theory was that they were \ngoing to be replaced. But because of our intransigence in Washington, \nthe funding is not there to replace them. So we are now facing \npotentially 8 years where we will not be able to fulfill their mission.\n  These are the planes that provide oversight for our men and women who \nare in harm's way--in Afghanistan, Iraq, in Southern Command, where we \nare intercepting drugs, in the Far East. Wherever the men and women in \nAmerican uniforms are facing danger, JSTARS is there protecting them in \nways no one else can in the military. All of these planes have to be \nreplaced, and the sooner we get started, the better. They will not be \nable to fulfill their mission over the next 8 years.\n  This chart shows the declining availability of the current fleet--\ndown to zero by 2023. It also shows that under the current plan, \npending DOD approval and funding, the replacement fleet doesn't even \nstart coming online until 2023--a start date that is now in jeopardy \nbecause of the current administration's budget request.\n\n  JSTARS' recap is the No. 4 requisition priority for the Air Force, \nbehind the long-range strike bomber, the new tanker, and the F-35. We \nare not going to be able to fulfill the mission of these airmen and \nsoldiers over the next 8 years unless we do something about it right \nnow--and even then, it might be too late.\n  This is a picture of a 1957 Chevrolet. Some of you will remember what \nthis is like. I remember this car. This is a collector's item. Some of \nmy friends own this car. This car is of the same genre, same age as \nmany of the airplanes we are now flying around the world. That is \ngreat, but imagine if you had to drive this car--this was your everyday \ncar and you drove it to work every day back and forth; you depended on \nit to get you to work every morning and to get you home every night. \nWhat would you do if you had to drive it to the west coast and back \nevery week? Imagine what the maintenance time loss would be for \nbreakdown. Imagine what it would be like traveling those distances \nwithout all the modern conveniences, such as satellite radio--Sirius, \nPandora. What about the safety factor? These are antiques. The point is \nthat this is a direct analogy of what we are doing with our military \ntoday in a very dangerous world. That sounds ridiculous, but you know \nwe have another example, and that is our marines around the world, who \nare the first to hit a crisis.\n  In Moron, Spain, we have a contingent of marines and one of their \nmissions is to protect our embassies in Africa. Post-Benghazi, that \ntakes on a new level of importance. These marines do a great job. They \nare the very best of what we have in America. They are ready to go. The \nproblem is that because of budget constraints, their fleet of \nairplanes, the V-22 Ospreys, is getting cut in half, and that \nfundamentally cuts their ability to complete their mission in half. So \nthey will not be able to fulfill the mission they have today the way \nthey are supposed to because of our own intransigence.\n  So, what is causing this great disinvestment in our military? Well, \nthere is only one answer: the national debt. These two crises interlock \nin a way they never have before. It used to be that defense hawks and \nbudget hawks were separate people. Today, I am living proof that they \ncan embody themselves in the same person, because I am both. We have to \nbe. We no longer have the luxury of debating both issues separately.\n  In the past 7 years, Washington has spent $25 trillion running the \nFederal Government. That is bad enough, but the problem is that we \nborrowed $9 trillion of that $25 trillion. That is 35 percent. The \nCongressional Budget Office says that over the next 10 years we will \nborrow 30 percent of that. What that means and why that is important is \nthat fundamentally, all of our mandatory spending--some $3 trillion--is \nmandatory, so our first dollars go to that. The problem is that all of \nour discretionary spending--all of USAID, our foreign programs, and our \nexpenditures--are fundamentally borrowed under that scenario, and that \nis where we are today. Can you imagine that? With this level of \nborrowing, every dime we spend on foreign aid--I just want to \nreiterate--foreign aid, domestic programs, and military--we are \nborrowing that money today because we haven't faced up to this crisis.\n  First we have the period here under President Bush. In 2000 our debt \nwas $6 trillion. We added $4 trillion on the back of two wars. In 2008, \nwe had $10 trillion in debt. Now we see we have another $9 trillion in \nthe last 7 years. We will be close to $20 trillion by the time we are \nthrough.\n  The yellow here is what the Congressional Budget Office says we are \nabout to face. If we do nothing from today, we will add another $9 \ntrillion to this Federal debt--close to $30 trillion.\n  I am a business guy and I know the capital markets are under great \nstress today. The danger of this is this is totally unmanageable. If \ninterest rates were to reach their 50-year average of just 5.5 percent, \nwe would be paying $1 trillion in interest on a $4 trillion total \nbudget. There is no way that is possible. That is about twice the \namount we spend on our military.\n  Our debt crisis is directly impacting our ability to protect our \nNation and project power around the world. This puts in jeopardy our \nvery ability to deal with global threats as they come up every day, and \nbelieve me, they are coming up every day. Without a strong economy, \nwithout dealing with our debt crisis right now, we can't adequately \nfund our military to confront the growing threats we face. That is a \nfact.\n  It used to be that fiscal hawks and defense hawks, and I have said \nthis, but today I see that more and more people who are one or the \nother are beginning to come together and recognize the other problem. \nThey are interrelated in a way they have never been.\n  Believe me, we need a strong defense. I believe we need to be \nresponsible for our Federal finances and the needs of our people here \nat home. The safety net needs to be maintained. Social Security needs \nto be saved. These are things we can't ignore, but we have to start \ndealing with our priorities today. That is why we have to find a way to \ncome together--Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, whatever--and \nmake sure we protect our economic and our national security priorities. \nWe need to get in a room and iron this out. They are not that \ncomplicated. We can find the solutions.\n  As former Admiral Mike Mullen said in 2012, ``I believe that our debt \nis the greatest threat to our national security. If we as a country do \nnot address our fiscal imbalances in the near-term, our national power \nwill erode.''\n  That was 5 years ago, and what have we done since then? Nothing but \nadd debt.\n  Last year, Congress passed a budget resolution. We laid out a \nconservative vision for what spending levels we should undertake and \ncut $7 trillion from the President's budget. We passed a budget, but \nbecause our budget process is broken, we didn't pass most \nauthorizations. We passed appropriations in committees, but we weren't \nable to get them to the floor and vote on them. So we ended up with a \nCR at the end of the year, and that led to a grand bargain, which I \nopposed, and an omnibus that added some $9 trillion to our national \ndebt. That was used to fund the government, in the absence of any \nappropriations bills having been approved. That pushed us to a first-\nquarter omnibus that really most of us wanted to avoid. At the end of \nthat, eight people got in a room over a weekend and decided how we are \ngoing to spend $4 trillion. That is not what our Founders had in mind. \nThat means that the topline spending levels were set by a so-called \ngrand bargain, which I voted against, because it increased spending and \nwould add over $9.5 trillion over the next decade to our national debt.\n  This mounting debt crisis will not fix itself--quite the contrary. It \nwill only\n\n[[Page S2483]]\n\ngrow worse because Social Security and Medicare are going to demand \nmore and more funds from the general operating fund because of the \nimbalances in those two items. If we don't get serious about solving \nthis debt crisis right now, we will not be able to fully support our \nnational security and our domestic priorities.\n  Recently, Richard Haass, a former top State Department official, said \nin a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, ``Our inability to \ndeal with our debt challenge will detract from the appeal of the \nAmerican political and economic model'' as we try to influence young \ndemocracies around the world. He continued: ``The result will be a \nworld that is less democratic and increasingly less deferential to U.S. \nconcerns in matters of security.''\n\n  We must create restraint and fiscal sanity in Washington. In the \nprivate sector, you fix a business by first drilling down and finding \nthe underlying problem. The way that Washington funds the Federal \nGovernment, the time it takes to complete the federal budget, and the \nfact that the current process allows Members of Congress to put off \nmaking tough decisions are the real problem. In business, this would \nnever be allowed. In your personal home, this cannot be tolerated, but \nsomehow we are able to do it here year after year. This process has \nonly worked four times in the past 42 years.\n  It has been encouraging to hear the Senate Budget Committee chairman, \nSenator Mike Enzi, and the House Budget chairman, Congressman Tom Price \nfrom my home State of Georgia, make this a priority for this year. I \nbelieve they are making great progress. Both are having hearings to \nfind out if there are models around the world that do it better than we \ndo. We are finding those examples, especially at a time when we cannot \nallow the process to break down and result in more continuing \nresolutions, omnibus bills, or short-term funding fights that don't \nsolve anything.\n  We must also reduce redundant programs, roll back the regulatory \nregime, and focus on growing our economy through overhauling our \narchaic Tax Code, and unlocking, finally, our Nation's full economic \nand energy potential.\n  Finally, we have to save Social Security and Medicare and tackle the \nbiggest problems of our overall health care costs. To do this, \nWashington needs to stop pretending that these crises will go away on \ntheir own and that the national debt will somehow solve itself. It \nwon't. In fact, it has already done irreversible damage to our \ncredibility and capability on the world stage. Our mounting debt crisis \nis already raising questions from our allies around the world about how \nwe will be able to stand by our international commitments.\n  I just got back from a trip to Europe and the Middle East. The No. 1 \npoint raised to us by leaders, heads of state in those countries, was \nthat America needs to lead again. To lead again, we need to get our \nfinancial house in order.\n  Our debt crisis and a failed foreign policy has served to confuse our \nallies and embolden our enemies. It threatens our ability to defend our \ncountry, period. Also, the interest payments on our debt is affecting \nour education, infrastructure, and more--here at home in the programs \nthat are necessary. Imagine if we didn't have that unproductive \nresponsibility of unnecessary interest. Every Member of this body knows \nwe need to act now.\n  My question is, why aren't we acting? The challenge is to stop \ntalking about it theoretically and start putting solutions into \npractice. That is why Georgians sent me to the U.S. Senate, and that is \nwhy I will continue fighting on this every day.\n  Let's not lose sight of Congress's No. 1 responsibility. We are \ncharged in the Constitution under article I to responsibly fund the \nFederal Government and to ensure that the 6 reasons why 13 Colonies got \ntogether in the first place can actually be realized.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/senate-section/article/S2483-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2483-S2484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     INCORPORATION TRANSPARENCY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here today to highlight law \nenforcement legislation that would help crack down on human \ntrafficking, terrorism financing, money laundering, Medicare fraud, the \nnarcotics trade, tax evasion, public corruption, and a litany of other \ncrimes in the United States and around the world. These crimes all \ninvolve money, and the United States has become a favorite destination \nfor criminals looking to hide it.\n  Earlier this month, the International Consortium of Investigative \nJournalists published the first of the so-called Panama papers, a leak \nof 11.5 million confidential documents from a Panama-based law firm \nthat sets up shell corporations and tax shelters for wealthy clients. \nThe documents we have seen so far show that, along with the Caribbean \nislands you might expect, several American States are popular places to \nform shell corporations.\n  Our friend Senator Kent Conrad, who used to be chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, was fond of using this floor chart showing what is called \nthe Ugland House building in the Cayman Islands. This little building \nclaims to be the place from which an astonishing 18,000 companies do \nbusiness. As unimaginable as it may be to have 18,000 companies \nclaiming to be doing business out of that one little building, I am \nsorry to say that there is a building just a 2-hour drive from the U.S. \nCapitol Building that serves as the official address for a quarter of a \nmillion companies, many of them shell corporations.\n  A shell corporation is a company that serves no economic purpose and \ndoesn't conduct any real business. Shell corporations exist primarily \nto hold legal title to bank accounts, real estate, or other assets, \noften obscuring the true human owners. While people can form shell \ncorporations in just about any country, many American States make it \nespecially easy to do so, perhaps even easier than getting a library \ncard. You may actually need to go down to a library to sign up for a \nlibrary card, but you can form a shell corporation with a few clicks of \na mouse and payment of a small fee.\n  There is another reason that the United States has become so popular \nfor shell corporations. Currently, none--zero--of the 50 American \nStates require the disclosure of the beneficial owners--the real human \nbeings who own the companies. Instead, corporate records can identify \nthe owner as just another faceless shell corporation, or the owner \ncould be identified as a professional agent paid to sign the needed \nforms and never speak of them again or a lawyer who refuses to disclose \nwho his client is under attorney-client privilege. Behind this easy-to-\nestablish veil of secrecy, criminals can and do use these shell \ncorporations to open bank accounts, transfer funds, and even to hide \nthe ownership of expensive assets.\n  This building shown here is at 650 Fifth Avenue in New York City. The \nIranian Government used a string of generic businesses to obscure its \nownership of this Fifth Avenue skyscraper. Profits from this enterprise \nhelped fund Iran-backed terrorism for decades, until a U.S. Government \ninvestigation finally uncovered the scheme in 2008.\n  How could a state sponsor of terrorism own a piece of the New York \nCity skyline and profit from owning that piece of the New York City \nskyline for so long without anyone knowing? Let's look at how Iran used \nanonymous shell corporations to hide its involvement.\n  On paper, 650 Fifth Avenue was owned by a partnership of the Alavi \nFoundation, a New York-based charity, and the Assa Corporation, a New \nYork shell company. Assa Corporation was, in turn, owned by yet another \nshell company, Assa Company, Limited, and formed in the Isle of Jersey, \na notorious banking center and tax shelter. The Isle of Jersey company \nwas in turn owned by individuals representing Bank Melli, the Iranian \nGovernment's financial arm, and there is the connection to Iran.\n  So to the public, that building--worth about half a billion dollars--\nwas\n\n[[Page S2484]]\n\nowned by a charity and a faceless shell company. Because there is no \nrequirement in the United States that States keep track of the real \nowners of a company formed under State law, New York State only knew \nthat the Assa Corporation was owned by another shell corporation. \nUltimately, investigators were able to connect those dots and tie Iran \nto the structure from a clue in the corporate records kept on the Isle \nof Jersey.\n  How is that for irony? A notorious tax shelter actually had better \nownership records than we have in the United States. Once Iran's \ninvestment and involvement was uncovered, the Department of Justice \nmoved to seize and sell the building and to distribute the proceeds of \nthat sale to American victims of Iranian-backed terror. After years of \nlegal appeals, the victims look close to receiving this compensation.\n  Of course, Iran isn't the only criminal enterprise hiding behind \nAmerican shell companies. Other recently uncovered examples of \nenterprises hiding behind American shell companies include a Mexican \ndrug cartel using an Oklahoma corporation to launder money through a \nhorse farm, a crime syndicate setting up a web of corporations in eight \nStates as part of a $100 million Medicare fraud scheme, and a human \ntrafficking ring based in Moldova that hides their crimes behind \nanonymous corporations in Kansas, Missouri, and Ohio.\n  According to the Rhode Island State Police, corporate secrecy in my \nown State has complicated their investigations into real estate fraud, \nillegal prescription drug distribution, and sales tax evasion.\n  In January, just months before the Panama Papers hit the headlines, \n``60 Minutes'' aired a segment showing just how easy it can be for \ncriminals to hide money in the United States. The program featured an \ninvestigator with the anticorruption organization Global Witness. That \ninvestigator pretended to represent a corrupt African leader, and ``60 \nMinutes'' brought a hidden camera along into his meetings with lawyers \nin New York.\n  The investigator, presenting himself as representing the corrupt \nAfrican leader, made clear that his client wanted help using suspicious \nfunds to buy a mansion, a jet, and a yacht in the United States and to \nhide his ownership of these assets. Of the 16 lawyers who met with the \nundercover investigator, only 1 turned him away. It seems the others \nwere comfortable helping a corrupt foreign official hide money in \nopaque American shell corporations.\n  While the underlying criminal schemes may be colorful and complex, \nthe answer to this shell corporation problem is simple and \nstraightforward. The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement \nAssistance Act would direct States to require applicants forming \ncorporations and limited liability companies to include basic \ninformation about the actual human beings who own the company.\n  The States would maintain and periodically update this information, \nand it would be available to law enforcement officers who present valid \ncourt-ordered subpoenas or search warrants. It is simple. Have each \nState keep track of who actually owns companies they charter and ensure \nthat information is available for Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement agencies through proper processes.\n  Transparency in business ownership is not a novel idea. Every member \nof the European Union will be transparent by 2017. The United Kingdom \nand the Netherlands have even announced plans to make their corporate \nownership registries available to the public. With the light of \ncorporate transparency about to shine on criminal assets hidden in \nEurope, their shell corporations will not be effective for these \npurposes. So that money will be looking for new dark homes.\n  America should take swift action to make sure these assets don't find \nnew hidden homes in opaque American shell corporations. We are supposed \nto be an example to the world, not the place where the world's corrupt \nand the world's criminals hide their cash and their assets.\n  The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act \nenjoys broad support from the national law enforcement community, \nincluding the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the \nFraternal Order of Police, the Society of Former Special Agents of the \nFBI, and the U.S. Marshals Service Association, as well as the Rhode \nIsland State Police.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to finish my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Chuck Canterbury, president of the National Fraternal \nOrder of Police, explains it this way: ``When we are able to expose the \nlink between shell companies and drug trafficking, corruption, \norganized crime, and terrorist finance, the law enforcement community \nis better able to keep America safe from these illegal activities and \nkeep the proceeds of these crimes out of the U.S. financial system.''\n  Of all places, the United States should not be a safe haven for \ncriminals, foreign or domestic, to hide their illegal assets. We could \ntake a simple major step in fighting money laundering, financial fraud, \nand terrorist financing by passing this bill. I urge my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to cosponsor it and to help us get it passed.\n  I thank the Chair. I appreciate the extra time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/senate-section/article/S2484-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2484-S2485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF ROBERTA JACOBSON\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, it has been nearly 9 months since the \nUnited States had an ambassador to Mexico. The President's nominee to \nthat post, Roberta Jacobson, is eminently qualified, as all of us know, \nto serve in that position. However, she has been waiting for the Senate \nto confirm her since the Foreign Relations Committee reported her \nnomination to the Senate in November of last year with a vote of 12 to \n7.\n  Yesterday I took to the floor to talk about our important trade \nrelationship with Mexico. That is not the only reason finalizing this \nnomination is so critical. The bilateral work on migration, security, \nand border issues of the United States and Mexico requires top-level \nleadership at our Embassy in Mexico City. It is critical for the United \nStates to have an ambassador to ensure cooperation on border security \nissues and to identify threats to our national security.\n  We continue to engage Mexico in disrupting organized criminal \nnetworks that facilitate human trafficking. According to Mexico's \nNational Institute of Migration, Mexico apprehended more than 190,000 \nmigrants in 2015, including nearly 19,000 unaccompanied minors, \nchildren, better known as UACs. This is a significant increase from \n2014, when 127,000 migrants, including just over 11,000 UACs, were \napprehended.\n  It is clear these complex issues require top-level diplomacy, and we \nwould benefit from an experienced leader who can navigate the nuances \nof these regional relations. In addition to these migration issues, the \nUnited States and Mexico need to address security challenges from \ntransnational drug trafficking. As we hear all too often, we are \nwitnessing an increase in heroin use leading to rising levels of \nviolence and heroin-related deaths.\n  While the United States and Mexico are cooperating on a strategy to \nfight heroin, this represents a priority that requires the leadership \nof an ambassador. We need someone in place as our top diplomat in \nMexico with experience with Mexican security and with law and to engage \nthe most senior Mexican Government officials on the narcotics issues.\n  In addition, there are specific ongoing cases that necessitate having \nan ambassador in place to ensure that our Nation's interests are being \nrepresented. As I said yesterday, Mexico represents one of our most \nimportant bilateral relationships. It is clear the longer the United \nStates goes without having an ambassador to Mexico, the greater our \npartnership will suffer.\n  There is simply no reason to go any longer without an ambassador to \nMexico when we have someone as qualified as Roberta Jacobson. I come \nwith good news; that is, it is my understanding that a deal--an \nagreement--is in the works that will ultimately lead to the\n\n[[Page S2485]]\n\nsuccessful confirmation later this week. As such, I will not be making \na unanimous consent request today, but I intend to come here as long as \nit takes, to keep up the pressure and to monitor this process, to \nensure that it has a successful resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/senate-section/article/S2485-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2485-S2486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAN\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, earlier this month, the Governor of Iran's \ncentral bank, Dr. Valiollah Seif, spoke at the Council on Foreign \nRelations in Washington and he made three primary claims. First, he \nsaid sanctions did not, in fact, lead Iran to agree to the terms of the \nnuclear agreement between Iran and the United States, the United \nKingdom, France, Germany, the EU, Russia, and China. He said sanctions \ndid not force Iran to agree. Second, he said Iran's nuclear program has \nalways been entirely peaceful. Third, he said that the United States \nand our European allies have not honored our commitments under the \nterms of the nuclear deal also known as the JCPOA.\n  Today I wish to push back against all three of these claims.\n  First, on sanctions, Governor Seif said: ``Contrary to baseless \nallegation[s] that some people made, sanctions did not and could not \nforce [Iran] to engage into a negotiation with our P5+1 colleague[s],'' \nthe nations I referenced.\n  The facts clearly say otherwise.\n  U.S. sanctions have been a major feature of U.S. policy toward Iran \nsince Iran's 1979 revolution. The imposition of international sanctions \nand worldwide bilateral sanctions on Iran began in 2006 and increased \ndramatically in 2010.\n  In June of 2010, the Congress passed the Iran Sanctions, \nAccountability, and Divestment Act, also known as CISADA, which \nweakened Iran's access to the international financial system and \nbolstered existing sanctions specifically against Iran's human rights \nabuse.\n  That same month, with the support not just of our European allies but \nalso Russia and China, the Obama administration and then-Secretary of \nState Hillary Clinton led the passage of U.N. Security Council \nResolution 1929, which created the most comprehensive and stinging \ninternational sanctions the Iranian regime has ever faced.\n  Two years later, in 2012, the National Defense Authorization Act \ndesignated the Central Bank of Iran for additional sanctions, which the \nObama administration successfully used to undermine Iran's ability to \nsell oil on world markets.\n  The Obama administration also convinced key allies, such as Japan, \nAustralia, South Korea, and Canada, to agree to additional bilateral \nmeasures that increased pressure on Iran's financial banking, \ninsurance, transportation, and energy sectors.\n  The effects of these coordinated sanctions were clear, swift, and \ndirect. The value of the Iranian currency decreased dramatically. \nObstacles to Iranian trade forced businesses to close and increased \ninflation within Iran. Iran's oil exports and government revenues \ndeclined sharply. In 2011, for example, Iran exported about 2.4 million \nbarrels of oil per day. By March of 2014, Iran's exports were down to \njust 1 million barrels a day--in a nation for which petroleum makes up \n80 percent of all commodity exports.\n  In July of 2012, former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called the \nsanctions regime ``the most severe and strictest sanctions ever imposed \non a country.''\n  The coordinated sanctions regime was so effective that Iran's current \nPresident even described Iran's economic situation as if the country \nhad ``returned to the 19th century'' under the sanctions regime. I \nthink it is clear on this first point that sanctions imposed an \nunsustainable cost on Iran and forced it to the table to engage in \nnegotiations with the West regarding its nuclear program.\n  That brings me to his second erroneous argument that Iran has pursued \nnuclear technology with only peaceful purposes in mind. Iran's actions \ndirectly contradict this claim.\n  In 2002, members of the international community revealed that Iran \nhad, in fact, been attempting to build a secret uranium enrichment \nfacility at Natanz in Central Iran and a heavy water plutonium reactor \nat its Arak facility in the northwestern part of the country. Only \nbecause Iran failed to keep these facilities secret did the IAEA--or \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency--finally begin having the \nopportunity to monitor these sites in 2002.\n  In 2009, the United States, France, and Britain revealed the \nexistence of another uranium enrichment plant buried deep under a \nmountain near the city of Qom.\n  The evidence continues. In 2011, the IAEA released a report on the \n``possible military dimensions'' of Iran's nuclear effort, known as \nPMD. The report detailed areas in which the agency had evidence of \nIran's past--and potentially ongoing--work on nuclear weaponization and \nthe development of nuclear warheads for missile delivery systems.\n  The IAEA's final report on the possible military dimensions of Iran's \nnuclear program, issued in December of 2015, found ``a range of \nactivities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device \nwere conducted in Iran prior to the end of 2003 as a coordinated \neffort.'' The report also found that Iran conducted certain activities \nrelevant to nuclear weaponization for at least several years after 2003 \nand that some of these activities didn't end until 2009.\n  It is not just on-the-ground reports and secret nuclear facilities \nthat suggest that Iran's nuclear efforts have not always been entirely \npeaceful. Let me remind my colleagues that just last month Iran tested \na ballistic missile that supposedly had a message on its side \nproclaiming in Hebrew: ``Israel must be wiped off the Earth.''\n  An Iranian regime that continues to advocate for the destruction of \nIsrael, America's vital ally Israel, does not sound like a nation that \nhas been and hopes to continue to develop nuclear technology for \nanything remotely peaceful.\n  An Iranian regime that ships illicit weapons to support the murderous \nregime of Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria or the Houthi rebels in Yemen \nor Hezbollah in Lebanon is not seeking to develop weapons for peaceful \npurposes.\n  An Iranian regime that illegally tests dangerous ballistic missile \ntechnology--some of which is capable of carrying a nuclear weapon, all \nof which violates U.N. Security Council resolutions--does not have \npeaceful intentions.\n  Because of this behavior, we have every reason to distrust Iran's \nclaims that its nuclear efforts were always peaceful. Iran continually \nmisled the international community about the nature of its nuclear \nprogram, and it continually disguised its efforts to conduct research \nand other activities to help it better understand how to develop a \nnuclear weapon. It continues to threaten Israel, to test ballistic \nmissiles, and to support terrorism throughout the Middle East.\n  That is why I simply cannot accept Seif's argument that Iran's \nnuclear program has always been entirely peaceful.\n  The third claim made by Seif last week was that the United States and \nour European allies have not honored our obligations under the nuclear \ndeal known as the JCPOA. Iran's evidence for this claim is that the \nsanctions relief granted to Iran for complying with the terms of the \nagreement hasn't suddenly unleashed a flurry of Iranian economic \nactivity. As Adam Szubin, our own Department of the Treasury's Acting \nUnder Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, recently put \nit, throughout the negotiations between the United States, our allies, \npartners, and Iran, the U.S. and our allies ``did not guarantee \neconomic outcomes, or a flood of immediate business into Iran.''\n  Acting Under Secretary Szubin is right. Iran is responsible for \nmaking Iran an attractive, safe place to do business. For many \nindividuals and businesses, Iran appears neither attractive nor safe. \nFor example, in October,\n\n[[Page S2486]]\n\nIran arrested Siamak Namazi, a businessman who is a dual American-\nIranian citizen. Namazi worked for a petroleum company in the UAE and \npreviously ran a consulting business in Iran. He still has not been \ncharged. In fact, the only recent development in Mr. Namazi's case is \nhis father Baquer--an 80-year-old man who suffers from heart problems--\nwas arrested in February and sent to Iran's notorious Evin Prison. Why \nwould Iranian leaders expect foreign investment to flow into their \ncountry when it arbitrarily arrests and detains those seeking business \nopportunities for their own country.\n  It is not only Iran's flawed legal system or its ongoing human rights \nviolations, more than half of Iran's economy consists of shadowy \norganizations controlled in part by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard \nCorps, the IRGC, the hard-line military force committed to the \npreservation of the Iranian regime. The pseudo-private entities that \nare tied to the IRGC include banks, businesses, religious foundations, \npension funds, and welfare projects that also serve as front companies \nfor the IRGC.\n  During his question-and-answer session at the Council on Foreign \nRelations, Mr. Seif was asked whether foreign businesses considering \ninvesting in Iran or doing business with Iran could be confident that \nthe money invested in Iran would not fund the IRGC. He was unable to \ndeclare definitively that it would not.\n  The onus, the burden, is on Iran--not the international community or \nthe United States--to reform Iran's domestic economy and to make sure \nits businesses are not linked to the IRGC, to make it a country--\ntransparent and open--and to engage in actions that suggest to the \nworld it is a trustworthy partner. The burden is on Iran to comply with \nthe JCPOA. The burden is on Iran to stop testing ballistic missiles, \nabusing human rights, and supporting terrorists. If Iran is unhappy \nwith the level of economic relief it has received since this agreement \ncame into effect, it only has its own actions to blame.\n  As Acting Under Secretary Szubin put it, ``the JCPOA [the nuclear \ndeal] is an international arrangement, not a cashier's check.''\n  I commend Dr. Seif for his willingness to travel to the United States \nand to make his case in front of our Council on Foreign Relations. I \nthink this is a constructive step, but as I have shown, I think the \ncase he made is a weak one. The evidence is clear. A coordinated \nsanctions regime did, in fact, force Iran to negotiate. Iran's nuclear \nprogram was not entirely peaceful in its intent or execution. The \nUnited States and EU aren't holding the Iranian economy back--the \nIranian Government is. The Iranian Government's actions are.\n  In my travels throughout the Middle East and in conversations with \nregional leaders and Ambassadors here, it is apparent these nations all \nshare one overriding concern, Iranian aggression. This challenge unites \ncountries as diverse as Israel, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the United \nArab Emirates.\n  As my colleagues may have seen in an op-ed in the Washington Post \njust last week, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Zarif sought to \njustify recent steps Iran has taken to dramatically build up its \ndefenses.\n  Countries do, indeed, have a right to self-defense, but there is a \ndifference between self-defense efforts undertaken by responsible \nmembers of the international community and some of Iran's recent \naggressive and destabilizing actions.\n  Responsible nations don't support terrorist groups throughout the \nMiddle East and stoke sectarianism to undermine the security of their \nneighbors. Responsible nations don't directly threaten the destruction \nof Israel. Responsible nations seek common ground and the pursuit of \nmutual interests with their neighbors. Responsible nations abide by \nU.N. Security Council resolutions.\n  Iran's actions make it clear it is not yet a responsible member of \nthe international community. If Iran then has complaints about the \nrelief it has received under this agreement, it should move its \nbehavior and begin to uphold its commitments under the deal while \nchanging the dangerous aspect of its ongoing behavior. Yet, instead, \nIran continues to try and dominate its region, a valuable reminder we \nmust continue to enforce the terms of the JCPOA strictly and push back \non Iran's bad behavior that is outside the parameters of the agreement.\n\n  While I commend the Obama administration for its recent action in \ninterdicting illicit arms shipments from Iran to the Houthis, \ncontinuing to designate IRGC-linked entities for more sanctions, and \ntaking other critical steps to push back on Iran's bad behavior and \ndestabilizing activities in the region, I also remain concerned about \nthe administration's willingness to entertain Iranian complaints about \nsanctions relief.\n  I urge the United States and our allies to remain cautious in our \ndealings with Iran. We must remember that the most important contract \nwith Iran is the one we have already agreed to--that is, this nuclear \ndeal--and we must continue to remind Iran that its own behavior is the \nreal cause of its continuing international isolation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 50th \nanniversary of the St. Jude's Ranch for Children, Nevada Campus.\n  St. Jude's Ranch for Children was founded by Father Jack Adam to \nsupport abused and neglected children and give them an opportunity to \nlearn and grow. Father Adam initially faced challenges in acquiring \nfunding for the project. However, with the help of Nevadan community \nleaders, including Claudine and Shelby Williams, Forrest Duke, and the \nSisters of Charity, the project raised $30,000, and the facility was \nbuilt. Eddie, a resident of Elko, NV, became the first child to attend \nSt. Jude's Ranch for Children. Since then, the organization has been a \nsanctuary for numerous abused and neglected children and is a \nrecognized landmark in southern Nevada.\n  St. Jude's Ranch for children offers supportive housing and \nnutritional services for children and families. The Therapeutic \nResidential Foster Care program provides children an opportunity to \nlive together, receive the nutritious foods they need to be successful, \nattend school, and participate in extracurricular activities. Children \nare nurtured in the program until they are ready to transition out of \ntherapeutic are. Later, children are placed with loving foster \nfamilies, and siblings are kept together.\n  April is National Child Abuse Prevention month. It is important that \nevery April we work together to raise awareness for programs that \nsupport the physical and emotional well-being of children and recognize \norganizations, such as St. Jude's Ranch for Children, that transform \nthe lives of children and families in our community.\n  Our youth are an important part of our history and future. We must \nensure that children are protected and have a nurturing home that \nallows them to succeed. When a child suffers from abuse or neglect, the \nwhole community and country suffers with them. The services provided by \nSt. Jude's Ranch for Children ensure safety, health, and opportunity \nfor many of our Nation's children. Their work is appreciated and \nadmired, and I wish them continued success for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/senate-section/article/S2486-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2486-S2487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING RICHARD F. SCHOLZ, JR.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week the city of Quincy, in my home \nState of Illinois, lost a tough, principled, and fair public servant--\nbut more importantly, a fine man. Judge Richard F. Scholz, Jr., passed \naway at the age of 87.\n  Judge Scholz was the quintessential public servant. He was a voice \nfor the underprivileged and a passionate advocate for the most \nvulnerable in the community. He spent more than 24\n\n[[Page S2487]]\n\nyears as a judge, fighting for at risk youths and a more equitable \njuvenile justice system. Although Judge Scholz could be tough, he had a \nsofter side that put a gentle and compassionate face on the criminal \njustice system. He was celebrated in the courts for his well-reasoned \nand thoughtful decisions. Throughout his tenure, he was honored by \nseveral civic organizations and community groups, but it was dealing \none-on-one with people that gave him the greatest joy and satisfaction.\n  Chuck Scholz, former Quincy mayor and Judge Scholz's nephew, recalled \nmeeting a longtime Quincy resident who told him a story: ``Your uncle \nsent me to jail, and it was the best thing that ever happened to me.'' \nHe went on to explain how Judge Scholz visited him one day at the \ncorrectional facility in St. Charles. The reason for his visit? To make \nsure he got his diploma while he was incarcerated. And when he was \nreleased, Judge Scholz got him a job. That is the kind of man Judge \nScholz was. He understood that the job didn't end in his courtroom.\n  Judge Scholz believed in serving the community by serving the \nindividual. He knew the recipe for building strong, healthy communities \nwas getting the right people involved in the right way. And the \ncommunity was better for it.\n  Born in 1928, Judge Scholz grew up in Quincy and attended St. Francis \ngrade school, Quincy Notre Dame High School, St. Ambrose College, and \nthe University of Illinois. After college, he moved down south and \nreceived his law degree from Mercer University in Macon, GA. While \nstudying law, he met and married Ellen W. Scholz and shared 58 \nwonderful years before her death in 2009.\n  Following law school, the young couple returned to Quincy to raise \ntheir family and practice law with his father and brother. In 1958, he \nwas elected judge of the 8th Judicial Circuit and served as chief judge \nfrom 1975 to 1979. In 1982, Judge Scholz retired from the bench and \nreturned to private practice.\n  During his time on the bench, Judge Scholz presided over high profile \ncases, fought for higher pay for the county's chief probation officer \nand the Youth Home superintendent, and he worked tirelessly with \ncommunity leaders to build the Adams County Youth Home, now the Adams \nCounty Juvenile Detention Center--one of only nine facilities of its \nkind in Illinois.\n  Hanging above the doorway at the Scholz family farm, there was a sign \nthat read: ``You will only be a stranger here but once.'' Always \nwilling to offer a helping hand, Judge Scholz made time for everyone. \nHe helped young attorneys understand the right way to conduct \nthemselves in and out of the courtroom. As a mentor to countless \nattorneys, judges, and children, Judge Scholz's mark on the community \nwill endure for years.\n  I will close with one more story. Years ago, a mother from a Quincy \nfamily had been murdered. Her children were orphaned, and State welfare \nofficials planned on placing them into different foster homes. Judge \nScholz wouldn't hear of it. He said: ``No, you are not breaking up this \nfamily.'' The family stayed together, and there is a photo of them \nstanding around Judge Scholz, with the words: our hero, carved into the \npicture--a hero indeed.\n  The stories of Judge Scholz's kindness and affection to the children \nand families in Quincy go on and on--what a legacy and what a great \nfriend to the people of Quincy. Judge Scholz will certainly be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/senate-section/article/S2487-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2487-S2488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF MERRICK GARLAND\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday I had the honor of speaking at an \nevent hosted by the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the U.S. Senate on \nthis body's role in considering Supreme Court nominees. The institute \nis a wonderful organization ``dedicated to educating the public about \nthe important role of the Senate in our government.'' My friend Ted \nKennedy loved the Senate and worked hard every day here to improve the \nlives of the people of Massachusetts and the people of America. I thank \nVicki Kennedy for all of her efforts to build the institute. She has \nalso continued the Kennedy legacy by working to advance medical \nresearch and health care for all Americans. I was honored by her \ninvitation to speak at the event.\n  The institute's event was held on the important and timely issue of \nthe Senate's constitutional role in providing advice and consent on \nnominees to the Supreme Court. As Senator Kennedy once said, ``Few \nresponsibilities we have as Senators are more important than our \nresponsibility to advise and consent to the nominations by the \nPresident to the Supreme Court.'' Ted understood the momentous nature \nof Supreme Court nominations, as well as the Senate's undeniable and \nirreplaceable constitutional role in providing advice and consent on \nthe President's nominees.\n  And the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which Senator Kennedy and I \nserved together for years, plays a singularly important role in \nconsidering nominees to serve in our Federal judiciary. But that \ncritical role has been abdicated by the Senate Republicans' \nunprecedented decision to deny any process to Chief Judge Merrick \nGarland, who has been nominated to the Supreme Court.\n  In the last 100 years since public confirmation hearings began in the \nJudiciary Committee for Supreme Court nominees, the Senate has never \ndenied a nominee a hearing and a vote. No nominee has been treated the \nway Senate Republicans are treating Chief Judge Garland. Even when a \nmajority of the Judiciary Committee did not support a nominee, the \ncommittee still reported out the nomination for a vote on the Senate \nfloor. This allowed all Senators to exercise their duty to consider the \nnominee.\n  In fact, when I became chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 2001 \nduring the Bush administration, I and Senator Hatch--who was then the \nranking member--memorialized how the committee would continue in this \ntradition to consider President George W. Bush's Supreme Court \nnominees. In a letter to all Senators, Senator Hatch and I wrote, ``The \nJudiciary Committee's traditional practice has been to report Supreme \nCourt nominees to the Senate once the Committee has completed its \nconsiderations. This has been true even in cases where Supreme Court \nnominees were opposed by a majority of the Judiciary Committee.'' \nSenator Hatch and I agreed to that. And then-Majority Leader Trent Lott \nagreed, too, saying this back in 2001: ``the Senate has a long record \nallowing the Supreme Court nominees of the President to be given a vote \non the floor of the Senate.'' We all agreed to this because that is \nwhat we in the Senate have done for a century, in an open and \ntransparent manner, allowing the American people to see us doing our \nwork.\n  This is exactly what the Judiciary Committee should be doing this \nvery day. It has now been 42 days since Chief Judge Merrick Garland was \nnominated to the Supreme Court. If we follow the average confirmation \nschedule for Supreme Court nominees over the last 40 years, the \nJudiciary Committee should be convening a hearing today on Chief Judge \nGarland's nomination. The late Justice Scalia, whom Chief Judge Garland \nwould replace on the Court, received a hearing 42 days after his \nnomination. And Democrats were in charge when the Senate last voted on \na Supreme Court nominee in an election year when Justice Anthony \nKennedy was confirmed in 1988. Justice Kennedy received a hearing in \nthe Judiciary Committee just 14 days after President Reagan nominated \nhim. Had he been nominated at the same time as Chief Judge Garland, his \nhearings would already have been completed.\n  Last month, the Kennedy Institute released a national poll that \nshowed just 36 percent of Americans know that the Senate confirms \nSupreme Court nominees. Our response as Senators to this unfortunate \nfact should not be to deny Chief Judge Merrick Garland a public hearing \nand a vote, breaking 100 years of Senate tradition and failing to do \nour jobs as Senators. Instead, our response should be to engage with \nthe American people and to show them through our actions that the \nSenate can hold up its part of the constitutional framework.\n  And although many Americans may not be able to tell you that the \nSenate confirms Supreme Court nominees, a solid majority of the \nAmerican public does know--by a 2-to-1 margin--that Chief Judge Garland \ndeserves to have a hearing. That strong majority of the public is \ntelling us that the Senate should show up for work and carry out\n\n[[Page S2488]]\n\nits constitutional duty by holding a hearing for Chief Judge Garland.\n  We are hearing that call from so many around the country, including \nhistorians, faith groups, civil rights organizations, and legal \nleaders. In an op-ed yesterday, the president of the Vermont Bar \nAssociation, Jennifer Emens-Butler, and others, including a former \npresident of the American Bar Association, made clear that Republicans' \nobstruction of Chief Judge Garland's nomination undermines the rule of \nlaw. They wrote: ``As leaders in the legal profession, we are committed \nto protecting the rule of law. Thus, we cannot remain silent as the \nSenate refuses to consider Garland. This level of obstructionism is \nunprecedented in American history and undermines the rule of law, the \nvery foundation on which this great nation was built.'' I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of this op-ed be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  Some Republican Senators have claimed that their unprecedented \nobstruction against Chief Judge Garland is based on ``principle, not \nthe person.'' There is no principle in refusing to confirm Supreme \nCourt nominees in election years, as the Senate has done over a dozen \ntimes, most recently for President Reagan's last nominee to the Court. \nFurthermore, we have seen Republican Senators and outside interest \ngroups attack Chief Judge Garland's judicial record, but then refuse to \nallow him the chance to respond at a public hearing. This is not \nprincipled, it is not fair, and it is not right.\n  To deny Chief Judge Garland a public hearing and a vote would be \ntruly historic--but that is not the kind of history the Senate should \nbe proud of. Over the more than 40 years I have served in the Senate, I \nrecall times when the consideration of Supreme Court nominees was \ncontroversial.\n  But in every one of those instances, the nominee received a public \nhearing and a vote. We did not avoid doing our jobs simply because it \nwas hard.\n  We must remember why we are here in the United States Senate. We are \nall here to serve the American people by carrying out our sworn oaths \nto uphold the Constitution. Protection of our enduring constitutional \nsystem requires that we hold our constitutional duties as Senators \nabove the partisan politics of the now. I hope that Republicans will \nsoon reverse course and put aside their obstruction to move forward on \nChief Judge Garland's nomination.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From The Hill, Apr. 26, 2016]\n\n Senate's Refusal To Move on Garland Continues To Undermine Rule of Law\n\n     (By Monte Frank, James R. Silkenat, and Jennifer Emens-Butler)\n\n       A month ago, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Monte \n     Frank (one of the co-authors of this piece) warned that the \n     Senate's refusal to consider President Obama's nomination of \n     Chief Judge Merrick Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court would \n     undermine the rule of law. Despite this warning, the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee has continued its blocking tactics and \n     has rebuffed calls for hearings and a vote. As leaders in the \n     legal profession, we are committed to protecting the rule of \n     law. Thus, we cannot remain silent as the Senate refuses to \n     consider Garland. This level of obstructionism is \n     unprecedented in American history and undermines the rule of \n     law, the very foundation on which this great nation was \n     built.\n       The rule of law is the restriction of the arbitrary \n     exercise of power by subordinating such exercise to well-\n     defined and established laws. As discussed in the earlier \n     piece with Blumenthal, in the United States, the rule of law \n     is grounded in our Constitution, which unambiguously lays out \n     the process for filling vacancies to the Supreme Court. \n     Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution states the roles \n     the president and the Senate must play in the appointment \n     process: ``The President . . . shall nominate, and by and \n     with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . \n     . Judges of the Supreme Court.'' The Constitution is also \n     clear that the president's term is four years, not three or \n     three-and-one-fourth years.\n       Now that Obama has fulfilled his constitutional \n     responsibility and made a nomination promptly to fill the \n     current Supreme Court vacancy, the Constitution requires the \n     Senate to likewise fulfill its responsibility to consider and \n     act promptly on the nominee. The Senate needs to move forward \n     by holding meetings, conducting hearings and ultimately \n     taking a vote.\n       While Garland is preeminently qualified, having served as \n     chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia Circuit since 1997, whether the Senate \n     ultimately confirms him is an entirely different question \n     than whether the Senate should even consider him. The current \n     arbitrary exercise of power to deny Garland a hearing and a \n     vote is the kind of abuse the rule of law is designed to \n     protect us from. If the well-defined and established \n     provisions of the Constitution are permitted to be willfully \n     ignored, then the rule of law will be undermined.\n       In a letter to the leadership of the Senate, 15 past-\n     presidents of the American Bar Association emphasized their \n     utmost respect for the rule of law and the ``need for the \n     judicial system to function independently of partisan \n     influences. The founding fathers understood this as well, and \n     structured the constitutional system of government to \n     insulate the judiciary from changing political tides. The \n     stated refusal to fill the ninth seat of the Supreme Court \n     injects a degree of politics into the judicial branch that \n     materially hampers the effective operation of our nation's \n     highest court and the lower courts over which it presides.''\n       The Senate should follow the example set by President \n     Reagan and then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Joe Biden \n     (D-Del.) in considering Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was \n     confirmed in an election year. Reagan urged the nation to \n     ``join together in a bipartisan effort to fulfill our \n     constitutional obligation of restoring the United States \n     Supreme Court to full strength.'' He asked the Senate for \n     ``prompt hearings conducted in the spirit of cooperation and \n     bipartisanship.'' Biden responded: ``I'm glad the President \n     has made his choice. We will get the process under way and \n     move as rapidly as is prudent. We want to conduct the \n     committee's review with both thoroughness and dispatch.'' \n     Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) was also on the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee at that time. Now that he is the chair, he should \n     follow the example set by Reagan and Biden.\n       The Senate's refusal to process the nomination has already \n     impacted the lives of everyday people throughout the United \n     States. If lower court decisions are confirmed simply because \n     of a tie in the Supreme Court, as has already occurred and \n     will continue to occur until the vacancy is filled, then the \n     court will not have created precedent and the lower courts \n     will not be able to rely on those decisions. Open questions \n     of law on significant issues will continue to be left \n     unanswered. To fill this void, the Senate must move forward \n     on a bipartisan basis with meetings and hearings, \n     consideration of and a timely vote on the nominee.\n       President Reagan's words in 1988 on the confirmation of \n     Justice Kennedy are just as applicable today: ``The Federal \n     Judiciary is too important to be made a political football. I \n     would hope, and the American people should expect . . . for \n     the Senate to get to work and act.'' We urge the Senate to \n     put partisan politics aside for the good of the American \n     people and to avoid undermining the rule of law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/senate-section/article/S2488-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2488-S2489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PARIS CLIMATE CHANGE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I wish to speak in strong support of the \nUnited Nations' Paris climate change agreement and the President's \ndecision for the United States to be among the first nations to sign \nthe agreement.\n  Last Friday, April 22, the United States and more than 170 nations \ncame together in New York to sign the international climate agreement \nnegotiated last year that would slow global warming and help poorer \nnations most affected by it. I find it very symbolic that April 22, the \nfirst day that nations could officially sign the agreement, was also \nEarth Day. Earth Day is a reminder of our obligation to preserve and \nprotect our environment for our children and future generations to \ncome.\n  Last year, I joined nine of my Senate colleagues in Paris to attend \nthe 21st United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP \n21, where the climate agreement was negotiated. What we witnessed at \nCOP 21 was monumental: 195 countries, representing more than 95 percent \nof global carbon emissions, came together to adopt the first universal \nclimate agreement that calls for international cooperation on \naddressing the causes of global warming and helping poorer nations most \naffected by it.\n  I am proud to say that the United States was a big part of that \neffort. President Obama's leadership was key in encouraging China, the \nworld's largest emitter, to submit an aggressive climate action plan, \nand helping countries to find consensus necessary to make such a \nlandmark agreement.\n  The Paris agreement establishes a long-term, durable global framework \nfor countries to work together to reduce carbon emissions and keep the \nglobal temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius in order to avoid \nsome of the worst consequences of climate change. For the first time, \ncountries have committed to putting forward ambitious, nationally \ndetermined climate targets and reporting on their\n\n[[Page S2489]]\n\nprogress towards those targets using a standardized process of review. \nThe Paris agreement encourages transparency, accountability, and \ncollaboration among nations not only to meet their climate targets, but \nto encourage innovation while doing so.\n  No country is insulated from the increasingly present and escalating \neffects of climate change. In the United States, we are seeing it \nthroughout the country, and we are certainly feeling its effects in New \nHampshire. Rising temperatures are shortening our fall foliage season, \nwhich is so important to our State's tourism economy. Milder winters \nhave led to increases of insect-borne diseases that endanger our \nwildlife. In New Hampshire, we have already seen a 40 percent decline \nin our moose population. The changing climate is also putting more \nstress on sugar maples, and this is already affecting syrup production.\n  Investments to improve the resiliency of our communities at all \nlevels is critically important to our ability to mitigate the impacts \nof climate change. And that is what we are doing in New Hampshire. At \nthe grassroots and statewide, Granite Staters recognize the urgency of \naddressing climate change and are leading the way by reducing pollution \nand transitioning to a more efficient, clean energy economy.\n  For example, last month in Durham, the New Hampshire Climate Action \nCoalition joined with the University of New Hampshire to host a pancake \nbreakfast and discuss the negative impact of climate change on the \nmaple syrup industry. The event featured a panel of local maple syrup \nproducers, scientists, and others who understand the impacts that \nclimate change is having on forests and maple trees. Over 80 people \ncame together to enjoy maple syrup, hear the speakers, and take action \nto protect our environment.\n  New Hampshire is also a part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas \nInitiative, RGGI--the Nation's first regional cap-and-trade program \ndesigned to reduce harmful carbon emissions from the power sector. \nThrough our participation in RGGI, New Hampshire has reduced greenhouse \ngas emissions in the power sector by nearly 50 percent since 2008 and \nis on track to meet the administration's Clean Power Plan's carbon-\nreduction goals 10 years ahead of schedule.\n  The events happening in New Hampshire show that there truly is broad \nmomentum in the fight against climate change. But in order to achieve \nour goals, State and local actions must be accompanied by national and \ninternational involvement. This is why the international climate change \nagreement is so essential.\n  Under the Paris agreement, the United States has made a commitment to \nreduce carbon emissions by at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by \n2025. While this goal is indeed ambitious, it is something that we can \nachieve. By implementing administrative policies like the \nadministration's Clean Power Plan, which will reduce pollution from our \nNation's dirtiest power plants, and by doing what this Chamber did last \nweek, which was to take up and pass a comprehensive energy bill that \nwill encourage energy efficiency and improve our Nation's energy \npolicies, we can meet our commitments.\n  The United States must also be responsive to climate change's impact \non our friends in the world's least developed and most vulnerable \ncountries. As one of the world's largest emitters of carbon emissions, \nwe have a responsibility to the world on climate change.\n  Climate change represents an enormous challenge, but the solutions \nare within reach if we put into place policies that allow for swift \naction. The world must work together to ensure that the goals of the \nParis agreement are realized. We have a responsibility to help protect \nour children and grandchildren from the most severe consequences of \nglobal warming by reducing emissions now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/senate-section/article/S2489-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               101ST ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, last Sunday I had the opportunity to attend \nthe 101st anniversary commemoration of the Armenian genocide, hosted at \nthe Armenian Martyrs Memorial in Providence, RI. I was pleased to be \nable to join with so many in the Armenian community in my home State \nfor this solemn event.\n  Over a century ago, the Young Turk leaders of the Ottoman Empire \nsummoned and executed over 200 Armenian community leaders and \nintellectuals, beginning an 8-year campaign of oppression and massacre.\n  By 1923, an estimated 1\\1/2\\ million Armenians were killed, and over \na half a million survivors were exiled. These atrocities affected the \nlives of every Armenian living in Asia Minor and, indeed, throughout \nthe world. The survivors of the Armenian Genocide, however, persevered \ndue to their unbreakable spirit and steadfast resolve and went on to \ngreatly contribute to the lands in which they found new homes and \ncommunities, including the United States. This genocide should no \nlonger be denied, which is why I have joined with several of my \ncolleagues on resolutions over the years to encourage the United States \nto officially recognize the Armenian genocide.\n  But as we remember our history, we must also look to the present and \nto our future.\n  Violence against Armenians in Nogorno-Karabakh has escalated in \nrecent months. These attacks on the Armenian people are completely \nunacceptable and call into question the sincerity with which Azerbaijan \nhas approached recent peace negotiations. We must remain vigilant and \ndo all that we can to encourage Azerbaijan to return to the negotiating \ntable and make a good faith effort to ensure a lasting peace agreement \nin the region.\n  As ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I remain \ncommitted to supporting efforts to provide assistance to Armenia to \nstrengthen security, promote economic growth, and support democratic \nreforms and development.\n  We also must find a way to come together to recognize our past and to \nshow our unwavering support to those facing persecution today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/senate-section/article/S2489-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2489-S2490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR.

Dr. Wasem also testified before \ncongressional committees numerous times throughout her tenure at CRS, \nproviding testimony on issues ranging from asylum to unauthorized \nmigration to immigration and social policy data.\n  As CRS's immigration team leader, Dr. Wasem served as a mentor to all \nof the other team members, and she always displayed great generosity \nand selflessness in devoting time and energy to their professional \ndevelopment.\n  The Congressional Research Service has given Dr. Wasem a number of \noutstanding commendations and special achievement awards for \nlegislative analysis in the areas of immigration policy, Haitian \nrelief, health care reform, homeland security, temporary foreign \nworkers, and welfare reform.\n  Dr. Wasem recently spent a year as a Kluge Staff Fellow at the \nLibrary of Congress where she researched legislative efforts to end \nnational origins and race-based immigrant admissions to the United \nStates, all of which culminated in the Immigration Act of 1965. During \nher time as a Kluge Fellow, Dr. Wasem was awarded the Abba P. Schwartz \nResearch Fellowship, which is administered by the John F.\n\n[[Page S2490]]\n\nKennedy Library Foundation, to further her research in this area.\n  During her 29 years at CRS--and her 2 years of previous Federal \nservice--Dr. Wasem won the respect and admiration of her colleagues. \nHer steadfast dedication to serve Congress and her commitment to the \nhighest standards of analytic, unbiased, and timely response to \ncongressional requests for information and analysis have made a \npositive and lasting contribution to the congressional policy \ndiscourse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/senate-section/article/S2490-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    REMEMBERING DR. BETTYE CALDWELL\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Dr. Bettye \nCaldwell, who pioneered early childhood education in the United States.\n  Dr. Caldwell's groundbreaking research at Syracuse University in the \n1960s paved the way for the national Head Start Program and was the \ninspiration for countless researchers and programs to educate young \nchildren in the United States and around the world.\n  She received her bachelor's degree from Baylor University in 1945 and \nwent on to earn a master's from the University of Iowa and her \ndoctorate from Washington University in St. Louis.\n  As a developmental psychologist, her work with pediatrician Dr. \nJulius B. Richmond convinced her of the need infants and toddlers have \nfor emotional and cognitive support. They focused on the development \ngap for children in disadvantaged homes and sought to combine childcare \nwith education, while keeping families strong. With this mission, she \nfounded and directed the Children's Center in Syracuse, NY. It was the \nfirst enrichment program for young children in the United States.\n  Dr. Caldwell and her husband, Dr. Fred Caldwell, moved to Little \nRock, AR, in 1969, where she became the principal of the Kramer School. \nUnder her leadership, ``the Kramer Project'' gained national attention \nas the site of the Center for Early Development and Education. Bettye's \nfamily notes that she considered the Kramer School her most significant \nwork.\n  She joined the faculty of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock \nin the mid-1970s and continued at the university for almost 20 years. \nUALR chancellor Joel E. Anderson noted recently, ``Dr. Caldwell changed \nthe way parents and policymakers understood early childhood \ndevelopment.'' She eventually retired from UAMS College of Medicine as \na professor of pediatrics in child development.\n  Many scholars know her best as one of the developers of the HOME \nresearch tool that helps observe the impact of a supportive home \nenvironment on a child's development. It is used today by researchers \naround the world.\n  A popular speaker and prolific writer, Dr. Caldwell spoke in all 50 \nStates and many foreign countries. She published more than 300 articles \nand edited several books. She served as president of the National \nAssociation for the Education of Young Children and gave her time and \nknowledge to organizations in Arkansas and throughout the Nation.\n  She received many honors and awards for her work, including being \nnamed Woman of the Year by Ladies Home Journal in 1978. Later in life, \nshe was honored with the prestigious Dolley Madison Award for \nOutstanding Lifelong Contribution in 2001.\n  Dr. Caldwell passed away on Sunday, April 17, 2016, at the age of 91. \nIn addition to her incredible professional contributions, her family \nnoted, ``There was just little that Bettye could not do.'' She was \nmarried for 58 years to her college sweetheart, raised twins--her son \nPaul Caldwell and daughter Elizabeth Lawson--and adored her two \ngranddaughters, Becca Ray and Rachel Caldwell. She was a talented \nseamstress, gourmet cook, and gardener. She loved to sing and enjoyed \nhaving guests in her home.\n  I am honored to work with Dr. Caldwell's granddaughter, Becca, and to \nknow what an extraordinary legacy she left as an educator, researcher, \nmother, and grandmother. She was a true leader and pioneer whose work \nwill continue to impact millions of children each day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/senate-section/article/S2490-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:51 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, with an amendment, in which it request the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       S. 1523.

This American System of \n     Conservation Funding is a user pays--public benefits approach \n     that includes excise taxes on hunting, fishing, and boating \n     equipment.

The \n     reauthorization of these\n\n[[Page S2492]]\n\n     programs as well as the creation of new programs will enhance \n     opportunities for outdoor recreation enthusiasts, improve \n     access to public lands, and help boost the outdoor recreation \n     economy.

A bill to amend section 3606 of title 18, United States \nCode, to grant probation officers authority to arrest hostile third \nparties who obstruct or impede a probation officer in the performance \nof official duties; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Probation Officer \nProtection Act, which I introduced today with Senator Feinstein. I \nwould like to begin by thanking Senator Feinstein for cosponsoring this \nbill and also thank Representatives Reichert and Pascrell for \nintroducing companion legislation in the House.\n  Under current law, a Federal probation officer may arrest a \nprobationer or individual on supervised release if the officer has \nprobable cause to believe that the offender has violated a condition of \nhis or her probation or release. The officer may make the arrest with \nor without a warrant.\n  In practice, formal arrests by probation officers are rare. Rather, \nprobation officers use this authority to lawfully engage in less \nrestrictive uses of force, such as ordering an offender to stand aside \nduring a search; instructing an offender not to interfere with the \nofficer's movements; or, in rare cases, temporarily restraining an \noffender who poses a physical danger.\n  Current law does not, however, address a probation officer's arrest \nauthority in situations where a third party attempts to physically \nobstruct the officer or cause the officer physical harm. Although \nobstructing a probation officer in the performance of his or her \nofficial duties is illegal, when a probation officer encounters an \nuncooperative or violent third party, the officer may be forced to \nretreat because he or she lacks authority to restrain the third party. \nThis lack of authority and resulting need to retreat exposes probation \nofficers to greater risk of harm and allows the third party--along with \nany evidence or individual the third party is attempting to shield--to \nelude capture. As a result, evidence that an offender has violated a \ncondition of his or her probation or supervised release, or evidence of \nother criminal activity, may be lost.\n  In some circumstances, a probation officer may be able to enlist the \nassistance of local police in responding to a hostile third party. But \nthis is not, in and of itself, an adequate solution. First, unless the \nprobation officer knows in advance that he or she is likely to \nencounter a hostile third party and can find an available police \nofficer to accompany him or her, the probation officer must wait for \npolice backup to arrive. This is often not a viable option. Second, \neven if a local police officer is available to accompany the probation \nofficer, because the probation officer lacks arrest authority, he or \nshe cannot lawfully assist the police officer if the police officer is \naccosted. Third, requiring federal probation officers to rely on local \nlaw enforcement in responding to uncooperative or violent third parties \nburdens local police departments and diverts police resources from \nother uses.\n  My bill addresses these problems by authorizing Federal probation \nofficers to arrest a third party if there is probable cause to believe \nthe third party has forcibly assaulted, resisted, opposed, impeded, \nintimidated, or interfered with the officer, or a fellow probation \nofficer, while the officer was engaged in the performance of official \nduties. This language parallels 18 U.S.C. Sec. 111, which makes it a \ncrime to forcibly assault, resist, oppose, impede, intimidate, or \ninterfere with an officer or employee of the United States while the \nofficer or employee is engaged in the performance of official duties.\n  The bill additionally provides that this arrest authority shall be \nexercised in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts.\n  It is important to note, that this legislation does not give \nprobation officers general arrest authority. Rather, it merely \nauthorizes arrest in the narrow circumstance where a third party \nforcibly interferes with a probation officer in the course of the \nofficer's performance of his or her official duties. This limited \narrest authority will protect officers, offenders, and third parties \nalike by preventing obstruction from escalating to actual violence, \nconsistent with the rehabilitative mission of the Federal probation \nsystem. State probation officers in many jurisdictions have similar \nthird-party arrest authority.\n  This legislation has the strong support of the Administrative Office \nof the U.S. Courts, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, \nand numerous other law enforcement groups. It will make a meaningful \ndifference in the lives of our Federal probation officers and local \npolice officers and in the homes and communities they serve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/senate-section/article/S2495-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2495-S2496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 442--CONDEMNING THE TERRORIST ATTACKS IN BRUSSELS AND \n  HONORING THE MEMORY OF THE UNITED STATES CITIZENS MURDERED IN THOSE \n    ATTACKS, AND OFFERING THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS FOR ALL THE VICTIMS, \n CONDOLENCES TO THEIR FAMILIES, RESOLVE TO SUPPORT THE BELGIAN PEOPLE, \n  AND THE PLEDGE TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY AND STAND IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE \n    COUNTRY OF BELGIUM AND ALL OUR ALLIES IN THE FACE OF CONTINUING \n                TERRORIST ATTACKS ON FREEDOM AND LIBERTY\n\n  Mr. CORKER (for himself and Mr. Cardin) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 442\n\n       Whereas, on March 22, 2016, three suicide bombers and their \n     accomplices conducted three coordinated terrorist attacks \n     across the city of Brussels, Belgium, killing at least 32 \n     civilians and wounding over 340 innocent men, women, and \n     children;\n       Whereas these terrorist attacks were conducted in order to \n     maximize casualties, the 7:58 a.m. explosions targeted the \n     Brussels-Zaventem Airport morning rush and the 9:10 a.m. \n     metro attack targeted those commuting to and from the \n     Maelbeek metro station, which is near the United States \n     Embassy and the European Union headquarters buildings;\n       Whereas evidence suggests that these attacks explicitly \n     targeted United States interests by placing explosive devices \n     in front of the American Airlines, Delta, and United Airlines \n     check-in counters;\n       Whereas the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) has \n     claimed responsibility for these attacks, which marks the \n     second time in just over four months that ISIS has used \n     suicide bombers to attack innocent civilians in a Western \n     European capital;\n       Whereas the world still grieves for those innocent lives \n     lost and injured in Paris, the 129 murdered civilians and the \n     350 injured men, women, and children;\n       Whereas Charles Michel, the Prime Minister of Belgium, has \n     responded to these horrors by calling for solidarity: \n     ``[W]hat we feared has happened.

Res. 446\n\n       Whereas 9-1-1 is recognized throughout the United States as \n     the number to call in an emergency to receive immediate help \n     from police, fire, emergency medical services, or other \n     appropriate emergency response entities;\n       Whereas, in 1967, the President's Commission on Law \n     Enforcement and Administration of Justice recommended that a \n     ``single number should be established'' nationwide for \n     reporting emergency situations, and various Federal \n     Government agencies and governmental officials supported and \n     encouraged the recommendation;\n       Whereas, in 1968, the American Telephone and Telegraph \n     Company (commonly known as ``AT'') announced that it would \n     establish the digits 9-1-1 as the emergency code throughout \n     the United States;\n       Whereas Congress designated 9-1-1 as the national emergency \n     call number in the Wireless Communications and Public Safety \n     Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-81; 113 Stat. 1286);\n       Whereas section 102 of the ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004 (47 \n     U.S.C. 942 note) declared an enhanced 9-1-1 system to be ``a \n     high national priority'' and part of ``our Nation's homeland \n     security and public safety'';\n       Whereas it is important that policy makers at all levels of \n     government understand the importance of 9-1-1, how the 9-1-1 \n     system works, and the steps that are needed to modernize the \n     9-1-1 system;\n       Whereas the 9-1-1 system is the connection between the eyes \n     and ears of the public and the emergency response system in \n     the United States and is often the first place emergencies of \n     all magnitudes are reported, making 9-1-1 a significant \n     homeland security asset;\n       Whereas more than 6,000 9-1-1 public safety answering \n     points serve more than 3,000 counties and parishes throughout \n     the United States;\n       Whereas telecommunicators at public safety answering points \n     answer more than 200,000,000 9-1-1 calls each year in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas a growing number of 9-1-1 calls are made using \n     wireless and Internet Protocol-based communications services;\n       Whereas a growing segment of the population of the United \n     States, including individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing, \n     or deaf-blind, or who have speech disabilities, is \n     increasingly communicating with nontraditional text, video, \n     and instant messaging communications services and expects \n     those services to be able to connect directly to 9-1-1;\n       Whereas the growth and variety of means of communication, \n     including mobile and Internet Protocol-based systems, impose \n     challenges for accessing 9-1-1 and implementing an enhanced \n     9-1-1 system and require increased education and awareness \n     about the capabilities of different means of communication;\n       Whereas numerous other ``N-1-1'' and 800 number services \n     exist for nonemergency situations, including 2-1-1, 3-1-1, 5-\n     1-1, 7-1-1, 8-1-1, poison control centers, and mental health \n     hotlines, and the public needs to be educated on when to use \n     those services in addition to or instead of 9-1-1;\n       Whereas international visitors and immigrants make up an \n     increasing percentage of the population of the United States \n     each year, and visitors and immigrants may have limited \n     knowledge of the emergency calling system in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas people of all ages use 9-1-1 and it is critical to \n     educate people on the proper use of 9-1-1;\n       Whereas senior citizens are highly likely to need to access \n     9-1-1 and many senior citizens are learning to use new \n     technology;\n       Whereas thousands of 9-1-1 calls are made every year by \n     children properly trained in the use of 9-1-1, which saves \n     lives and underscores the critical importance of training \n     children early in life about 9-1-1;\n       Whereas the 9-1-1 system is often misused, including by the \n     placement of prank and nonemergency calls;\n       Whereas misuse of the 9-1-1 system results in costly and \n     inefficient use of 9-1-1 and emergency response resources and \n     needs to be reduced;\n       Whereas parents, teachers, and all other caregivers need to \n     play an active role in 9-1-1 education for children, but can \n     do so only after first being educated themselves;\n       Whereas there are many avenues for 9-1-1 public education, \n     including safety fairs, school presentations, libraries, \n     churches, businesses, public safety answering point tours or \n     open houses, civic organizations, and senior citizen centers;\n\n[[Page S2498]]\n\n       Whereas children, parents, teachers, and the National \n     Parent Teacher Association make vital contributions to the \n     education of children about the importance of 9-1-1 through \n     targeted outreach efforts to public and private school \n     systems;\n       Whereas the United States should strive to host at least 1 \n     educational event regarding the proper use of 9-1-1 in every \n     school in the country every year;\n       Whereas programs to promote proper use of 9-1-1 during \n     National 9-1-1 Education Month could include--\n       (1) public awareness events, including conferences, media \n     outreach, and training activities for parents, teachers, \n     school administrators, other caregivers, and businesses;\n       (2) educational events in schools and other appropriate \n     venues; and\n       (3) production and distribution of information about the 9-\n     1-1 system designed to educate people of all ages on the \n     importance and proper use of 9-1-1; and\n       Whereas the people of the United States deserve the best \n     education regarding the use of 9-1-1: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2016 as ``National 9-1-1 Education \n     Month''; and\n       (2) urges governmental officials, parents, teachers, school \n     administrators, caregivers, businesses, nonprofit \n     organizations, and the people of the United States to observe \n     the month with appropriate ceremonies, training events, and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/27/senate-section/article/S2498-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3878.
