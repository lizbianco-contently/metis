Mr. President, today not only will Congress pass a \nbudget for the first time in 6 years, it will pass a balanced budget \nfor the first time in recent memory. This is something many Americans \nhave been waiting a long time to see. It is something they deserve, and \nit is just the latest example of a new Congress that is back to work--\nback to work on behalf of Americans who work hard and expect Washington \nto do the same.\n  No budget will ever be perfect, but this is a budget that sensibly \naddresses the concerns of many different Members. It reflects honest \ncompromise from many different Members with many, many different \npriorities.\n  It includes additional resources and flexibility for national \ndefense. It reduces spending, and it balances without raising taxes. \nThat is especially impressive when one considers the type of budget the \nWhite House proposed--one that never balanced--ever--but still tried to \nraise taxes by nearly $2 trillion.\n  That White House budget was so unserious that only a single Member of \nthe President's party could be persuaded to publicly support it here in \nthe Senate. Perhaps that is because it proposed to double down on the \nfailed policies of the past: more overspending, more debt, more taxes, \nand hardly any reform.\n  So the White House fantasy budget may have made the left happy, but \nthe new Congress believed the American people deserved better. We \noffered a budget that is more than just balanced; it is also oriented \ntoward growth. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice, the budget we will approve today contains ideas that could \nboost jobs and grow our economy.\n  It would embrace the energy revolution and provide for more \nenvironmentally responsible innovation. It would repeal unfair taxes, \nsuch as those in ObamaCare, and set the table for more comprehensive \nreform of our outdated Tax Code.\n  Because this budget is about embracing the future, it also gives us \nthe tools to leave ObamaCare's broken promises and higher costs where \nthey belong--in the past--in favor of a fresh start with the \nopportunity for real health reform.\n  This budget is also about protecting the vulnerable. It aims \nresponsibly to improve and modernize programs such as Medicare, so they \nwill continue to be there when Americans need them. After all, we know \nthat failing to make commonsense improvements to save these types of \nprograms today will mean allowing draconian cuts to fall on the \nvulnerable in the years to come.\n  The balanced budget before us went through the normal committee \nprocess. Members of both parties debated it vigorously on the floor. \nThey offered more amendments than just about anyone can count, and then \na conference committee met to work out the differences between the \nversion of this balanced budget passed by the House and the one we \npassed here in the Senate. That is the way the process is supposed to \nwork. That is the way Congress is supposed to function.\n  The budget reflects a lot of hard work from a lot of individuals. I \nwould particularly like to thank Chairman Mike Enzi and his counterpart \nin the House, Chairman Tom Price, as well as every member of the \nconference committee, for their tireless efforts to agree on a \nframework that can pass.\n  The balanced budget they produced won't solve every challenge, but it \nis a measure that will move us further down the path of positive \nreform. It is a budget that aims to make government more efficient, \nmore effective, and more accountable to the middle class. And it is a \nreminder that the new Republican majority is getting Congress back to \nwork for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/05/senate-section/article/S2611-6", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2611-S2612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    BIPARTISAN CONGRESSIONAL TRADE PRIORITIES AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on another matter, once the budget is \napproved, we will continue our work on\n\n[[Page S2612]]\n\nthe bipartisan Iran bill. Then it is my hope to turn to another \nbipartisan measure, the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and \nAccountability Act--TPA.\n  This bill would enhance Congress's role in the trade process while \nensuring Presidents of either party have the necessary tools to secure \nstrong, enforceable trade agreements for American workers. Here is why \nthat is important. Without this bipartisan legislation, American \nworkers and farmers, including from my home State of Kentucky, will not \nbe able to reap the rewards of selling more made-in-America goods to \nplaces such as Europe and the Pacific.\n  This is a bill we should all want to support. So it won't surprise \nanyone to hear this bill has substantial bipartisan support. It even \npassed the Committee on Finance on an overwhelming vote of 20 to 6--20 \nto 6.\n  But of course we have already heard of an attempt to stand in the way \nof this bipartisan effort to debate this legislation. We have already \nheard of yet another effort to make a partisan stand against a \nbipartisan accomplishment that would help grow opportunities for our \nconstituents.\n  So yes, some may oppose allowing American workers to compete and win \nin new markets. Some may not be all that excited about selling more \nproducts stamped ``Made in America'' to places such as Europe and the \nPacific. But the reality is the American people deserve more \nopportunities, not more special interest roadblocks.\n  That is why I plan, with the support of Members of both parties, to \nturn to the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and \nAccountability Act once we finish the Iran bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/05/senate-section/article/S2612-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the history of Cinco de Mayo is one that is \nlargely unfamiliar to most Americans, but to Mexican Americans it is \nvery familiar. It is a shame we don't know more about it because the \nstory of Cinco de Mayo is one of inspiration. It is the tale of a small \nmilitary force that was vastly outnumbered but refused to capitulate.\n  At the Battle of Puebla, 153 years ago, a small Mexican Army force \nfound itself outnumbered two to one by the French. The outmatched \nsoldiers refused to give up. They couldn't. That was not in their \nmakeup. The future of Mexico rested on their shoulders. Unbelievably, \nin spite of seemingly insurmountable odds, the Mexican Army refused to \ngive up.\n  That is what we celebrate today--Cinco de Mayo. It is not just \nMexican culture and history, but also the resilient spirit that refuses \nto capitulate. Our United States is better off because of that spirit \nengendered by millions of Mexican Americans and, indeed, the entire \nLatino community. It is that same spirit today that injects new life \ninto our communities. It is that same spirit possessed by generations \nof Mexican Americans that has fueled the economics and vibrancy of \ncommunities throughout the Southwest. It is that same spirit that \nempowers Latino students to push themselves to new heights. And it is \nthat same indomitable spirit that inspires Hispanic Americans to defend \nour country on the front lines around the world, as they have done for \nmany, many decades.\n  Hispanic heritage in this country has never been stronger. Now it \nfalls upon us, as Members of Congress, to support Mexican Americans and \nthe greater Latino community to reach the promise of the American \ndream. We can do that by investing in working American families, not by \nkicking families off their health insurance, as my friend the \nRepublican leader spoke of in this budget that is balanced in name \nonly. Really, you can keep talking about how balanced something is, but \nif it is unbalanced, it is still unbalanced.\n  The Republicans want to repeal ObamaCare for 16.5 million people--and \non and on with all the things that are good in that legislation and \nthat have so changed America. In this budget, they want to strip \nchildren's financial aid to go to college or cut job training \nprograms--and on and on with what they want to do in this budget.\n  They talk about this great meeting that took place to come up with \nthis final bill in conference. That conference took about 10 minutes. \nThey knew what they wanted to do, and they did it very quickly. The \nRepublican budget is unfair, it is unbalanced, it is unwise, and, as \nsome have said, it is immoral.\n  So as we celebrate Cinco de Mayo today, I hope we will remember that \nunrelenting Mexican spirit that prevailed on the battlefield 153 years \nago. But more importantly, I hope we will recognize that the same \nspirit is among us today, in the homes of Mexican Americans across \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/05/senate-section/article/S2612-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2612-S2613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HIGHWAY TRUST FUND AND FISA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on another matter, the Senate has a lot to \ndo before the recess for Memorial Day. We need to finish the Corker-\nCardin Iran legislation. We need to wrap up work on the budget \nresolution. But in addition to those two important pieces of \nlegislation, there are other pressing needs. Surface transportation \nexpires while we are on recess.\n  The highway trust fund runs out of money, and the authorization for \nthe Federal highway program expires later this month. There are 63,500 \nbridges that are structurally deficient, and more than 50 percent of \nour roads are in disrepair. That is according to the Federal Highway \nAdministration. Without reliable funding, our highways and bridges will \nonly get worse, and that is an understatement.\n  Six States already are delaying or canceling important transportation \nprojects because of questions over future funding--Arkansas, Delaware, \nGeorgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Wyoming.\n  The ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, the senior Senator \nfrom Vermont, said today that in Vermont--this tiny State, area-wise \nand population-wise, with about 600,000 people in it--their \nconstruction timeframe is very, very narrow. They can't do construction \nduring most of the year. They need to plan way ahead of time, and they \ncan't do that if there is nothing to plan. States need certainty from \nWashington that they will receive their highway dollars before \nconstruction leaders put shovels in the ground.\n  Nevada needs that certainty. Tourism in Nevada welcomes over 50 \nmillion visitors annually, resulting in 17 billion miles traveled over \nour roads and highways. Nevada has $47.3 billion in statewide \ntransportation needs. That is just one State.\n  We must ensure our Nation's highway system has the necessary funds to \naddress the pressing needs, and they are not there. Transportation \nwould be the first easy place to find agreement in Congress, and it is \nhard to comprehend, but the Republican majority in the Senate has not \nheld a single hearing on this most important piece of legislation--not \na single hearing, nothing.\n\n  We want to work with Republicans to address our Nation's crumbling \ninfrastructure. We understand the importance of transportation \ninvestment for working families across the country. Yet, stunningly, \nRepublicans have effectively put our Nation's transportation system on \nthe back burner. Hearing the Republican leader's statement this \nmorning, I guess that is going to continue. Procrastination is \ndangerous to American drivers and hurtful to our economy. The U.S. \nhighway system is central to our Nation's economic competitiveness. It \nis how we move goods and services. It is central to American families \nwho use our roads and bridges each day to go to work and take their \nchild to school. Congress should do more to support these working \nfamilies and businesses.\n  For every $1 billion we spend on infrastructure projects, we create \n47,500 jobs. Without strong Federal infrastructure funding, the \nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers predicts that our country could \nlose $1 trillion in sales. That is almost 3.5 million jobs. Putting \ncritical transportation investments on the back burner is not an \neffective way to govern, and I would hope we can have something done on \nhighways before we go home for our recess. How can we be home in good \nconscience and say we tried but couldn't get it done?\n\n[[Page S2613]]\n\n  We also have to reform and reauthorize FISA, the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act. It is one thing that has kept us safe. The FISA \nprovisions were expanded in the PATRIOT Act and they expire June 1. \nSenators Leahy and Lee, a bipartisan team of Senators, have introduced \na bill that would reform these important provisions so they strike the \nright balance between protecting our Nation's security and preserving \nAmerica's civil liberties. An identical bill was reported out of the \nHouse Judiciary Committee with a strong bipartisan vote of 25 to 2. The \nHouse is out this week, but I hope they take it up next week. I am told \nthey are going to. This is an issue that warrants our full debate and \ndeserves the Senate's attention before we leave. We have a lot to do \nand not much time. I hope Senate Republicans will help us move these \nimportant pieces of legislation without allowing either one to lapse. \nThat is going out of business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/05/senate-section/article/S2613-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Pursuant to section 305(c) of the \nCongressional Budget Act, there will now be up to 10 hours of debate \nequally divided.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today we have the historic opportunity to \nput our country on not just another course but a better course. This is \nbecause Congress is poised to approve its first balanced 10-year budget \nsince 2001. This balanced budget represents a ``lean in'' moment for a \nCongress under new management to confront rapidly growing deficits \nborne from our government's habitual overspending which plagues America \nand its taxpayers.\n  Understanding this historical context is critical because our Nation \ncurrently faces one of the largest forecasted deficits since the end of \nWorld War II. The joint Senate-House budget agreement, which produces \nbillion-dollar surpluses in its final years, would be an accomplishment \nunequaled since 1947.\n  The new leadership in the Senate is committed to getting back to \nwork, which will allow us to begin rebuilding the trust of working \nAmericans. Instead of allowing political points and partisan gridlock \nto take precedence over responsible governing, we are once again doing \nthe people's business.\n  Make no mistake--America faces overwhelming odds as we work to steer \nour ship of state to more sustainable and fiscally responsible waters. \nEven as we take in record revenues and taxes, our Nation is still \nunable to live within its means. As some of America's greatest leaders \nhave previously noted, these challenges are not undertaken because they \nare easy but because they are hard.\n  Americans who work every day to pay their taxes and provide for their \nfamilies understand that it is time for the Federal Government to live \nwithin its means, just as they do. Just imagine if these families spent \nand borrowed the way the Federal Government does. It would mean that a \nfamily with a median income of $52,000 would spend $61,000 a year. The \nfamily would add an additional $9,000 to the $311,000 they already \nwould owe on their credit card. American families know they cannot live \non borrowed money, and neither can the Federal Government. This \nbalanced budget shows these families that if they can do it, so can we.\n  As with any budget, it is important to let the numbers speak on how \nthis proposal helps make America stronger and more secure. This joint \nSenate-House congressional budget balances the budget within 10 years \nwithout raising taxes. It achieves more than $5 trillion in savings. It \nproduces a $32 billion surplus in 2024 and a $24 billion surplus in \n2025 and stays in balance. It boosts the Nation's economy by more than \n$400 billion in additional economic growth over the next 10 years, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office. It is expected to grow \n1.2 million additional jobs over the next 10 years, again based on the \nCongressional Budget Office data.\n  This balanced budget achieves real results and allows the Federal \nGovernment to support Americans when it must and get out of the way \nwhen it should.\n  Let me tell you about some of the highlights of this budget \nagreement.\n\n[[Page S2614]]\n\n  The balanced budget ensures a strong national defense. It invests in \nour military personnel and the readiness of our Armed Forces in the \ncurrent global threat environment. It ensures that defense spending \nreflects the commitment of Congress to keep America safe and ensure \nthat our military personnel are prepared to tackle all challenges, both \nat home and abroad.\n  The balanced budget provides for repeal and replacement of ObamaCare. \nIt provides for the repeal of ObamaCare, including all of its taxes, \nregulations, and mandates. It paves the way for real health care \nreforms to strengthen the doctor-patient relationship, expand choices, \nlower health care costs, and improve access to quality, affordable, \ninnovative health care. In other words, it delivers on what the \nPresident promised but never delivered. It focuses reconciliation \ninstructions on the key congressional committees with jurisdiction over \nObamaCare: the Senate Finance Committee; the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee; the House Energy and Commerce Committee; \nthe House Education and the Workforce Committee; and the House Ways and \nMeans Committee.\n  The balanced budget preserves Medicare. It preserves Medicare and \nprotects seniors' access to health care by extending the life of the \nMedicare hospital insurance trust fund. It repeals the Independent \nPayment Advisory Board--IPAB--the unelected, unaccountable board of 15 \nbureaucrats created by the President's health care law that will make \ndecisions on benefit cuts. It accounts for the recent enactment of \nlegislation that addressed the Medicare Program's sustainable growth \nrate--SGR--or more commonly called the doc fix.\n\n  The balanced budget supports stronger economic growth. It boosts U.S. \neconomic growth and private sector job creation by balancing the \nbudget, reducing the debt, and putting a halt to government \noverspending to reduce the cost of work and investment, as well as the \ncost of starting and growing a business.\n  It expands the Nation's economy by more than $400 billion over the \nnext 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, under the \nold way of doing the accounting.\n  It provides an estimated 1.2 million jobs for the U.S. economy by \n2025, based on data provided by the Congressional Budget Office in its \ntraditional ways of evaluating.\n  It boosts the Nation's gross national product by 1.4 percent per \nperson after accounting for inflation by 2025, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office. This boost in economic growth will all \ncome from the private sector. Government spending does not contribute \nto its growth. As my fellow Budget Committee member and businessman \nSenator Perdue notes, expanding government does not help grow the \neconomy.\n  The balanced budget improves accountability and effectiveness of \ngovernment. It is important to note that a balanced budget will help \nmake our government more efficient, effective, and accountable. If \ngovernment programs are not delivering results, they should be \nimproved, and if they are not needed, they ought to be eliminated.\n  This agreement between the Senate and House will help Congress \nprioritize and demand results from our government programs. There is no \ndoubt that this will be challenging for every single Member of \nCongress, but I believe we are up to the task because the American \npeople are counting on us.\n  This budget agreement improves transparency, efficiency, \neffectiveness, and accountability of the Federal Government by cutting \nwaste, eliminating redundancies, and enacting regulatory reform, and \nthere is plenty of that out there we have not looked at yet.\n  It calls for modernizing Medicaid by increasing State flexibility and \nprotecting those most in need of assistance.\n  It improves honest and responsible accounting practices as part of \nthe Federal budget process by ensuring that fair-value accounting \nestimates are used, which provide a more honest accounting method. This \nis in addition to the honest, dynamic scoring method that more \naccurately tells us what legislation will cost hard-working taxpayers.\n  It improves the administration and coordination of benefits, and it \nincreases employment opportunities for disabled workers.\n  This budget also calls on Congress to pass a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. That point is especially important \nbecause we must show taxpayers that Congress is committed to a balanced \nbudget and not to overspending, so we can make our government more \neffective. But we are running out of time.\n  Currently, lawmakers in 27 States have passed applications for a \nconvention to approve a balanced budget amendment and new applications \nin 9 other States are close behind. If we had 34 States, that would \ncause us to have a constitutional convention to balance the budget. If \njust seven of those nine States approve moving forward on the balanced \nbudget issue, it will bring the total number of applications to 34 \nStates. This would meet the two-thirds requirement under article V of \nthe Constitution and force Congress to take action.\n  The other side often says they cut the Federal deficit in half during \nthe President's term in office, but I think using the word ``deficit'' \nis meant to be confusing. People think he reduced the debt by one-half. \nActually, the President has increased the Nation's debt dramatically. \nWhat we are talking about when we say ``deficit'' is the amount of \noverspending, the amount we spend compared to what we bring in. Yes, \nthat is deficit, but it is overspending, and if we call it \noverspending, it will not be confused with bringing down the national \ndebt, which is not even touched and which under the President's budget \nonly gets worse.\n  In his most recent budget released earlier this year, the President \nproposed a plan that never balances and includes huge spending \nincreases. It also includes a $2.1 trillion tax increase--that is \n$2,100 billion of tax increases--while it adds $8.5 billion--or $8,500 \nmillion--to the national debt. The Senate recently voted on his budget, \nand it was rejected 99 to 1.\n  There is no question that balancing the budget is a daunting task. \nLast year, our Nation overspent by $468 billion, which, if left \nunchecked, is set to rise to $1,000 billion. We are in control of \n$1,100 billion in discretionary spending, and this year we will spend \n$468 billion more than we take in. I will repeat that. We are only in \ncontrol of $1,100 billion in discretionary spending, and this year we \nwill spend $468 billion more than we take in.\n  This is an unsustainable financial path, and if Congress did what \nevery American family has to do--live within our means--we would have \nto cut our annual discretionary spending in half. That would be a 50-\npercent cut.\n  This is because we spend 1\\1/2\\ times what we take in for items on \nwhich we can make decisions. No family or State government can do that \nfor very long, but the Federal Government does it every year.\n  Our budget is not perfect, but it is a start. It provides Congress \nand the Nation with a fiscal blueprint that challenges lawmakers to \nexamine every dollar we spend.\n  This is crucial because we currently spend over $230 billion in \ninterest on our debt every year, and that is at an interest rate of 1.7 \npercent. The Congressional Budget Office tells us that every 1 \npercentage point that our interest rates rise will increase America's \noverspending by $1,745 billion over the next 10 years.\n  We have a looming debt of $18 trillion on its way to $27 trillion. If \nour interest rates were to rise to 5 percent, which is the historical \nnorm, we will have to spend almost $700 billion annually, out of the \n$1,100 billion we get to make decisions on, to pay the interest on our \ndebt. This would be catastrophic for our Nation's economy. It is vital \nthat we address this situation now while we still have some choices.\n  To provide a clearer picture of how dire our Nation's fiscal outlook \nis, if we were forced to balance the budget in 1 year, we would have to \neliminate most of our defense spending, most of our highway spending, \nand most of our education spending. This drastic 50-percent cut would \nbe needed because of our consistent overspending and our interest \npayments, which are set to explode.\n  What are the two best ways to make a difference?\n\n[[Page S2615]]\n\n  First, Congress should look at the more than 260 programs whose \nauthorization--the right to spend money--has expired. Some of these \ngovernment programs expired in 1983, but we are still spending money on \nthem every year. That means we have been paying for these expired \nprograms for more than 30 years. In some cases, we spend as much as \nfour times the spending authority that has expired. We have to look at \nthose programs.\n  For the 260 programs that have expired, we are spending $293 billion \na year. Normally, we talk about over a 10-year period. Over a 10-year \nperiod, that would be $2,935 billion. Eliminating those programs would \nalmost balance the budget. They can't be eliminated, but they should be \nlooked at regularly. That is why we have authorizations that expire. \nThat is so we are forced to take a look at them. No, that is so we \nshould be forced to take a look at them; obviously, we don't. We don't \ndo that because we want the committees of jurisdiction to have a hard \nlook at the expired authorizations and make them current or, if there \nare duplications, eliminate the programs that are not needed after all \nor, with duplication, we ought to be able to at least get rid of half \nof the administrative bureaucracy on it and make sure the money gets \nout into the country where we promised it.\n  Now, there is a second way. The other way we can balance the budget \nis to grow the economy. The Congressional Budget Office tells us that \nif we were to increase the gross domestic product, private sector \ngrowth--again, this is not referring to government GDP; that is just \nprivate sector growth--if we were to increase the private sector growth \nby 1 percent, that would provide an additional $300 billion in \nadditional tax revenue every year. I think that could balance the \nbudget. But first we must get our overspending under control because \nCongress is already spending more tax revenue than at any point in \nhistory. When we take the tax revenue from the individuals and from the \nbusinesses, we slow down this growth that would provide the additional \n$300 billion in tax revenue every year. If we grow the economy, we will \nexpand opportunity for each and every American.\n  Now, I know in their speeches our friends from across the aisle will \ncriticize us for not being finished by April 15. But think of it this \nway: We did something in 4 months that they could only accomplish once \nin 4 years, and that is produce a budget--let alone a budget that \nactually balances.\n  While they were in charge, they often didn't produce a budget by \nApril 15 or October 1 or even January 1. In fact, they produced only \none budget conference agreement in the last 6 years, so don't criticize \nus for what we are doing. While we may have taken a few extra days, we \ndid get it done, and this budget is poised to play a vital role in \nhelping Congress get back to the work of doing the people's business. \nAnd when we get it done on time, the spending committees can begin on \ntime. Hopefully, that will give the spending committees time to look at \nthis duplication and the unauthorized spending we have.\n  Now, some point out that the President was able to get his budget out \non time. That is true, but the last time I checked, he didn't have to \nrun it by 535 elected officials as we do; he just had to run it past \none elected official--himself. I should mention that is the first time \nin 6 years he has gotten a budget to us on time. We even had to have a \nrollcall vote today to proceed to this privileged conference report. I \ndon't understand that.\n  The Senate Budget Committee is tasked with the responsibility of \nsetting spending goals. Congress has other committees that authorize \ngovernment programs and they are charged with overseeing their \nefficiency and effectiveness. We also have committees that allocate the \nexact dollars for these programs every year, but the Senate Budget \nCommittee sets the spending goals. In other words, we set limits and we \nset some enforcement.\n  This is why passing a budget is so important for our Nation. It lets \nthe congressional policymakers who actually allocate the dollars get to \nwork by following our spending limits. This year, we are giving them an \nearly start. Leader McConnell is committed to allowing the Senate to do \nits job, and that means debate and votes on the 12 appropriations \nbills--the 12 spending bills. This is an important occurrence in the \nSenate, because over the past 8 years, appropriations bills have been \nas rare as ice cubes in the desert.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues in both the Senate and the House for \nall their hard work in producing a joint budget agreement that balances \nwithin 10 years, does not raise taxes, strengthens our Nation's \ndefense, protects our most vulnerable citizens, improves economic \ngrowth and opportunity for hard-working families, and stops the Federal \nGovernment's out-of-control spending. These important steps, and still \nothers to come, show Congress is back working for the American people \nto deliver on the promise of a government that is more accountable. \nThis is something each and every American expects and deserves from its \nleaders in Washington. With action on our balanced budget, we will \ndeliver.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Enzi for his \ncivility and his humor. I have enjoyed the process by which we have \ngotten to where we are today. But I must say that anyone who takes an \nobjective look at this Republican budget can do nothing else but \nconclude that this is an absolute disaster for the working families of \nthis country. In fact, one of the problems I have had in describing the \nRepublican budget is that it is so bad--it is so far out of touch with \nwhere the American people are--that people really don't even believe us \nwhen we talk about what is in this budget, which is what I am going to \ndo in a moment.\n  Before I do that, I think we can all agree that what a budget is \nabout is a development of priorities to address problems. We look at \nwhat is going on in our country as we assess the needs of the American \npeople, and we build a budget around those needs. So let me begin by \nassessing what I believe are the needs of the American people.\n  The fundamental economic reality of today is that for the last 40 \nyears--not the last 6 years, not the last 20 years but the last 40 \nyears--the middle class of this country has been disappearing. Today, \nwe have more people living in poverty than at almost any time in the \nmodern history of America, and yet while that is going on, the gap \nbetween the very, very, very rich and everybody else is growing wider \nand wider.\n  Today, in fact, in America, we have more income and wealth inequality \nthan any other major country on Earth. I know many people think that in \nthe United Kingdom, they have the Queen and dukes and lords and all of \nthis aristocracy; clearly, their distribution of wealth and income must \nbe a lot worse than it is in the United States. That is not the case. \nToday, compared to every other major country on Earth, our distribution \nof wealth and income is the worst, and it is worse in this country \ntoday than at any time since the late 1920s.\n  It is hard to believe but true: Today, 99 percent of all new income \ngoes to the top 1 percent. Since the Wall Street crash of 2008, 99 \npercent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent. What that means is \nall over this country we have people working not one job but two jobs, \nthree jobs; people working longer hours for lower wages. Yet 99 percent \nof all of the new income generated is going to the top 1 percent. In \nthe midst of that reality, our Republican colleagues say, Well, only 99 \npercent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent, but what can we do \nto make the richest people even richer?\n  Median family income in this country since 1999 has gone down by \nalmost $5,000. Families are struggling to put bread on the table, to \nsend their kids to college, to take care of their basic needs. But the \nRepublican budget says the middle class is shrinking, people are \nstruggling; what can we do to make life even harder for the working \nfamilies of our country.\n  When we talk about unemployment in America, the official unemployment \nrate is 5.5 percent. The true unemployment--real unemployment--however, \nis 10.9 percent, if we include those people who have given up looking \nfor work and people who are working part time when they want to work \nfull time. Youth unemployment, which we never talk about, is over 17 \npercent, and African-American youth unemployment is\n\n[[Page S2616]]\n\nliterally off of the charts. Does the Republican budget say: How do we \nput the American people back to work or how do we help our young people \nwho are desperately looking for jobs or looking for education? Quite \nthe contrary. The Republican budget cuts virtually every program out \nthere that is designed to help working families and unemployed workers.\n  The typical male worker--that male worker in the middle of the \nAmerican economy--incredibly made $783 less last year than he did 42 \nyears ago. In other words, the middle class in this country is moving, \nunfortunately, in the wrong direction.\n  Does the Republican budget say that we are going to raise the minimum \nwage so that everybody in this country who works 40 hours a week can \nlive with dignity? No, it does not. Again, it moves us in exactly the \nwrong direction.\n  While unemployment is much too high, while median family income has \ngone down, when millions of people are working longer hours for lower \nwages, there is another phenomenon taking place in this country, and \nthat is that the wealthiest people and the largest corporations are \ndoing phenomenally well--not good, not pretty good--phenomenally well. \nToday, we live in a society where the top 1 percent owns almost as much \nwealth as the bottom 90 percent.\n  Here is the chart. The top 1 percent owns almost as much wealth--here \nat the top is the 1 percent. Here is the bottom 90 percent, going down. \nThat is reality.\n  The Republican budget says: Wow, look at that extraordinary disparity \nin wealth. We are going to do something about it.\n  Yes, they do something about it. Their proposals will make the rich \neven richer and working people even poorer. Not only do we have a \nsituation today where--as incredible as it may sound--the wealthiest 14 \npeople in this country--the wealthiest 14--not 1,400, not 14,000, but \nthe wealthiest 14 people in this country--in the last 2 years have seen \ntheir wealth increase by $157 billion. So 14 people have seen their \nwealth increase by $157 billion. That is more wealth than the total \nwealth of the bottom 130 million Americans.\n  Here is a chart showing Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, an increase of \n$19 billion. Larry Ellison's wealth increased by $11 billion. This is \njust an increase over a 2-year period. Do you know what the Republican \nbudget says to these guys? Hey, $157 billion in increase in 2 years? \nThat is not enough. We are going to give your families a very \nsignificant tax break by ending the estate tax.\n  We have a situation where one family in this country--the Walton \nfamilies, which own Walmart--that one family owns more wealth than the \nbottom 42 percent of the American people.\n  Given the huge disparity of wealth and income, given the fact that \nmillions of Americans today are struggling to put food on the table, \ngiven the fact that working families don't know how they can afford \nquality child care for their kids and middle class families don't know \nhow they are able to send their kids to college, the Republican budget \nin virtually every instance moves us in exactly the wrong direction.\n  The United States of America, sadly, is the only major country on \nEarth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right--\nsomething that I believe should occur. I think health care is a right \nand not a privilege. Today, we have made some gains under the \nAffordable Care Act. We have more people who have health insurance than \nwas the case a number of years ago. That is a good thing. This is what \nthe Republican budget does: The Republican budget, by ending the \nAffordable Care Act and by cutting Medicaid by over $400 billion, \nthrows 27 million Americans off of health insurance. That is it--27 \nmillion Americans--men, women, kids--off of health insurance. What \nhappens to those people? How many of those 27 million people will die? \nCertainly thousands, because when they get sick they are not going to \nbe able to go to a doctor. How many of those people will suffer because \nthey had illnesses that could have been treated or cured, but they \ncan't go to a doctor? This budget knocks 27 million people off of \nhealth insurance. When you ask the Republicans what happens to those \npeople, they have no response at all--none, zero. So instead of moving \nus in the direction of having health care for all of our people, they \nincrease the number of uninsured by 27 million Americans.\n  At a time when senior poverty is increasing, the Republican budget \ncalls for ending Medicare as we know it by turning it into a voucher \nprogram. What does that mean? The Republican idea is that we give \npeople a voucher. I don't know that they have an exact amount for their \nvoucher--maybe $8,000--whatever. They say: Here is a check for $8,000. \nYou are 85 years of age and you are struggling with cancer. Here is \nyour check for $8,000, and you go out to a private insurance company \nand get the best deal you can.\n  If you are 85 years of age and you are struggling with cancer or \nheart disease and somebody gives you a check for $8,000, you tell me \nwhat kind of private insurance you are going to be able to get. How \nmany days will it last you in the hospital? This is an effort to \nundermine and destroy Medicare. It is a disastrous idea. That is \nexactly what is in the Republican proposal.\n  At a time when millions of disabled people are trying to survive on \nless than $14,000 a year, the Republican budget would pave the way for \na massive cut to Social Security Disability Insurance. Instead of \nmaking college more affordable--and I know that in the State of \nVermont, my State, and I expect in States all over this country, young \npeople are really wondering whether they want to go to college, because \nthey are so nervous about the debt they will have when they come out--\nwhat is the Republican response to the crisis of the lack of \naffordability of college? Here is their response. They would cut Pell \ngrants by more than $85 billion over the next decade, which would make \nthe cost of college education more expensive for some 8 million \nAmericans. In other words, instead of addressing this crisis, instead \nof helping make us competitive in a global economy by giving us the \nbest-educated workforce, what they do is to move us in the wrong \ndirection.\n  We are as a nation the wealthiest Nation in the history of the world. \nMost people don't know it, because almost all of that wealth goes to a \nhandful of people on top. In the midst of this extremely wealthy \nNation, disgracefully, today, we have millions and millions of families \nwho literally are worried about how they are going to put food on the \ntable and feed their kids tomorrow and next week.\n  I can tell you that in the State of Vermont--and I expect in States \naround this country--we have people working 40 and 50 hours a week but, \nbecause their wages are so low, they don't earn enough money to buy the \nfood they need to properly take care of their kids and feed their kids \nwell. Those families literally go to emergency food shelters all over \nAmerica. These are working people who never in their lives thought they \nwould have to go to an emergency food shelter. That is what they are \ndoing all over America.\n  What is the Republican response to hunger in America, taking care of \nthe most basic needs we have? The Republican response is massive cuts--\nmassive cuts--to food stamps and the WIC Program. The WIC Program is a \nwonderful program to ensure that low-income pregnant women get good \nnutrition and that their babies have good nutrition. How basic can it \nget? Cut those programs. Cut the Meals On Wheels programs for fragile \nseniors.\n  In the midst of throwing 27 million Americans off of health \ninsurance, in the midst of cutting $85 billion for Pell grants to make \nit harder for our kids to go to college, in the midst of making massive \ncuts in nutrition programs which would increase hunger and suffering in \nthe United States of America, Republicans do something else that is \nliterally remarkable--and I know people think I am not telling the \ntruth. I am.\n  What they say is that when the rich are getting richer, when almost \nall new income and wealth is going to the people on top, what they have \ndecided to do for the wealthiest 6,000 families in America--the top \ntwo-tenths of 1 percent--what they say to these billionaire families is \nthat we are going to give you a massive tax break by repealing the \nestate tax. What we are going to do is give you a $269 billion tax\n\n[[Page S2617]]\n\nbreak that goes to the top two-tenths of 1 percent, and 99.8 percent of \nthe American people will not gain one nickel in benefits from the \nrepeal of the estate tax. It only goes to the wealthiest of the \nwealthy.\n  But to add insult to injury, while giving a huge tax break for the \nbillionaire class, the Republican budget also says: Let's see if we can \nraise taxes on lower-income and working-class families by allowing the \nexpanded earned-income tax credit and child tax credit to expire. These \nare tax credits that go to working families and lower-income families \nwho have kids. We added a more generous benefit a few years ago, and \nthey are going to allow that to expire at the same time as they give a \nmassive tax break to the wealthiest families in this country.\n  My friend from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, talks repeatedly about the deficit. \nI agree that the deficit is a problem. But he will acknowledge that \nunder the last 6 years under President Obama, we have made significant \nprogress in reducing the deficit--about two-thirds. But it remains very \nhigh. We have an $18 trillion debt and that is a real issue. There is \nno denying it. One of the reasons that we have a huge debt--not the \nonly reason but one of the reasons--is that the United States under \nPresident Bush went to war in Iraq and went to war in Afghanistan.\n  Now nobody knows what the end cost of that war will be by the time we \ntake care of the last veteran 50 or 60 years from now, but the best \nguesses are that those wars will cost us $4 to $6 trillion by the time \nwe take care of the needs of our last veteran who served in those wars.\n  How do we pay for those wars? How do we pay for those wars? In every \nother war that this country fought, Presidents had the courage to go \nforward and say: Wars are expensive. We are going to raise taxes. Not \nin this case--those wars were put on the credit card--$4 to $6 trillion \nand we didn't pay for it.\n  Apparently, my Republican colleagues haven't learned a simple \nlesson--that you can't be honest and worry about the deficit, and then \ngo to war and not pay for it. What they have done in this budget is to \nincrease Pentagon spending by another $38 billion next year and $186 \nbillion over the next 10 years.\n  And how is that paid for? Oh, it is not paid for. It goes on the \ncredit card. They put it all into the so-called OCO account, and this \nis, by the way, an account that many of my conservative friends have \ncalled an accounting gimmick.\n  So here we are. Here we are at a time when this country probably \nfaces more serious problems than at any time since the Great \nDepression. The middle class is disappearing. Poverty is much too high. \nThe gap between the very, very, very rich and everybody else is growing \nwider and wider. Real unemployment is much too high. Young people are \nunable to afford to go to college. On every one of those issues, the \nRepublican budget does exactly the opposite of what we should be doing.\n  In the year 2015, we should not be voting or bringing forth a budget \nwhich makes the billionaires even richer while cutting programs for \npeople who are struggling. With an $18 trillion debt, we should not be \nincreasing military spending by simply adding that money to the \ndeficit.\n  So I would hope that people in this body, in the Senate, will take a \ndeep breath, and appreciate, in fact, what is going on with working \nfamilies in this country and will vote no on this disastrous budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  I want to thank Senator Sanders for laying out the budget in a way \nthat makes sense. It is a document that is supposed to reflect our \nvalues, who we are. It is supposed to be a roadmap for the future. What \nMr. Sanders has just said is that it is a roadmap to disaster, and I \nintend to pick up on that theme.\n  I want also to say that I know how hard it is to get a budget out. I \nwas on the House Budget Committee for years and on the Senate Budget \nCommittee. I want to compliment Senator Enzi. I know it is hard to put \ntogether a coalition, even within your own party. He has said that the \nSenate is under new management and he is very excited about it, and I \nunderstand that. I get it. I have been in both the majority and the \nminority and I like the majority a lot better.\n\n  But the bottom line is, if this is the first big action of the new \nmanagement, let's bring back the old one, because in this budget, the \npeople who benefit are the very tippy top maybe two-tenths of 1 \npercent. It is unreal. I am not going to stand on the floor and just \nthrow out barbs, I am going to give definite numbers so everybody sees \nwhat we mean.\n  The only time we have had a balanced budget in recent history was \nwhen Bill Clinton was President and the Democrats controlled the \nSenate. I remember it well because we didn't get one Republican vote \nfor that budget that was so critical.\n  I remember my colleague Senator Bob Kerrey was thinking about it so \nhard. He saw all sides. He went to the movies, and during the movie he \ncame to a--this was the right budget--he came back and voted and it got \ndone.\n  Now, that was a Democratic budget that invested in the people of the \nUnited States of America, invested in their infrastructure, invested in \ntheir education, invested in their health care, and invested in them. \nIt invested in them.\n  Remember, President Clinton said: Put America's families first. And \nit worked because we invested in our people. We headed into a period of \nunprecedented growth--23 million jobs created under Bill Clinton and \nthe budget balanced.\n  As soon as George W. Bush took over, he did enormous tax cuts for the \nwealthiest at the top, got us into two wars--put them on a credit \ncard--and we have been battling our way back after the worst economic \ndownturn. If you look at the job creation under ``W,'' it is just \nshocking. Now, under President Obama, we have fought tooth and nail and \nwe are coming back. This budget is an unmitigated disaster.\n  Let's start. At a time when 16 million people have finally been able \nto get health insurance thanks to the Affordable Care Act, also known \nas ObamaCare, they want to repeal this law and throw these people out. \nThey will not have health care, and then what will happen? They will \nsuffer, their families will suffer, and the economy will suffer. At a \ntime when nearly 70 million Americans rely on Medicaid and CHIP for \nhealth coverage--Medicaid, we know is for the working poor, CHIP is for \nchildren--they want to block grant that program and, while they are \ndoing it, impose cuts of more than $1.3 trillion.\n  So you have to ask this question--this isn't just a matter of putting \na number on an easel--what will it mean for maternity care when half of \nall of our births in the United States are financed by Medicaid? Half \nof all births in the United States are financed by Medicaid, and they \nare cutting Medicaid by $1.3 trillion. So they will fight for your \nright to be born, but, boy, don't count on getting any help if you wind \nup in a maternity ward.\n  At a time when more than 50 million senior citizens and disabled \nAmericans are in the Medicare Program and baby boomers continue to age \nin, they propose cutting the program by $430 billion by placing the \nburden on the backs of seniors and privatizing that program through \nvouchers. They are going to end Medicare: Senior citizens, you are \nunder new management here, and they are ending Medicare as we know it, \nas we know that great program.\n  So after years of being the most successful program--and if you ask \npeople on Medicare if they like it, they not only like it, they love \nit--they are ending it.\n  As Senator Sanders pointed out, eloquently, I thought, they are \nsaying to a sick person--you know, people are living longer. Thank God. \nSo let's say a person is 85, 90 years old, having a hard time \nfunctioning and then gets a desperate cancer on top of it: Here is \nmoney. Go out and find the best insurance you can. Oh, yes, we know you \nare 90. Here is a Web site.\n\n  Oh, I don't have a computer.\n  Too bad. We are under new management over here. Oh, great. Bring back \nthe old management. That is what I think.\n  The old management wasn't perfect, but the old management had a \nheart, had a soul. No one will hear.\n  Now, how is this: In case you are not sold about how devastating this \nbudget\n\n[[Page S2618]]\n\nis, the Republican budget resolution eliminates opportunities for the \nneediest students from preschool to college by cutting $270 billion \nfrom education and job training investments over the next decade. So \nwhile the Republican leadership is pushing for free trade, free trade, \nwhatever, what is happening to training our workers? They are cut.\n  At a time when less than one-half of eligible preschool-aged children \nare able to participate in Head Start, half of our eligible kids cannot \nget in. The Republican budget cuts the program by over $4 billion, \nresulting in over 400,000 children losing access to Head Start over the \nnext decade.\n  Now, tell me I am dreaming. This is the new management. We are going \nto take 400,000 children over the next decade and say: Sorry, no room \nfor you. The door is closed.\n  We all know Head Start is critical.\n  We know the cost of college continues to rise. We all know it--\nbecause we are alive, we have a heartbeat and a pulse, and everybody \nalive today knows what it is. I have met people who are still paying \noff their student loan debt when they are on Social Security. That is \nthe new reality. What did they do? They cut Pell grant funding by more \nthan one-third, making college less affordable for many of the more \nthan 8 million students receiving aid.\n  So let's see who is now in their line of fire: middle class, seniors, \nlittle babies, students, and workers. At a time when student loan debt \nhas reached $1.2 trillion and students are graduating with over $28,000 \nin student loan debt, on average, the Republican budget resolution \neliminates the in-school interest subsidy for need-based student loans, \ncausing student loan debt to increase by nearly $4,000 for an estimated \n30 million students.\n  So it isn't bad enough for them to know that people are paying off \ntheir student loans when they are on Social Security, now they are \nincreasing the cost of student loans even more, instead of working with \nus to decrease the cost to students. I will tell you, if every taxpayer \nin America is a shareholder, it is time to call a meeting and change \nthis management.\n  Now, if you are a renter, one in four renters is paying more than \nhalf their income on housing, placing them one paycheck away from \nhomelessness--half your income. The Republican budget resolution \neliminates housing assistance for 450,000 families due to a 14-percent \ncut to the section 8 rental assistance program--beautiful.\n  At a time when 45.3 million people are living in poverty, the \nRepublican budget resolution cuts about $800 billion from income \nsecurity programs over 10 years. This category includes SNAP, \nSupplemental Security Income for low-income seniors and people with \ndisabilities, and heating assistance for low-income families--lovely, \nlovely. Welcome to the new management that is the Senate.\n  Here is the thing, this is even hard to imagine they did it. It upset \nthem so much that the wealthiest 14 families might get hit with a \nlittle bit of the tax--and I am talking about people who are worth over \n$10 million, way more, 20, 30, 40, 50--you name it, the highest level. \nThey give them a $3 million tax cut.\n  They actually raised taxes by an average of $900 on 16 million low- \nand moderate-income families by allowing expansions to the EITC and \nchild tax credit to expire, so there is no expansion of that program.\n  Now, whom else could we hit? Well, maybe we could hit some of our \nStates that are suffering from the realities of climate change, such as \nthe Western States that are undergoing the longest recorded drought in \nhistory.\n  Come talk to my farmers, ask them how happy they are that you are \nproposing dramatic cuts--and have imposed them in this budget--to the \nEPA, to the Department of Interior, DOE, and to NOAA--the agencies best \nequipped to steward our precious natural resources, develop a clean \nenergy future, enforce our water laws, and protect our health.\n  But wait a minute. There are a few people who were left--away from \nthis budget knife. Well, if you drive a car or you drive a truck or you \nget on a bus, you get hit too.\n  Listen to this one. At a time when 63,500 of our bridges are \nstructurally deficient and 50 percent of our roads are in less than \ngood condition, this budget cuts transportation and infrastructure \ninvestment by more than $200 billion over 10 years, a cut of 40 \npercent.\n  I just had a press conference a couple of weeks ago with Republican \nbusiness leaders and Democratic workers, and they have come together \nagainst this new management idea. They are looking to fund the highway \ntrust fund.\n  The whole fund expires this month. I haven't heard one word about how \nwe are going to have a multiyear funding bill. We have six States today \nthat have stopped spending on infrastructure.\n  The last I checked, we are still the greatest Nation in the world. \nTell me, how do you remain a great power if your bridges are \nstructurally deficient--63,500 of them. How do you remain a world power \nwhen you cannot move goods efficiently or people efficiently?\n  I will say, in all my years here, I have had the best relationship on \ninfrastructure spending with my colleague Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma. \nThis budget predicts a 40-percent decrease in infrastructure spending, \nso pretty much everyone--everyone who is impacted by this new \nmanagement, which is all of us--is getting hit hard by this budget. A \nbudget is a reflection of whom you fight for, whom you believe in, and \nwhat your values are. This budget will bring pain to middle-class \nfamilies, to our working poor, to our children, to our seniors, to our \nstudents, to our drought-plagued or flood-plagued areas, and to the \npeople who use their automobiles to go to work.\n  In essence, this budget hurts the very people we should be fighting \nfor. Instead of checking with those who actually balanced the budget--\nwhen Bill Clinton was President--they go off on an opposite tear, which \nis to take away investments--which is what led to the prosperity, which \nis what led to the balanced budget, which is what led to 23 million \njobs--and put in place austerity.\n  I gave you just a little look at some of these cuts. But, guess what, \nAmerica, there is a secret in the budget. There is another $900 billion \nof cuts over the next 10 years in a secret little package, unspecified \ncuts, almost $1 trillion, because they don't even know where to go to \ncut. So if you didn't like the cuts I talked about, wait until they get \nto the unspecified cuts.\n  Who do you think is going to get those cuts? Not the wealthy few \nfamilies, it is going to be more pain for the middle class, more pain \nfor the working poor, and more pain for the workers and businesses of \nthe transportation sector. We are not going to see cures for \nAlzheimer's or cancer because, believe me, that is not going to happen, \nno initiatives there.\n  This budget does not belong on the Senate floor. This budget is too \npainful to be enacted. This budget ought to be redone with an eye \ntoward the balance we achieved those years ago by making smart \ninvestments in our people and by cutting back on wasteful spending but \nnot bringing political vendettas to the table when already so many \nmillions of our people have health insurance. You are going to take \nthat away? You fought so hard for the chance to govern--you did, \nbelieve me--just as we are going to fight to get it back. That is what \npolitics is. But now it is time to work together.\n  This is a radical budget. This doesn't reflect any coming together. \nAnd as soon as we wake up America to the fact that this budget hurts \nthem, maybe we will have a chance to fix it. I really hope so because \nour middle class can't take any more pain. Our drivers can't take any \nmore pain. Our students can't take any more pain. Our seniors can't \ntake any more pain. Our children can't fend for themselves.\n  So I hope we will have a big ``no'' vote on this budget. I also hope, \nafter we have our vote, that we come together and fix some of these \nmajor problems, starting with the highway trust fund, where already six \nof our States have stopped spending. There are still 800,000 unemployed \nconstruction workers and thousands of businesses suffering because we \ndon't have a long-term solution to the highway trust fund. Why don't we \ntake care of that? No, we are going to take up some fast-track, speedy \ntrade bill that includes countries that pay their people 52 cents an \nhour. That is what we are going to do. We are going to rush to that.\n\n[[Page S2619]]\n\n  Why don't we fix the problems here? Why don't we fix the student loan \nrate so people aren't paying off student loans when they are on Social \nSecurity? Why don't we make sure people can afford to get educated? Why \ndon't we improve the health care system and not throw people off the \nrolls? Let's do it the right way. Let's not do it ``my way or the \nhighway'' because that only is going to wind up hurting the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am glad I had a chance to come to the \nfloor and listen to the distinguished ranking member on the Committee \non the Budget and the senior Senator from California talk about this \nbudget, but I feel like it is two ships passing in the night when I see \nthis remarkable accomplishment under the leadership of Chairman Enzi on \nthe Committee on the Budget and the entire Committee on the Budget.\n  This is a congressional budget that balances within 10 years. It \ndoesn't raise taxes. It reprioritizes our Nation's defense. It protects \nour most vulnerable citizens. It improves economic growth, which is \nliterally the rising tide that lifts all boats in a growing economy. \nThat is something our economy has not been doing very well lately. And \nit stops the Federal Government's out-of-control Federal spending. This \nis really a remarkable accomplishment. As a matter of fact, this is the \nfirst joint 10-year balanced budget resolution since 2001.\n  I think what drives our friends across the aisle crazy is the fact \nthey haven't passed a budget since 2009. Now, with the new leadership \nhere in the Senate, in the 114th Congress, we have done the basic work \nof governing, which is to propose--and this afternoon we will pass--a \nbalanced budget.\n  I know there are differences across the aisle. Clearly, there are \nreasons why people choose to be a Democratic Senator or a Republican \nSenator. But, to me, the differences are pretty stark. Our friends \nacross the aisle don't think that the government should have to live \nwithin its means but that we should continue borrowing money we don't \nhave and overspending and hand the bill to our kids and grandkids. I \npersonally think that is a moral hazard. That is really \nunconscionable--to keep spending money and then to send the bill to our \nkids and grandkids and say: You pay. We had a good time. Good luck.\n  Our friends across the aisle think the Federal Government is not big \nenough because they want to continue to feed the beast with more of \nAmericans' hard-earned tax dollars so it can get bigger and intrude \nfurther into everyone's freedoms and choices that should be left to \nindividuals and their families.\n  It sounds to me as though the ranking member on the Committee on the \nBudget, the Senator from Vermont, thinks the government ought to simply \ntake more of the money Americans have earned and give it to somebody \nelse who didn't earn it.\n  I can only conclude that our friends across the aisle think an $18 \ntrillion debt is not a problem. It is. When interest rates start \ncreeping back up, as they eventually will, more and more of our tax \ndollars are going to be spent sending interest payments to the Chinese \nand other holders of our sovereign debt to service that debt. That is \ngoing to crowd out not only national security spending, it is going to \ncrowd out the safety net spending we all agree is necessary for people \nwho can't protect themselves.\n  So there are real differences.\n  This budget, I am proud to say--which we will pass this afternoon \nthanks to the heroic work of our Committee on the Budget--is a real \naccomplishment. I guess what would be a real embarrassment is if we \ndidn't pass a budget. But we will pass a budget.\n  People listening at home may say: Why are you patting yourselves on \nthe back for passing a budget? We have a budget in our business. We \nhave a budget at home. So why is it such a big deal for the new \nCongress to actually pass a budget?\n  Well, I guess it shouldn't be a big deal. It should be something we \ndo routinely because it is really the most basic demonstration of the \nability to govern. But what makes it remarkable is the fact that it \nhasn't happened in a long time. So that is why I am so glad.\n  We actually have seen under the new leadership in the 114th Congress \nsome real progress. We have actually seen Democrats and Republicans \nworking together to accomplish some important things. That is something \nwhich I think the American people appreciate and which all Members of \nthe Senate have come to enjoy. The mood has changed. The ability of \nSenators to participate in the process and actually come up with \nsolutions has gotten so much better in just the first 100 days of the \n114th Congress, I think we are slowly starting to develop some \nmomentum.\n  We passed a bill that lets Medicare beneficiaries see the doctors \nthey need. That is a good thing. We also passed an important piece of \nlegislation that provides aid to victims of human trafficking. Through \nthe end of this week, we will continue to work our way through another \nimportant piece of legislation, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, \nwhich was unanimously voted out of committee a few weeks ago. This is \nvery important not only to the region in the Middle East but also to us \nand the world. This bill will guarantee that Congress will have an \nopportunity to review and potentially block any final deal with Iran \nthat President Obama reaches during the so-called P5+1 negotiations.\n  After we conclude the consideration of that important piece of \nlegislation, we are going to move on to consider something else I think \nwill help grow the economy and actually end up bringing more revenue \ninto the Federal Treasury, help us with some of our deficits and debt, \nand that is to pass trade promotion authority and then to take up the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement.\n  My State happens to export more than any other State in the Nation, \nand our economy reflects that because just our binational trade with \nMexico creates about 6 million jobs. It is a good thing to have more \nmarkets in which to sell the things our farmers grow or sell the \nlivestock our ranchers raise or the manufactured goods Americans make. \nIt is a good thing.\n  This bill would make sure the United States gets the best deal in \npending trade agreements with countries from Asia, to South America, to \nEurope, and it would help make sure that Texas's products and, more \ngenerally, American products and industries find new markets, which \nwill in turn raise wages for hard-working families. That is something \nwe all support.\n  With all these other signs of progress, I think that writing and \npassing a budget is one of the most fundamental responsibilities we \nhave. While that should be pretty obvious--families across the country \nsit around the table each month and do the same thing--it is a fact \nthat was lost on many of our Democratic colleagues when they controlled \nthe Chamber.\n  While listening to the Senator from California, I was reminded once \nagain of what a cut in Washington, DC, is. It is not a cut in the \namount of spending in a program at current levels, it is a reduction in \nthe rate of increase. That is what they call a cut. What this budget \ndoes is it begins to cut the rate of increase of spending in a way that \nhelps us control the deficits and take the first important step toward \ndealing with our long-term debt.\n  When we vote on this budget today, it will be the first time both \nChambers have actually voted for an agreed-upon spending bill since \n2009. As I said earlier, it will be the first balanced 10-year budget \nsince 2001, and that is despite 4 consecutive years of trillion-dollar \ndeficits under President Obama--trillion-dollar deficits. Those \ndeficits, as the chairman has appropriately pointed out, add up to \ndebt, the deficit being the difference between what the government \nbrings in and what it spends in a given year. Four years of consecutive \ntrillion-dollar deficits has done grave damage to our national debt, \nwith a downgrade in America's credit rating by Standard & Poor's.\n  It would be one thing if the President and our friends across the \naisle had a\n\n[[Page S2620]]\n\ngood record when it comes to their budgets and their proposals, but \nthey do not. Just look at what the President has proposed.\n  President Obama has missed statutory deadlines to propose a budget so \noften that it became more notable when he actually did fulfill that \nresponsibility than when he did not.\n  When the President's budget was voted on in 2011, it was unanimously \nrejected by Democrats and Republicans. It didn't receive a single vote. \nThe same was true in 2012. If the President had proposed a responsible \nbudget, I am certain Members of his own party would have at least voted \nfor it. In 2011 and 2012, no Democrat voted for the President's budget. \nLast year, in the House of Representatives, all but two Members voted \nagainst the President's budget when given the chance. It went down by a \nresounding 413 to 2. That was the President's budget proposal. We saw \nhistory repeat itself in March as well. One by one, nearly every Member \nof this body came to the floor and gave a thumbs down to President \nObama's budget proposal. As a matter of fact, it got one vote; it went \ndown 98 to 1.\n  Whether it is offering a completely irresponsible budget that is \nrejected by both parties or the failure to offer any budget at all, our \nfriends across the aisle are living in a glass house. And when you live \nin a glass house, you really shouldn't throw stones. But the most \nimportant point is that the American people deserve better.\n  We had an important election in November, and it changed the majority \nin the Senate. It established new management.\n  In that last election cycle we made promises we intend to keep, and \nwe were elected on our promise to be different and to govern \nresponsibly. That promise includes passing a budget that protects \ntaxpayers and sets the Nation on a path toward sound fiscal footing. \nFortunately for the American people, we are keeping our campaign \npledges, and this budget does reflect their confidence in the new \nleadership of the Congress.\n  This budget leaves our country with a surplus after 10 years. It puts \nus on a path to begin to pay down our national debt, and it does not \nraise taxes.\n  By balancing the budget without tax hikes, like we do in Texas with \nour budget, we can protect taxpayers and foster an economic environment \nthat allows jobs and opportunity to blossom.\n  But protecting our taxpayers is not our only priority. I believe our \nNo. 1 priority in the Federal Government is national security. I \nbelieve Congress needs to make sure that is unmistakably clear, and we \ndo so in this budget.\n  The budget also provides the military with the necessary flexibility \nto react to changing threats and to make additional investments as \nnecessary in a way that does not add to overspending.\n  Not only does this send a message to our troops that they will have \nthe support they need in order to do the job they volunteered to do but \nalso to our families, our military families who serve as well in our \nall-volunteer military system.\n  This prioritization of national security also sends a very important \nmessage to our Nation's adversaries. We know that weakness is a \nprovocation to the bullies and the tyrants around the world. When \npeople such as Vladimir Putin see the United States retreating, pulling \nback, not prioritizing our national security, and not maintaining our \nrole in the world as a preeminent power, it is a provocation and it is \nan encouragement. We see that happening around the world as we see now \na greater security threat environment than perhaps we have seen in \nmany, many years. But this budget sends a message to our adversaries \naround the world that America will not shrink and will not retreat from \nour leadership role.\n  The budget under consideration was passed just a few days ago in the \nHouse of Representatives because it serves the American people by \nproviding for our national defense and balancing the budget within 10 \nyears. And it doesn't raise taxes--something Congress hasn't done for \nalmost 15 years.\n  This afternoon, the Senate will keep its part of the bargain. We will \nfollow through on our promise, and we will make clear to the American \npeople that we are committed to getting our fiscal house in order with \nthis important first step.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, a budget is far more than a series of \nnumbers on a piece of paper. A budget really is a statement of values \nand priorities, a statement of the kind of Nation we are and the kind \nof Nation we want to be.\n  For many of us, these values and priorities are clear. We believe \nthat a budget should help us move toward an economy that is built from \nthe middle out--not from the top down--and a government that works for \nall of our families--not just the wealthiest few. But the Republican \nbudget that we are here debating today would move us in the opposite \ndirection.\n  Instead of working with us to build on the bipartisan budget deal we \nstruck last Congress, Republicans have introduced a budget that would \nlock in sequestration. It would hollow out defense and nondefense \ninvestments and use gimmicks and games to paper over the problems.\n  Instead of putting jobs, wages, and economic security first by \nprioritizing policies such as paid sick leave, which shouldn't be \npartisan issues, the Republican budget would cut taxes for the rich and \nleave working families behind. Instead of building on the work we have \ndone to make health care more affordable and accessible, the Republican \nbudget would take us back to the bad old days when insurance companies \ncalled all the shots and when fewer Americans had access to the care \nthey need.\n  I will take a few minutes today to talk about each of these issues \nand to urge my Republican friends to take a different approach, to put \npolitics aside, to come back to the table, and to work with us on a \nresponsible budget that puts the middle class first and will actually \nwork for families and communities that we all represent.\n  The first issue I want to talk about is the automatic cuts from \nsequestration and the failure of this budget to address an issue \nDemocrats and Republicans agree needs to be solved.\n  I am proud that coming out of the terrible government shutdown at the \nend of 2013, we were finally able to break through the gridlock and \ndysfunction to reach a bipartisan budget deal that prevented another \ngovernment shutdown, restored investments in education, in research, \nand in defense jobs and really laid down a foundation for continued \nbipartisan work.\n  That deal wasn't the budget I would have written on my own, and it \nwasn't the one Republicans would have written on their own, but it did \nend the lurching from crisis to crisis. It helped workers and our \neconomy and made it clear that there is bipartisan support for rolling \nback sequestration in a balanced way.\n  Our bipartisan deal was a strong step in the right direction, and I \nwas hopeful that we could work together to build on it, because we know \nthere is bipartisan support to replace sequestration in a balanced and \nfair way.\n  Not only did we prove that with our bipartisan budget deal, but \nDemocrats and Republicans across the country have continued to come out \nagainst the senseless cuts to defense and nondefense investments. But \nRepublicans went the opposite way with their budget this year.\n  They were able to cut trillions of dollars of programs that support \nfamilies and fight poverty--nearly $1 trillion cut from Medicare and \nMedicaid and more than $5 trillion overall. But they refused to \ndedicate a single penny of that to roll back the automatic cuts to \neducation, research or defense investments.\n  To put that in perspective, we were able to roll back sequestration \nfor 2 years in the Bipartisan Budget Act with $85 billion in savings. \nBut the Republican budget won't fix the problem even for this coming \nyear with more than 50 times that amount of savings.\n  Instead of using just a tiny fraction of the enormous cuts this \nbudget has in it to pay for investments that both Republicans and \nDemocrats agree must be made, this budget uses a gimmick by increasing \nOCO funding to appear to patch over the problem on the defense side \nwithout raising the cap on defense funding and doing nothing at all for \nnondefense investments such as education, research, jobs, and \ninfrastructure.\n\n[[Page S2621]]\n\n  We know the automatic cuts are terrible policy, and we know the \nPresident has said he would veto spending bills at sequester levels. I \nalso know there are Republicans who have seen the impact of \nsequestration in their States, as I have seen it in my State of \nWashington, and I know there are Republicans who look at this budget \nand wonder why it couldn't use some of the trillions of dollars in cuts \nto reinvest in American innovation or in our defense investments.\n  So I am hopeful that instead of continuing to kick the can down the \nroad or relying on gimmicks that don't actually solve this problem, \nRepublicans will come back to the table and work with us to build on \nour bipartisan budget deal in a balanced and responsible way, will \nallow the Appropriations subcommittees to actually do their work and \nnot wait for another crisis before they push the tea party aside and \nwork with us to get this done.\n  Instead of rehashing old debates and lurching us toward another \ncompletely avoidable crisis, we should be working together to put in \nplace policies that boost the economy and help our working families--\npolicies such as allowing workers to earn paid sick days. No worker \nshould have to sacrifice a day's pay or their job altogether just to \ntake care of themselves or their sick child. But today, in this \ncountry, 43 million Americans do not have access to paid sick days.\n  Making sure more workers have this basic worker protection will give \nmore families some much-needed economic stability. And, by the way, it \nis pro-business. Access to paid sick days boosts productivity, and it \nreduces turnover--two huge benefits for employers.\n  Businesses that want to help their workers stay healthy should have a \nlevel playing field so they aren't at a disadvantage when they do the \nright thing. A strong bipartisan majority of Senators affirmed their \nsupport for allowing workers to earn paid sick days during the budget \namendment process, and I was hopeful we could build on that momentum \nand keep working together to increase the economic security for \nmillions of workers and families.\n  So I was very disappointed that the conference report does not \nreflect that provision. Instead of keeping our bipartisan amendment and \nproviding paid sick days to help workers and families, this conference \nreport instead allows for tax credits for employers that would not \nguarantee access to paid leave. That is a step in the wrong direction. \nBut it doesn't have to be the last step this Congress takes.\n  So I urge our colleagues to work with me to pass the Healthy Families \nAct, legislation that would move this debate beyond budget amendments \nand make paid sick days a reality for millions of Americans. Allowing \nworkers to earn paid sick days is one way we can ensure our workplaces \nare working for all families--not just the wealthiest few.\n  I also want to talk about one more way this budget would be \ndevastating for families across the country. The Affordable Care Act \nwas a critical step forward in our efforts to build a health care \nsystem that puts patients first, and it allows every family to get the \naffordable, high quality health care they need. But the work didn't end \nwhen this law passed--far from it.\n  Families across the country are expecting us to keep working to build \non this progress and continue making health care more affordable, more \naccessible, and with higher quality, and that is what Democrats are \nfocused on. Unfortunately, this Republican budget would do the exact \nopposite. It would roll back all the progress we have made, take us \nback to the bad old days when insurance companies called all the shots, \nwhen being a woman was a preexisting condition, when far fewer families \ncould afford to get the health care they need. In fact, this Republican \napproach could even mean an average tax hike of $3,200 a year on \nworking families who would have to pay more for their care.\n  Families are tired of Republicans playing games with their health \ncare. So I hope my Republican colleagues will listen to the millions of \npeople across the country who have more affordable, quality health care \nand to the vast majority of our constituents, who want us to work \ntogether to solve problems and not rehash old fights, and that they \nwill finally drop the political games and work with us to move our \nhealth care system forward--not backward--for the communities we serve.\n  Republicans control Congress. It is their job to write and pass a \nbudget. But our constituents actually sent us here to work together--\nnot simply to argue with each other. People across the country are \nexpecting us to break through the gridlock once again, like we were \nable to do last Congress, and deliver results for their families and \nthe communities we represent.\n  So I urge my colleagues to oppose this budget that would be \ndevastating to middle-class families, seniors, investments in our \nfuture, and the economy. I really hope that Republicans decide to come \nback to the table and work with us on policies that grow the economy \nfrom the middle out--not from the top down--and that moves us towards a \ngovernment that works for all families--not just the wealthiest few.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Enzi and members of the \nBudget Committee for the 2016 budget conference agreement that we are \ncurrently considering in the Senate. Included in the budget conference \nagreement are policy provisions that I believe begin to move this \ncountry in the right fiscal direction, including balancing the budget \nwithin 10 years without the need to raise taxes on the hardworking \nAmerican taxpayer--something the administration's budget fails to do. \nIn addition, the budget agreement provides a pathway to repeal the \nfailed policies of ObamaCare.\n  I am pleased the resolution does provide some relief from \nsequestration's devastating cuts to our national defense. The good news \nis that there is some relief. Providing additional resources for \ndefense through the Overseas Contingency Operations account, known as \nOCO, is a good one, but it is temporary and it is a Band-Aid.\n  Again, I thank Senator Enzi for the great job he has done, but the \nfact is that this body and this Congress is guilty--is guilty--of not \nrepealing sequestration, which is devastating our military and \ndestroying our ability to defend this Nation in these most perilous and \ndifficult times.\n  Before the Senate Armed Services Committee on January 29, former \nSecretary of State Henry Kissinger testified:\n\n       As we look around the world, we encounter upheaval and \n     conflict. The United States has not faced a more diverse and \n     complex array of crises since the end of the Second World \n     War.\n\n  What are we doing? We are slashing defense year after year through \nsomething called sequestration, which was never intended to happen. \nThat is a devastating indictment of the Congress of the United States \nin our first priority, which is protecting this nation.\n  Gen. Mark Welsh, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, stated:\n\n       We are now the smallest Air Force we've ever been. When we \n     deployed to Operation Desert Storm in 1990, the Air Force had \n     188 fighter squadrons. Today, we have 54, and we're headed to \n     49 in the next couple of years. In 1990, there were 511,000 \n     active duty airmen alone. Today, we have 200,000 fewer. . . . \n     We currently have 12 fleets of airplanes that qualify for \n     antique license plates in the state of Virginia.\n\n  General Odierno, Chief of Staff of the Army, said:\n\n       In the last three years, the Army's active component and \n     strength has been reduced by 80,000; the reserve component by \n     18,000. We have 13 less active component brigade combat \n     teams. We've eliminated three active aviation brigades. . . . \n     We have already slashed investments in modernization by 25 \n     percent.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       The number one thing that keeps me up at night is that if \n     we're asked to respond to an unknown contingency, I will send \n     soldiers to that contingency not properly trained and ready. \n     We simply are not used to doing that.\n\n  Admiral Greenert, the Chief Of Naval Operations:\n\n       [D]ue to sequestration of 2013, our contingency response \n     force, that's what's on call from the United States, is one-\n     third of what it should be and what it needs to be.\n\n  Gen. Joseph Dunford, Commandant of the Marine Corps, now nominated to \nbe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Of Staff, testified:\n\n\n[[Page S2622]]\n\n\n       We're investing in modernization at a historically low \n     level. We know that we must maintain at least 10 percent to \n     12 percent of our resources on modernization to field a ready \n     force for tomorrow. To pay today's bills, we're currently \n     investing 7 percent to 8 percent.\n\n  I asked every single one of our service chiefs and our area \ncommanders the same question: If we do not repeal sequestration, will \nit put the lives of our men and women who are serving in the military \nin greater danger? The answer by every single one of these uniformed \nleaders--not just civilian leaders--was, yes, we will put the lives of \nthe men and women who are serving in the military in greater danger \nunless we repeal sequestration on defense.\n  I say to my colleagues of the United States Senate, this is not \nacceptable. It is not acceptable for us to ask the young men and women \nwho are serving in our military in uniform to put their lives in \ngreater danger because we copped out, we failed to address the issue of \nincreasing an unsustainable deficit. We are making them pay the price.\n  Thirteen percent of the budget is allocated to defense; defense is \ntaking 50 percent of the cuts.\n  The Ryan-Murray agreement was something that was welcomed. We need \nanother Ryan-Murray. We need the men and women who are serving as \nMembers of Congress to understand that we have no greater \nresponsibility than the defense of this Nation.\n  I can assure my colleagues that, working with my friend Senator Reed \nof Rhode Island, the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, we will be working. We will reduce waste and mismanagement. \nWe will address acquisition. We will reform acquisition and the \nterrible cost overruns that plague our ability to do business in the \ndefense business. We will be cutting the size of these huge staffs that \nhave grown and grown. We will be making significant reforms in the way \nthe military does business, but these reforms will not have the impact \nthat is necessary in the short term, and that is that we are putting \nthe lives of American soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen in greater \ndanger.\n  I come to the floor to thank my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, \nfor the great job he has done on this budget. But I would tell my \ncolleagues that we must work together in a bipartisan fashion to fix \nthe damage sequestration is doing.\n  I will only add one other point that is very important. Some of us \nhave forgotten that in the days after the Vietnam war, the military was \nin terrible disarray. Ronald Reagan came to the Presidency on the \nslogan ``Peace through strength.'' We rebuilt the military. We put it \nback in the condition of being the greatest military and effective \nforce in the world, and we won the Cold War.\n  Right now, if you look at a map of the world in 2011 and look at a \nmap of the world today--in 2011 when we enacted sequestration--you will \nfind that Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Madeleine Albright, Brent \nScowcroft, and every person who is respected on national security in \nthis country will tell you that we are in grave danger. Whether it be \nfrom ISIS, whether it be from Iran, whether it be aggressive behavior \nby the Chinese--no matter what it is, there are severe crises, no \nmatter where it is in the world. We are in the midst of serious \nchallenges to our national security, and the last place--the last \nplace--we should continue to cut is on our defense and capability to \ndefend this nation.\n  I yield floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I first wish to thank the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona for his leadership and echo his words that we need \na bipartisan solution on this issue, and hopefully we will be able to \naddress it, not only supporting our men and women when they are \nactively in harm's way but supporting them as veterans, which I know he \ncares deeply about as well. That is why we need a bipartisan and \nbalanced solution like we had before. I thank the Senator for his \nleadership.\n  Mr. President, the reality is that this budget--any budget for the \nUnited States--is about our values and our priorities. That is what it \nis all about as a country. I have to say, as a senior member of the \nBudget Committee, I am deeply concerned about the values portrayed in \nthis budget. I greatly respect the chairman and ranking member and \nthank them for their service, but when we look at this budget in total, \nthis goes opposite to what the majority of Members talk about every day \nbecause this particular budget keeps the system rigged in favor of the \nwealthy and well-connected against the interests of hard-working, \nmiddle-class Americans.\n  Picture this: In this budget, if you are a family with assets of $10 \nmillion or more, you hit the jackpot: You get at least a $3 million \nbonus tax cut in this bill, in terms of the policies laid out in the \nbill. How is it paid for? It is paid for by everybody else. Sixteen \nmillion hard-working Americans will see a tax increase of at least $900 \nbased on these policies. We will see critical investments and services \ncut. There is nothing done to address jobs going overseas. There is not \none loophole proposed to be closed that is sending our jobs overseas. \nWe want to create an economy and really balance the budget? Let's bring \nthose jobs home. There is nothing in this budget about that. If you \nhave wealth of over $10 million, it is your lucky day--$3 million or \nmore in your pocket. There is Christmas in this budget for very wealthy \nmultimillionaires, but if you are everybody else, you are in trouble.\n  There is no focus on creating jobs. And God help you if your family \nhas a mom or dad or grandpa or grandma who has Alzheimer's disease and \nis in a nursing home because this budget guts nursing home care for \nmillions of Americans, a lot of folks who desperately need that care.\n  One out of five Medicare dollars today goes to treat Alzheimer's. \nThis is an area I have been deeply involved in and I am partnering with \nSenator Susan Collins on, important work that needs to be done. But if \nyou have someone who has Alzheimer's disease and who needs long-term \ncare, you are out of luck in this budget.\n  This morning, I talked to a group of women who are in town for breast \ncancer research. This is the month that focuses on breast cancer \nresearch. If you care about breast cancer research, in this budget, you \nare out of luck. If you want to make sure we are investing in cures and \ntreatments--we are now so close in so many areas. American research, \ninnovation, and the best minds in the world are working on \nopportunities to us to solve Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and \ncancers and all kinds of other areas of concern. But the budget is cut \nfor NIH, the National Institutes of Health. What kinds of priorities \ndoes this reflect?\n  On top of that, for 16.4 million people who now have affordable \ninsurance, it will be gone.\n  What is interesting about the budget is it is very creative because \nall the revenue, all the fees to pay for health care stay to help \nbalance the budget; it is the health care that goes away. So for those \nbreast cancer patients whom I talked to this morning who are now so \ngrateful that if they need go out and get new insurance, they will not \nbe called someone with a pre-existing condition, that goes away in this \nbudget.\n  If you have a child who is 22, 23, just graduated--I spoke at \ngraduation ceremonies this last weekend--and they are on your insurance \nright now while they are trying to get themselves together and get that \nfirst job, that goes away.\n  This budget attacks health care, which, by the way, is not a frill. \nWe do not control when and how we get sick or if our children get sick \nor if our parents or grandparents need a nursing home or what may \nhappen in terms of medical issues in our families, but health care is \ndirectly attacked. The Affordable Care Act--gone. Gutting inpatient \ncare in nursing homes for Alzheimer's patients and others. Research--\ngone.\n  We are hearing from our Republican friends that they are making \ngovernment work. But I will tell you what--it is not working for \nmiddle-class families. It is working for you if you are making over $10 \nmillion a year or have more than $10 million in assets, but it is not \nworking for you if you are holding down two or three jobs and you are \njust trying to make it for your family.\n  We believe as Democrats that this ought to be a middle-class budget \nbecause everybody deserves a fair shot to get ahead and have a chance \nto have a better future. For us, that means this\n\n[[Page S2623]]\n\nbudget should have a major focus on creating millions of jobs by \nrebuilding our roads, rebuilding our bridges, our infrastructure.\n  By the way, the funding for that--the authorization for the highway \ntrust fund--runs out at the end of May. There is nothing in here to \naddress that, no funding in here to address that. We are going to see \nall kinds of jobs eliminated all across the country if that funding is \neliminated. We believe in rebuilding our roads and bridges and creating \nmillions of jobs.\n  We stand up for Social Security and Medicare. This budget has $430 \nbillion in cuts to Medicare, and it doesn't say where they come from. \nIt is proposing a structure that would actually eliminate Medicare as \nwe know it and turn it into some kind of a voucher system or some other \nkind of system that is not guaranteed care under Medicare. We believe \nin protecting Medicare and Social Security.\n  We believe everybody ought to have a fair chance to work hard and \nmake it and go to college. This does nothing but increase costs for \nstudents going to college. We believe costs ought to go down so that \nwhen students leave college, they do not end up with so much debt that \nthey cannot go out and buy a house. People cannot buy a house, as \nrealtors in Michigan have told me, because they have so much debt. They \ncannot qualify to get a loan for a house or to start a new business.\n  We, as Democrats, want to make sure everybody has a chance to go to \ncollege, that it is affordable, that we are protecting Social Security \nand Medicare, and that we are creating jobs, rebuilding our roads and \nour highways and the opportunity to invest in America.\n  Finally, we want to bring jobs home. It is insane that we still have \na Tax Code that rewards those--sometimes only on paper--who leave this \ncountry. They still breathe the air, drink the water, drive on the \nroads, they just don't have to pay their fair share of taxes as \nbusinesses because on paper they are based somewhere else. That is not \nfair to every small business in Michigan that is working hard every \nday. It is not fair to every taxpayer across this country and every \nbusiness we have that is really an American business. There is nothing \nin this budget which addresses that.\n  I conclude by saying we should resoundingly object and vote no on the \npriorities and the values set out in this budget. They do not reflect \nwhat is good to create and grow a middle class and create opportunity \nin this country.\n  If you are one of the privileged few, hallelujah. Break out the \nchampagne after this passes. But if you are the majority of Americans, \nhold on to your seats and put on your seatbelt, because if this is, in \nfact, put into place, it will be a rough ride for America. Our side is \ngoing to do everything humanly possible to make sure that does not \nhappen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my great colleague from Michigan \nfor her outstanding words and leadership. She is a senior member of the \nBudget Committee. She knows just what is wrong with this budget and she \nknows how to reach the American people in terms of revealing and \nshowing just that. I thank her.\n  I thank my dear friend Senator Sanders, a fellow graduate of James \nMadison High School in Brooklyn, for his great leadership on the Budget \nCommittee as well.\n  Look, in a certain sense, this Republican budget is a gift to us and \nto the American people because it shows their real priorities, and \ntheir priorities are so far away from what average Americans want that \nthis budget will resound from one end of the country to the other \nbetween now and November of 2016.\n  The budget the House and Senate Republicans have put together helps \nthe very wealthy and powerful in our country who, frankly, don't need \nany help. This idea that cutting taxes on the very wealthy will somehow \nmake America a better place, how many Americans actually believe that? \nWe understand a lot of our colleagues do. They hang out with these \npeople, I guess. But that is not what most Americans think, that is for \nsure.\n  The budget should reflect the economic reality right now. Middle-\nclass incomes are declining. It is harder to stay in the middle class. \nIt is harder to reach the middle class. A budget should help those \nfolks who are in the middle class stay there, and it should help those \nwho are trying to get to the middle class create ladders so they can \nget there.\n  Again, this budget seems to focus all of its attention and all of its \ngoodies on the very wealthy. The economy is getting stronger but mainly \nat the very high end. So we need to cut their taxes because they are \nhurting? And at the same time we need to raise taxes on 16 million \nAmericans who are working and making $20,000, $30,000, $40,000 a year--\nraise their taxes by $900? How many Americans would say we should cut \ntaxes on the 4,000 wealthiest people an average of $3 million, at the \ncost of $260 billion over 10 years, and raise taxes by $900 on people \nmaking $20,000, $30,000, $40,000 a year? Is it 1 percent of America who \nthinks that way? Maybe. But it seems our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle followed that Pied Piper, that 1 percent, in putting \ntogether their budget. It makes no sense.\n  The Republican budget is a document of willful ignorance. It was \nconstructed in an ideological house of mirrors where no one sees \nreality. No one who put together this budget sees any reality. They \ndon't see middle-class people struggling.\n  Making it harder to pay for college? What the heck is going on here \nin this great America? Our colleagues are trying to pass a budget that \nsays we should make it harder to pay for college, that veterans should \nlose food stamps--veterans, the people who served us. I am sure the \nvast majority of them are looking for jobs and income. That is who \nveterans are. They don't want a handout. But when they are down on \ntheir luck--maybe they had injuries, maybe it was rough adjusting to \nfamily life back home again--you cut their food stamps? Wow. What kind \nof budget is this? As I said, it is a budget in an ideological house of \nmirrors.\n  Cap student loan payments? There are 30- and 40-year-olds with huge \nburdens of debt. They cannot even buy a home. Maybe they even put off \nhaving kids. In this budget, our Republican friends are saying we \nshould eliminate and cut programs so we can reduce some of that debt \nburden. Wow. What world are you folks living in? It sure isn't the \nworld of reality. It is an ideological house of mirrors. It is a budget \ndocument of willful ignorance.\n  I could go on and on and on with this budget. How many families have \nelderly parents in nursing homes who have Alzheimer's? We know that \ntragedy. This budget makes it harder for those people to stay in those \nnursing homes by cutting Medicaid, which many of them are on. And then \nthese young families are going to have the burden of taking their dear \nparents, their loved ones, back into their homes. Do we want that?\n  Well, you say, we have to cut somewhere. How about not giving the \n4,000 richest families $260 billion over 10 years and putting some of \nthe money into cancer research, putting some of the money into helping \nveterans feed themselves, putting some of the money into helping make \nit easier to pay for college?\n  Republicans are going to have to figure out a way to convince the \nAmerican people that they are doing something, anything, to help the \nmiddle class. So far they are striking out.\n  There is only one bit of good news. Our colleagues, when they are \nforced to actually put real numbers to these budget numbers in the \nappropriations process, will not be able to do it. They will not dare \ndo it. I hope--this will be up to our ranking member Senator Mikulski \nand the members of our Appropriations Committee--they take this budget \nand actually craft it into the appropriations bill and put it out \nthere, and let's see how many of our colleagues actually vote for it.\n  How many of our colleagues will vote to make it harder to pay for \ncollege? How many of our colleagues will make it harder for veterans to \nfeed themselves when they are out of luck? How many of our colleagues \nwill vote to raise taxes by $900 on people making $30,000, $40,000 a \nyear? I doubt many.\n  This is a fun day for our Republican colleagues. They get to beat \ntheir ideological breasts, show the hard right\n\n[[Page S2624]]\n\nthey really mean it, and then maybe we can go back to governing the \ncountry and helping the middle class.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to speak as well about the budget \nthat is before the Senate. I want to point out something I believe the \nSenator from New York failed to mention in his comments. We are \nactually doing a budget. That is what is pretty historic about this.\n  A few years back, I got on the Budget Committee because I thought it \nwould be the place where a lot of action was going to occur and where \nwe were going to be doing big, consequential things for the country. I \nasked our leaders, when they made committee assignments, if I could \nserve on the Budget Committee. I served on the Budget Committee for 4 \nyears. In the 4 years I was on the Budget Committee, when the Democrats \ncontrolled this Chamber, we did not write a budget--not a single year. \nIt was like being on a committee that was completely irrelevant around \nhere. We did not do a budget for 4 years. This year, we are finally \ngoing to pass a budget. They only did do one in 2009 so they could pass \nObamaCare with 51 votes.\n  The last time we actually had a 10-year balanced budget was in 2001. \nSo we are talking about something that is pretty historic. This is the \nfirst time this has happened in 14 years. I will repeat that. The last \ntime Congress passed a joint 10-year balanced budget resolution was 14 \nyears ago, in 2001--the year Apple released the first iPod.\n  This year, the President has, once again, proposed a budget that \nnever balances--not in 10 years, not in 25 years, not ever. When the \nother side gets up and talks about the Republican budget and attacks \nit, at least Republicans in this Chamber recognize the importance of \nhaving a budget and putting in place a pathway, if you will, for how we \nare going to get the fiscal situation of this country in a better \nplace, and it sets out our priorities because that is really what the \nbudget process does. It says this is what we are for.\n  What the Democrats argue--and we heard the Senator from New York \nmaking the argument--is that we are not spending enough and that this \nis about spending more. I believe the American people realize that if \nwe want to solve middle-class wage stagnation--they talk about the \nmiddle-class wages being lower, and they are lower. They have been \nsignificantly lower since this President took office. As I was saying, \nif we want to solve middle-class wage stagnation, we have to have an \nexpanding economy.\n  The way to help people into a better place economically and to raise \nthe income of people in this country is to get a growing, vibrant, \nrobust, expanding economy that is growing at a faster rate than the \nanemic 1- to 2-percent growth we have seen in the last few years. The \nway we achieve that is not by growing the government. It is not about \ngrowing the government. We have to grow the economy. When the economy \nis growing, that is when we start to see people in this country, \nmiddle-class income families, benefit.\n  As I said, the President proposed a budget that never balanced, and \nhe proposed increasing spending by a staggering 65 percent over the \nnext 10 years. I don't need to tell the American people that kind of \nspending is unsustainable. For too long the attitude in Washington has \nbeen to spend now, pay later. That only works for so long. Sooner or \nlater your spending catches up with you.\n  Six years ago, when the President took office, our national debt was \nalready a massive $10.6 trillion. Over the past 6 years, during the \nPresident's administration, our national debt has increased by more \nthan $7.5 trillion, and today it is at a dangerously high $18.2 \ntrillion. That is the size of our economy. In fact, that is larger than \nour economy. That is a 1-to-1 ratio. That kind of debt slows economic \ngrowth, threatens government programs, such as Social Security and \nMedicare, and jeopardizes our Nation's future.\n  In 2011, then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ADM Mike Mullen, \nthe highest ranking military official in our country, said, ``I've said \nmany times that I believe the single, biggest threat to our national \nsecurity is our debt.'' I have heard him say that. I served on the \nArmed Services Committee for 6 years. I heard the chairman of the Joint \nChiefs say that repeatedly in front of committees at various hearings \nand at various times. That is quite a statement from the country's top-\nranking military official: the greatest threat to our national security \nis our debt.\n  If we keep racking up our debt the way we have been doing, we will \nnot be able to pay for our priorities, such as Social Security, \nMedicare, national defense, and infrastructure. All of those priorities \ncould face huge cuts if we don't get our Nation on a sound fiscal \nfooting.\n  When the Republicans took control of the Senate in January, we were \ndetermined to get Washington working again. We knew that one of the \nmost important steps in that process was passing a balanced budget \nresolution. Republicans understand what every American family knows; \nthat you cannot keep racking up debt indefinitely and that the solution \nto being in debt is not to increase spending.\n  In March, we introduced a budget blueprint that would balance the \nbudget in 10 years and put our Nation on a path to fiscal health. House \nRepublicans introduced a similar balanced budget resolution. During the \nmonth of April, the two Houses came together to iron out the \ndifferences in our blueprints and produced the final document that we \nwill be voting on today.\n  It is not a perfect document. It does not solve every one of our \nNation's problems, but at long last it gets us moving in a different \ndirection--in the right direction. Instead of ignoring our Nation's \nfiscal problems, the Republicans' budget resolution addresses them and \npromotes spending restraint.\n  Under our budget blueprint, by the time the 10-year budget closes in \n2025, our Nation will be running a surplus of $24 billion instead of \nracking up another $1.5 trillion in deficits every single year. Unlike \nsome budget plans, our budget will continue to balance in 2026 and \nbeyond.\n  In addition to restraining spending, the Republicans' budget \nresolution focuses on cutting waste and eliminating the inefficiency \nand redundancy that plagues so many government programs. Our budget \nalso puts in place reforms that will encourage honest accounting. The \nresult of these provisions will be a more efficient, effective, and \naccountable government that works for the American people.\n  Our budget also, as I said, makes a healthy economy a priority. \nAlmost 6 years after the recession has ended, millions of Americans are \nstill struggling and opportunities for advancement are still few and \nfar between. A big reason for that is the oppressive, big-government \npolicies and deficit spending of the Obama administration. Our budget \nwill help stop government from strangling the economy by limiting the \ngrowth of spending and reducing the debt, which will help reduce the \ncost of work and investment and the cost of starting and growing a \nbusiness. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that our \nbudget will result in an additional $400 billion in economic growth \nover the next 10 years.\n  The Republicans' budget will also pave the way for the removal of \ninefficient and ineffective government regulations that are making it \ndifficult for many businesses to hire new workers and create new \nopportunities and higher paying jobs.\n  Our budget also addresses another priority of American families, and \nthat is fixing our Nation's broken health care system. Now 5 years on, \nthe President's health care law has resulted in higher costs, lost \nhealth care plans, reduced access to doctors, and new burdens on \nbusinesses, both large and small. In fact, it has been pretty much one \ndisaster after another.\n  Just this week, a USA TODAY headline announced that ``contrary to \ngoals, ER visits rise under ObamaCare.'' The article says: ``Three-\nquarters of emergency physicians say they've seen ER patient visits \nsurge since ObamaCare took effect--just the opposite of what many \nAmericans expected would happen.'' That is from the USA TODAY article. \nOf course, as we know, ER visits are our most expensive form of health \ncare.\n  It is no surprise that the majority of the American people continue \nto oppose the law. Our budget paves the way for a repeal of ObamaCare \nand the introduction of real, patient-centered\n\n[[Page S2625]]\n\nhealth care reforms that will give Americans more health care choices \nat a lower cost.\n  Finally, our budget will start the process of putting major \nentitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare on a sounder \nfooting going forward. Right now, the Social Security trust fund is \nheaded toward bankruptcy. If we don't take action, Social Security \nrecipients could be facing a 25-percent cut in benefits by the year \n2033. Medicare faces similar challenges to those faced by Social \nSecurity. Under the worst-case scenario, the Medicare trust fund could \nbecome insolvent by as early as 2021. That is just 6 short years away. \nThe Republican budget would help preserve Medicare by extending the \ntrust fund's solvency for an additional 5 years, which would protect \nretirees' benefits while giving policymakers additional time to ensure \nthat this program provides support to seniors for decades to come.\n  I am proud that today the Republicans in Congress will ensure that we \nhave a joint balanced budget resolution for the first time in 14 years, \nbut I also wish to emphasize that is no more than what the American \npeople should expect. The American people, after all, have to live \nwithin a budget; their government needs to do so as well.\n  Going forward, balanced budgets need to be the norm here in Congress. \nWashington has spent enough time working for its own interests. It is \ntime to get Washington working again for American families.\n  This is the first time in 14 years that we have actually had a budget \nresolution and a conference report that balance within 10 years. As I \nsaid earlier, during my time here in the Senate, which hasn't been that \nlong but about 10 years now, this is the first time--with the exception \nof 2009, in which we did a budget simply so the Democrats could pass \nObamaCare through reconciliation--this is the first time we have done a \nbudget that passed both chambers in the 10 years I have been here, with \nthe exception perhaps of the first few years.\n  It is time to get Washington working again for the American people. \nIt starts with passing the budget. That is why I am proud that Senator \nEnzi and others worked hard to get us where we are. I hope today we \nwill ultimately have the votes necessary to pass this and do something \nwhich hasn't been done around here in a very long time but which is \nreally essential for the good of the American people in this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/05/senate-section/article/S2625-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise today to speak in opposition to the Republican so-called \nbudget. I call it a ``so-called budget'' because I do not believe even \nRepublicans would actually pass appropriations consistent with it. It \nlooks to me like it is just a show to keep extremists on the right \nhappy. My guess is that practical Republicans cannot wait for President \nObama to bail them out by negotiating appropriations higher.\n  Recently, we have seen impressive examples of committee \nbipartisanship. In Foreign Relations, Senator Corker brought a \nunanimously bipartisan Iran resolution out of the poisonous turmoil \nsurrounding that issue. In the HELP Committee, Senator Alexander \nbrought a unanimously bipartisan education bill out of committee on an \nissue that has long been contested. Even the intensely divided \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee brought out a chemical \nregulation bill with a strong bipartisan majority. But Budget? No \nchance.\n  Instead of working with Democrats on a real budget, Republicans \nproduced a partisan ideological showcase. They cut programs for \nseniors, for low-income families, and for other vulnerable citizens and \nprotected the wealthiest Americans from contributing even one dime in \ndeficit reduction.\n  As we have seen in the past, Republicans care about deficit reduction \nonly when it involves cutting programs for people who need help. But \ncan they find a single tax loophole to cut? Not one.\n  This budget follows the Ryan budget off the cliff of shielding every \nsingle subsidy and giveaway in the Tax Code. No special interest tax \nloophole is too grotesque for them. Big Oil tax subsidies, special low \nrates for hedge fund managers, private jet depreciation, for goodness' \nsake--tax giveaways that amount to nothing more than taxpayer subsidies \nfor the wealthy and well connected--this budget loves and protects them \nall.\n  Not only do the Republicans protect every tax loophole, they propose \neliminating the estate tax--a tax that only affects families worth over \n$10 million--the top 0.2 percent. You may have heard a lot about the 1 \npercent. Well, this budget does even better than that. It confers a \ngreat, wonderful, fat favor on the top 0.2 percent and, at the same \ntime, the budget will allow the taxes to increase on 13 million lower- \nand middle-income households--households with 25 million children. That \nis a $300 billion tax giveaway to that 0.2 percent--to basically 5,000-\nsome of the wealthiest families in America. And that big gift to those \n5,000-and-some wealthiest families is paired with a tax hike for \nmillions of families who are just getting by.\n  And, of course, it is lower-income and middle-class families who \nwould suffer the most from the Republican spending cuts. Medicaid, food \nstamps, Pell grants, and job training all get axed. They hand Medicare \nover to private sector vouchers and kick 16 million Americans off of \nhealth insurance plans they obtained through the Affordable Care Act.\n  Today, across this Capitol, breast cancer advocates are asking for \nour support for investment to help cure that deadly disease. This \nbudget cuts research for breast cancer and other deadly diseases. It \nslashes funding for nursing homes, including those that care for \nseniors with Alzheimer's. It even supports a 20-percent across-the-\nboard benefit cut for disabled Americans--a 20-percent benefit cut for \ndisabled Americans--by doubling down on the senseless House rule that \ncan be used to create an artificial crisis and prevent a routine Social \nSecurity fix.\n  As for the investments that keep our Nation competitive in an \nincreasingly global economy, all are attacked. From scientific research \nto education to infrastructure, the Republicans offer a radical plan of \ncuts.\n  In a nutshell, their behavior proves that the deficit is just a \npretext for them to cut programs that Republicans have always opposed--\nprograms that create jobs, support the middle class, and offer \nlifelines to the most vulnerable Americans.\n  Even transportation infrastructure--our roads and bridges--gets \nwhacked. Much of our highway system dates back to the 1950s, and roads \nand bridges across the country are in dire need of repair and \nreplacement. This budget fails to provide any new funding for \ninfrastructure. It does not even ensure that current funding levels \nwill be maintained.\n\n[[Page S2626]]\n\n  This matters because the current funding authorization for highway \nand transit projects expires at the end of the month. That will imperil \nconstruction projects and jobs just as we enter the busy summer highway \nconstruction season. There is no plan to deal with that that \nRepublicans have announced--no bill in any committee.\n  In the budget, Republicans had an opportunity for a big win-win. They \ncould have upgraded America's roads and bridges and supported millions \nof jobs. Ranking Member Sanders even offered an amendment that would \nhave paid for infrastructure investments by closing some of these \ncorporate tax loopholes. All Republicans had to do was vote yes. But \ncorporate tax loopholes were too important, and roads and bridges did \nnot matter. They chose to protect their cherished tax giveaways for \nspecial interests. Today the clock still ticks toward a looming highway \njobs shutdown.\n  This will hurt a lot of States. It will particularly hurt my home \nState of Rhode Island. We are a historic and densely populated State. \nWe have aging and heavily used infrastructure. Lots of our roads and \nbridges are in poor condition. One study found that the average \nmotorist in Rhode Island pays an extra $637 per year for car repairs \nand operating costs because of potholes and bumps and other bad road \nconditions. It is not just Rhode Island. This is true also across the \ncountry. Nationwide, poor road conditions are estimated to cost our \ncountry more than $100 billion a year--over $500 per motorist. The \nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers gives America's bridges a grade of \nonly C-plus. It gives our roads a D.\n  Where is the plan to address this? Where is the plan to help the \nworking Americans who have to spend $500 or $637 a year because we do \nnot take care of our roads and highways? There is none.\n  Well, I understand that the Republicans in the Senate have been in \nthe minority for a long time and old habits die hard. But the \nresponsibility of a majority is to be responsible. Republicans passed \nup the opportunity to be responsible in their budget with highway \nfunding. This should not be that difficult. They could start by looking \nat the bipartisan 6-year highway bill approved last year in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. My recollection is that it was \napproved unanimously. That bill would have provided the certainty that \nour State departments of transportation need to plan for the big \nmultiyear, job-creating projects that our years of deferred maintenance \nhave brought due.\n  The extremist Republican budget under the Senate rules does not need \nDemocratic support, and it appears that the Republicans do not even \nwant Democratic support. Under the Senate rules, this budget will pass \nthis Chamber. The good news about that is that the budget is merely \npolitical theater. The penalty for violating this budget is a 60-vote \npoint of order. Nowadays it takes 60 votes to pass an appropriations \nbill. So in effect the penalty is a nullity. So there is really nothing \nto violating the budget.\n  The real budget will be sent to us through the Appropriations \nCommittee, and the real numbers will be negotiated upwards, and the \nRepublicans will be relieved of the human responsibility for what would \nhappen if this budget were actually to guide our appropriations. That \nis the good news.\n  The bad news is that it is a missed opportunity to try to work in any \nkind of a bipartisan fashion. It is a missed opportunity to address \nissues that Americans agree on, such as maintaining our bridges and \nhighways.\n  I hope very much that my friends on the other side of the aisle will \nbegin to work with Democrats on addressing, with some semblance of \nbipartisanship, our constituents' needs in that regard. With funding \nset to expire in just a few weeks, and with no Republican plan on the \nhorizon to address it, we should at least begin with a bipartisan \nconversation about a long-term highway bill.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise as we are talking about the \nbudget, and I want to talk a little bit about that today, being a \nmember of the Budget Committee and someone very concerned about the \nfiscal direction of our country. I also want to talk about a trip I \ntook to Israel. Over the last weekend, I was in Israel having meetings \nwith Prime Minister Netanyahu, members of the Knesset, the Minister of \nIntelligence, the Deputy Foreign Minister, and others, and part of what \nI want to talk about in the budget relates to that.\n  This budget, by the way, is the first time in 6 years that we have \nhad the ability for the House and Senate to come together and have a \ncongressional budget. During that 6 years, by the way, I think there \nhas been $8 trillion added to the national debt. During that 6 years, \nthere has not been adequate oversight of the departments and agencies \nof government, partly because there hasn't been a budget. Without a \nbudget, it is very difficult to go through the appropriations process, \nwhich means that not only has spending been high--more money being \nspent than coming in, in terms of revenue year after year to the tune \nof hundreds of billions of dollars--but also we haven't had the ability \nto have the appropriate checks and balances, oversight of the various \nagencies we have in the appropriations process.\n  So, after 6 years, it is about time. My constituents, when I say it \nis the first time in 6 years we have been able to pass a budget, they \nsay, well, what took you so long. Why is it that I have to have a \nbudget in my family, have to have a budget in my business and in our \ncommunity, the county, and the State, and Congress can't get its act \ntogether? So we are, this afternoon, I believe, going to pass this \nbudget, and it does provide this framework for going forward.\n  What is that framework? Well, it is a balanced budget over 10 years. \nAlthough it is the first time Congress would come together in 6 years \nto have a budget, it is actually the first time since 2001 that there \nhas been a budget that gets to balance that is presented and passed by \nthis Congress. That is important.\n  Earlier, one of my colleagues was talking about everything that was \ncut by this budget. Actually, those decisions are going to be made by \nthe Appropriations Committee. That is appropriate. They are the \ncommittee responsible for defending every dime. Congress has that \nresponsibility. They are the ones who should look at the priorities. \nThey are the ones who should decide which program is working and which \none is not working, which ones should get less money, which ones should \nget more money, which ones should be reformed and changed. That is the \nprocess we are going to be undertaking, and it is exactly what we are \nhired to do.\n  Is it an easy vote? No. Yet we see this afternoon we will get the \nnecessary 51 votes to pass this budget and begin to move the country \nforward. It not only balances the budget in 10 years, it does it \nwithout raising taxes. It does it in a way that actually strengthens \nMedicare, protects Social Security, supports a healthier and stronger \neconomy that we need in this country.\n  We just had the economic growth numbers come out for the first \nquarter and, boy, are they disappointing--0.2 percent. We just had some \nweak numbers in terms of jobs numbers last month. We have to do better. \nWe can and should do better. Part of it starts with better policies \nhere in Washington, DC. We need policies that encourage people to get \nout there and work hard, take a risk, and let people know that if they \ndo play by the rules and work hard, they can get ahead. There is so \nmuch more we can do with tax reform and regulatory relief and coming up \nwith smart ways to deal with health care. That is what this budget \ndoes, by the way.\n  It also improves the efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability of \ngovernment. This is very important. It has a particular provision that \nI feel strongly about, as the Presiding Officer knows. He has done a \ngreat job of shepherding us through the Budget Committee to make sure \nwe could have the information on the floor of the Senate to decide the \nbest tax reform to pursue.\n\n[[Page S2627]]\n\nWe will now have not just what is called the static analysis but also \nan analysis, that takes into account that tax policy does change \npeople's behavior. We all know that--everybody knows that--but we \nhaven't had that information until now. This macroeconomic scoring of a \ntax provision is going to make it more likely to come up with good tax \nreform that will help give this economy the shot in the arm it needs to \nget moving.\n  I am pleased with the fact that we are finally going to move forward \non a budget. It is discouraging that it took this long--6 years--but \nwith the Republican majority we committed to do this, and I am very \npleased that this afternoon we are going to finally see, for the hard-\nworking taxpayers whom I represent, the opportunity to actually have a \nbudget around here and to get individual appropriations bills done.\n  One other part of the budget that relates to the trip I just took is \nour defense spending. The budget helps to provide more avenues for \nincreasing defense where needed, and in this dangerous world in which \nwe live, we do have to ensure that we have a strong defense that is up \nto the challenges we face.\n\n\n                                 Israel\n\n  Mr. President, I just returned from a trip to Israel, where I had \nvery productive meetings with Prime Minister Netanyahu, with the \nSecretaries, the Ministers of Intelligence, the Deputy Foreign \nMinister, other Israeli officials, as well as our Ambassador over there \nand his team.\n  The reason for going to Israel was the same as with the previous \nvisits; that is, to learn firsthand from those on the ground about the \nbest way forward in a very volatile and dangerous region of the world, \nto show support for our ally Israel and, finally, to report back to my \nOhio constituents and to the Senate as we face these challenging issues \nwe have in the region. I saw when I was there, again, how since its \nindependence in 1948, the people of Israel have not only learned how to \nsurvive, how to make do in sometimes a very unforgiving strategic and \nnatural environment, but have also learned how to thrive.\n  They boast the region's most dynamic economy now. It is also the \nregion's most vibrant democracy, with an open society that promotes the \nvalues of freedom, tolerance, and equality. It is a small population. \nThey have very little land and very few natural resources, and they are \nfaced with aggression from all sides. Throughout its history, Israel \nhas faced these challenges through both the power of the head and the \nheart--knowledge, innovation, grit, and determination--to build and \ndefend the world's one and only Jewish State and the one democracy in \nthe region.\n  It is against this general backdrop that I wanted to talk to the \nPrime Minister and other leaders about some really important topics \nthat we face in the Senate; one is the ongoing nuclear talks and how to \nprevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, as well as how to \naddress Iran's current aggression all throughout the region.\n  Second, I wanted to talk about the insidious campaign going on around \nthe world. It is a campaign to delegitimize Israel through boycotts, \ndivestments, and sanctions. I have been involved in this for years. Ten \nyears ago, I worked on this as the U.S. Trade Representative. Most \nrecently, I joined Senator Ben Cardin in a bipartisan effort that was \nsuccessful in adding an amendment to the trade bill that is working its \nway through the system, to tell our trading partners you cannot \nboycott, divest, and sanction Israel if you want to do business with \nus.\n  Third, I want to talk about the myriad of challenges that face this \nregion and the destabilizing of it right now: ISIS, the civil war in \nSyria, the immediate challenges Israel faces with the terrorist \nactivities of Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and in Syria.\n  Finally, I wanted to talk about the Israel-Palestinian dialogue, the \nopportunity for peace and a two-state solution.\n  Of all these threats, I suppose Israel's greatest threat lies in \nIran. Iran has been described, by the way, as a regime that is the No. \n1 state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Let's remember that, \nremember whom we are dealing with. This has been true since 1984, when \nthey put Iran on the terrorist list. I think there are only four \ncountries on it, and one is Cuba, that I am sure the administration \nwould like to remove from that list. So this is a small list of \ncountries.\n  According to the administration, the Iranian regime is able to \nproduce enough material for a nuclear weapon in sometime between 3 \nmonths and 1 year, depending on which testimony you hear from the \nadministration. They also acknowledge that it supports terrorist groups \nsuch as Hezbollah. It funds other Shiite militias as it seeks regional \ndominance in Iraq. We have seen this in Yemen most recently, but also \nin Syria and elsewhere. They also have supported a Sunni group, Hamas, \nas they lobbed rockets into Israel. Many of those rockets have been \nprovided, apparently, through Iran. Of course, we should not forget \nthat this behavior comes from a regime that has pledged to \n``annihilate,'' ``destroy,'' and ``wipe Israel off the map.''\n  Like many of my colleagues in the Senate, I have serious concerns \nabout the framework of the nuclear agreement and what may follow in a \ncomprehensive deal. Given the importance of this issue, I feel strongly \nthat Congress should play a role in analyzing any agreement and \napproving or disapproving it. Our negotiating objective, in my view, \nshould be an enforceable agreement; one that contains concrete and \nverifiable steps to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons \ncapability.\n  For years, the international community demanded that Iran dismantle \nits nuclear program--most notably by halting all enrichment activity. \nIf you look at the U.N. resolution and the activity around that, it is \npretty strong language. From what we know, it appears that the so-\ncalled framework agreement is still a great distance from that. I hope \nthat can be improved. We are looking at a model of an agreement that \naims to freeze the nuclear program but somehow doesn't dismantle it. I \ncertainly would have preferred the dismantlement model, and with the \ntough sanctions we put in place, I had hoped that was doable. But given \nwhere we are and given Israel's expertise and focus, I wanted to learn \nmore about why the Israelis think the framework agreement is inadequate \nand whether it can be turned into a better agreement.\n  There are many important questions that remain, and sadly only a few \nof them have satisfactory answers in the current framework agreement. \nIn fact, the Iranian version and the U.S. version of the text seem to \ndiffer on some of the key details. If you hear from them, they say one \nthing and we say another. In particular, I returned from this trip \ncontinuing my focus on what I think is perhaps the most important issue \nof all, which is the sanctions relief. The U.S. Congress put these \nsanctions in place, encouraging the administration. If we give the \nIranian regime sanctions relief on day one before they have kept their \nword on any deal, we will be contributing a cash windfall to Iran's \nongoing efforts to further destabilize an ever-growing list of \ncountries--think about it--Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Yemen, and so on. \nWhether it is sanctions relief or whether it is releasing frozen oil \nrevenues in banks that are all around the world, getting the proceeds \nfrom sales of oil that are now frozen in banks, if that becomes \nsomething the Iranians can use, that kind of financial relief would be \na step to fuel war, not peace.\n  So these are the right areas to focus on when it comes to Iran, not \njust for Israel's sake, of course, but for the sake of peace and \nstability in the region and for our sake, our national security, and \nthe world's sake.\n  I am hopeful we can pass the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act and \nsafeguard Congress's role. I hope we can move to a bipartisan consensus \non the floor of the Senate. But what constitutes a good deal? I believe \nconsensus could provide a measuring stick to determine what kind of an \nagreement would produce a lasting peace and also provide the \nadministration some leverage, give them some leverage to be able to \nnegotiate a more effective agreement by having that debate on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  Attacks on Israel, of course, don't always come from rockets, \nmissiles, or other violent means. Increasingly, opponents of Israel are \nusing economic weapons to target Israel. The boycott,\n\n[[Page S2628]]\n\ndivestment, and sanctions movement--also called BDS--is an effort to \nundermine Israel's sovereignty and further isolate it from the \ninternational community, really delegitimize the state.\n  Senator Cardin and I recently authored the United States-Israel Trade \nEnhancement Act of 2015. It has a very simple purpose. It says that the \nUnited States will leverage trade to stop efforts to delegitimize \nIsrael, especially when, as I look at it, having just been there, some \nof these BDS efforts actually harm the Palestinians in the West Bank, \nwhom I think some of these efforts are meant to help.\n  Our legislation leverages ongoing trade negotiations to discourage \nour trading partners from engaging in this economic discrimination. I \nhave seen how it works. I know trade can be effective. We did this with \nOman when I was in the U.S. Trade Representative's office, as they \nwanted to negotiate a trade agreement, and the same with Bahrain. Both \nof those agreements ended up removing their boycotts of Israel. I \ntalked with Saudi Arabia when I negotiated for their accession to the \nWTO, where again we were able to make progress in providing, in that \ncase, equal treatment to Israel.\n  I am very proud that the Cardin-Portman amendment was the first and \none of only three amendments to pass out of the Finance Committee when \nwe took up the trade promotion authority bill.\n  In my meetings with U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro, the \nForeign Ministry, Israeli national security officials, and in my \ndiscussions with the Prime Minister, I gained some additional insight \ninto how BDS actually works in practice, and I came home more resolved \nthan ever to work in a bipartisan way to ensure that we don't have this \ndiscrimination and painfully obvious double standard with Israel. For \ninstance, its advocates only insist on isolation and penalties for \nIsrael--not other countries--over territorial disputes and turn a blind \neye to other territorial disputes around the world.\n  Finally, I talked to officials at length about general turmoil in the \nMiddle East and Israel's relationship with its neighbors. This \ndeteriorating regional security environment includes Egypt's battle \nagainst Hamas and radicalism in the Sinai, the brutal civil war in \nSyria, the destabilizing role of Iran-backed Hezbollah fighters in \nLebanon and Syria, threats and challenges to our ally Jordan, the \nbrutality of ISIS, and the Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.\n  So I returned from my trip with my concerns reinforced over the \nthreats to the region, but I also returned with hope because whether I \nwas touching the ancient stones of the Western Wall, walking the \nStations of the Cross in the Old City, amidst the Old City Market, \nstanding amidst the worshipers in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, or \nmarveling at the modern hustle and bustle of Tel Aviv, I saw a \nremarkable phenomenon up close.\n  A small but determined country that carries within its narrow borders \nthe ancient wisdom of our great faith, the cutting-edge innovations, \nand the can-do spirit of the modern State of Israel--all of this \ncombines to bring me back to this floor with a greater resolve to meet \nthe challenges we talked about today for our own national security but \nalso for that of our steadfast ally, Israel.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, what is the business pending before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The conference report to accompany S. Con. \nRes. 11, with 10 hours of debate equally divided.\n  Mr. DURBIN. On the budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the budget.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I hope some of the comments I make in \nreference to this product are not taken personally.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for all the work he has put into the \nbudget and for his friendship and cooperation on so many different \nissues.\n  What is this budget all about? A budget is really like a blueprint. \nIt really says what we want to do and spend in the next fiscal year \nthat starts October 1. As a result of passing a budget, we send a \nmessage to the spending committees and tell them how much to spend in \ndifferent areas. The budget tries to spell out not only the amounts but \nalso the policy we are to follow when we pass these spending bills. It \nis really a pretty small document by Federal standards, but it really \npacks a lot of wallop when it comes to what we are going to be doing \nfor the next several months.\n  Budgets make choices, just as our family budgets make a choice. Can \nwe afford a new car? Is it time to move? Can we remodel the kitchen? \nCan we pay for the kids to go to college? These are family budget \ndecisions that are made that really impact the lives of members of the \nfamily. Just as those decisions impact lives, so does this, in a large \nway, for over 300 million Americans.\n  Sadly, from my perspective--and I have great respect for the Senator \nfrom Wyoming, who serves as the Senate Budget Committee chairman--from \nmy perspective, this budget has the wrong priorities. Let me tell you \nwhy.\n  Many times, you are going to hear speeches given on the floor of the \nSenate about how the government should not pick winners and losers. I \nhave heard that so many times. It basically says: Let's leave it to the \nfree market forces and other forces. Government shouldn't pick winners \nand losers.\n  This budget being offered to the Senate picks winners and losers, and \nwe can almost identify those winners by name because what this budget \ndoes is it eliminates the Federal estate tax. The Federal estate tax in \nthis circumstance--changes that are called for, reforms in it, will \nresult in tax breaks for the wealthiest people in America. Roughly \n4,000 people a year will be spared, if their estates are worth more \nthan $10 million, from paying the estate tax. For these individuals who \nare that wealthy, it means a $3 million tax break. When you add it up \nover a 10-year period of time, 4,000 people per year, it comes out to \n$268 billion. So the wealthiest people in America are declared the \nwinners in the Senate Republican budget.\n  Who are the losers? The losers are 16 million Americans who will find \nthat they don't have the benefits of the EITC tax credit, as well as \nthe child tax credit that has been proposed. For 16 million Americans, \nwe cut back tax credits which they can use to build and sustain their \nfamilies in order to give tax breaks to 4,000 people a year who have an \nestate worth more than $10 million.\n  We haven't ignored the estate tax. In fact, we substantially reformed \nit. We indexed it. We made a lot of changes to it. But the Republican \nbudget said we haven't gone far enough. We still have 4,000 people who \nare so rich that they are going to pay the tax, and this budget says it \nis time for that to end. I think they are wrong.\n  In order to deal with reducing the budget deficit, let me tell you \nwhere this Republican budget turns. All of us are aware of the fact \nthat student loan debt now is the largest debt in America other than \nmortgage debt. There is more student loan debt in America than credit \ncard debt. Think about that for a second.\n  Millions of students are deep in debt and carrying that debt for year \nafter year because higher education--colleges and universities--cost so \nmuch. Middle-income families can't afford to pay it. They haven't saved \nenough. So the kids and sometimes the family have to borrow the money \nto get it done.\n  What does this budget do for those student borrowers? First, it \nreduces the amount of money available in Pell grants. Pell grants are \ngrants--not loans--given to low-income students at colleges and \nuniversities. That is money the students don't have to borrow because \nthey come from low-income families. Well, in this bill, we have a 31-\npercent cut in Pell grant funding; it is about $90 billion over 10 \nyears. Eight million Americans are dependent on Pell grant funding in \nthis current school year. They will find that there is less money \navailable in grants--even though they are from low-income families--to \ngo to college. So what is the alternative? Don't go to college or \nborrow more money. So the Republican approach to the student loan debt \ncrisis is to decrease the grants and increase the debt of future \nstudents.\n  That isn't all. There is a provision that says: If you borrow money \nto go to\n\n[[Page S2629]]\n\ncolleges and universities from the Federal Government, then your \nrepayment of those government loans is going to be at least sensitive \nto your situation in life. In other words, you won't have to pay more \nthan 10 percent of your income each year to pay off the student loan.\n  They eliminate it. That basically means these students are going to \nhave to pay higher amounts of their earnings on their student loans. Is \nthat a problem? It is a big problem. It is a problem for those fresh \nout of colleges and universities who want to start their lives. How are \nthey going to start their lives and take the jobs they want and still \npay off the student loans? Students are making decisions now about \nwhere they go to work and what they do with their lives because of the \ndebt they carry with them out of colleges and universities. The \nRepublican budget before us today makes it more difficult for those \nstudents by reducing the Pell grants and increasing the payback cost on \nstudent loans.\n  They do something else for students, too. The Affordable Care Act, \nwhich some call ObamaCare, said: If you graduate from college, you can \nstay on your parents' health insurance plan until age 26. Is that \nimportant? Boy, it was in our family.\n  I can remember when my daughter graduated from college, and I said: \nJennifer, do you have health insurance?\n  She said: Dad, I don't need it. I feel fine.\n  Really?\n  Well, now, under the Affordable Care Act, my daughter and other kids \ncan stay on their parents' health insurance plan. So what does the \nRepublican budget do about that? It abolishes the Affordable Care Act. \nIt abolishes that protection for families to keep their kids on their \nhealth insurance plans. How can that help families and kids fresh out \nof college? A lot of kids out of college are not finding jobs right \naway. They are doing internships. They are working part time. They \ncan't afford health insurance. But they are on the family plan now \nbecause of ObamaCare--not according to the Republican budget; they want \nto get rid of it.\n  That isn't all. When you take a look at eliminating the Affordable \nCare Act--at this point, we have 16 million Americans who have the \nbenefit of health insurance because of ObamaCare, and they eliminate it \nover a period of time. And we believe that number will grow to 27 \nmillion Americans who, because of the Republican budget, will not have \nthe opportunity to get health insurance.\n  They cut back on Medicaid eligibility. Medicaid, of course, is health \ninsurance for those in low-income situations. What will happen to those \npeople? I wonder if the Budget Committee sat down, took a look, and \nsaid: Well, what is going to happen if people lose their health \ninsurance, 27 million Americans? It would be naive to say that they \njust won't get sick. We know they will, and it will go back to the old \ndays. In the old days, sick people who had no health insurance still \nshowed up at the hospital. The hospital took care of them. The doctors \ntook care of them. They were charity patients. Who paid for their care? \nAll of us who have health insurance. I don't want to go back to the old \ndays. I don't think America wants to. But this Republican budget does. \nIt eliminates the Affordable Care Act.\n  I travel around Illinois and Chicago--I am honored to represent it--\nand I go to community health centers. They are popping up all over, in \nrural areas and cities as well, in neighborhoods. I want to say how \nproud I am that the Affordable Care Act created many of these centers. \nI have said, and I stand by it, that if I were sick or a member of my \nfamily were sick, I would be confident that if they walked into that \ncenter, that clinic, they would be treated to professional care. They \nare popping up all over the place. Elderly people now have someplace \nclose to home to go to a clinic. Those who are on Medicaid--the health \ninsurance from the government--can go in and be treated the same as \nanybody else.\n  What do we have in this bill when it comes to these health care \nclinics? This bill not only kicks 11 million people off Medicaid by \ntaking away States' rights to expand health care to lower income \nresidents, it cuts funding for community health centers by 70 percent--\ncommunity health centers that are now serving 23 million Americans, \nwhich includes 7 million children and 250,000 veterans. How can we be \nbetter off by cutting back on the medical care in these health clinics? \nDo we think people won't get sick? Of course they will, and the cost \nwill be shifted to others, just like the bad old days that we remember \nwhen health insurance premiums were going through the roof. But that is \nthe proposal, and I think it is a serious mistake.\n  When I look at this Republican budget, I wonder if the Members who \nvoted for it have really taken these ideas back home; if they have sat \ndown with people and talked about what the impact will be when working \nfamilies lose the tax credit of the ITC and child care. I wonder if \nthey have considered what the impact will be by saying they want to \nperpetuate breaks in the Tax Code which reward companies for taking \njobs overseas.\n  Isn't that the last thing we should be doing? Shouldn't the Tax Code \nbe rewarding American companies that keep quality jobs in the United \nStates, instead of shifting their mailing address to the Cayman Islands \nor someplace in Europe?\n  I think it is pretty clear: If you want to build a strong American \neconomy, you stand by the best, most patriotic American corporations \nthat keep people working in the United States. Yet that is not what \nthis budget proposal does. We can do better.\n  I hope we defeat this budget resolution, and I hope we can then sit \ndown and actually have a bipartisan conversation about the future of \nthis country.\n  I think the future of this country includes a Tax Code that is fair \nto working families. I think it rewards American companies that create \njobs in the United States. I don't think it gives 4,000 people a year, \nwho happen to be the wealthiest people in America, a winning Power Ball \nticket, as this budget proposal we have before us does.\n  I think we ought to expand the reach of health insurance, not reduce \nit. We want to give families a chance to be able to send their kids to \ncollege and kids not be so burdened with debt they can't chart their \nown futures. That is an optimistic, positive view of a growing America. \nThis budget resolution is not.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this budget resolution and say \nto the Committee on the Budget that we can do better. If we are going \nto pick winners and losers, let's pick working families right here in \nAmerica as the winners.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Portman). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise reluctantly against this budget \nresolution. I want to pick up exactly where our colleague from Illinois \nleft off with respect to the values that are really important for this \ndebate. As I look at this budget, I see opportunities missed that would \nbring the Senate together, help us find common ground, and particularly \nhelp the middle class.\n  The reality is there are tens of millions of people in Oregon and \nacross America who day in and day out walk an economic tightrope, \nstretching every paycheck to the last penny. They want to climb the \nladder of opportunity, they want to give their kids a brighter future, \nand the climb is not easy. My view is we ought to be trying to write a \nFederal budget that makes it easier for middle-class people to climb \nthat ladder of opportunity and for those who aren't middle class to \nstart moving up the rungs.\n  This legislation before us misses out on several bipartisan \nopportunities that reluctantly drive me to say the bill is flawed, \nbecause in too many instances, it leaves our working families, our \nmiddle class, behind.\n  Let me be specific. I offered, when the budget came up here, an \namendment which stipulated that tax reform be built around the needs of \nour middle class so employers that would hire workers would have an \nopportunity to hire more, our workers would be able to get child care, \nand our students would be able to get educated. It was pretty \nstraightforward. It said tax relief should be built around our middle \nclass.\n  A number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle asked if \nthis would allow for some approaches that\n\n[[Page S2630]]\n\nthey would be interested in. I said of course.\n  Chairman Enzi and I both have the honor to serve on the Senate \nCommittee on Finance, so I offered an amendment that was built around \nsome core ideas, recognizing my colleagues might have other approaches. \nA number of Republicans voted for that. It got more than 70 votes in \nthe Senate.\n  Today, as we debate this legislation, we don't hear anything about \ntax relief for middle-class families. As I look at the budget, it sure \nlooks to me, given some of the other priorities, as though there is a \nreal prospect that taxes could go up for our middle-class families, as \nif they are not getting hammered hard enough. We could be working on a \nbudget proposal today that creates new opportunity for middle-class \npeople, a proposal that includes something such as what was voted on in \nthe Senate that got more than 70 votes. Yet it is not there.\n  A second example deals with rural America. Again, in a lot of our \nrural communities there is enormous hurt. Many feel the policies of the \nFederal Government would pretty much turn them into some kind of \neconomic sacrifice zone. So in the Committee on the Budget, I said: I \nthink we have an opportunity to bring together programs such as the \nSecure Rural Schools Program, the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program, and \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund, and we could adopt a smarter \napproach to fighting wildfires. The fact is that, too, was bipartisan. \nIn the Committee on the Budget, the vote was 18 to 4--an overwhelming \n18-to-4 bipartisan vote for the kind of approach I offered which would \nbring these programs together and put in the budget secure rural \nschools alongside these other programs that are a rural lifeline.\n\n  Once again, a bipartisan proposal--a bipartisan proposal that got \nresounding support in the Senate Committee on the Budget--somehow \ndidn't make its way into the legislation we are considering today. So \nfor communities in my home State, the message is: We are not really \ngoing to make your communities a priority.\n  I was just in, for example, Roseburg, OR, which is Southern Oregon, \nwhere there are hard-working people who would like to both get the \ntimber harvest up and have the funds for their police and their schools \nand their roads and basic services. But this budget says that even \nthough in the Committee on the Budget we had something bipartisan to \nhelp those communities, gee, we are really not going to follow through. \nWe are just going to have a partisan plan, No. 1; and No. 2, we are \ngoing to basically shuffle to the side these bipartisan proposals with \nrespect to middle-class tax relief and rural communities that, in my \nview, could make a huge difference in the quality of life for millions \nof American families. Of course, these were bipartisan ideas.\n  Now, a third area that has concerned me about this budget is the need \nfor supporting programs such as Medicare and Social Security that keep \nmillions of Americans from falling through the cracks. With this budget \nplan, the Congress ought to be protecting Medicaid so Americans of very \nlimited means can count on having access to health care. Yet the budget \nthat is being considered today would make, in my view, needlessly \npainful, needlessly arbitrary cuts.\n  It just seems as if the budget doesn't recognize that weakening \nMedicaid will hurt the most vulnerable families in Oregon and across \nthe country--those who are struggling so hard to climb that ladder of \nopportunity. Without Medicaid coverage, those who are vulnerable end up \nforgoing checkups. They end up passing on the preventive visits. In my \nview, they will end up with lesser care at a higher overall cost. A \nmassive burden would end up getting shifted to hospitals and doctors \nand many Americans who simply pay insurance premiums through their \nemployer.\n  So if we make those kinds of cuts today--the cuts I have described as \nbeing arbitrary--we are going to have higher costs and more economic \npain down the road.\n  Finally, millions of seniors and those with disabilities rely on \nMedicaid to help cover what otherwise can be crushing costs--crushing \ncosts--in the long-term care area. I was codirector of the Oregon Gray \nPanthers for a number of years before I was elected to Congress, and \nwhat I have seen over the years are nursing home costs going up and up \nand up. Even those families who worked hard and saved and never took \nthat extra vacation, never bought that special car ended up being \nimpoverished, and they and those who are disabled simply would not be \nin a position to get long-term care without Medicaid.\n  Now, we know what used to happen years and years ago. There were poor \nfarms, there were almshouses when savings ran out. It is pretty hard to \ndo that with the demographic revolution of today, with 10,000 people \nturning 65 every day--10,000 people turning 65 every day for years and \nyears to come.\n  So my view is Medicaid, this lifeline for the most vulnerable \npeople--a lifeline that keeps so many individuals, particularly \nseniors, from falling into utter destitution--should be protected \nrather than filleted, as this budget would do, and it is one of the \nmajor reasons I am in opposition.\n  I will close by way of saying that I have gotten, over the years, to \nknow Chairman Enzi very well. He is a compassionate legislator. He is a \ntalented legislator. My hope is, though I oppose this budget today for \nthe reasons I have described--the bipartisan opportunities missed with \nrespect to tax relief for the middle class and the rejection of a \nbipartisan plan to help rural America--that in the days ahead, as we go \nto the Committee on Finance, in particular, and we look at these \nissues, we can return to what has always been the Senate at its best, \nwhich is working in a bipartisan fashion. We can do it on tax relief. \nWe can do it for rural America.\n  By the way, we can do it in terms of Medicare. We can protect the \nMedicare guarantee and hold down costs. Our colleague Senator Isakson \nfrom Georgia has joined me in an important piece of legislation that \nreally starts to transform Medicare into a program that better meets \nthe needs of those who will most need it, which is those with chronic \ndisease--cancer, diabetes, stroke, and heart disease. But we would be \nprotecting the Medicare guarantee, not, in effect, damaging Medicaid \nthe way this budget would do.\n  Mr. President, I am going to yield the floor now and just state, once \nagain, that I hope we can go back to what makes the Senate function at \nits best, bipartisanship. We missed that opportunity thus far, and I \nhope we will return to it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for his kind \ncomments, and I know, as the ranking member of the Committee on \nFinance, he will be doing a lot of things to see that things in this \nbudget happen, and I suspect they will happen a lot the way they are \nhere.\n  I would like to mention just a couple of things, though, for him to \nnote because he mentioned the wildfire suppression. I know how \npassionate he and Senator Crapo have been on wildfire suppression. I \nwant him to note that section 3208 preserves the wildfire suppression \nfunding.\n  One of the things that has always concerned me since I got here was \nthat we have these emergencies for all sorts of things. When I first \ngot here, they were $5 billion a year; now they are up to $7 billion a \nyear. But any time you are budgeting and you know something is going to \nhappen every year, it ought to be in the budget. So I put in $7 billion \nfor emergencies, and that will help to provide some of the funding for \nhis suggestion of the wildfire suppression.\n  A couple of the other paragraphs the Senator from Oregon would be \ninterested in are 4319 and 4320. We did not throw out everything. We \ndid do some combining of ones that were very similar to make sure that \nin the 183 proposals we had for reserve funds, we could come up with a \nfew fewer that would incorporate the ideas of everyone.\n\n  Some of the previous speeches mentioned what we were doing to \nMedicare. There aren't a lot of specifics on Medicare because, again, \nthe Finance Committee--which Senator Hatch chairs and Senator Wyden is \nthe ranking member on--will have to make a lot of those actual \ndecisions. In fact, almost everything that is in the budget requires \nsome additional action, and that\n\n[[Page S2631]]\n\nadditional action even has to be signed by the President. So if we are \nway off, it is not going to happen. But I am thinking there will be a \nlot of bipartisan action on this.\n  On Medicare itself, all we in the Senate did was go with the same \nMedicare cuts that the President suggested in his budget. We made one \nsmall change in that. We said those Medicare cuts, the money that will \nbe saved in Medicare, has to stay with Medicare. That is a difference \nthat we have with the President. When we did ObamaCare, there was $714 \nbillion worth of Medicare that was taken out and spent on other parts \nof the program. We could have done the doc fix back then really easily, \nbut that was spent in other places.\n  One of the promises we made was that if there were some changes in \nMedicare--and there ought to be some changes in Medicare. Actually, the \ngovernment ought to take a look at everything it does on a regular \nbasis and do it better or, if it is not working, do without it. But \nMedicare does serve a need in this country, and the money that comes \nfrom Medicare ought to stay in Medicare but used in better places in \nMedicare, where it is more needed.\n  So I hope people will actually take a look at the document that is \nhere.\n  Incidentally, on the Medicare proposal, the House came to the Senate \nproposal and eliminated a couple of things they had.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, if we look into this Senate's agenda this \nmonth, we will see right away why so many folks are frustrated with \nWashington. We have now been considering an Iran bill for the last 2 \nweeks. It has huge bipartisan support, but it is tied up with \namendments designed to kill the bill.\n  Today, the House and Senate Republicans bring forth a budget which \nreflects some of the worst ideas from each Chamber. Back in March, I \nraised concerns that the Senate budget put the interests of a few ahead \nof the future of this country, and that is still true today. The \nmajority insists on spending billions of dollars overseas, and \ncontinues the fiction that this spending somehow doesn't count towards \nthe deficit.\n  Under this budget, every penny proposed in the overseas contingency \noperations account--that is $187 billion--is going to be borrowed from \nChina, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and others. The majority once again favors \ntax breaks for the wealthiest among us over plans to strengthen the \nmiddle class--a middle class that has been the envy of the world. But \nunder this blueprint, the $2,500 tax credit that helps students with \nthe cost of tuition disappears. The benefit under the child tax credit \ngets smaller, and American middle-class folks get squeezed. The \nmajority continues to reward companies that ship jobs overseas instead \nof creating jobs right here in the United States. This budget \ndrastically cuts and ends Medicare as we know it, and it opens up the \ndoor to the sale of our public lands.\n  Finally, this budget fails to invest in basic infrastructure. In \nfact, it actually calls for a cut of over $200 billion in highway and \ntransit funding over the next decade. The majority is pushing this \nproposal even though the highway bill funding expires on May 31, 2015. \nNow we are nearly out of time. In less than 4 weeks, just as millions \nof Americans will be getting on the road to enjoy summer vacations, \nroad construction projects around this country will come to a \nscreeching halt.\n  In my home State of Montana, the State department of transportation \nwill delay nine projects this month due to Congress's failure to pass a \nlong-term highway bill. Four projects that were scheduled to be awarded \nin April have been postponed to July and may be postponed indefinitely. \nFive more that were scheduled to be awarded next week will also be \ndelayed. If Congress does another short-term extension, that list will \nget even longer. If we delay these projects even by a few weeks, we \ncould miss the entire construction season in Montana, a northern-tier \nState. The snow will start falling, and the potholes will get bigger.\n  We already know that America's transportation infrastructure has been \nignored for far too long. According to the American Association of \nState Highway and Transportation Officials, more than half of America's \nmajor roads and bridges are rated as poor to mediocre. In Montana, 40 \npercent of our roads are in need of repair or will need fixing soon. \nWhen our roads have potholes or can't handle the volume of cars and \ntrucks, safety becomes an issue. Montana routinely leads the Nation in \nhighway fatalities, and thousands of road fatalities each year are the \nresult of bad road conditions.\n  As far as the economic impact, Federal highway dollars directly \nimpact 11,000 jobs in Montana alone, not to mention the thousands of \nothers who rely on roads for their businesses. These are jobs that \ncannot be outsourced. Each year, around $60 billion in goods is shipped \nover Montana's 75,000 miles of roads and highways. That is true \neconomic impact.\n  So instead of a long-term highway bill that allows States to plan and \nto get America moving, the next item the majority leader says he is \ngoing to take up is trade promotion authority. This will open the door \nfor trade deals that the American public hasn't been allowed to see. \nWhile many in Washington see trade promotion as the key to ensuring \nAmerica's long-term economic viability, we need to make sure that the \ninvestments are made right here at home--smart investments.\n  After all, how are farmers in Montana going to get their crops to \nAsia if they cannot even get them down the road to the nearest grain \nelevator?\n  Our transportation infrastructure affects every industry. Take, for \ninstance, Montana's outdoor economy. Millions of people come to Montana \neach year to hunt, fish, hike, and enjoy Montana's great outdoors--from \nGlacier and Yellowstone National Parks to our millions of acres of \nforest and public lands. Montana's outdoors brings in $6 billion each \nyear and supports some 60,000 jobs.\n  Passing a highway bill will increase folks' ability to access these \noutdoor places. But States which oversee these construction projects \ncannot wait until the end of the month to find out if Congress is going \nto do its job. Many of them are already pumping the brakes on projects \nuntil we step up and pass a highway infrastructure bill.\n  In the University District in Missoula, an important resurfacing \nproject was scheduled to start next week after classes get out. But \nthanks to congressional inaction on the highway bill, that project will \nstart no earlier than the third week in July--maybe not at all.\n  What does that mean? That means the project likely will not be done \nbefore students return and traffic in the University District increases \nexponentially. The Montana Department of Transportation has already \nannounced it will push back the start-up date 3 months for a bridge \nreplacement in Sanders County.\n  With one in five bridges being in desperate need of repair, delays on \nprojects such as this are irresponsible and only add to the backlog. \nThe need to act could not be more clear. While everyone knows we need a \nlong-term solution, the American people have come to expect the worst \nfrom Congress--shortsighted, stopgap measures that will not give \nbusinesses or working families the certainty they need and deserve.\n  The House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee \nhave put forth no solutions to this date. They are anxious to move the \ntrade legislation that seems all too reminiscent of past trade deals--\nlong on promises but short on jobs. Yet they will not produce a long-\nterm highway bill that we know creates jobs here in America.\n  We must pass a long-term highway bill, and one that is paid for. But \ninstead of working together on a long-term plan, Congress seems \nresigned to passing another short-term patch. This is shortsighted and \nwe will have negative consequences for folks across this country.\n  The question I have for my colleagues is this. When did passing a \nhighway bill become political? When\n\n[[Page S2632]]\n\ndid basic investments in our Nation's infrastructure become this \ndifficult? This is a no-brainer. Now we have folks in Congress who \nthink roads build themselves. We have folks in Congress who eagerly \nswipe the Nation's credit card when it comes to investments in the \nMiddle East. But these same Members of Congress will not even open up \nthe wallet to fill a pothole next to a school in this country.\n  China will spend more than $400 billion on transportation \ninfrastructure this year. That is eight times more than the United \nStates will spend on the highway trust fund. How do we expect to \ncompete in a global economy if we are not willing to make the \ninvestment?\n  Infrastructure investments are investments in our economy, and they \nare investments in the future. If we can pass a long-term bill, it will \npay for itself by giving businesses the certainty they need to grow, \ncreate jobs, and build the kind of economy that our kids and our \ngrandkids deserve.\n  The clock is ticking, but the Senate is focused on the wrong \npriorities. It is time to refocus on making smart investments in our \neconomy and being honest with the American people in our budgets. Right \nnow we are doing neither.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to voice my \nopposition to this budget. Since being elected to the Senate, I have \nalways stressed the importance of responsibly addressing our country's \nfiscal challenges. We have had bipartisan agreements before when we \nfaced fiscal challenges. At the end of 2013, we passed the bipartisan \nMurray-Ryan budget agreement which then led to the passage of the \nomnibus spending bill. I was part of the group of 14 during the \nshutdown who came together with an idea for a fix that allowed us to \nget to the budget--seven Democrats and seven Republicans. We also saw \nsome major bipartisan work on the farm bill, the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, and we \nreauthorized the Child Care and Development Block Grant Program and, as \nwell as we know, recently, the Medicare sustainable growth rate. But \ntoday that is not what this budget is about. That is one of my major \nfocuses today.\n  I would say, by the way, as a result of some of the bipartisan work \nthat has been done in the past, since 2009 we have seen the deficit as \na percent of GDP drop from nearly 10 percent--9.8 percent, exactly--to \nunder 3 percent.\n  In this economic recovery, we have seen 61 straight months of private \nsector job growth and added over 12 million private sector jobs. \nUnemployment is at 5.5 percent nationally and 3.7 percent in my home \nState of Minnesota. The unemployment rate went down faster in 2014 than \nit has in any year since 1984.\n  With this economy not just stabilized but finally starting to show \nsome signs of improvement--not everything that we need, not with \neveryone sharing in its growth; we know that--we are no longer \ngoverning from crisis. We are finally governing from opportunity--\nopportunity for the people of this country, opportunity to compete in \nthis global economy. My problem with this budget is that it does not \ngive us that opportunity. This budget would make drastic cuts to the \nprograms we need to seize this opportunity in the global economy, \nprograms such as student loans, transportation, and heating assistance, \njust to name a few.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the deficit is \nprojected to drop to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2015, a cut of nearly two-\nthirds. Yet this budget would cut many of the programs that help our \nmiddle-class people, our families, our seniors, and those working hard \nto make ends meet. We have heard about a lot of the cuts in programs, \nbut I want to focus on three key areas that I believe we need to invest \nin today so we can seize this opportunity when we finally have a stable \neconomy and our country can grow and compete. The first is \ninfrastructure, the second is investing in kids, and the third is \nresearch.\n  One of the best ways to boost our economy and create good-paying jobs \nis through investing in infrastructure. For far too long we have \nneglected the roads, the bridges, and the mass transit that millions of \nAmericans rely on every day. According to the Federal Highway \nAdministration, more than 24 percent of the Nation's 600,000 bridges \nare either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. According \nto the American Society of Civil Engineers' 2013 report card, the \nUnited States scores a D-plus on the overall condition of our Nation's \ninfrastructure.\n  Compared with other countries, we are falling behind. China and India \nare spending, respectively, 9 percent and 8 percent of their GDPs on \ninfrastructure. How much are we committing? Just 2 percent. The effects \nof this shortsighted strategy are increasingly clear. No one knows that \nbetter than in my home State of Minnesota, where on August 1, 2007, a \nmajor bridge--an eight-lane highway--went crashing into the Mississippi \nRiver, and 13 people died. Dozens and dozens were injured. Dozens of \ncars were submerged in the water. As I said that day, a bridge should \nnot fall down in the middle of America--especially not an eight-lane \ninterstate highway, especially not a bridge that is one of the most \ntraveled bridges in our State, especially not a bridge that is blocks \nfrom my house, a bridge that my family goes over every day when we want \nto go anywhere in our State--rush hour in the heart of a major \nmetropolitan area.\n  When we have something like that happen in the State, we understand \nthe importance of investing in infrastructure. The last thing we want \nto see is more cuts. Whether it is roads, bridges, rail, airports or \nwaterways, the need to rebuild our infrastructure is critical to \nreclaiming our country's competitive edge. We want to get goods to \nmarket in this export economy. How do we do it? We do it with roads, \nwith bridges, with rail. We do it with locks and dams. We do it with \nairports. Yet this budget would cut transportation and infrastructure \nby more than $200 billion over the next decade--a cut of 40 percent. \nThat is simply unacceptable.\n  Education funding is something that is so important to me in my life. \nMy grandpa worked 1,500 feet underground in the mines and never \ngraduated from high school. He literally spent his life working, \nputting money in a coffee can in the basement to send my dad to \ncommunity college. My dad went to community college and got a 2-year \ndegree and then went on to the University of Minnesota--two public \ninstitutions. That is what education is about. Yet, we see cuts to \neducation, cuts to Pell grants in this bill.\n  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act provides critical \nfunding to help offset education costs for States and local areas that \nare providing services to kids with disabilities. We are talking about \nour most vulnerable kids here. Yet this budget would cut Federal \neducation funding by 2 percent in 2017 and 9 percent in 2025. IDEA \nfunding--that funding so critical for kids with disabilities--would be \ncut by more than $15 million per year on average in Minnesota and more \nthan $950 million nationally. Our kids deserve better than that.\n  Medical research--no one knows that better than Minnesota, home of \nthe Mayo Clinic, home of the University of Minnesota. Yet what do we \nsee with this budget? The cuts would mean a devastating $8 billion \ndecrease at the National Institutes of Health over the next decade. \nThis is simply unacceptable--cutting investment in medical innovation \nfor cures that could cure Alzheimer's, for cures that could cure \nchildhood diabetes, for cures and for research that could help people \nwith autism; cutting investment in medical innovation is not a path \nthat we can afford to take.\n  As Newt Gingrich said in an op-ed this last month, investing in \nhealth research is both a moral and a financial issue. The NIH is a \nbeacon of hope for people across the Nation and in my home State of \nMinnesota. Just look at Alzheimer's. Right now, close to 5.2 million \nAmericans are living with Alzheimer's, including nearly 100,000 \nMinnesotans. These numbers will grow dramatically in the many coming \nyears\n\n[[Page S2633]]\n\nwith the aging of the baby boomer generation. We know there is good \nresearch being done through the Human Genome Project and the work that \nis being done at Mayo, where, if we can catch it earlier, our doctors \nmight be able to figure out exactly what works and does not work. If \nyou do not catch it early, how are they ever going to do the research \nwe need to do to figure out what works and what does not work if you \nwait too long?\n  That is some of the groundbreaking work that is being done right now. \nThat is why I have worked with Senator Durbin on legislation to boost \nNIH funding. In contrast to this budget, the American Cures Act, of \nwhich I am a cosponsor, would reverse the trend of declining Federal \ninvestment in medical research and fuel the next generation of \nbiomedical discoveries by providing a 5-percent annual increase at NIH \nand at other key Federal research agencies.\n  We need to see this as an investment. We know how expensive \nAlzheimer's is--and we know the heartbreaking stories of families where \na family member gets Alzheimer's. Yet we cannot back away from the \nresearch that is going on right now--the research for things such as \nprecision medicine. We are going to have targeted treatments helping \npatients to live healthier lives.\n  In conclusion, this budget would make cuts to infrastructure at a \ntime when we need to invest and rebuild. This budget would make cuts to \nprograms that serve kids with disabilities and slow the process of \nbiomedical research and innovation. We have an opportunity now in this \ncountry. Through the work of so many businesses and workers across the \ncountry, we have been able to stabilize this economy. People in our \ncountry did not give up. But now is the moment to seize opportunities, \nand seizing opportunities means really taking back our place in America \nas a preeminent researcher, as the country that people go to when they \nwant to cure diseases. We cannot do that by moving backwards. We cannot \ndo that if we are going to cut the funding for our roads and bridges. \nWe cannot afford to have another I-35W bridge collapse.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this budget and work together on a \nsmarter budget, one that actually allows this country--America--to \nseize the opportunity before us so we can compete in this global \neconomy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the budget that \nis before the Senate, this combined House-Senate Republican budget. In \nevaluating this budget proposal, my core question has been this: Is \nthis a budget that works for working America? Or is this a budget \ndesigned for powerful special interests and for those best off in our \nsociety? A budget is not just about the numbers; it is about the vision \nthat it has for America.\n  Over 70 years ago, President Franklin Roosevelt issued an economic \nbill of rights, proclaiming: In our day these economic truths have \nbecome accepted as self-evident: the right to a useful and remunerative \njob; the right to earn enough to provide adequate food; the right of \nevery family to a decent home; the right to adequate medical care; the \nright to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, \nsickness, accident, and unemployment; and the right to a good \neducation. He closed with these words: ``All of these rights spell \nsecurity.''\n  Enacting a budget that advances these economic rights for all \nAmericans is my top priority. That means the budget must create good-\npaying jobs, improve access to quality, affordable education, ensure \nretirement security for our seniors, and lower the tax burden on \nworking families. The American people share these priorities. They want \na plan, a budget, a vision for our Nation that builds a foundation for \nmiddle-class families to thrive.\n  Two months ago, I stood on the Senate floor to review the budget \nproposed as the Senate Republican budget. In category after category, \nthat budget earned a failing grade. Unfortunately, I am here today to \nsay that the plan that has come out of the conference committee from \nthe House and Senate Republicans is even worse. It constitutes an \negregious assault on working Americans. It slashes investments in \ninfrastructure and education, failing to close tax loopholes and \nattacking financial reform. It is fundamentally misaligned with the \nvalues of working Americans. It is poised to move our Nation in exactly \nthe wrong direction--more tax breaks and corporate welfare for \nmillionaires, billionaires, and large corporations that are already \ndoing phenomenally well and more pain and suffering for the middle \nclass, working families, and the most vulnerable.\n  With this budget, the GOP is continuing to play games with Americans' \nhealth care coverage, claiming we can grow our economy by cutting \nhealth care for seniors and children and the poorest in our society. \nThe Senate GOP budget wiped out coverage under the Affordable Care Act, \nand this budget continues to wreak havoc. It will immediately eliminate \nhealth insurance coverage for 16.4 million Americans and swell the \nranks of the uninsured by 23 million individuals within a single year. \nIt will deny millions of young adults the right to stay on their \nparents' health insurance plan until the age of 26. It will deprive 130 \nmillion Americans with preexisting conditions the right to purchase \naffordable health insurance if they lose their jobs or otherwise lose \ntheir health insurance. These numbers are appalling.\n  It puts our seniors back at risk of bankruptcy from unaffordable \nprescriptions because it wipes out the ACA's effort to fill in the \nMedicare Part D doughnut hole. In 2014 alone, seniors saved $4.8 \nbillion on prescription drugs, and 39 million seniors will be forced to \npay more for preventative services under this budget. The GOP budget \ntakes seniors back to the bad old days where the doughnut hole would \nforce more than 9.4 million seniors and persons with disabilities to \npay billions more out of pocket for prescription drugs.\n  At a time when senior poverty is on the rise, shouldn't we be focused \non helping our seniors retire with security and dignity? Instead, the \nnew plan cuts Medicare deeply--$430 billion over 10 years. It cuts \nMedicaid by at least $400 billion, jeopardizing nursing home care for \nthe most vulnerable senior Americans. It calls for ending Medicare as \nwe know it by turning it into a voucher plan. Finally, it paves the way \nfor a fast-track consideration of a way to repeal the Affordable Care \nAct through reconciliation.\n  When you total up these factors, look at the assault on seniors. \nThere is more for prescription drugs and less for nursing home care and \nMedicaid. Medicare will be cut by $430 billion, and it will be \nvoucherized. Annual wellness checks and preventive services, such as \nmammograms and prostate cancer screening, will be wiped out. What this \nbudget does is turn security into insecurity. What this budget does is \nturn dignity into indignity. This is an unacceptable assault on our \nseniors.\n  It is also an assault on our children and on education. Both \nDemocrats and Republicans agree that we want a chance for our children \nto get ahead and to pursue their dreams. Shouldn't the budget tell our \nchildren that education is a priority? The Republican plan makes new \ncuts to Head Start that would kick 400,000 children off the program \nover a 10-year period--400,000 empty Head Start chairs across America.\n  This picture is from an event that I held at Oregon's Whitaker \nSchool. The cuts in the Senate Republican plan to Head Start would mean \n15 empty chairs just at this one location. But now we are talking about \na budget that wipes out an opportunity for 400,000 children from \nstruggling families to get a head start through Head Start.\n  The conference report doesn't just hit early childhood education; it \nalso fails our children with regard to opening the doors of opportunity \nfor higher education. College costs are soaring, so it makes sense to \nstrengthen Pell grant funding. But this Republican budget slashes Pell \ngrant funding by about one-third. Picture one out of every three of our \nchildren who use a Pell grant to get through the doors of college, the \ndoors of opportunity, unfortunately having that opportunity taken away. \nThis budget cuts the program by $90 billion over 10 years and will make \ncollege out of reach for so many when we should be going in the other \ndirection.\n  That is not all. It also increases student loan debt by an average of \n$4,000 for an estimated 30 million students,\n\n[[Page S2634]]\n\nmaking the children from struggling families pay more for basic need-\nbased student loans.\n  I believe in opportunity. I believe in the American dream. I believe \nthat higher education is one of the best pathways to the middle class. \nWe cannot and must not adopt a budget designed to slam the doors of \nopportunity shut on millions of our children.\n  There is more to be concerned about. One of the keys to prosperity is \ninfrastructure. My colleague from Minnesota was just illuminating many \nof the problems in that area. Why shouldn't a budget prioritize \nimproving our Nation's crumbling roads, bridges, dams, water systems, \nairports, and rail systems?\n  We have a huge infrastructure deficit. Our highway trust fund is \nrunning out of money. Right now Europe is investing 5 percent of its \nGDP in infrastructure and the United States is investing less than 2 \npercent. We are vastly underinvesting, and this budget continues and \naggravates that underinvestment, hurting the creation of good-paying \njobs now and doing enormous damage to the economy of the future.\n  Our parents did far better for us by putting a massive infusion of \nfunds for infrastructure that strengthened the system and strengthened \nour economy today. Shouldn't we do the same for the next generation? \nAnd then we can turn to food security.\n  Our country has 40 million hungry Americans. In the wealthiest Nation \non Earth, shouldn't our budget make sure families can put food on the \ntable? This Republican budget says no. It supports making massive cuts \nto programs that provide critical assistance to low-income families. \nThis plan eliminates nutrition assistance for 1.2 million women, \ninfants, and children who rely on the WIC Program through $10 billion \nin cuts to programs over the next decade. This budget would cut $660 \nbillion over 10 years for programs that support low-income individuals \nand families, including massive unspecified cuts to food stamps. With \nthis budget, my Republican colleagues are telling the parents of \nchildren and financially challenged families: Let them go hungry. And \nthat is just wrong.\n  Since this budget cuts food, Pell grants, infrastructure, and health \ncare, and since it does so much damage to working families, shouldn't \nit ask for some small sacrifice from those who are best off? Apparently \nnot. This Republican budget takes from the most vulnerable and gives it \nto the wealthiest families in America. This Republican budget provides \na quarter of a trillion--and, yes, that is trillion with a T--dollar \ntax break for the wealthiest 0.2 percent of Americans while increasing \ntaxes on 13 million working families with 25 million children by \ndiminishing the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, \naffecting families who earn just a modest amount with an average \nhousehold income of just $22,000.\n  I cannot conceive of any economic or moral argument that justifies \ntaking money out of the pockets of struggling families--from Pell \ngrants to Head Start to food on the table--and giving it away to the \nalready wealthiest Americans. Perhaps one of my colleagues who is \nvoting for this budget would like to explain why taking from the poor \nto give more to the wealthiest families in America is justified, \nbecause it is not justified.\n  Despite the fact that our richest families already pay less in their \nmarginal tax than working families pay, this Republican budget wants to \ngive more away to them from the American Treasury and do it by taking \nfood and education opportunities out of the reach of our struggling \nfamilies.\n  This budget removes two amendments that were originally adopted in \nthe Senate budget. Senator Murray's amendment would have allowed \nAmericans to earn paid sick leave. It was supported by 61 Senators, \nincluding 15 Republicans, but it was eviscerated in this budget. The \nsecond amendment was introduced by Senator Schatz. It would have \nensured that all legally married same-sex spouses have equal access to \nSocial Security and veterans' benefits they have earned. It was broadly \nsupported but wiped out in this joint House-Senate Republican budget.\n  This budget takes away from hard-working, middle-class Americans, \nfrom struggling Americans who are often working two to three minimum-\nwage jobs, and it gives away to the wealthy and well-connected, not \nasking them for one slim dime--not one egregious tax loophole closed--\nand gives them preferred tax cuts, returning millions of dollars to the \nwealthiest families.\n  Is this a budget that works for working Americans or is it a budget \nfor the best off? I think it is clear from the topics I have covered \nthat this is a budget for the best off at the expense of everyone else \nin America in every possible way that provides a foundation.\n  If we return to the vision laid out by Franklin Roosevelt in 1944 of \nthe self-evident economic truths, of a right to a good job, to earn \nenough for adequate food, to a decent home, to adequate medical care, \nand to protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, \naccident, and unemployment, this budget fails every test and should be \ndefeated.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the budget \nresolution conference report that we are considering today.\n  In my view, this is the worst budget resolution that I have seen in \nmy 22 years in the Senate. It represents a major step backwards for the \ncountry, and I believe we need to go back to the drawing board.\n  Budget resolutions are as much about priorities as they are about \nnumbers, and I believe this budget resolution sets all the wrong \npriorities.\n  At a time when millions of families are still struggling to recover \nfrom the recession, this budget would raise their taxes while cutting \ntaxes for the wealthiest Americans, who have only gotten wealthier in \nrecent years.\n  The budget calls for the elimination of the child tax credit and the \nearned income tax credit, which would raise taxes by an average of $900 \non 13 million working families. Yet, at the same time, the budget would \neliminate the estate tax, which is only paid by 5,400 families each \nyear who inherit estates worth more than $10 million.\n  Let me repeat that: this budget calls for raising taxes on 13 million \nlow-income families in order to pay for tax cuts for the 5,400 \nwealthiest families, representing the richest 0.2 percent of our \ncountry.\n  Prioritizing the rich over struggling families is at the heart of \nwhat is wrong with this budget.\n  In addition, this budget calls for dramatic funding cuts for the very \nFederal programs that these working families rely on most. Nationwide, \nthe cuts required by this budget would: prevent 35,000 low-income \nchildren from enrolling in Head Start, an early childhood education \nprogram; cut Federal funding for public schools that serve more than \n1.9 million low-income students; increase the cost of college for more \nthan 8 million low-income students through cuts to Pell grants; prevent \n2.2 million Americans from accessing job training services; and \neliminate health coverage through Medicaid for 14 million low-income \nAmericans.\n  In my view, these cuts are draconian and wholly unnecessary. I also \nbelieve that these cuts would only further exacerbate income inequality \nand economic hopelessness, the very forces that have been fueling \nunrest throughout the country.\n  The events in Baltimore that have been broadcast across the Nation in \nrecent weeks are not only a response to years of police brutality, but \nalso the result of whole neighborhoods being left behind economically.\n  As a former big-city mayor, I remember a time when there was robust \nFederal and State support for cities to redevelop depressed \nneighborhoods and provide educational and employment opportunities for \ntheir citizens.\n  That priority no longer exists, certainly not in the austere funding \nlevels of this budget. Instead, we have seen a total abandonment of our \ncities over the past three decades.\n  When I was mayor of San Francisco, the Community Development Block \nGrant program, CDBG, was the primary source of Federal funding to help \nState and local governments undertake housing, economic development, \nand neighborhood revitalization projects. During my time at city hall, \nCDBG funds peaked at $3.7 billion, which would be the equivalent of \n$10.6 billion in inflation-adjusted 2014 dollars. In 2014, Congress \nprovided only $3.023 billion for CDBG, just 28 percent of that peak \ninflation-adjusted amount.\n\n[[Page S2635]]\n\n  For my city, when CDBG was at its prime, it meant we had around $28 \nmillion per year to use for police, fire departments, and economic \ndevelopment projects. Under the funding levels in this GOP budget, San \nFrancisco would be slated to receive only around $16 million a year, \njust 20 percent of what I had when adjusting for inflation.\n  If you care about our cities and the problems facing them, these are \nthe dollars that can really make a difference. They work; I have seen \nit. Yet, they would simply not be there under this budget.\n  At the same time, many States, including California, have cut funding \nfor local redevelopment projects, further straining local government \nfunding for economic development and neighborhood revitalization.\n  Now, I recognize Congress can't solve all of the country's problems, \nand pouring money into cities will not cure all of their ills.\n  But I believe the central role of the Federal Government should be to \nexpand opportunities for the people who need it most, not those who \nhave already succeeded in life.\n  This budget doesn't do that. Not only does this budget not help \nworking families, it would actually make their situation even worse.\n  This budget would take away the healthcare of the most vulnerable, \nmake it even harder for Americans to find a job, deny our Nation's \nyouth the opportunity to learn, and raise taxes on those who can least \nafford it.\n  The Republican priorities reflected in this budget are morally wrong \nand terrible for our country's future. It is time to develop a budget \nthat helps all Americans, not just the wealthy few.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the budget conference report before us today \ncharts the wrong course for our country and threatens our economic and \nnational security.\n  During the consideration of the Republican Senate budget a few weeks \nago, I laid out concerns about its most alarming aspects and my reasons \nfor opposing it. My concerns and opposition have not changed because \nthis Republican budget conference report doesn't deviate from the \nSenate budget's construct.\n  Indeed, the Republican budget stacks the deck in favor of special \ninterests and makes it harder for middle-class families to get ahead. \nFor example, their budget would eliminate the estate tax, giving the \nwealthiest 0.2 percent of Americans a $269 billion tax cut over 10 \nyears. It would pave the way to cut millionaire's top marginal tax rate \nfrom 39.6 percent to 25 percent. At the same time, it would raise taxes \non 16 million middle-class families by ending the expansion of the \nearned income tax credit and child tax credit. These choices by my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle are clear and stand in stark \ncontrast to policies my Democratic colleagues and I fight for that help \nmiddle-class families and grow the economy from the middle out.\n  The Republican budget would also keep the sequester in place, which \nputs unworkable caps on nondefense and defense spending. Both sides of \nthe ledger need relief from the sequester for our Nation's economic and \nnational security. But it seems that my colleagues on the other side \nare only willing to use the overseas contingency operations, OCO, \naccount to provide relief to defense spending despite what we have \nheard from our military leaders on the need to address both sides of \nthe ledger and that using OCO in this manner has its own serious \nshortcomings.\n  The Pentagon simply cannot meet the complex set of national security \nchallenges without the help of other government departments and \nagencies--including State, Justice, Homeland Security, and the \nintelligence community. In the Armed Services Committee, we have heard \ncompelling testimony on the essential role of other government agencies \nin ensuring our Nation remains safe and strong. The Department of \nDefense's share of the burden would surely grow if these agencies were \nnot adequately funded as well.\n  Adding funds to OCO does not solve the Defense Department's problems. \nAs Army Chief of Staff General Odierno said, ``OCO has limits and it \nhas restrictions and it has very strict rules that have to be followed. \nAnd so if we're inhibited by that, it might not help us. What might \nhappen at the end of the year, we have a bunch of money we hand back \nbecause we are not able to spend it.''\n  Making a 1-year plus up to OCO also does not help the Defense \nDepartment with the certainty and stability it needs when building its \n5-year budget. As General Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, \ntestified, ``we need to fix the base budget . . . we won't have the \ncertainty we need'' if there is a year by year OCO fix. Defense \nSecretary Carter added that raising OCO does not allow the Defense \nDepartment to plan ``efficiently or strategically.''\n  While adding funds to OCO would provide some relief to the Defense \nDepartment, it is to defense alone, leaving domestic agencies at \nsequestration levels. And the truth is that the Defense Department \ncannot do its job without other departments. As General Mattis said, \n``If you don't fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more \nammunition.'' And in recent testimony, the commanders of Northern \nCommand and Southern Command stated they could not accomplish their \nmission of protecting this country without the Coast Guard, the Border \nPatrol, DEA, and the intelligence community.\n  Moving beyond the needs we have to keep the Nation safe, there is a \nwhole list of needs that ensure Americans and our economy stays healthy \nand thrives. I would like to bring attention to one such need--\naddressing lead poisoning, a preventable tragedy that dramatically \nimpacts a child's health and ability to learn. This budget would mean \ncuts to programs that help keep kids healthy like the lead poisoning \nprevention program. The kinds of physical health issues and \ndevelopmental delays that stem from lead poisoning have long term \neffects on our children, our communities, and our economy. Indeed, \neducational system costs are estimated at $38,000 over 3 years per \nchild with special education needs due to lead poisoning.\n  The impact is especially pronounced in low-income and minority \nneighborhoods and populations in cities like Providence or as the \nNation has recently seen in the dramatic events unfolding in Baltimore. \nThese lead poisoning prevention programs are the kinds of initiatives \nthat help put disadvantaged communities on an even playing field and, \nultimately, work to ensure that our children can grow up to contribute \nto their families and their communities.\n  I have mentioned several shortsighed provisions, but this budget is \nreplete with them. We cannot short-change our Nation's investments in \nthe middle class, in our children, and our national security and expect \nlong-term prosperity. That is why I will vote no and urge my colleagues \nto do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                 Recognizing Montana's Small businesses\n\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Montana's thousands \nof small businesses and for their contributions to our State's economy.\n  During National Small Business Week, we recognize all of the hard-\nworking Montana men and women who took the risk to start a small \nbusiness. These men and women have spent countless, sleepless nights \nworking to create jobs and grow their business in a State they love and \ncall home.\n  Before being elected to Congress, I spent nearly 3 decades in the \nprivate sector, and I know firsthand there is no better place to live \nand work than in Montana. I also know that our small businesses are \ncritical to Montana's economy and our State's future.\n  According to the Small Business Administration, small businesses \nrepresent more than 97 percent of all Montana employers, in turn \nemploying more than 68 percent of Montana's private sector labor force.\n  I am excited to say there are a lot of small business success stories \nin Montana. We have countless business leaders and entrepreneurs \nworking to drive our State's economic growth and helping us lead the \nway in a variety of industries, from tourism and agriculture to \ntechnology and resource development.\n  Look no further than Bozeman, my hometown, where Advanced Electronic \nDesigns is doing incredible things in innovations, helping to build up \nthe Montana high-tech sector. Their team is comprised of 15 Montana \nState University engineers, and together they have designed more than \n70 percent of the\n\n[[Page S2636]]\n\nLED signs in Times Square--from the NBC ``Today'' show to the Disney \nstore.\n  I have also had the opportunity to tour ALCOM in Bonner, MT, to see \ntheir trailer manufacturing facility. They just won the Small Business \nAdministration's 2015 Small Business Award for Montana Exporter of the \nYear. This award recognizes ALCOM's achievement in significantly \nincreasing their export sales, profits, and jobs, while encouraging \nother Montana businesses to find new markets for their goods.\n  This is an exciting time to do business back home in Montana. From \nour growing technology sector to our State's diverse natural resources, \nthere is a lot of opportunity to create jobs and grow businesses in \nMontana. Unfortunately, the Federal Government's out-of-touch policies \nand bureaucratic overreach continue to prevent Montana's small \nbusinesses from reaching their full potential. Too many Montana \nbusinesses face regulatory burdens that hinder innovation and block \nopportunities for growth.\n  Our Tax Code is too complex and serves as yet another barrier to \nprosperity. And ObamaCare's burdensome and costly mandates are forcing \nmillions of dollars in new fees and compliance costs upon Montana's \nsmall businesses, in turn forcing our job creators to downsize, reduce \nemployee hours, or close their doors altogether.\n  When I drive around in Montana, I have yet to hear a small business \nowner ask for more regulations and higher taxes. We need commonsense \npolicies that encourage Montana's job creators to innovate and to grow. \nWe need solutions to lift these regulatory barriers, reduce tax \nburdens, and create long-term certainty for hard-working Montanans.\n  I have long said that the best solutions don't come from bureaucrats \nin Washington, DC; they come from Main Street Montana and our State's \nhard-working businesses and community leaders because in Montana, we \nunderstand that jobs come from small business, not big government. That \nis why we need to reduce the redtape that is holding our small \nbusinesses back and work toward commonsense regulations that don't \nplace unnecessary burdens on Montana families and Montana small \nbusinesses.\n  We do need comprehensive tax reform that is fair, that is simpler, \nthat promotes economic opportunity, and that works for all Montanans. \nAnd we need to repeal and replace ObamaCare with Montana-driven \nsolutions that put patients and their doctors at the center of a health \ncare equation and don't place these job-killing burdens on our small \nbusinesses.\n  Instead of hindering our small businesses, we should reward them with \nflexibility and with the freedom they need to thrive and empower them \nwith the tools they need to create jobs. That starts with educating \nMontana's future leaders and ensuring that students have the tools they \nneed to succeed in their future careers.\n  It is no secret that for many recent college graduates, finding a job \nin today's economy is harder than ever. This is especially true in \nMontana, where students are often forced to leave our State to find \ngood-paying and long-lasting careers. It has been said that our top \nthree exports are our grain, our cattle, and our children.\n  As we work to grow Montana's technology and resources, we need to \nensure that our students have the skills they need to get ahead and \nfind jobs at home. From Montana's tribal colleges and vocational \nschools to the new Jake Jabs College of Business and Entrepreneurship \nBuilding at Montana State University, Montana's educational \ninstitutions are leading the way in giving our students the head start \nthey need to succeed outside of classrooms and help grow our State's \neconomy because when small businesses succeed, our economy thrives.\n  We need to continue to find ways to encourage investment, \nentrepreneurship, and innovation in our State and all across our \nNation. Our country was founded on the principles of hard work and \nentrepreneurialism. I am proud that Montana's small businesses continue \nto exemplify these pillars of our Nation's heritage and are leading the \nway in economic innovation.\n  During this National Small Business Week, I encourage all of my \nfellow Montanans to shop small and join me in supporting Montana's \nsmall businesses and thanking them for the important role they hold in \nour State--not just this week but every week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today, for the first time in 6 years, \nCongress will pass a budget, and we are passing a budget that actually \nbalances. This fulfills another basic responsibility of governing and \nan important promise Republicans made to the American people.\n  In advance of this vote, I wish to take a moment to applaud Chairman \nMike Enzi for his leadership on this issue. Because of his strong work, \nour balanced budget will help grow our economy, reduce the debt, repeal \nObamaCare, and rein in Washington overreach. Our balanced budget proves \nthat the Senate is fully working again on behalf of the American \npeople.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak about another issue that is also \nimportant to Americans across the country, an issue which I hear about \nas I travel the State of Wyoming and which I heard about this weekend.\n  Last week, the Democratic leader came to the floor of the Senate and \nhe made some very interesting statements about the President's health \ncare law. He said ObamaCare is a smashing success. That was last week.\n  On Monday, we had this headline in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       U.S. Emergency Room Visits Keep Climbing: People on \n     Medicaid turn to hospital care when doctor access is limited, \n     new survey suggests.\n\n  It is interesting to take a look at this large story and learn about \nhow the number of visits to emergency rooms keeps climbing in spite of \nwhat the President promised during the debate of the President's health \ncare law.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Emergency room visits continue to climb in the second year \n     of the Affordable Care Act, contradicting the law's \n     supporters who had predicted a decline in traffic as more \n     people gained access to doctors and other health care \n     providers.\n\n  This is according to a survey by the American College of Emergency \nPhysicians. They should know; they are the ones in the emergency room \ntreating patients. The group says that people whom the health care law \npushed on to Medicaid--pushed on to Medicaid--are having trouble \ngetting appointments or even finding a doctor to take care of them \nbecause it is someone who doesn't take their new coverage. Does the \nDemocratic minority leader think that is a smashing success? This is a \nsurvey of over 2,000 emergency room doctors. Seventy-five percent of \nthem said they have seen increases in emergency room care since 2014. \nOnly one out of 20 ER doctors said they have seen a decrease.\n  The article quotes one doctor, Dr. Howard Mell, as saying: ``There \nwas a grand theory the law would reduce ER visits.''\n  A grand theory? Yes, it was.\n  He said: ``Well, guess what, it hasn't happened. Visits are going up \ndespite the [law], and in a lot of cases because of it.''\n  That is according to one emergency room doctor who sees the results \nof the Obama health care law every day in the emergency room where he \ntakes care of patients.\n  This really shouldn't surprise anyone. We have seen the warning signs \ncoming now for a while. Back in December, the Department of Health and \nHuman Services found that more than half of the health care providers \nlisted for Medicaid plans--half listed as taking Medicaid patients--\ncouldn't schedule appointments for patients, and they are even listed \nwith Health and Human Services as taking care of Medicaid patients. \nThis is only of the doctors who actually care for Medicaid patients in \nthe first place. We know that about half of doctors won't see Medicaid \npatients at all because the reimbursement is so low for taking care of \nthem.\n  For more than one-quarter of the doctors, the wait time for a patient \nto actually get an appointment is more than a month. Does the \nDemocratic leader think that is a smashing success, waiting more than a \nmonth to see a doctor?\n  Last year, almost half of doctors said they had seen an increase in \nemergency\n\n[[Page S2637]]\n\nroom visits, and now we see it is much higher. Some supporters of the \nlaw last year said that wasn't important. They said: Don't worry, the \nnumbers will drop off after the first year as more people get primary \ncare physicians. Well, it hasn't happened, and it has actually gotten \nworse. About half of the ER doctors saw an increase in the first year \nof ObamaCare coverage and 75 percent saw an increase this year, the \nsecond year.\n  It is not getting better. It continues to get worse, to the point \nthat USA TODAY had an article dated May 4, yesterday, page 1: ``ER \nVisits Surge Despite ObamaCare.''\n  It says:\n\n       Three-quarters of emergency room doctors say they are \n     seeing ER patient visits surge since ObamaCare took effect--\n     just the opposite of what many Americans expected would \n     happen.\n\n  It is not what many Americans expected would happen.\n  Look at what the President said would happen. Back in 2009, the \nPresident was trying to pass the law, and President Obama said this: \n``If everybody's got coverage, then they're not going to go to the \nemergency room for treatment.''\n  That was one of the biggest reasons the law required everyone in \nAmerica to have insurance coverage. Remember, that is the mandate. It \nis called the individual mandate, and it remains extremely unpopular \ntoday. The President kept saying it over the years. He said it early \non, he said it during the debate, and he said it after the law passed. \nHe continues to hold this position in spite of the fact that 75 percent \nof emergency room doctors--2,000 doctors who actually work in emergency \nrooms--are saying: It is not true, Mr. President. The ERs are getting \nmore and more crowded.\n  We see what happens when an ER gets more crowded: The wait time goes \nup, the mortality rates for patients trying to get treatment there goes \nup--because of the health care law.\n  In 2013, the President told one group of people: ``It means that all \nthe providers around here, instead of having to take in folks in the \nemergency room, they suddenly have customers who have insurance.''\n  The President's statements continue to fly in the face of reality. \nAccording to the people who really know what is going on, the medical \ncoverage is not keeping people out of emergency rooms. It has become \ncrystal clear that coverage does not equal care. Not only is ObamaCare \ncoverage not delivering care, in many cases the system to provide the \ncoverage isn't even working.\n  There was an article last Friday in the Washington Post. The headline \nwas ``Nearly half of ObamaCare exchanges are struggling over their \nfuture.''\n  It says: ``Nearly half of the 17 insurance marketplaces set up by the \nstates and the District [of Columbia] under President Obama's health \nlaws are struggling financially.''\n  Does the minority leader think that is a smashing success?\n  According to this article, ``many of the online exchanges are \nwrestling with surging costs, especially for balky technology and \nexpensive consumer call centers--and tepid enrollment numbers.''\n  It talks about problems in Minnesota, Vermont, Rhode Island, and \nColorado. In Oregon, the exchange has failed so spectacularly that the \nState had to shut it down entirely.\n  The Washington Post says: ``States have already received nearly $5 \nbillion in Federal grants to establish the online marketplaces.''\n  That is $5 billion that hard-working American taxpayers had to pay to \nset up these exchanges, and half of these exchanges, in spite of all of \nthat taxpayer money, are now struggling financially.\n  This article quotes one expert, Sabrina Corlette, who is a project \ndirector at Georgetown University's Center for Health Insurance \nReforms. She said: ``A lot of people are going to want to know: What \nhappened to all those taxpayer dollars?''\n  Well, that is what a lot of Senators want to know. That is exactly \nwhat Senators on this side of the aisle have been asking for quite a \nwhile now. What happened to all of that hard-earned taxpayer money? How \nmuch of that $5 billion was wasted?\n  The States with these failing exchanges are now looking at raising \ntaxes and raising fees on everybody else's insurance claims. So in half \nof the States, the exchanges where people are supposed to sign up for \ncoverage are failing. Billions of taxpayer dollars wasted, and States \nare looking at charging people even more. That is the President's \nsolution for health care in America.\n  People who do get coverage and want to see a doctor may have to wait \nfor more than a month. They may end up going to the emergency room \nalong with millions of other eople since ObamaCare's mandates began.\n\n  Does the minority leader, who came to the floor last week calling \nthis health care law a smashing success, really think that is so? This \nis not what the American people wanted from health care reform. People \nknew what they wanted, and they wanted something very simple: They \nwanted the care they need from a doctor they choose at a lower cost. \nObamaCare has failed on every one of those things. It is not a smashing \nsuccess.\n  It is time for us to finally give Americans the health care they were \nasking for all along.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, a budget is about building for the future. \nA budget is about what it takes for our families, our businesses, and \nour economy to grow and prosper.\n  The basics are pretty simple: Our kids need access to a good, \naffordable education. Our workers need good wages and good benefits. \nOur businesses and our workers need transit--roads and bridges that are \nsafe enough, strong enough, and fast enough to get us to work and keep \ngoods and services moving. Our workers need good jobs here in America, \njobs built on 21st-century innovation and technology. And everyone \nneeds to know that we are in this together, that we won't kick people \nto the ground, that we will help those who need it most, including \nseniors, children, and families struggling to make ends meet. That is \nhow we build a strong future.\n  The Republicans have a different vision of how to build a future. The \nRepublican budget plan will make the rich richer and the powerful more \npowerful while leaving our kids, our college students, our seniors, our \nworkers, and our families to fall further and further behind.\n  The people of Massachusetts didn't send me here to do what I can to \nhelp the richest of the rich; they sent me here to work for them. So I \nwant to talk about what this Republican budget will mean to the people \nof our State.\n  Assuming it is applied proportionately, the Republican budget can cut \nmandatory transportation funding by 40 percent over the next decade. \nThat will be significantly fewer dollars to repair and improve our \nhighways and to help keep our buses and trains moving in Massachusetts. \nSo if you already think we have a crumbling infrastructure, if you are \nalready worried about old buses and whether the T can struggle through \nanother winter, remember that the Republicans want to slash the support \nfor transportation by 40 percent. With these cuts, our crumbling \ninfrastructure will crumble even faster.\n  These cuts will also cost jobs. Economists estimate that this \nRepublican budget could mean 56,000 fewer jobs in Massachusetts alone.\n  This budget also takes aim at our kids. Over the next decade, it \ncould eliminate Head Start services for 400,000 children across this \ncountry, cutting the program by more than $4 billion. Little kids are \nunder attack, and so are big kids. The Republican budget could also \nmake college more expensive for the 131,000 Massachusetts students who \nreceive Pell grants. And cutting the student loan interest rate? Forget \nit. The Republican budget keeps sucking billions of dollars in profits \noff student loans.\n  The Republican budget puts Massachusetts residents' health at risk, \nespecially the health of our seniors. Today, the Affordable Care Act \nsaves seniors billions of dollars in prescription drugs. The days when \nseniors had to choose between filling a prescription and paying the \nrent were over, but under the Republican budget, almost 80,000 seniors \nin Massachusetts could each pay an average of $920 more per year for \nprescription drugs.\n  It gets worse. About 900,000 seniors in Massachusetts could lose free \npreventive Medicare health services and\n\n[[Page S2638]]\n\nabout 26,000 Massachusetts nursing home residents who rely on Medicaid \ncould face cuts to their care and an uncertain future.\n  What about medical research and the technologies of the future, the \nkind of work we are proud to do in Massachusetts? For over 10 years, \nCongress has decimated medical research funding, reducing the buying \npower of the National Institutes of Health by nearly 25 percent and \nchoking off support for projects that could lead to the next major \nbreakthrough against cancer, heart disease, ALS, diabetes, or autism.\n  With people living longer and longer and more and more families \ndesperate for a breakthrough on Alzheimer's, what is the Republican \nbudget solution? Cut the NIH budget. Cut medical research. In fact, \ncompared with the President's budget, the Republican budget could mean \n1,400 fewer NIH grants a year.\n  The Republican budget also cuts $600 billion from income security \nprograms, such as nutrition assistance, potentially jeopardizing food \nstamps for thousands of Massachusetts families who depend on this \nprogram to put food on the table. And just to turn the knife a little \ndeeper for families in Massachusetts, the Republican budget could cut \nfunding for heating assistance--funding that helps 183,000 \nMassachusetts families stay warm in the winter.\n  We know whom this budget would hurt--millions of middle-class \nfamilies in Massachusetts and all over this country who are busting \ntheir tails to try to make ends meet. It will hurt people who work hard \nand play by the rules but who are seeing opportunity slip away. Why? \nWhy inflict so much damage on hard-working American people, on students \nand seniors, on kids and construction workers? Why cut back the support \nfor researchers trying to cure Alzheimer's or college kids trying to \nget an education? Why? One answer. Once again, the Republicans want to \ngive billions of dollars in tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans--and \nthey expect everyone else to pay for it. The Republicans have planned \n$269 billion in tax cuts that could go to just a few thousand of the \nrichest families. That is not just irresponsible, it is just plain \nwrong.\n  A budget is about values. The Republicans' values are on display \nhere. This budget is about making sure that a tilted playing field \ntilts even further, and everyone else gets left further and further \nbehind. Those aren't American values. We believe and we have always \nbelieved in opportunity. We believe that everyone should have a \nfighting chance to build a better life for themselves and their \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, we weren't sent here just to help the rich get richer. \nIt is time for the Senate to stand up for the values that build a \nstrong middle class, and we can start by voting down this terrible \nRepublican budget.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                   Citizen Unrest and Law Enforcement\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the unrest we \nhave seen, especially in Baltimore in the last week and to a lesser \nextent in several other cities around the country, including the city \nof Philadelphia in my State of Pennsylvania.\n  There has been, of course, no shortage of discussions on this matter, \ngoing back to last year, to the protests in Ferguson, MO, and those \nsurrounding other flashpoints that have involved law enforcement \nofficials.\n  We have in one way or another landed on a bit of a national \nconversation about police practices, and that is a good conversation. I \nthink we should have that. I, for instance, think we should seriously \nconsider body cameras for use by police officers.\n  I think this conversation is closely related to some other things \nthat we need to be talking about as well, including the problems of \nurban America that have a number of causes and that certainly deserve \nour attention and our action. For instance, I think we can and should \nbe talking about how we can create better jobs, better economic growth, \nand a better economic climate in our cities, especially our big cities. \nWe need to talk about how we can bring down the terrible rate of \npoverty that has been persistent for decades in our cities. We have to \ntalk about how schools have been letting down too many poor families in \nour big cities.\n  We ought to talk about family structure as well because we know that \na breakdown of families contributes enormously to all sorts of social \npathologies--involvement in gangs and drug use and drug dealing, \ncriminality in general, and poverty itself.\n  We can talk about guns, too. I remain proud of the work I have done \nacross the aisle to try to make it more difficult for guns to fall into \nthe hands of people who have no right to be using them--criminals and \nthose with mental illness.\n  These are all things we ought to be talking about in this great \ndebate, and we should be acting on these things in the Senate and in \nState and local governmental bodies across the country.\n  There is something in this discussion that we should also be willing \nto talk about. It is something that hasn't gotten as much attention \nduring this national conversation about police practices, and it is \nsomething that has been bothering me for some time. I think it came to \na head this week in Baltimore. I am going to talk about this now and I \nam going to continue to talk about this in the coming weeks and months \nbecause I think it is an important part of this national discussion.\n  My concern specifically is over the growing scapegoating of police \nofficers in America today. Before I go any further, let me be perfectly \nclear about one central point. If a police officer acts \nunprofessionally, acts outside the bounds of ethical standards or \nbreaks the law, then by all means that police officer has to be held \naccountable and punished for his or her transgression. There is no \nexcuse whatsoever for unlawful police conduct. That absolutely cannot \nbe tolerated not even one little bit.\n  I will be clear about another point. It is true that there are real \nand horrible cases of police misconduct. No one I know is trying to \ndeny that or sweep it under the rug or pretend it doesn't happen. It \ndoes happen, and it should never be tolerated.\n  Let's also keep this in perspective. There are doctors who break the \nlaw. There are accountants who break the law. There are lawyers who \nbreak the law. There are elected public officials who break the law. \nThe fact is that there are bad actors in every profession, in every \nline of work, in every walk of life, and that is true of the police as \nwell. But if you listen to many of the police critics we hear from \ntoday, you would think there is some sort of epidemic of crimes \nperpetrated by the police. That, I assure you, is not true.\n  In my years in public life, I have spent a lot of time with police \nofficers. I have gotten to know many of them. I have gone on rides with \nthem. I have listened to their concerns. I have met with them. I have \nsupported their community organizations. I have attended the charitable \nfundraisers they have held. By and large, I can tell you that I don't \nknow of any group of people anywhere in our society who are more \ndedicated professionals than the policemen and policewomen across our \ncountry.\n  Far from the epidemic of police misdeeds that some claim to be \nhappening out there, I think just the opposite is true. The \noverwhelming majority of police are honest men and women. They have \nvery high ethical standards. They don't have a racist bone in their \nbody. Our police have incredibly difficult and often dangerous jobs to \ndo, and it is an incredibly important job as well.\n  Our communities--let's face it--we all depend on the police. That is \nprobably more true in urban areas than anywhere else in the country.\n  So we need to have a conversation about bad police practices, but we \nalso need to have a conversation about what a great job the vast \nmajority of police are doing across our country and how much they \ndeserve our thanks and our support.\n  Unfortunately, the scenes we witnessed in Baltimore last week \ncertainly work against the kind of gratitude we ought to show to our \nlaw enforcement community. I am not talking about what happened to \nFreddie Gray. Mr. Gray absolutely deserves justice. If the police in \nthe Gray case committed crimes, then they must be punished. I don't \nquestion that in the least. But what happened last week in\n\n[[Page S2639]]\n\nBaltimore was not only about Freddie Gray. In scenes reminiscent of \nlast year in Ferguson, last week in Baltimore we saw a great American \ncity dissolve into utter lawlessness. We saw riots that destroyed a \nsenior citizen center, a CVS drugstore, numerous cars, all kinds of \nproperty. We saw dozens of injuries, including injuries to over 90 \npolice officers.\n  We had a curfew imposed and the National Guard called in to restore \norder as though this were some kind of war zone. We even had Major \nLeague Baseball cancel two games and conduct one game where no fans \nwere permitted to attend. They played before an empty stadium. How is \nthat allowed to happen in a great American city?\n  Some people excuse this lawlessness and point to the difficult \nunderlying conditions in the local community, but let's ask ourselves \nwho gets hurt the most by these riots.\n  Well, we know it is the very poor people from these communities who \nnow have no senior center to go to. They cannot go to CVS to get their \nprescriptions filled or to pick up necessities for their kids. And, of \ncourse, there is this big, red, flashing neon sign telling businesses, \nlarge and small--they could provide jobs and economic activity there--\nto stay away.\n  So where do the police come in on this? Well, President Obama called \nthe looters and rioters in Baltimore thugs, and President Obama has \nreceived some criticism for that. I just would use an objective, \nindisputable term. These people are ``criminals.''\n  It is a serious crime to set a fire to a car or to a building. It is \na serious crime to throw a rock or a bottle at a police officer. \nAssault and battery is a serious crime. It is a serious crime to engage \nin looting, and people who commit those acts are criminals. They should \nbe arrested, they should be charged, and they should be prosecuted and \npunished to the full extent of the law, but in order for that to \nhappen, we need the police. We need them to be actively engaged.\n  The Baltimore police officers have reported that they were ordered to \nstand down last week as the city was being destroyed. That is pretty \ntough to take--especially, I assume, for the law-abiding Baltimore \ncitizens who need that police protection.\n  Instead of standing down in the face of wanton criminal acts, the \npolice need to be allowed to do their job. They should make arrests. \nThey should restore order. There should never be another American city \nthat looks the way Baltimore did last week.\n  Now, when six police officers were charged on Friday in the death of \nFreddie Gray, there were celebrations in the streets in Baltimore. At a \ncertain level, that is completely understandable. Whatever Mr. Gray did \non that day, the day he was arrested, he certainly did not deserve to \ndie, and his death cries out for answers. We need to have answers to \nthese questions.\n  In the passions of last week, I understand why some people cheered \nthe appearance that the criminal justice system was standing up for Mr. \nGray. I totally understand that, but let me ask a question. What \nhappens if these accused police officers are found to have not broken \nthe law? What if one of them, several of them or even all of them are \nfound not to have violated the law? What happens then? Will we see \nBaltimore, and maybe other cities, erupt in flames once more? That is \nalready what appears to be forecast in some quarters.\n  What about those six individual police officers? Well, we know what \nhappens if they are found guilty. If they are found guilty, they are \ngoing to go to jail for a long time, and that will be appropriate.\n  But what happens if they are found innocent? In the Ferguson, MO, \ncase, a grand jury found there was no reason to believe a crime had \nbeen committed by the accused police officer, Darren Wilson.\n  The U.S. Justice Department also did an investigation, and they \ndecided not to bring civil rights charges against Officer Wilson. So \nOfficer Wilson was found to have committed no wrongdoing, neither by \nthe local grand jury nor by the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. \nJustice Department.\n  But what happened to Officer Wilson? Did anybody ask that question, \nWhat happened to Officer Wilson? Well, he faced multiple death threats. \nHe ended up having to leave his job on the police force, the one job he \nhad always wanted and he loved to do. He ended up having to move out of \nhis home and go live somewhere else. He is only 28 years old.\n  Now, the accused police officers in Baltimore have life stories too. \nOne of them is police Sergeant Alicia White. She is a 30-year-old \nAfrican-American woman who joined the Baltimore Police Department 5 \nyears ago. She is engaged to be married. A local Baltimore minister, \nwho knows Sergeant White, described her this way:\n\n       She wanted to be a police officer because she is a \n     Christian and wants to be a good role model for young black \n     women. And she wanted to be that good cop in the community \n     and bridge the gap between the police and the neighborhoods.\n\n  Of the six arrested officers, three are African Americans, three are \nWhite. None of this means any of these officers necessarily acted \nappropriately or right in this case. It is quite possible they did not \nand, if so, the court system, our legal judicial system, will determine \nthat.\n  What I am simply trying to point out is that these police officers \nhave human faces. They are human beings, and these officers are going \nto go through hell whether they deserve to or not. Their lives will \nnever be the same whether they are guilty or innocent. There will be \nmany people in the community who shun them, even if they are found to \nhave done nothing wrong.\n  What message does that send to all the tens of thousands of police \nofficers all across America who risk their lives every day to protect \ntheir communities from criminals? Unfortunately, it says there are a \nlot of people out there who are looking to misplace a lot of social \nproblems we face in our country on the backs of the police. It says \nthey might not be allowed to do their jobs when their communities most \nneed them to do their jobs, and it says that one day, should they find \nthemselves accused of wrongdoing, there might be a public mob that \nclamors for their conviction and threatens to burn down the city if the \nlegal system finds them independent. That is a sad state of affairs.\n  I am not defending the officers in the Gray case. I don't know \nwhether they are guilty or innocent. I expect the legal system to \ndetermine that, but that is not my point. My point is that while there \nare some police officers who act terribly and who must be stopped, \nthere is no epidemic of police criminality in this country.\n  We should absolutely discuss and act upon the issues that surround \npolice and community relations, by all means, and we also need to \nacknowledge the critical role the police play in keeping our community \nsafe, the overwhelming majority of police who conduct themselves \nhonorably day in and day out.\n  The next time there is a demonstration about police conduct, I hope \nit is a demonstration to thank the police for their dedication, their \nhard work, and their courage. That is a demonstration I will be honored \nto join.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, we are here debating choices. They \nhappen to be choices about our budget, about the future of our Nation \nthat will be determined by choices we make about how to invest.\n  That is the key concept at stake in this very momentous moment as we \nconsider choices for how to invest in middle-class financial security, \nand all that goes along with it, job creation, infrastructure, \neducation funding, clean energy research. All of those choices are \ncritical to the future of our Nation, and we will make disastrous \nchoices if we adopt the budget that has come to us in the conference \nreport for fiscal year 2016 because it fails to understand the need for \ninvestment in our future.\n  We are in danger of leaving a lesser America--an America that for the \nfirst time in our history will reflect a lesser Nation left to our \nchildren and their grandchildren. All generations before us determined \nthat they would sacrifice, that they would give back and pay forward. \nYet now, sadly, in fact tragically, we endanger their future by failing \nin those investment decisions.\n  The conference agreement would cut trillions of dollars to domestic \nprograms without seeking revenue. In\n\n[[Page S2640]]\n\nfact, it relies on gimmicks that undermine its integrity--a significant \ngimmick, for example, accounting, $2 trillion in tax revenue from the \nAffordable Care Act while at the same time repealing that law. It \nrelies on trillions of dollars in supposed savings without detailing \nhow those savings will be accomplished.\n  At the very least, we owe a measure of integrity to the American \npeople. We can disagree about choices, but at least we should be honest \nabout how revenue is supposed to match the spending we allocate. The \nproposal before us would, in fact, repeal the Affordable Care Act, \nwhich has already allowed more than 16 million Americans to obtain \nhealth insurance, access preventive services, and save money on their \npremiums. It would cut more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, reversing \nthe expansion that has provided health insurance to millions of \nAmericans.\n  Too many Americans are still struggling, and yet this budget would \ncut funding for job training and employment services. It would \neliminate the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, which provides vital \nsupport for small manufacturers in Connecticut and across the country. \nTime and again, we have learned that education is the key to a brighter \nfuture for our children. Yet, tragically, this budget would cut the \nfunding across the spectrum of American education, from universal \nprekindergarten, which would be slashed, to college affordability, \nwhere loan programs would be decimated. In fact, instead of making \ncollege more affordable, this budget decimates two critical programs \nthat would help future students pay back loans. Remember, the average \nstudent debt in this country is in the tens of thousands of dollars. In \nConnecticut, it is about $30,000, conservatively estimated.\n  This budget would increase student loan payments for millions of \nborrowers, and it would slash Pell grants--increase the cost of loans, \ncut the amount of grants available that enable students to avoid \nborrowing. In fact, it would cut the Pell Grant Program by nearly 30 \npercent and eliminate other important Federal subsidies.\n  These moneys are not spending, they are investments in our future, \nthe futures of those students whose hopes and dreams will be \nconstrained, undercut, and killed but also the future of our capacity \nto manufacture and compete around the globe because what we have--more \nthan any other nation--is very smart, skilled people. That is why \ncompanies are coming back to this Nation after outsourcing.\n  One of these programs, the Pay as You Earn Program, caps monthly \nstudent loan payments at a level that is proportionate to their \nearnings and forgives debt after 20 years of repayment.\n  But the Republican budget would require cuts to this program in a way \nthat could increase required monthly payment increases of more than 50 \npercent to some borrowers, and it paves the way for eliminating the \nPublic Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which assists students with \ndebt payments for those who go into public service professions, such as \nteaching, firefighting, and policing. This program ought to be \nespecially close to our hearts because we purport to be engaged in \npublic service and to provide a role model for young people who engage \nin public service.\n  I am particularly concerned about this program's impact on our \nrailroads, roads, bridges, and airports. We know those facilities as \ninfrastructure--the magic word in the Senate, ``infrastructure.'' In \nfact, we had a hearing just this morning in the Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee on the importance of fully funded, long-term \ninvestments in our Nation's highway transit and rail system.\n  We heard testimony from the public and private sectors about how \nimportant a revitalized and reinvigorated transportation network is for \nAmerican competitiveness, American businesses, and American \nprofessionals to compete in the world. Yet, through this budget, we \nwill not only sanction, but we will encourage and enable an inadequate \ninvestment in infrastructure. The budget conference report before us \nwould cut funding for highways and mass transit by 40 percent over the \nnext decade. There may be no more important fact to know about this \nbudget.\n\n  So I regret that I will vote against this budget because I wish, as \ndo many of my colleagues, that we could reach a bipartisan measure that \nwill embody the best in America, not encourage a retreat from our \npublic obligation.\n  In fact, I think America is ready to invest, ready to give back and \nto pay forward. In fact, I believe our wealthiest Americans are ready \nto do more and approve closing loopholes and ending subsidies, not \nmaking blanket cuts to vital programs, not cutting taxes for \nmillionaires, as this budget would create a pathway to do, not forcing \nanother 12 million middle-class families and students to pay for \ncollege by ending the American opportunity tax credit or adding $1,100 \nmore in burdens on them, and not forcing 16 million middle-class \nfamilies to pay a $900 tax hike by ending the expansions of the earned-\nincome tax credit and child tax credit. I think our most fortunate \nAmericans are ready to pay forward and do more and invest and, in fact, \nmake more sacrifices, which is the way this budget ought to be \narranged. And it isn't even a matter of sacrifices on the part of \nanyone; it is ending the subsidies for outsourcing to ensure that \neveryone pays their fair share without those hidden tax breaks and \nsubsidies that can be closed.\n  I hope we can do better than this. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nopposing the budget conference report.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, a budget is a vision of the future, and \nit clearly appears the two sides have very different visions as to what \nour country should be and the direction in which we move.\n  At a time of unprecedented and grotesque income and wealth \ninequality, where 99 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 \npercent, my Republican colleagues say we need to give a massive tax \nbreak to the 5,000 wealthiest families in America--the top two-tenths \nof 1 percent--a $269 billion tax break over a 10-year period. That is \nnot what the American people believe. What they believe is that at a \ntime when the rich and large corporations are doing phenomenally well, \nwhen we have a large deficit, when we have massive unmet needs in this \ncountry, that maybe, just maybe it is time to ask the wealthy and large \ncorporations to start paying their fair share of taxes, not give them \nmore tax breaks. That is exactly what this Republican budget does.\n  At a time when the United States is the only major country on Earth \nthat doesn't guarantee health care to all people and when 35 million \nAmericans today have no health insurance and even more are \nunderinsured, with large copayments and high premiums, the Republican \nbudget unbelievably--unbelievably--simply throws 27 million Americans \noff of health insurance. What happens to them? What happens when the \nAffordable Care Act is ended--which is what their budget does--and 16 \nmillion people lose their health insurance? What happens when another \n11 million people lose their health insurance because of the $440 \nbillion cuts in Medicaid? What happens to 27 million Americans? How \nmany of them will die? Clearly, many thousands will die. People who are \nsick will not be able to go to the doctor. People who are sick will get \nsicker and suffer. Twenty-seven million people thrown off of health \ninsurance is beyond being unconscionable. Yet, that is what is in the \nRepublican budget.\n  The Presiding Officer is a neighbor of mine in New Hampshire. I know \nthat in New Hampshire--I have been there recently--and in Vermont, \nyoung people are wondering about how they are going to be able to \nafford to go to college and what kind of student debts they will incur \nwhen they leave college. Our charge is to work together to make sure \nthat every young person in this country who has the ability and the \ndesire and the willingness to go to college is able to go to college \nregardless of his or her income. That is what we need to do in a \ncompetitive global economy.\n  We used to have the highest percentage of college graduates in the \nworld. Today, we are in 12th place. That is not where we should be if \nwe want to compete globally in this difficult world economy.\n  What is the Republican solution? The Republican solution is to make a \nbad\n\n[[Page S2641]]\n\nsituation much worse, with a $90 billion cut over a 10-year period in \nmandatory Pell Grant funding--Pell grants being the major source of \nfunding for low- and moderate-income young people in order to get help \nto go to college. This budget does exactly the opposite of what we \nshould be doing.\n  We are the wealthiest country in the history of the world. The \nproblem we are having is that almost all of that wealth is going to a \nhandful of people at the top. Yet, today we have more people living in \npoverty than at almost any time in the modern history of America. We \nhave seen some descriptions of that in the tragedy we recently observed \nin Baltimore in communities where 50 percent of the people are \nunemployed, where kids don't have enough to eat. Honestly, without \nbeing too rhetorical, I just don't understand how, when families are \nstruggling to feed their kids, when everybody understands that hunger \nis a real problem in this country, anybody could vote for a budget that \nmakes huge cuts in food stamps, in the WIC Program, and in other \nnutrition programs for families who are struggling to feed their \nfamilies. That is not what this country is supposed to be about.\n  On top of all of that--on top of cutting health care, with 27 million \npeople thrown off of health insurance; cutting education, making it \nharder for kids to go to college, harder for families to put their kids \ninto Head Start; harder for poor families to feed their kids--my \nRepublican colleagues say a major priority in this country is to give \n$269 billion in tax breaks to the top two-tenths of 1 percent. Does \nanybody--anybody outside of this Chamber think that makes any sense at \nall? Does anybody outside of here think those are American priorities? \nBillionaires do not need another tax break. They are doing just great. \nThey are doing fine.\n  Then, to add insult to injury, the Republican budget allows to expire \nthe additional benefits we put into the earned-income tax credit and \nthe child tax credit. That, in effect, would mean a tax increase for \nover 10 million working families. We would be raising taxes on low-\nincome workers while lowering taxes on billionaires. Those are not the \npriorities of the American people.\n  Madam President, I hope very much we will reject this budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, the Senate will soon vote to adopt the \nconference report to S. Con. Res. 11, the budget resolution. I \nsupported the budget resolution when we considered it in March, and I \nplan to support the conference report, but I was disappointed to see \none difference between the budget resolution that was passed by the \nSenate this year and the conference report we will be voting on later \ntoday. The Senate's budget resolution contained language that would \nhave created a point of order against any legislation that designated \nmore in the so-called OCO or overseas contingency operations funding \nthan what the President requested in fiscal year 2016. The conference \nreport we will soon consider does not contain that provision.\n  This point of order would have allowed those of us who have objected \nto off-budget funds being used in order to avoid spending caps--\nparticularly in the international affairs budget--to at least raise the \nissue on various appropriations bills and other measures we consider in \nthis body. This is an issue which needs to be raised, especially in \nlight of the State Department's use of such funding.\n  It is bad enough that the administration has been requesting OCO \nfunding to avoid making tough choices for its underlying budget since \n2012, but Members of Congress have become enablers, consistently \nappropriating more OCO funds than the administration has asked for. In \nfiscal year 2014, the administration requested $3.8 billion in OCO \nfunding for international affairs; Congress appropriated $6.5 billion. \nFor fiscal year 2015, the administration requested $7.8 billion in OCO \nfunding for international affairs; Congress appropriated $9.26 billion. \nThat figure does not include the $2.5 billion appropriated to address \nthe Ebola crisis; we appropriated that separately as emergency funding.\n  While emergency funding and OCO are different designations, the \npractical effect is the same. This is funding which is not subject to \nbudget spending caps created by the Budget Control Act.\n  This year, the administration has requested $7 billion in OCO funding \nfor international affairs.\n  Secretary Kerry said in early 2013 that ``OCO funding supports the \nefforts of the department in meeting the extraordinary demands of \noperating in the frontline states of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, \nand to a limited extent in other fragile regions.'' This year's OCO \nrequest includes funding for those countries, plus Syria, Jordan, and \nthe Ukraine.\n  Some of my colleagues have concerns that the Defense Department will \nbe shortchanged under the spending caps, and we have worked to increase \nOCO funding spending in 2016 beyond the $57 billion requested by the \nPresident to $96 billion in total. But that $96 billion can be used for \nanything the administration and Congress both designate as being in \nsupport of ``overseas contingency operations.'' It also enables \ndepartments that receive OCO-designated appropriations to avoid having \nto make the tough funding decisions in their underlying budgets.\n  I am disappointed the conference report we will consider today does \nnot contain a point of order that would have at least enabled those of \nus who share these concerns I have raised today to raise this issue and \nto take some votes on it.\n  With that being said, I also understand that passing a budget is an \nimportant step in getting back to regular order and allowing Congress \nto carry out one of its primary responsibilities--establishing a budget \nfor the Federal Government. By passing this budget, Congress will be \nable to start considering appropriations bills and other budget-related \nlegislation. After all, it is Congress's job to exercise oversight and \nprioritize where and how Federal dollars are to be spent. In addition, \npassing a budget also initiates the reconciliation process for the \ncommittees in the House and the Senate that oversee the Affordable Care \nAct.\n  As I said earlier, I will support this conference report, but I would \nbe remiss not to voice my concerns over the removal of the OCO-related \npoint of order and the systemic use of off-budget funds to avoid \nbusting the spending caps.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all time \nremaining on the conference report be yielded back at 5:30 p.m. today \nand that the Senate vote on the adoption of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Madam President, the American people have consistently \nand overwhelmingly voiced their concern that our country is moving in \nthe wrong direction, whether that be with regard to wage stagnation, \nunemployment or simply realizing the American dream.\n  Unfortunately, the budget resolution before us sends a strong message \nto the American people that Washington isn't listening. Instead of \ntaking the opportunity to work together across party lines and move our \ncountry in the right direction, the Republican budget resolution \ncontinues to take our Nation down a road where Washington again stacks \nthe deck against the middle class and rewards the wealthiest families \nand largest corporations in America.\n  There isn't a single tax expenditure or loophole that is closed in \nthe Republican budget. This budget refuses to ask the wealthy to \ncontribute a single dollar more to deficit reduction. It does nothing \nto eliminate the carried interest loophole at a time when Wall Street \nbillionaires pay a lower effective tax rate than some truckdrivers, \nteachers, and nurses. In fact, this budget would eliminate the estate \ntax for wealthy families who inherit over $10 million.\n  This budget doesn't just give a tax cut for the wealthiest 1 percent, \nit also calls for lowering the top individual tax rate at a time when \nthe top 1 percent already earns more income than the bottom 50 percent.\n  What is more, the Republican budget resolution actually delivers a \ntax break\n\n[[Page S2642]]\n\nfor the wealthiest 0.2 percent of Americans over the next decade, \nproviding an average tax break of $3 million to multimillionaires and \nbillionaires. In fact, there are more Senators who will be voting later \nthis afternoon on this budget proposal than the number of Wisconsin \nfamilies who would benefit from the tax provision of this tax break I \njust cited.\n  Who picks up the tab for these giveaways? In my home State of \nWisconsin, an estimated 158,000 hard-working families would pay $1,000 \nor more in taxes under the Republican budget resolution. I wonder, do \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle really believe this budget \ngives Americans ``the right to rise''? Is this their idea of an \n``American revival'' for our middle class?\n  Not only does the Republican budget resolution fall short when it \ncomes to making strong investments in education to create a strong path \nto the middle class, it actually falls flat by actually cutting these \ninvestments, failing to make college education affordable, and ignoring \nthe huge student debt crisis across America. For Wisconsin families, \nthe cost of college education will increase for up to 117,000 students \nbecause of the Republican budget's substantial cuts to the Pell Grant \nProgram. At a time when our national economy moves forward with a slow \nand steady recovery, my State's economy has continued to lag behind.\n  So I can't support this Republican budget resolution when it doesn't \nmake the strong investments America desperately needs in our roads, in \nour bridges, and in our ports that will create jobs, boost our local \neconomies, and provide businesses with the quality transportation \nsystem they need to move their goods to market. I can't support this \nRepublican budget resolution when about 46,000 Wisconsin jobs would be \neliminated because of cuts to investment in transportation, education, \nand other programs.\n  At a time when both parties should be working together to pass a \nbudget that grows our economy for the middle class and gives everyone a \nfair shot at getting ahead, this Republican budget resolution cuts \ninvestments in workforce readiness, leaving 40,000 Wisconsinites \nwithout the training that prepares them to put their hard work ethic to \nwork moving our economy forward.\n  Many of the Wisconsin workers I hear from every day are really \nstruggling to make ends meet. They are working more, taking home less, \nand worried--worried that for the first time in American history, their \nkids will have fewer opportunities than they did.\n  The Republican budget doesn't address those worries, it doesn't \naddress those anxieties or those fears. It doesn't respond to this \ninsecurity. Rather, the Republican budget continues the same failed, \ntop-down economics, where Washington rigs the rules in favor of special \ninterests, in favor of millionaires and billionaires.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican proposal seeks to balance the budget on \nthe backs of the middle class and those struggling to one day become a \npart of America's middle class. This budget proposal marks another \nmissed opportunity for the majority. The American people are right to \nbelieve this budget takes our country another step in the wrong \ndirection because it turns its backs on building a stronger future. We \ncan do better.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, section 3112 of the conference agreement \ndirects the Joint Committee on Taxation and CBO to produce, alongside \nCBO's conventional estimates, cost estimates that incorporate the \nmacroeconomic effects of major policy changes. With respect to the \ndesignation of the major legislation that would fall within this \ndefinition, the chair of the Committee on the Budget in the Senate \nshall exercise the authority granted under subsection (c)(1)(B)(ii), in \nconsultation with the appropriate chair or vice chair of the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, to designate a revenue measure as major \nlegislation.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I have been here most of the day listening \nto comments about the budget. I am fascinated by the budget speculation \nthat has gone on here. Of course, I do know I only had 6 weeks to make \nup a budget for us to debate, and add to, subtract from, and then to \nconference. But a lot of what has been said is not actually in the \nbudget. Of course, one of the comments was that it should be a \nbipartisan budget. In the whole time I have been here, there has not \nbeen a bipartisan budget. The majority party has always gotten to take \nthe lead and outline what they see as a vision. But in the past, I \nremember we used to do our opening statements on the budget in the \nBudget Committee and then get a copy of the budget we had just \ncommented on. I thought that was wrong. I provided them with it the day \nbefore the statements were made so they could make better comments on \nthe budget and have better amendments.\n  What I really would have liked to have done is to have released it \neven a little earlier. I proposed this to them in exchange for them \ndoing their amendments in advance so we could see their amendments and \nthey could see our amendments. That would lead to a much more \nbipartisan budget event. That was not agreed to.\n  Now we are down to the point where we are talking about this final \nconference report, where we have gotten the House and the Senate to \nagree on a position. I noticed a lot of people today said we were \ncutting highways. We are not cutting highways. There is a provision in \nthere to take care of highways. I think everybody--both sides of the \naisle--wants to make sure we have adequate highways in America. How we \nget there might be a little different. The President suggested we put a \nmandatory tax on money that is held overseas by companies to force them \nto bring it back. If that is done in too short of a period, that would \nbankrupt a lot of companies because they do have those invested in \nthings overseas. But it is something everybody looking at international \ntax reform has been talking about. One of the difficulties is, if you \ndo give a reduction in the amount of tax in order to encourage them to \nbring it back without making it mandatory, it shows up as a huge cost \nto the Federal Government. Right now they are taxed at 35 percent. If \nwe were to say they could bring it back at the 14 percent the President \nsuggested, that would be a 21-percent cost to our budget. But if we \nleave it at 35 percent, nobody is bringing that money back here. If we \nput it at 14 percent and make it mandatory, I guess they would bring \nthe money back here, if we didn't bankrupt them. That will be \nconsidered in the Finance Committee in the tax reform package.\n  I am certain something will be done on that to make us more \ncompetitive overseas, to bring the money back. I know they are talking \nabout taking, as the President suggested, a portion of those funds to \ntake care of the highways in the beginning, but we still have to have a \nlong-term way to take care of highways, and that is going to require \nsome bipartisan action.\n  Virtually everything that was talked about today in the way of \ncriticism is something that still has to be done. It has to be done \nwith a majority vote, and it has to make it through the whole Senate \nprocess, which probably requires 60 votes, which means it is going to \nbe bipartisan, and then every one of those things we were accused of \ndoing has to be signed by the President.\n  They have to be reasonable. They cannot be unreasonable, as we are \nseeing in there. Some do not even exist. For instance, we were accused \nof cutting Head Start money. That is not in the budget. There were some \ncuts to Head Start. That was part of the sequester a couple of years \nago. I was astounded when some of the Head Start people came to my \noffice and said: We got cut 7\\1/2\\ percent.\n  I said: No, no. It is 2.3 percent.\n  They said: No. We got cut 7\\1/2\\ percent.\n  What I found out was that the bureaucracy in DC kept their money and \ntook it out on the kids out there. Kids were taken out of Head Start. \nThey realized their error and they made some different changes and they \nrestored the money out there.\n\n[[Page S2643]]\n\n  I asked my people: Ok. You got your money back?\n  They said: Yes, but we still couldn't put our kids back because our \ncosts went up so high under ObamaCare on health care for our employees \nthat we had to put all of that into health care. That was not how it \nwas supposed to work either, but that is how ObamaCare works.\n  They also talk about us cutting Pell grants. We moved Pell from \nmandatory to discretionary. It was not cut. It was moved so it could be \nreviewed on a regular basis, just like everything else. The estate tax \nwas mentioned. Again, that is a Committee on Finance issue that would \nhave to be dealt with. It has not been given approval for all the years \nthat have been asked for, but that does not mean somebody cannot \nrequest it. We will see if the Finance Committee can find some way to \ndo it.\n  I think we can tell from the discussion that probably was not going \nto happen. The numbers speak, and the speculation does not. But here \nare some of the things this budget does: It balances the budget within \n10 years without raising taxes. It achieves more than $5 trillion in \nsavings, so it puts us on a slope to get to a balanced budget in 9 \nyears. It produces a $32 billion surplus in 2024 and a $24 billion \nsurplus in 2025 and it stays in balance. It boosts the Nation's economy \nby more than $400 billion in additional economic growth over the next \n10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. It is expected \nto grow 1.2 million additional jobs over the next 10 years--again, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office statement.\n  The balanced budget ensures a strong national defense. Yes, that is \nin there. The balanced budget provides for repeal and replacement of \nObamaCare. The balanced budget preserves Medicare. We heard about these \ncuts to Medicare. There are some savings in Medicare. Under our plan, \ninstead of those being spent on other programs outside of Medicare, \nthose are to be used for Medicare.\n  We already saw that we did the doc fix. That is so the doctors would \nbe adequately paid so they would continue to take Medicare patients--\nvery important. That is taken care of in this budget. The balanced \nbudget supports stronger economic growth. Note that the boost in \neconomic growth will all come from the private sector. Government \nspending does not contribute to this growth.\n  As my fellow Budget Committee member and businessman Senator Perdue \nnotes, expanding government does not help grow the economy.\n  The budget agreement improves transparency, efficiency, \neffectiveness, and accountability of the Federal Government by cutting \nwaste and eliminating redundancies and enacting regulatory reform. It \ncalls for modernizing Medicaid by increasing State flexibility and \nprotecting those most in need of assistance. It improves honest and \nresponsible accounting practices as part of the Federal budget process \nby ensuring that fair value accounting is used, which provides a more \nhonest accounting method.\n  I am the first accountant to chair the Budget Committee. It is very \nimportant for me to have it so we can tell exactly where things are \ngoing, not just in the first 10 years, which is what we have been \ntypically doing, but looking at the outlying numbers too.\n  We are going through a baby boom retirement right now, and the number \nof people under Social Security is going just like that.\n  We did not change Social Security. Under the Budget Act, we are not \nallowed to change Social Security, but we are going to have to take a \nlook at it. Looking at those numbers in the long term is going to force \nboth sides of the aisle to take a look at what we need to do to save \nwhat we are used to.\n  This new honest accounting will tell us more accurately what the \nlegislation will cost the hard-working taxpayers. It improves the \nadministration and coordination of benefits, and it increases \nemployment opportunities for disabled workers. It calls on Congress to \npass a balanced budget amendment for the Constitution. There are a \nbunch of States that are working on it and 27 States passed the \nrequirement for us to do that. Nine other States are close behind. If \nseven of the nine agree to that, we will have to actually balance the \nbudget.\n  How difficult is that? Last year, we overspent $468 billion. The \ndollars that we get to actually make decisions on are about $1,100 \nbillion. Some people call that $1.1 trillion. I do not think that \nreally tells the story; 1,100 billion sounds like a lot more than $1.1 \ntrillion. So $468 billion overspent on an $1,100 billion decision \nprocess, that is 50 percent. If we were to balance the budget, we would \nhave to cut that by 50 percent, and people really would be concerned.\n  Why do we have to do that? Interest rates alone will cause us to do \nthat. If the interest rates go up to what they normally would be--right \nnow we are spending $230 billion, and that is at an interest rate of \n1.7 percent. With interest rates rising, we would have to spend $1,745 \nbillion over the next 10 years just on interest.\n  Another reason we need to get this budget done is so appropriators \ncan get started. They are the ones that do the spending bills. There \nare 12 spending bills out there that get into the specifics of the \nthings we are spending. All we did was give a blueprint for the overall \npicture for each of those 12 spending committees. But they need to take \na look at what they have jurisdiction over and see where there is \nduplication, fraud, waste, and programs that are not even working.\n  We have a bunch of programs out there that we have not reauthorized. \nThat means they have expired, but we are still spending money on them--\n$293 billion a year on them. We have to do better.\n  There are two ways we can make a difference. We can look at those 260 \nprograms and see if--if they have not been looked at for a long time, \nsee if there couldn't be some savings there. Secondly, we can try to \ngrow the private sector economy. Private sector growth by 1 percent \nwould provide more than $300 billion in additional tax revenue every \nyear. That almost balances the budget by itself.\n  There are some things we can do if we start looking at how we can \nkeep from impeding business, get business going and make it more \ncompetitive in the United States, and we can do better.\n  I hope the people will all support the budget we have. It isn't \nperfect. We had a short time to work on it compared to the time the \nother side had to work on it in previous years, but we did it, and now \nwe need to finish it.\n\n  I ask for my colleagues' support on the budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Under the previous order, all time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report to accompany S. \nCon. Res. 11.\n  Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, the U.S. Marshals Service performs many \nimportant functions. Marshals protect Federal judges, they transport \nFederal prisoners, and they apprehend fugitives. The marshals operate \nthe Witness Security Program, and they manage the Asset Forfeiture \nProgram. The work is vital and sometimes even dangerous.\n  Given the important nature of the work, it is all the more essential \nthat its leaders carry out their mission with integrity and openness. \nUnfortunately, the evidence suggests that there are serious questions \nabout the leadership of the Marshals Service. The growing number of \nallegations brought to my office by whistleblowers is very alarming. It \nsuggests there may be a pattern of mismanagement.\n  In several letters to the Justice Department, I have asked about \nmultiple personnel actions allegedly driven by favoritism rather than \nmerit.\n  The first example involves the Director of the U.S. Marshals Service, \nStacia Hylton. In September 2011, Director Hylton sent an email from \nher personal email address to Kimberly Beal. At the time, Beal was the \nDeputy\n\n[[Page S2645]]\n\nAssistant Director of the Asset Forfeiture Division. The email included \nthe resume of an applicant for a highly paid contractor position.\n  Beal apparently went to unusual lengths to ensure that the applicant, \nwho knew Director Hylton in college, was hired. Emails indicate that \nMs. Beal inserted herself into the hiring process even though a \ncontractor representative told her the applicant was unqualified. She \ndirected subordinates to remain silent about the applicant's lack of \nqualifications. Ms. Beal traveled to Boston to interview the applicant \nin person. According to the whistleblower, she did not travel to \ninterview other candidates for similar positions.\n  After the contractor hired the applicant, Director Hylton placed Ms. \nBeal in the position of Acting Assistant Director of the Asset \nForfeiture Division--a position she now holds permanently.\n  In yet another example, an Assistant Director reportedly directed \nsubordinates to offer a lucrative contract position to a person with \nwhom she allegedly had a personal relationship. Gamesmanship of this \nsort undermines the confidence of dedicated Marshals Service employees \nin their leaders.\n  I could go on and on with examples such as these that have been \npouring into my office.\n  Another problem area is the alleged mismanagement of the Assets \nForfeiture Fund. The law requires that proceeds generated from asset \nsales be used to operate the Asset Forfeiture Program, compensate \nvictims, and support law enforcement. Yet, it appears that some in \nleadership use the funds to feather their own nests. Money is spent on \nthe ``best of the best'' in office furnishings and decorations instead \nof what is really needed to enhance law enforcement. In one example, \nthe fund was used to purchase a $22,000 conference table. In another \nexample, the fund was used to buy 57 square feet of top-of-the-line \ngranite for the Asset Forfeiture Training Academy in Houston. The \nMarshals Service claims it cannot even figure out how much the granite \ncost. Whistleblowers say the official who approved it told the supplier \nthat ``cost was not a factor.'' And that official has dismissed \nconcerns about wasteful spending of asset forfeiture money on the \ngrounds that it does not come from appropriated funds.\n  That is not responsible leadership. All money collected through the \npower of government needs to be spent carefully. Every dollar wasted on \nunnecessary luxuries in Marshals Services offices is a dollar that \ncannot be used to support real law enforcement priorities as the law \nrequires. The proceeds of asset forfeitures should not be a slush fund \nfor the personal whims of unaccountable bureaucrats.\n  How has the Justice Department responded to these allegations? When I \nasked the Department to explain the efforts to have Director Hylton's \nfavorite candidate hired by a contractor, the Department told me that \nDirector Hylton ``did not recommend'' the applicant ``for any \nposition.'' And the words ``did not recommend for any position'' is a \nquote.\n  The Marshals Service says it consulted with its Office of General \nCounsel before the Department sent its letter denying any improper \nhiring practices. That is disturbing because the Office of General \nCounsel has known about these allegations since December 2013. Still, \nthe Justice Department told me that no one did anything wrong. Someone \nin the Marshals Service General Counsel's Office had an obligation to \nspeak up before the Justice Department issued a false denial. They \nshould have known better.\n  About 3 weeks later, the Department retracted its earlier denial. In \na second response, the Department attached additional evidence that, in \nits words, ``appears to be inconsistent with representations'' that it \nhad previously made. That evidence was an email chain showing that \nthen-Deputy Assistant Beal had, in fact, received the applicant's \nresume from Director Hylton's personal email address. She then \nforwarded it to other senior leadership, stating that the ``Director . \n. . highly recommends'' the applicant. That evidence directly \ncontradicts the denial that the Department initially sent to the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  You would think the Department would insist on an independent inquiry \nafter being misled like that. Unfortunately, the Department is still \nallowing the Marshals Service to investigate itself. Justice Department \nheadquarters is not doing its job when it fails to supervise components \nwithin DOJ. There needs to be better supervision and a truly \nindependent inquiry to get to the bottom of these allegations.\n  Finally, I recognize the courageous whistleblowers who are bringing \nthese shortcomings to Congress's attention. As often happens, many of \nthese whistleblowers have faced retaliation for just speaking up, just \ntelling the truth, just helping Congress do its constitutional \nresponsibilities. But they have been retaliated against, and even today \nthey fear more retaliation will come. Multiple whistleblowers allege \nthat senior leaders submit FOIA requests to seek information on \nemployees who may have made protected disclosures. How sneaky. This is \nnot the purpose of the Freedom of Information Act. Multiple \nwhistleblowers also allege that since receiving my letters, managers \nwithin the U.S. Marshals Service have been on the hunt for the \nidentities of those who have made protected disclosures to my office. \nThis behavior is absolutely unacceptable and contrary to the intent of \nwhistleblower protection legislation. Maybe instead of spending time \ntargeting the people who are trying to bring wrongdoing to light, the \nmarshals should focus on providing full and accurate answers to my \nquestions.\n  The work of the Marshals Service is vital. The men and women doing \nthat work deserve not just our gratitude but our support as well. That \nsupport includes demanding responsible and accountable leadership from \nthe Marshals Service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/05/senate-section/article/S2645-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2645-S2646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICAID\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about one aspect of the \nbudget debate that has been before us, and it involves a major program \nthat affects the lives of not just millions of Americans but literally \ntens of millions.\n  We have debates and discussions in this body all the time about our \ncommitment to children, our commitment to older citizens, and a whole \nrange of folks we are concerned about. All of us at one time or another \nhave made pronouncements about how important it is to support children, \nespecially vulnerable children. We also are very concerned that as our \nparents or older relatives reach a certain age, they get the quality \ncare in the twilight of their lives that we would expect. They are \nhelped through a range of programs and services, actually starting with \nMedicare.\n  So we are concerned about our children, we are concerned about our \nolder citizens, and we are also concerned about the middle class. We \nhear a lot of us speaking about strategies or efforts to help boost the \nmiddle class and all of the challenges of the middle class. It is \ninteresting, though, that some issues affect all three of those broad \ngroups of Americans. The issue I am going to talk about is Medicaid. It \naffects, obviously, children. It affects individuals with disabilities. \nIt certainly affects older citizens across the country. And, indeed, it \naffects the middle class.\n  The Senate Republican budget cuts Medicaid funding by more than $1.3 \ntrillion, and in my judgment--and this is an assertion of an opinion--\nit would end the program as we know it because of the dimensions of \nthose cuts. The budget would repeal the Medicaid expansion, threatening \nhealth insurance for some 14 million Americans, and convert much of the \nprogram's funding into block grants.\n  Let me talk about seniors for a moment. We have had lots of debates \nabout the best policy going forward in the budget as it relates to a \nwhole range of issues, especially programs such as Medicaid. But at the \nend of the day, it is not the rhetoric or the speeches; it is the votes \nthat tell where one stands and what we prioritize.\n  We all have our own personal stories about those who have gone before \nus, and we, of course, always remember our own parents. But when we are \ntalking about our seniors, we are talking about Americans who fought \nour wars, worked in our factories, taught our children, built the \nmiddle class, and\n\n[[Page S2646]]\n\ndid so much for us, including giving us life and love. We want to make \nsure we are doing everything possible to provide them with the quality \ncare they deserve when they reach the age of 65 or older.\n  We know Medicaid provides older beneficiaries the dignity in their \nlater years that they should have a right to expect, as well as the \nflexibility to design where they receive care.\n  In my home State of Pennsylvania, over 40 percent of Medicaid \nspending on long-term services and supports goes towards home and \ncommunity-based care. Many assume the Medicare Program--Medicare, not \nMedicaid--will cover long-term care. In fact, it is Medicaid that is \nthe largest single provider of long-term care in America--not Medicare, \nbut Medicaid.\n  Medicaid covers approximately 40 percent of all long-term care \nservices provided in the United States, and 4 out of 10 people is a big \nnumber, obviously. It is lots of folks we care about and interact with \nin the course of a day, whether they are neighbors or family members or \ncoworkers across the board.\n  As enrollment continues to grow, more Americans are relying upon \nMedicaid than ever before. Medicaid is the major long-term care program \nfor the middle class. So I would ask we all keep that in mind as we \nconsider the determinations made through the budget process.\n  Let me give one example of a man living in Philadelphia--his example \nand his mother's. After her husband's passing, this individual's mom \nhad health problems and her health deteriorated quickly. Kidney \nproblems forced her in and out of the hospital. She was living on a \nfixed income, with medical bills piling up. She sold her apartment and \nused that money to pay for a few more years of care. This woman and her \nson were using every penny they could to help with her care, but it \nwasn't enough. She needed constant assistance. Her son, as the only \nchild in the family, couldn't do it himself while raising his own two \nchildren.\n  Eventually, this man's mother received Medicaid benefits and moved \ninto a nursing home in Philadelphia. Her son says he doesn't know what \nhis family would have done without Medicaid. Paying for nursing home \ncare would have quickly eaten his salary, and he would have had to sell \nhis family home. Again, he was raising two children. Medicaid allowed \nhim to avoid that vicious cycle.\n  Like millions of Americans, this man went to school and worked hard \nto get a good job so he could make a decent living. But despite being \nemployed as a professional, without Medicaid to help his mom, he would \nhave had to impoverish his own family--his two children--to care for \nhis aging mom. This would have put his children's future at risk.\n  Medicaid offered this individual some help--obviously, his mother \nsome help--in providing for his family and offering a way to have his \nmother get the care she needed.\n  This is not atypical. This is reality for so many families. Here is \none quick statistic. Then I will move to children, and then I will wrap \nup.\n  In Pennsylvania, seniors accounted for just 10 percent of Medicaid \nenrollees but over 22 percent of spending in 2011. The national numbers \naren't much different than that. The number of enrollees might be \naround 10 percent or in that lower range, but the spending, because of \nthe kind of care they received, is of a higher cost.\n  Let me talk for a couple of minutes about children. Together, \nMedicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, which we know as \nCHIP, served more than 45 million children in Federal fiscal year 2013, \nrepresenting one in three children in the United States. So Medicaid \nplus CHIP is the health care for more than one in three children.\n  We know CHIP is the health insurance program that impacts a lot of \nmiddle-income or at least lower-income families with children. In \nPennsylvania, for example, just the Medicaid Program covered 34 percent \nof children ages 0 to 18. So just a little more than a third of \nPennsylvania children rely upon Medicaid--a critically important \nprogram for those children.\n  One of the groups here in Washington that tracks programs and \npolicies for children is First Focus. They had a report in September of \n2014 where they reported that in calendar year 2012, 47 percent of \nrural children were covered by public insurance, meaning Medicaid or \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program or maybe a third option. So 47 \npercent of rural children were covered by public health insurance and \nonly 38 percent of urban children.\n  I know that sounds counterintuitive for some here, but rural children \nin America rely substantially upon Medicaid and the CHIP program. So \nimproving access to health insurance for low-income children not only \nleads to better health outcomes in the short run and in the long run, \nbut it also improves educational outcomes and government savings in the \nlong term.\n  Compared to their uninsured counterparts, children covered by \nMedicaid or CHIP are more likely to complete high school and college. \nThese important programs help children literally succeed in life \nbecause they stay in school, whereas they would not at that rate if \nthey were uninsured.\n  Some claim Medicaid is a highly inefficient program--that is one of \nthe charges against it--whose costs are growing out of control. In \nfact, Medicaid's cost per child is 27 percent lower than the per-child \ncost for private insurance. And Medicaid's costs per beneficiary have \nbeen growing more slowly--per beneficiary costs--than under private \ncoverage. I would argue it is not only efficient but effective in \ndelivering quality health care to our children.\n  We know there is more to be done. We know there are improvements that \nMedicaid could incorporate. We need to improve dental and behavioral \nhealth care for children and increase access to screenings and \nvaccinations to make sure our children are protected.\n  Let me just close with a couple of observations about children and \npregnant women. We know that Medicaid is also an important addition for \nchildren, but it is very important for pregnant women, with prenatal, \nlabor, delivery, and postpartum care.\n  Nationwide, Medicaid finances 45 percent of all births--45 percent. \nWe have a lot of folks in both parties who say how much they care about \npregnant women and children. Well, if 45 percent of all births are in \nMedicaid, we better protect Medicaid. It is vitally important.\n  Children who have health insurance, such as Medicaid and CHIP, are \nmore likely to receive vaccinations, have regular medical checkups, and \navoid preventable childhood illnesses.\n  So let me conclude with this thought. We know we have to find \nsavings. We know we have to work towards a fiscally responsible budget. \nBut I don't think anyone here believes the way to do that is to do it \non the backs of children who are poor but receive good health care \nthrough Medicaid or to do it by way of short-circuiting or limiting \nsubstantially the opportunities that older citizens have to go to a \nnursing home. Everyone in this building knows someone who is in a \nnursing home solely because of Medicaid--not everyone, but plenty of \npeople either we know and love or people we know and encounter during \nthe course of the year.\n  So if we care about pregnant women, if we care about kids, if we care \nabout older citizens and individuals with disabilities, we should think \nlong and hard before we substantially cut, as this budget does, \nMedicaid.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/05/senate-section/article/S2646-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2646-S2647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     BULLETPROOF VEST PARTNERSHIP GRANT PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week, the Senate is poised to pass the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program Reauthorization Act of 2015. \nThe law enforcement community is unified in its support of this program \nbecause it quite simply saves lives. To date, this program has provided \nmore than 13,000 State and local law enforcement agencies with nearly \n1.2 million bulletproof vests, including nearly 4,400 to officers in \nVermont.\n  Senator Graham and I have been working to address any and all \nconcerns that certain Republican Senators have raised about the bill. \nWe are prepared, for example, to accept an amendment from Senator Lee \nthat would reduce the authorization level from $30 million annually to \n$25 million. Unfortunately, I learned yesterday that a single \nRepublican Senator\n\n[[Page S2647]]\n\ncontinues to maintain a hold on this bill, continuing a pattern from \nthe last Congress of unwarranted obstructionism. I have been in contact \nwith a number of law enforcement groups representing officers around \nthe country, and I know that they are all incredibly disappointed that \nthis bill continues to be blocked.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership has helped to establish protective \nvests as standard equipment for law enforcement agencies across the \ncountry. Yet, for far too many jurisdictions--especially rural and \nsmaller agencies--vests still cost too much and wear out too soon. We \nknow that bulletproof vests will not save every officer, but they have \nalready saved the lives of more than 3,000 law enforcement officers \nsince 1987. I have met with police officers who are alive today because \nof vests purchased through this program, and they will attest to the \nfact that this program saves lives. These vests also are a comfort for \nfamilies, to know that their loved ones have them.\n  While I will keep fighting for passage of this bulletproof vest \nlegislation, we must also make sure that our work to make our \ncommunities safer for all continues. Over the past few years, the \nSenate has come together to protect victims of sexual assault and \ndomestic violence by reauthorizing and reinvigorating the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. We have worked to protect racial and religious \nminorities and the LGBT community when we passed the Matthew Shepard \nand James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act. We came together to \npass the Innocence Protection Act and the Drug Free Communities Act. \nAnd just a few months ago, we came together to enact the Death in \nCustody Act to bring needed transparency to every death that occurs in \npolice custody, and we need to do more to prevent such tragedies.\n  In the coming weeks, I hope that the Senate Judiciary Committee will \nturn its attention to the bipartisan effort to end mass incarceration. \nI am working with Chairman Grassley on the importance of legal \nrepresentation for those accused of misdemeanor offenses. Chairman \nGrassley is working with Senator Whitehouse and others to improve our \njuvenile justice system. Senator Rand Paul and I are working to \neliminate mandatory minimum sentences. I also support the work of \nSenators Durbin and Lee, who are seeking to reduce mandatory minimum \nsentences for certain drug crimes. We have historic opportunity to \nrestore the faith that Americans should have in the justice system. If \nwe work together, I know we can make meaningful improvements so that \nour entire justice system lives up to its name.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/05/senate-section/article/S2647-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MAY NOMINATION\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

In the 44 years that Dr. May has spent at NIST, \nincluding serving as Acting Director since last June, he has set his \nown standard for service, dedication, and leadership in this great \nagency.\n  Dr. May grew up in Birmingham, AL, graduated from Knoxville College \nin 1968, and upon graduating with a bachelor of science degree in \nchemistry, took a job with a Federal laboratory in Oak Ridge, TN. In \n1971, Dr. May came to Maryland to work for NIST's predecessor, which \nwas then called the National Standards Bureau. He completed his Ph.D. \nin chemistry at the University of Maryland while working full-time at \nNIST and earned his doctorate in 1977. His research on trace organic \nanalytical chemistry has been covered in more than 100 peer-reviewed \njournals around the world.\n  His colleagues know him not only for his brilliance in the lab but \nfor his commitment to NIST's mission and employees. He is respected by \nthe scientists at NIST but also by the engineers, lab workers, IT \nexperts, and building staff. His vision will help NIST's 3,000 \ndedicated employees continue to be the world's leading experts in \ninnovation, from quantum cryptography to 5G communications.\n  I join my colleagues in supporting Dr. Willie E.

They call it the Integrative Community Studies program. \nThese students learn how to build their own lives through employment \nand self-sufficient living.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to recognize Dr. \nWalt Nolte, who will retire on June 30, 2015, after 11 years as \npresident of Casper College.\n  Dr. Nolte and his wife Becky joined Casper College on July 1, 2004, \nbecoming the seventh chief executive officer in the college's 63-year \nhistory. He served as an administrator in several States, but Casper \nCollege was the institution he chose to call home longer than any \nother.\n  Dr. Nolte has been Casper College's ``Great Communicator.'' He is a \nleader guided by the principle of doing what is best for the team. He \nhas actively encouraged and developed open dialog between the college's \ngoverning bodies. He has provided constant encouragement and \nparticipation within the college community to uphold Casper College's \nmission: education for a lifetime. His understanding of the value of \ncommunity partnership has enabled the college to build one of the \nhighest rates of civic engagement of any Wyoming college.\n  In addition to guiding an excellent curriculum, Dr. Nolte has always \nmaintained that the campus facilities must be a priority. He is a \nleader who looks to the future and meets challenges head-on. In just 11 \nyears, he was able to secure voter and community support for critical \nimprovements to Casper College during a national economic downturn.\n  Dr. Nolte has been recognized at the regional and national level for \nhis leadership. The National Council for Marketing and Public Relations \nDistrict No. 4 named him their 2011 Pacesetter of the Year. He was also \nnamed a distinguished graduate of the University of Texas at Austin \nCollege of Education, and in 2011, Walt was named the first recipients \nof the Tacoma County Community College Distinguished Alumnus Award.\n  John E. Roueche, Ph.D., arguably the foremost scholar on community \ncollege leadership, recently wrote\n\n       Dr. Nolte is one of those rare leaders who practices well \n     what he preaches, leading by his own excellent example. He is \n     also a leader who is quite comfortable in his own skin and \n     delights in the success of all on his team. He truly \n     understands that the community college is of, by and for the \n     community.\n\n  Dr. Walt Nolte's legacy will benefit the college, the community of \nCasper, and the great State of Wyoming for years to come.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Indiana \nUniversity-Purdue University Fort Wayne, IPFW, on its 50th anniversary. \nI also want to recognize the outstanding faculty and staff for the \nextraordinary impact they have had on the education and lives of \ncountless students.\n  IPFW now is the largest university in northeast Indiana, providing a \ncritical foundation for thousands of Hoosiers who then use their skills \nand education to contribute to the surrounding community. In fact, 75 \npercent of IPFW alumni live and work in northeast Indiana.\n  In 1964, Indiana University and Purdue University merged their Fort \nWayne campuses to form IPFW, and the campus administration formally \ncombined in 1975. In the 1990s, IPFW opened the doors of some of its \nmajor, state-of-the-art facilities, which paved the way for larger \nstudent enrollment. By 2000, more than 10,500 students were enrolled, \nand in 2004, campus housing opened, allowing students to live and learn \nat IPFW for the first time. The campus went on to set a new enrollment \nrecord in the 2010-2011 school year with 14,192 students.\n  IPFW prides itself on keeping class sizes small in order to maintain \nhigh-quality, individualized instruction. This gives IPFW students the \nchance to be on a first-name basis with experts in their field of study \nand affords them the opportunity to develop a network of professional \ncontacts. The IPFW curriculum offers a wide variety of classes with \nmore than 200 academic programs, including undergraduate, graduate, and \nonline; more than 230 partnerships with businesses and educational \norganizations; and a growing number of scholarships that afford \nHoosiers from all backgrounds the opportunity to learn and thrive in an \nacademic setting. For the past 50 years, IPFW has worked to fulfill its \nmission to be an exceptional environment for teaching, learning, and \nstudent achievement.\n  Outside of the classroom, IPFW excels, too. The Mastodons now compete \nas a member of the NCAA Division I Athletics and fields 14 varsity \nteams. IPFW previously competed in Division II of the NCAA, where in \n1993, the men's basketball team won a school-record 23 games and \nachieved the No. 4 ranking among Division II teams. IPFW's men's \nvolleyball team, commonly known on campus as the Volleydons, has gained \nnational recognition with strong postseason showings, making six NCAA \nTournament Final Four appearances and reaching the 2007 NCAA National \nTournament Final. Former Mastodon setter Lloy Ball won an Olympic Gold \nMedal in the 2008 Beijing Games. IPFW athletics has many achievements \nto recognize, all the while meeting high academic standards in the \nclassroom.\n  For five decades, IPFW has provided northeastern Indiana and students \nacross the State and country with the opportunity to achieve their \ndreams through higher education. IPFW remains representative of the \nhard work, dedication, and innovation that are fundamental parts of the \nHoosier spirit. I want to congratulate Chancellor Vicky L. Carwein, the \nentire faculty and staff, and students both past and present, on this \nimportant anniversary. I am confident IPFW will continue to be a \nfixture in northeast Indiana and know the faculty and staff will \ncontinue to provide an outstanding education to our students in the \nyears to come. On behalf of the citizens of Indiana, I congratulate \neach and every member of the IPFW community on this 50th anniversary. I \nwish IPFW continued success and growth for many more years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/05/senate-section/article/S2648-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2648-S2649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      REMEMBERING GRETCHEN KAFOURY\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, long ago, I decided the most \ncomplimentary statement one could make about an elected official boils \ndown to four simple words: ``That person really cares.'' Those four \nwords perfectly sum up Gretchen Kafoury's long record of public service \nin Portland and in Oregon.\n  From serving in the Peace Corps during the 1960s to teaching at \nPortland State University four decades later, Gretchen just cared--and \nthen cared some more--about helping everyone have a better life.\n  Gretchen was the go-to leader in Portland and statewide in the fight \nto help women escape domestic violence. She was our conscience in the \nbattle to help people of modest means have more affordable housing. And \nshe was a pioneer for equal rights when she organized the campaign to \nforce open the doors at the City Club of Portland for women.\n  Small in stature, Gretchen Kafoury had the biggest heart in Oregon. \nIf you didn't have power or clout or a political action committee--and \nyou were talking about justice, Gretchen brought her smarts, her \nenergy, and her persistence to your cause.\n  I met Gretchen shortly after I graduated from law school at the \nUniversity of Oregon and was starting the Oregon Gray Panthers with \nanother admirer of Gretchen's--Ruth Haefner.\n  When you visited Ruth's house in Northeast Portland, you would see it\n\n[[Page S2649]]\n\nfilled with literature from progressive seniors for good causes. And I \nclearly remember how those progressive seniors thought Gretchen was \nspot on, for example, in developing the first health clinic for \nteenagers at Roosevelt High School.\n  Gretchen was incredibly helpful to the Gray Panthers in those days \nwhen she served in the Oregon Legislature as our State passed a generic \ndrug law, home care for seniors, and new rules to stop rip-off artists \nscamming health insurance to seniors.\n  Before Gretchen worked to crack down on those scamsters, it was \ncommon to see seniors with as many as 8 to 10 worthless health \ninsurance policies that fast-talking salesmen had sold them. Those \nphony salesmen never stood a chance when Gretchen fought to stop \nbusiness practices that fleeced the elderly.\n  When I ran for Congress in 1980, virtually no established elected \nofficials were in my corner. Gretchen was one of those folks in a group \nso tiny it could have fit in a couple of phone booths. I had never run \nfor public office but--with help and encouragement from Gretchen and \nseniors--I wanted to go to Washington to work on the very issues \nGretchen championed. I was proud she was in my corner every step of the \nway.\n  Over the years when I would see Gretchen at a housing rally, a \ndomestic violence conference, or an event to help nurses and other \nhealth care providers get better care for Oregonians at lower cost, I \nwould always see Gretchen and start to smile. That is because her \ncaring was so infectious and her passion to help people who needed help \nwas so powerful.\n  She prompted so many others to become involved in public life, not \nthe least of whom are her two daughters, one of whom is Multnomah \nCounty Chair Deborah Kafoury.\n  How lucky all Oregonians were to have Gretchen, and how lucky I was \nthat she was my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/05/senate-section/article/S2649-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2028.

Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Rubio, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 1195. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to update \nreporting requirements for institutions of higher education and provide \nfor more accurate and complete data on student retention, graduation, \nand earnings outcomes at all levels of postsecondary enrollment; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, when my colleagues and I went to college, \nthings were a lot different. Our colleagues took out loans, but those \nloans were manageable, and there were jobs waiting after graduation. \nToday, too often, that is simply not the case. In fact, the majority of \nstudents today will leave school weighed down with an average of more \nthan $31,000 in debt.\n  Investment in higher education is an economic imperative. Education \nis the great equalizer. It enables upward economic mobility and breaks \ndown class structures. A highly skilled and educated workforce is the \nbasis for any healthy economy. It is the foundation of our country's \nfuture.\n  In nearly every financial decision Americans make, individuals and \nfamilies try to evaluate the economic value of that decision. Like \nprospective homebuyers who inspect and assess the potential value of \ntheir future home, students should be able to compare colleges and \nprograms based on what the likely return on their investment will be.\n  Our capital markets work best when there is transparency so we can \naccurately measure the value of what we choose to invest in. We saw \nwhat happens when this is not the case with the burst of the housing \nbubble. Parts of our economy have yet to recover from the mortgage \ncrisis. Misinformed consumers bought a product based on misleading \ninformation and, often times, fell victim to bad loans offered by \npredatory lenders.\n  Consumers must know what they can expect from their investments. \nSimilarly, students are entitled to know the value of their education \nbefore they borrow tens of thousands of dollars from banks and the \ngovernment to finance their future.\n  Right now, consumers don't have this information. It is unavailable \nto students and families who are making critical decisions that will \nimpact not only their future--both their financial future and career \npath--but also the collective future of our country. That is why today, \nSenator Rubio, Senator Warner and I are introducing an updated version \nof the Student Right to Know Before You Go Act which will help inform \nconsumers and prevent market failures.\n  This proposal would ensure future students and their families can \nmake well-informed decisions by creating a market in which specific \nschools and specific programs can be evaluated based on the average \nannual earnings and employment outcomes of graduates; rates of remedial \nenrollment and success of students that participate in remedial \neducation; the percent of students that receive Federal, State, and \ninstitutional grant aid or loans by source; the average amount of total \nFederal loan debt of students upon graduation; the average amount of \ntotal Federal loan debt for students that do not complete a program; \ntransfer success rates; and rates at which students continue on to \nhigher levels of education.\n  The Department of Education has created a College Scorecard which is \na step in the right direction. The Scorecard, however, does not fully \ncapture any of the metrics outlined above. The Wyden-Rubio-Warner bill \ngenerates this critical information.\n  Markets fail when there is too little information and until now, it \nhas been impossible to collect this data in a cost-effective way while \nensuring student privacy.\n  This proposal makes it possible to secure a return on investment--for \nstudents, parents, policymakers, and taxpayers--while creating a \nworkforce that meets the demands of today's businesses and ensures that \nAmerican workers can successfully compete in the global economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/05/senate-section/article/S2652-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2652-S2653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 167--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \nCOURAGEOUS WORK AND LIFE OF ARGENTINIAN PROSECUTOR ALBERTO NISMAN, AND \nCALLING FOR A SWIFT AND TRANSPARENT INVESTIGATION INTO HIS TRAGIC DEATH \n                  IN BUENOS AIRES ON JANUARY 18, 2015\n\n  Mr. RUBIO (for himself and Mr. Kirk) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 167\n\n       Whereas the bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual \n     Association (AMIA) in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on July 18, \n     1994, killed 85 people and wounded more than 300;\n       Whereas the AMIA bombing case has been marked by judicial \n     misconduct, and the investigation had reached an impasse in \n     2004;\n       Whereas, in September 2004, Alberto Nisman was appointed as \n     the Special Prosecutor in charge of the 1994 AMIA bombing \n     investigation;\n       Whereas, on October 25, 2006, Argentine prosecutors Alberto \n     Nisman and Marcelo Martinez Burgos formally accused the \n     Government of Iran of directing the bombing, and the \n     Hezbollah militia of carrying it out;\n       Whereas Ibrahim Hussain Berro, a member of the terrorist \n     group Hezbollah, was identified as the AMIA bomber;\n       Whereas Iranians Ali Fallahijan (former Iranian \n     Intelligence Minster), Mohsen Rabbani (former Iranian \n     cultural attache), Ahmad Reza Asghari (former Iranian \n     Diplomat), Ahmad Vahidi (former Iranian Minister of Defense), \n     Ali Akbar Velayati (former\n\n[[Page S2653]]\n\n     Iranian Foreign Minister), Mohsen Rezaee (former Chief \n     Commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps), and Ali \n     Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (former President of Iran) were \n     named as the Iranian suspects in the bombing;\n       Whereas Imad Fayez Moughnieh (former head of Hezbollah's \n     external security) was named as a suspect in the bombing;\n       Whereas, in November 2007, Interpol voted to put 5 Iranian \n     and 1 Lebanese suspect in the 1994 AMIA attack on its most \n     wanted list;\n       Whereas, in 2007, a Guyanese man, Abdul Kadir, plotted to \n     blow up JFK airport in New York and was, according to Mr. \n     Nisman, ``the most important Iranian agent'' in Guyana and \n     influenced by Mohsen Rabbani;\n       Whereas there are countries in Latin America, especially \n     the group known as the Bolivarian Alliance (ALBA), that \n     actively cooperate with the Government of Iran and maintain \n     special relations with the Islamic Republic at various \n     levels;\n       Whereas Iranians and other citizens from the Middle East \n     have received passports from Venezuela or purchased them in \n     other countries of the region associated with ALBA countries;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has allegedly purchased \n     uranium from Venezuela and Bolivia;\n       Whereas Hezbollah, Iran's proxy, cooperates with drug \n     cartels in Latin America;\n       Whereas, in January of 2013, the Argentinian agreement with \n     Iran set up a ``truth commission'' to investigate who was \n     ``really'' responsible for the bombing, despite the fact that \n     Iran remains the main suspect in such attack;\n       Whereas Alberto Nisman was invited to testify before \n     Congress in February 2013, but was prevented by the \n     Government of Argentina, who denied him permission to travel \n     to Washington, DC, to testify;\n       Whereas, in May 2013, Prosecutor Alberto Nisman published a \n     500-page indictment accusing Iran of establishing terrorist \n     networks throughout Latin America, including in Argentina, \n     Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Chile, Colombia, Guyana, Trinidad \n     and Tobago, and Suriname, dating back to the 1980s;\n       Whereas, on January 13, 2015, Alberto Nisman alleged in a \n     complaint that Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de \n     Kirchner and Minister of Foreign Relations Hector Timerman \n     conspired to cover up Iranian involvement in the 1994 \n     terrorist bombing, and reportedly agreed to negotiate \n     immunity for Iranian suspects and help get their names \n     removed from the Interpol list;\n       Whereas Alberto Nisman alleged that Iranian oil was to flow \n     to Argentina in exchange for Iran to purchase large \n     quantities of Argentine grain and had evidence that \n     reportedly included wire-taps of phone calls ``between people \n     close to Mrs. Kirchner'' and a number of Iranians, including \n     Mr. Rabbani, the Iranian diplomat;\n       Whereas Alberto Nisman was scheduled to present his new \n     findings to the Argentinian Congress on January 19, 2015;\n       Whereas Alberto Nisman was found shot in the head in his \n     apartment located in Buenos Aires on January 18, 2015;\n       Whereas, Diego Lagomarsino, the prosecutor's office \n     employee who last saw Alberto Nisman alive and had provided \n     Mr. Nisman with the revolver that was found at Mr. Nisman's \n     residence, stated that Mr. Nisman had told him that ``it [the \n     revolver] was for security'' and that the previous day \n     Antonio Jaimie Stiusso (former head of Argentina's \n     Intelligence service) had called, warning him to ``take care \n     of his [Nisman's] security detail and his daughters' \n     safety'';\n       Whereas officials of the Government of Argentina continue \n     to discredit Mr. Nisman, attempting to ruin his reputation;\n       Whereas the President of Argentina continues to raise \n     unfounded hypotheses with regard to Mr. Nisman's findings, \n     including imaginary conspiracies she has suggested were \n     orchestrated by United States hedge funds and other entities \n     she considers ``hostile'' to the President of Argentina;\n       Whereas an Argentinean Federal court dismissed Nisman's \n     findings against the president and other officials and later \n     the accusations were dropped by Javier De Luca, another \n     Federal prosecutor;\n       Whereas that move has raised questions in Argentina about \n     the objectivity of Mr. De Luca, given his closeness to a \n     group of Ms. Kirchner's supporters;\n       Whereas the ongoing official investigation into Alberto \n     Nisman's death has yet to determine 2 months later whether \n     his death is a suicide or a homicide;\n       Whereas an independent investigation launched by Alberto \n     Nisman's family has released its own report by forensic \n     experts and forensic pathologists showing that Mr. Nisman's \n     death was not an accident or suicide, including claims that \n     ``the prosecutor had been shot in the back of the head'', \n     that ``no gun powder residue was found on his hands'', and \n     that ``Mr. Nisman's body had been moved to the bathroom once \n     he was shot''; and\n       Whereas no one has been brought to justice for the death of \n     Alberto Nisman, nor have any of the named Iranian suspects \n     for the AMIA bombing: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) offers its sincerest condolences to the family of \n     Argentinian prosecutor Alberto Nisman;\n       (2) recognizes Alberto Nisman's courageous work in \n     dedicating his life to the investigation of the bombing of \n     the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association (AMIA) in Buenos \n     Aires, Argentina, which killed 85 people and wounded more \n     than 300;\n       (3) calls for a swift, transparent, and internationally \n     backed investigation into Alberto Nisman's tragic death;\n       (4) encourages the public release of the results of the \n     investigation, including the forensic and pathological \n     reports by the government, which would show whether Alberto \n     Nisman took his own life, or if his death is a homicide;\n       (5) urges the President to directly offer United States \n     technical assistance to the Government of Argentina in \n     solving the death of Alberto Nisman, as well as the ongoing \n     investigation of the AMIA bombing;\n       (6) expresses serious concern about Iran's terrorist \n     network in Argentina, the United States, and all of the \n     Western Hemisphere, mindful of the findings of Mr. Nisman's \n     investigation and reports on this matter, and encourages \n     continued investigations of Iranian terrorist networks based \n     on his work;\n       (7) urges an independent investigation into the findings of \n     Mr. Nisman regarding the events that led to the memorandum \n     signed between Argentina and Iran;\n       (8) likewise expresses serious concerns about attempts by \n     President Cristina Kirchner and her government to discredit \n     Mr. Nisman and raise unfounded hypotheses on Mr. Nisman's \n     findings and death findings while the work of the courts on \n     this matter still continues; and\n       (9) urges the President of the United States to continue to \n     monitor Iran's activities in Latin America and the Caribbean \n     as it is mandated by the Countering Iran in the Western \n     Hemisphere Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-220).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url":

and\n       (3) are the largest single source of families providing \n     permanent homes for children transitioning from foster care \n     to adoption;\n       Whereas children in foster care who are placed with \n     relatives, compared to children placed with nonrelatives, \n     have more stability, including fewer changes in placements, \n     have more positive perceptions of their placements, are more \n     likely to be placed with their siblings, and demonstrate \n     fewer behavioral problems;\n       Whereas some relative caregivers receive less financial \n     assistance and support services than foster caregivers;\n       Whereas children in foster care are 4 times more likely to \n     receive psychotropic medications than children enrolled in \n     Medicaid overall;\n       Whereas youth in foster care are much more likely to face \n     educational instability, with 65 percent of former foster \n     children experiencing at least 7 school changes while in \n     foster care;\n       Whereas an increased emphasis on prevention and \n     reunification services is necessary to reduce the number of \n     children who are forced to remain in the foster care system;\n       Whereas more than 23,000 youth ``age out'' of foster care \n     annually without a legal permanent connection to an adult or \n     family;\n       Whereas the number of youth who age out of foster care has \n     increased during the past decade;\n\n[[Page S2654]]\n\n       Whereas foster care is intended to be a temporary \n     placement, but children remain in the foster care system for \n     an average of 2 years;\n       Whereas children in foster care experience an average of 3 \n     different placements, which often leads to disruption of \n     routines and the need to change schools and move away from \n     siblings, extended families, and familiar surroundings;\n       Whereas children entering foster care often confront the \n     widespread misperception that children in foster care are \n     disruptive, unruly, and dangerous, even though placement in \n     foster care is based on the actions of a parent or guardian, \n     not the child;\n       Whereas children who age out of foster care lack the \n     security and support of a biological or adoptive family and \n     frequently struggle to secure affordable housing, obtain \n     health insurance, pursue higher education, and acquire \n     adequate employment;\n       Whereas States, localities, and communities should be \n     encouraged to invest resources in preventative and \n     reunification services and postpermanency programs to ensure \n     that more children in foster care are provided with safe, \n     loving, and permanent placements;\n       Whereas Federal legislation during the past 3 decades, \n     including the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of \n     1980 (Public Law 96-272), the Adoption and Safe Families Act \n     of 1997 (Public Law 105-89), the Fostering Connections to \n     Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-\n     351), the Child and Family Services Improvement and \n     Innovation Act (Public Law 112-34), and the Preventing Sex \n     Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act (Public Law 113-\n     183) provided new investments and services to improve the \n     outcomes of children in the foster care system;\n       Whereas May 2015 is an appropriate month to designate as \n     ``National Foster Care Month'' to provide an opportunity to \n     acknowledge the accomplishments of the child-welfare \n     workforce, foster parents, the advocacy community, and \n     mentors for their dedication, accomplishments, and positive \n     impact on the lives of children; and\n       Whereas much remains to be done to ensure that all children \n     have a safe, loving, nurturing, and permanent family, \n     regardless of age or special needs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the designation of May 2015 as ``National \n     Foster Care Month'';\n       (2) recognizes National Foster Care Month as an opportunity \n     to raise awareness about the challenges that children face in \n     the foster care system;\n       (3) encourages Congress to implement policies to improve \n     the lives of children in the foster care system;\n       (4) acknowledges the special needs of children in the \n     foster care system;\n       (5) recognizes youth in foster care throughout the United \n     States for their ongoing tenacity, courage, and resilience \n     while facing life challenges;\n       (6) acknowledges the exceptional alumni of the foster care \n     system who serve as advocates and role models for youth who \n     remain in care;\n       (7) honors the commitment and dedication of the individuals \n     who work tirelessly to provide assistance and services to \n     children in the foster care system; and\n       (8) reaffirms the need to continue working to improve the \n     outcomes of all children in the foster care system through \n     parts B and E of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 601 et seq.) and other programs designed--\n       (A) to support vulnerable families;\n       (B) to invest in prevention and reunification services;\n       (C) to promote adoption in cases where reunification is not \n     in the best interests of the child;\n       (D) to adequately serve children brought into the foster \n     care system; and\n       (E) to facilitate the successful transition into adulthood \n     for children who ``age out'' of the foster care system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/05/senate-section/article/S2654-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 169--EXPRESSING CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILY OF DR. \n  WARREN WEINSTEIN, AND COMMEMORATING THE LIFE AND WORK OF DR.

Mr. CORKER (for himself and Mr. Rubio) proposed an amendment \nto the resolution S. Res. 97, supporting the goals of International \nWomen's Day; as follows:\n\n       Strike the preamble and insert the following:\n       Whereas there are more than 3,500,000,000 women in the \n     world as of March 2015;\n       Whereas women around the world have fundamental rights, \n     participate in the political, social, and economic life of \n     their communities, play a critical role in providing and \n     caring for their families, contribute substantially to the \n     growth of economies and the prevention of conflict, and, as \n     farmers and caregivers, play an important role in advancing \n     food security for their communities;\n       Whereas the advancement of women around the world is a \n     foreign policy priority for the United States;\n       Whereas on September 24, 2014, the President highlighted \n     the United States' support for the advancement of women, \n     noting: ``Where women are full participants in a country's \n     politics or economy, societies are more likely to succeed. \n     And that's why we support the participation of women in \n     parliaments and peace processes, schools, and the economy.'';\n       Whereas women remain underrepresented in conflict \n     prevention and conflict resolution\n\n[[Page S2655]]\n\n     efforts, despite proven success by women in conflict-affected \n     regions in moderating violent extremism, countering \n     terrorism, resolving disputes through nonviolent mediation \n     and negotiation, and stabilizing societies by improving \n     access to peace and security services, institutions, and \n     decisionmaking venues;\n       Whereas on December 19, 2011, the Obama Administration \n     launched the first United States National Action Plan on \n     Women, Peace, and Security (referred to in this preamble as \n     the ``National Action Plan'') that includes a comprehensive \n     set of national commitments to advance the active \n     participation of women in decisionmaking relating to matters \n     of war and peace;\n       Whereas the National Action Plan states the following: \n     ``Deadly conflicts can be more effectively avoided, and peace \n     can be best forged and sustained, when women become equal \n     partners in all aspects of peace-building and conflict \n     prevention, when their lives are protected, their experiences \n     considered, and their voices heard.'';\n       Whereas the National Action Plan requires the National \n     Security Council staff to coordinate a comprehensive review \n     of, and update to, the National Action Plan in 2015 with \n     consultation from international partners and civil society \n     organizations;\n       Whereas according to the Bureau of International Narcotics \n     and Law Enforcement Affairs of the Department of State, the \n     full and meaningful participation of women in security forces \n     vastly enhances the forces' effectiveness;\n       Whereas the ability of women and girls to realize their \n     full potential is critical to the ability of a country to \n     achieve strong and lasting economic growth and political and \n     social stability;\n       Whereas according to the International Monetary Fund, \n     ``focusing on the needs and empowerment of women is one of \n     the keys to human development'';\n       Whereas according to the United Nations Educational, \n     Scientific and Cultural Organization, \\2/3\\ of the \n     781,000,000 illiterate people in the world are female;\n       Whereas according to the United States Agency for \n     International Development, compared to uneducated women, \n     ``educated women are less likely to marry early and more \n     likely to have smaller and healthier families. They are also \n     more likely to get a job and earn a higher wage.'';\n       Whereas according to the Food and Agriculture Organization \n     of the United Nations, the majority of women living in rural \n     areas of the developing world are heavily engaged in \n     agricultural labor, yet they receive less credit, land, \n     agricultural inputs, and training than their male \n     counterparts;\n       Whereas according to the United Nations, women have access \n     to fewer income-earning opportunities and are more likely to \n     manage the household and engage in agricultural work, making \n     women more vulnerable to economic insecurity caused by \n     natural disasters and long-term changes in weather patterns;\n       Whereas according to the World Bank, women own or partly \n     own more than \\1/3\\ of small and medium-sized enterprises in \n     developing countries, and 40 percent of the global workforce \n     is female, yet women entrepreneurs and employers have \n     disproportionately less access to capital and other financial \n     services compared to men;\n       Whereas despite strides in recent decades, women around the \n     world continue to face significant obstacles in all aspects \n     of their lives, including underrepresentation in all aspects \n     of public life, denial of basic human rights, and \n     discrimination;\n       Whereas despite achievements by individual female leaders, \n     women around the world are still vastly underrepresented in \n     high-level positions and in national and local legislatures \n     and governments and, according to the Inter-Parliamentary \n     Union, women account for only 21.9 percent of national \n     parliamentarians;\n       Whereas it is estimated that 1 in 3 women around the world \n     has experienced some form of physical or sexual violence;\n       Whereas according to the United Nations Office of Drugs and \n     Crime's 2012 Global Report on Trafficking in Persons, women \n     account for between 55 and 60 percent of all trafficking \n     victims detected worldwide, and women and girls together make \n     up approximately 75 percent of all known trafficking victims;\n       Whereas 603,000,000 women live in countries where domestic \n     violence has not been criminalized;\n       Whereas according to the World Health Organization, \n     approximately 800 women die from preventable causes related \n     to pregnancy and childbirth every day, with 99 percent of all \n     maternal deaths occurring in developing countries;\n       Whereas on August 10, 2012, the President announced the \n     United States Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based \n     Violence Globally, the first interagency strategy to address \n     gender-based violence around the world;\n       Whereas violence against women and girls impedes progress \n     in meeting many international global development goals, \n     including efforts to stem maternal mortality and the spread \n     of HIV/AIDS;\n       Whereas on October 11, 2013, the President strongly \n     condemned the practice of child marriage;\n       Whereas according to the International Center for Research \n     on Women, \\1/3\\ of girls in the developing world are married \n     before the age of 18, and 1 in 9 girls is married before the \n     age of 15;\n       Whereas according to the World Health Organization, suicide \n     is the leading cause of death for girls ages 15 to 19, \n     followed by complications from pregnancy and childbirth;\n       Whereas it is imperative to alleviate violence and \n     discrimination against women and afford women every \n     opportunity to be full and productive members of their \n     communities;\n       Whereas 2015 marks the 20th anniversary of the Fourth World \n     Conference on Women, where 189 countries committed to \n     integrating gender equality into all dimensions of society;\n       Whereas 2015 marks the deadline for meeting the United \n     Nations Millennium Development Goals, and progress towards \n     meeting the targets for gender equality and women's \n     empowerment remains uneven; and\n       Whereas March 8 is recognized each year as International \n     Women's Day, a global day to celebrate the economic, \n     political, and social achievements of women past, present, \n     and future, and to recognize the obstacles that women still \n     face in the struggle for equal rights and opportunities: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1201.
