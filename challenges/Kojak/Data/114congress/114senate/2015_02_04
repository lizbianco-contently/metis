Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.R. 240.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 5, H.R. 240, a bill \n     making appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security \n     for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it was good to see the new Senate come \ntogether and pass another bipartisan bill yesterday. It was a win for \nour Nation's heroes. It was yet another win for the American people. \nBut that was only one of the votes we took because just hours after \njoining Republicans to do something good for our veterans, Democrats \nvoted to block funding for the Department of Homeland Security. It was \nenough to give anyone whiplash.\n  Now Americans are wondering, what could possibly lead Democrats to \nfilibuster Homeland Security funding? The legislation Democrats are \nfilibustering would fund the Department of Homeland Security. It would \nalso protect American democracy from overreach, described by President \nObama as ``unwise and unfair.'' That is it. You would think that a bill \nsuch as this would pass overwhelmingly. You would think that at least \nthe Democrats would allow the Senate an opportunity to improve the bill \nif it needs to be improved. But Democrats voted to filibuster the bill \noutright. They prevented the legislation from even being debated.\n  Today's Democratic Party seems willing to go to any extreme to \nprotect the kind of Executive overreach President Obama once described \nas ``not how our democracy functions.'' It would go so far as to block \nHomeland Security funding and to give the President the opportunity to \ncontinue to do what he is doing.\n  The whole situation is a bit perplexing given what some of our \ncolleagues said just a few weeks ago, given what they said about the \noverreach President Obama referred to as ``ignoring the law.'' One \nDemocratic Senator said that ``the President shouldn't make such \nsignificant policy changes on his own.'' Another Senator claimed he was \n``concerned about the constitutional separation of powers.'' He said, \n``The Constitution doesn't say if the Congress fails to act then the \nPresident can do x, y, and z. It just doesn't.'' A third Democratic \nSenator had this to say of the President's plan for overreach: ``It \nmakes me uncomfortable.'' Yet all of these Senators voted to shut down \ndebate and block funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Every \nlast Democrat voted to filibuster rather than work across the aisle to \naddress the very issue they claim to be concerned about.\n  Perhaps today's Democratic Party is so devoted to the right of \npoliticians to engage in action that would, as the President seemed to \nimply, ``violate the law,'' that it cannot tolerate dissent. But that \nis no reason to shut down the Department of Homeland Security. That is \nno reason to prevent the Senate from even debating whether to fund the \nDepartment.\n  So the Democrats' Homeland Security filibuster needs to end now. \nDemocratic Senators who say they are serious about keeping our Nation \nsafe and addressing what President Obama acknowledged as ``unwise and \nunfair'' overreach need to prove it.\n\n\n               Recognition Of The Acting Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday we were informed of another \nbarbaric act by ISIS--literally burning a Jordanian pilot to death in a \ncage. This follows news reports of beheadings of Japanese citizens, \nAmericans, and so many others. It is an indication of the threat not \njust to the Middle East but to the world of terrorism in its extreme, \nas ISIS demonstrates on a regular basis.\n  It was ironic that the same day we learned this, I visited the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and met with the Secretary, Jeh \nJohnson, and talked about the political strategy of the Republicans \nwhen it comes to funding the\n\n[[Page S742]]\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security--the same Department that is \nresponsible for keeping America safe from the threat of terrorism.\n  You see, the Presiding Officer knows well that when we were here in \nDecember passing an omnibus appropriations bill, the House Republicans \ninsisted that one agency be singled out and not properly funded, one \nagency of our government: the Department of Homeland Security. They \nfunded every other agency of the government to September 30 of this \nyear in a regular appropriations process but refused--the Republicans \nrefused to fund the Department of Homeland Security. Why? They wanted \nto reserve the right to fight with the President over the issue of \nimmigration. They wanted to reserve the right to object to any \nExecutive action taken by the President related to immigration. Their \nforum for this objection? The appropriations for the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  Yesterday Secretary Johnson came to our Democratic caucus lunch to \nexplain what it was like to manage a department of our government under \na continuing resolution. That is the technical name in our Budget Act \nfor temporary funding. He said it was like driving a car with a gas \ntank that only held 5 gallons of gasoline and not being sure where the \nnext service station was going to turn up. He said: That is how I am \ncalled on now to run the Department of Homeland Security--the \nDepartment that we entrust more than any other to keep us safe from \nterrorism.\n  Why? Why would the Republicans choose this Department to single out \nand not properly fund? At a time when we are facing threats of ghastly \nterrorism in this world that we have not seen, why would the \nRepublicans insist on making the appropriations for the Department of \nHomeland Security the forum for their debate with President Obama?\n  Now the Senator from Kentucky, our majority leader, comes to the \nfloor and says: Well, yesterday the Democrats refused to vote to fund \nthe Department of Homeland Security.\n  I will make a point for the record here that when the majority leader \nturns to page 12 of the publication sitting on his desk, the Calendar \nof Business of the Senate, when he turns to page 12, he should look at \nline 7 on page 12 of the Calendar of Business of the Senate, and there \nhe will find S. 272, introduced by Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New \nHampshire and Senator Mikulski of Maryland.\n  Let me read what S. 272 is:\n\n       A bill making appropriations for the Department of Homeland \n     Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Read the second time and placed on the calendar on January 28.\n  This bill will fund the Department of Homeland Security. This bill is \na clean appropriations bill.\n  If you look at the bill Senator McConnell and others have brought to \nthe floor for funding the Department of Homeland Security--I invite the \nSenator from Kentucky and those who are interested in debate to turn to \npage 55. Start reading on page 55 the general provisions that were sent \nto us by the House of Representatives--page after page of riders and \nrestrictions on the appropriations for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  You see, the House of Representatives said: We will only fund the \nDepartment of Homeland Security if we can have our way when it comes to \nthese restrictions on how they spend money.\n  Well, what is it that is so important to the House Republicans and \nSenate Republicans that they are willing to risk funding of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security? What is it that is holding them up \nfrom putting the resources in the hands of Secretary Johnson and this \nDepartment that they need to keep America safe? It must be something \nthat is momentous, historic. What is the reason they are taking a stand \nand leaving America vulnerable? Well, the Republicans clearly must have \nsomething that they think is even more threatening to the United States \nthan terrorism. What could it be? Well, it turns out we know, because \nof riders attached by the House of Representatives. The Republicans in \nCongress are more fearful of a group known as the DREAMers than they \nobviously are of the threat of terrorism from these extreme groups.\n  Who are these DREAMers? Well, I know this issue better than some. \nFourteen years ago it came to my attention that there was a serious \nmiscarriage of justice taking place in the United States. It turns out \nthat children brought to our country by their parents who were \nundocumented literally had no country. They grew up in America. They \nwent to school in America. They lived in America. They considered \nthemselves Americans. They pledged allegiance to our flag in their \nclassrooms. They sang our national anthem. They dreamed of their \nfuture, only to learn when they were still children that that \nopportunity was not there for them. You see, they were undocumented. \nTheir parents brought them to America, never filed any papers, and they \nwere undocumented.\n  It did not seem right to me at the time that a young person--a \ntoddler, an infant--brought to this country would be paying this heavy \nprice with their lives because of any wrongdoing by their parents. So I \nintroduced a bill, the DREAM Act, at the time cosponsored by Senator \nHatch of Utah. We said in that bill: If you were brought to America as \na child and your parents brought you here and did not file the papers \nor left you in an undocumented state, but you lived in America, did \nnothing wrong in America, graduated from high school in America, we \nwould give you a chance. We would give you a chance to step forward if \nyou were willing to either serve in our military or go to college and \nput you on a path to legalization. That was the DREAM Act. It was \nintroduced 14 years ago. It has never become the law of the land.\n  In that period of time, of course, thousands of young people have \nfound themselves in this predicament. It was 2\\1/2\\ years ago when I \njoined 20 other Senators and wrote to President Obama and said: Can you \nconsider an Executive order that would protect these DREAMers from \ndeportation so that they can live in America? And the President, 2\\1/2\\ \nyears ago, did. It was known as DACA, and this program said to these \nyoung people, this is your chance. Come forward, register, go through a \ncriminal background check, prove you graduated from high school, and \nthe President, 2\\1/2\\ years ago, said: We won't deport you.\n\n  We estimate 2 million young people would be eligible. Six hundred \nthousand have stepped forward and have been given this protection from \ndeportation.\n  This is the program that has led the Republicans in the House and \nSenate to threaten funding for the Department of Homeland Security. The \nvery thought that these young people could stay in America, live in \nAmerica without fear of deportation, work in America, go to school in \nAmerica, is so reprehensible to the Republicans in the House and \nSenate, they are prepared to jeopardize the funding for the Department \nof Homeland Security, which protects America.\n  I have come to the floor on more than 50 occasions to tell the story \nof these DREAMers, which I will do again this morning.\n  I ask my Republican colleagues in the House and the Senate to listen \nto the story of a DREAMer and tell me: Do you believe the person I am \nabout to describe should be deported from America?\n  His name is Pablo da Silva. He was brought here from Brazil in 2001 \nwhen he was 13 years old. Pablo grew up in New Jersey. This is what he \nsaid about his childhood:\n\n       The same as every other kid growing up in the U.S., I \n     attended middle school, pledged allegiance to the American \n     flag, and sang the National Anthem. As I grew older, I came \n     to understand that one thing about me differed from my \n     classmates. I was undocumented. However, my parents always \n     taught me to see barriers as a measure of perseverance and an \n     opportunity to thrive.\n\n  Pablo's dream was to become a doctor. During high school and college, \nhe volunteered at nursing homes every week. He was a member of a group \ncalled Doctor Red Nose. That is where he and others would dress up like \nclowns visiting hospitals and nursing homes to cheer up the patients \nand health care providers.\n  Pablo was accepted at Rutgers University, one of our Nation's best. \nBut because Pablo was undocumented, he didn't qualify for any financial \nassistance. He would have had to pay out-of-State tuition. So he \ncouldn't afford Rutgers. Pablo enrolled in a community college. Because \nhe had taken\n\n[[Page S743]]\n\ncommunity college courses when he was in high school, Pablo was able to \ncomplete a 2-year associate's degree in only 1 year.\n  With an associate's degree in hand, Pablo was able to transfer to \nKean University in New Jersey. In 2011, Pablo da Silva graduated at the \ntop of his class with a major in biology, summa cum laude. He received \nan award for the highest grade point average in the biology department. \nHe was on the dean's list every semester of college and a member of the \nhonor society Phi Kappa Phi.\n  Remember, this is the person whom the Republicans in the House and \nthe Senate want to deport from the United States and refuse to fund the \nDepartment of Homeland Security until this DREAMer is deported.\n  After graduating from college, Pablo da Silva was unable to pursue \nhis dream of becoming a doctor. He couldn't go to medical school as an \nundocumented person, so he worked in a variety of manual labor jobs.\n  In 2012, President Obama established DACA, and then Pablo heard \nsomething amazing. Loyola University of Chicago was prepared to accept \nstudents who had received DACA into its medical school.\n  Like many States across the country, Illinois has a shortage of \nphysicians in inner city and rural areas. Loyola University's DACA \nProgram is an opportunity to address this problem.\n  The State of Illinois has created a DACA loan program. Under this \nprogram, Loyola's DACA medical students can receive loans to help cover \nthe cost of medical education. For every year of loans, every year they \nget loans to go to medical school, these students must work for 1 year \nin a medically underserved area in my State of Illinois.\n  It is quite a tradeoff--1 year of medical school for 1 year of \nprofessional life as a doctor helping people who have no access to \ndoctors. As a result, an amazing thing happened. Some of the best and \nbrightest students in America have come to Loyola to get a medical \neducation, and they have signed up to stay in Illinois to serve the \nparts of our State where the people I represent are desperate for a \ndoctor.\n  Last fall, Pablo da Silva began medical school at Loyola where he is \npursuing his dream of becoming a cardiothoracic surgeon. He wrote me a \nletter and this is what he said about the DACA Program:\n\n       DACA has allowed me to fulfill my long-lasting aspiration \n     to pursue a career in medicine. It has truly changed my \n     future and for that I'm truly grateful. I'm eager to \n     contribute my share to the country I call my own.\n\n  When you read this letter, you stop and think, how can the \nRepublicans in the House of Representatives and the Senate have made \nthis man their enemy? How can they look at this young man, who has \nstruggled throughout his life to obtain an education--who has overcome \nthe odds, who has volunteered time and again in his community, who is \nwilling to work in underserved medical areas--how can they look at this \nman and say he is the enemy?\n  The Republicans in the House and Senate fear Pablo da Silva more than \nthey fear the extremist terrorist groups. They fear this DREAMer, and \nthey are willing to give short-term funding to a Federal agency to make \ntheir point.\n  If the House Republicans and some in the Senate have their way, Pablo \nda Silva won't be able to finish medical school. He won't become a \ndoctor. And if they have their way and deport him--which is what the \nHouse bill calls on us to do--my State is going to be denied a doctor \nin a medically underserved area.\n  We are a nation of immigrants. My mother was an immigrant to this \ncountry. I believe immigrants have brought so much to America, not just \nin hard work--and they take the toughest jobs--but also this risk \ntaking that is involved in immigration. They are willing to put it all \non the line.\n  In my case, my grandparents came here with my mom, when she was a \nlittle girl, to a country where they barely spoke the language and knew \na handful of people. They made a life, raised a family, and I was lucky \nto be part of it. And I am honored to stand on the floor of the Senate \ntoday.\n  That is my story, that is my family's story, and that is America's \nstory. That is the story of Pablo da Silva.\n  Why are the Republicans at war with this young man? Why do they think \nthat stopping his opportunity to go to medical school and serve America \nis in the best interests of our Nation? It certainly isn't.\n  Yesterday the Senate assistant majority leader said on the floor that \nDACA ``kicked the people who played by the rules to the back of the \nline and the people who did not to the front of the line.''\n  Here is the reality: The President's immigration action simply puts a \ntemporary hold on the deportation of low-priority cases like immigrant \nstudents such as Pablo da Silva. It doesn't put the DREAMers or any \nother undocumented immigrants in the same line as legal immigrants, and \nit doesn't put any legal immigrants at the back of the line. Only \nCongress can do that.\n  Speaking of Congress, it is important to note that in 2013 this \nSenate passed comprehensive immigration reform with a strong vote of 68 \nto 32. Republicans and Democrats voted for it.\n  For the remainder of that Congress, the year 2013 and 2014--more than \n1\\1/2\\ years--the Republican House of Representatives refused to allow \na vote on the Senate's immigration reform bill, refused to call their \nown bill, refused to take any action. It was at that moment when the \nPresident stepped forward and said: I have to do something with this \nbroken immigration system.\n  Instead of slowing down the appropriations to the Department of \nHomeland Security, I wish to remind the majority leader and the Speaker \nof the obvious. They are in control. They have the majority. They can \ncall immigration issues before the Senate and the House at a moment's \nnotice. We are prepared--prepared--to debate those immigration issues, \nbut we are not prepared to do that, engage in that important debate, at \nthe expense of funding the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Now we are going to waste a week of the Senate's time--a week when we \ncould pass the Shaheen-Mikulski bill and fund this Department, a week \nwhen we could initiate the debate on immigration, a week when the \nRepublicans can come forward with their own immigration ideas, if they \nhave any, other than deporting Pablo da Silva. They can come forward \nnow, but they refuse to.\n  They want to make this political point with the President, but they \ndo it at the expense of the safety and security of America, and they do \nit at the expense of DREAMers such as Pablo da Silva.\n  Every time we have tried to pass comprehensive immigration reform, \nthe Republicans have said no.\n  Every student of American history can tell us that anti-immigration \nparties eventually wither and die. We are a nation of immigrants.\n  There are some on the Republican side who understand that, and they \ncan't really explain why the Grand Old Party, the Republican Party, is \nturning its back on immigrants in a nation of immigrants. That is their \npolicy. They are so determined to pursue it they are willing to \njeopardize the appropriations for one of the most important agencies of \nour government, the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The President has used his legal authority to bring some fairness to \nour broken immigration system. If the Republicans think they can do it \nbetter, they have every right as the majority party in the House and \nthe Senate to offer legislation.\n  But with the Homeland Security Department facing a shutdown in just 3 \nweeks, we don't have time for these symbolic votes in the House bill on \nthe floor. Turn to page 15, I say to the majority leader, of the \nCalendar of Business of the Senate, and you will find the answer to \nyour question. You will find the way to fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity in a responsible way.\n  What the majority leader should do is to swallow his pride, call Mr. \nBoehner and say: Your idea is not going to fly in the Senate. It is \ntime for us to fund this agency. It is time to understand that as \nresolute as the terrorists are in harming innocent people and \nthreatening America, America should be as resolute in fighting them \nback.\n  The first line of defense is the Department of Homeland Security. It \nis time to fund it. We could do it in a\n\n[[Page S744]]\n\nmatter of minutes this morning if the majority leader would simply call \nto the floor this clean appropriations bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation Of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 3 weeks ago, scientists at Boston's \nNortheastern University made an amazing discovery in a pile of dirt. \nThey found a new antibiotic called teixobactin. This new antibiotic, \nthe first that has been discovered in more than 25 years, holds the \npotential to kill off a wide variety of disease-causing bacteria. It \noffers hope for a cure to serious and growing antibiotic resistant \ndiseases.\n  President Obama noted in his State of the Union Address that \nantibiotic resistance is one of the world's most pressing public health \nchallenges. In the United States alone, it costs us at least $20 \nbillion a year and claims 23,000 lives.\n  A plastic storage crate filled with backyard dirt might seem like an \nunlikely source for a breakthrough, but that is exactly where these \nscientists--who were working under a grant from the National Institutes \nof Health--discovered this potentially lifesaving medical breakthrough.\n  Scientific breakthroughs are nothing new for the United States of \nAmerica. In the last century we split the atom, defeated polio, \nconquered space, created the Internet, and mapped the human genome. All \nof those historic achievements had something in common with the \ndiscovery of teixobactin--they were backed by U.S. Government research \nfunds.\n  I have people come up to me in Illinois and say: Name one thing this \ngovernment has ever done. Well, aside from winning a few wars that were \ncritical to the future of mankind, we have done amazing things when it \ncomes to research.\n\n  For generations the United States was the unchallenged world leader \nin support of scientific research, but in recent years our lead has \neroded. In 1965 the United States spent 25 percent of our nondefense \ndiscretionary budget on research and development--1965, 25 percent; \ntoday, 10 percent.\n  Meanwhile, other countries are stepping up. China has increased \nresearch and development funding by 20 percent a year every year from \n1999 to 2009. If we stay on course, China will be investing more in \nresearch and development as a share of their overall economy than the \nUnited States in as soon as 5 years.\n  The erosion of U.S. funding is particularly troublesome and costly in \nthe area of biomedical research. Thanks to budget cuts, and \nparticularly the sequestration, the U.S. share of global biomedical \nresearch funding declined by 13 percent between 2004 and 2012. \nLifesaving discoveries are being delayed and young scientists are \nfinding fewer funding opportunities. A decade ago 30 percent of the \nqualified NIH grant proposals were funded, today it is just 18 percent.\n  In Illinois researchers regularly tell me how difficult it is to find \ngovernment support for their medical research. They can spend as much \ntime applying for grants and opening rejection letters as they do \nconducting experiments and analyzing data.\n  There are indications that young researchers are taking their talents \nto other industries and even other countries. In 1982 18 percent of NIH \nprimary investigators were under the age of 36. In 2011 3 percent of \nNIH primary investigators were under the age of 36. The young \nresearchers aren't going in to government-sponsored research. \nMeanwhile, our population is aging, medical conditions from cancer to \nAlzheimer's are touching more and more lives, and the need for medical \nbreakthroughs has never been greater.\n  Back in Illinois I had the pleasure of visiting the lab of legendary \nresearcher Dr. Janet Rowley at the University of Chicago. She was an \ninspiration. I wish I could have met her. Four decades ago, sitting at \nher dining room table in Hyde Park in Chicago, she had what she called \nan ``oh wow'' moment--a flash of insight that transformed the world's \nunderstanding of cancer. Until that moment it was generally assumed \ngenetic abnormalities were the result of cancer. Dr. Rowley's work \nshowed it was the other way around; that genetic mutations in fact \ncaused cancer. That revolutionary insight led to targeted drug \ntreatments for previously untreatable cancers. What family--what family \non Earth--has not been touched by cancer?\n  Janet Rowley was working under a small grant from the National \nInstitutes of Health when she made this historic finding. One of the \nparts of her story I love is when she and her family returned to \nChicago in 1962, Janet told the University of Chicago she would like to \ncome back to continue her research with a couple of conditions. She \nsaid: I am a mother of four boys. I can only work part time. Second, \nshe wanted a microscope, a desk, and a salary. She asked for $5,000 a \nyear. To its everlasting credit, the University of Chicago said yes. \nTen years later came her ``oh wow'' moment that changed our \nunderstanding of cancer.\n  One of my deep concerns is this: How many other Janet Rowleys are \nbeing lost in America to medical research because they can't get the \nfinancial support for the grants they need to move forward? How many \nmedical scientists have been forced to scale back or even abandon vital \nresearch because of ill-advised cuts to the National Institutes of \nHealth?\n  If America is going to remain a world leader in research that does \ncontribute to longer and healthier lives, Federal funding for medical \nresearch has to be a national priority. Last week I reintroduced a \ncritical bill. The American Cures Act calls for $150 billion in Federal \nresearch funding to support medical breakthroughs over the next 10 \nyears.\n  I guarantee we will get more than $150 billion in payback if we put \nthat money in medical research. If we can delay the onset of \nAlzheimer's in this country just by weeks or months, and God willing \ncure it, think of how much we will save. Last year it cost our Federal \nGovernment over $200 billion to treat Alzheimer's patients.\n  For researchers making long-term plans, it is not only the amount of \nfunding but its reliability. That is why the American Cures Act would \neliminate the year-to-year unpredictability of congressional budgets \nand politics and set a steady growth rate of 5 percent over 10 years.\n  Francis Collins, one of the most extraordinary doctors in America, \nheads up the NIH, and he said: This, Senator, will make a difference.\n  These funds would go to four institutions: the National Institutes of \nHealth, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department \nof Defense health programs, and the VA Medical and Prosthetic Research \nProgram.\n  The American Cures Act will make funding for lifesaving medical \nresearch less political and more predictable.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senators Sherrod Brown, Amy Klobuchar, Barbara \nBoxer, Ed Markey, Ben Cardin, Al Franken, Bob Casey, and Chuck Schumer, \nas well as Congresswoman Anna Eshoo for cosponsoring and sponsoring \nthis legislation. People may have seen the old bumper sticker that \nsaid: If you think education is expensive, try ignorance. Well, if you \nthink biomedical research is expensive, try illness.\n  Medical research is a great investment. Every $1 we spend generates \nover $2 in economic growth. We more than double our investment and that \nis before counting the value of diseases cured.\n  Dr. Anthony Fauci, a brilliant epidemiologist who heads the National \nInstitutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the discovery of \nteixobactin: ``That was a long shot--but it worked.''\n  That was also true with the polio vaccine, discovered 60 years ago by \nDr.\n\n[[Page S745]]\n\nJonas Salk, and so many other American cures and breakthroughs that \nhave changed the world. Private industry doesn't fund this sort of \nbasic foundational science. It can't. This kind of science takes \npatience and time and a lot of investment.\n  America is blessed with some of the best and most generous medical \nphilanthropies in the world, but they can't fill this funding gap. Only \nwe can do it. It takes our government to fund the science that leads to \nbreakthrough cures. This shouldn't be a partisan issue, and it \nshouldn't be a low-budget priority. I think it should be the highest.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the American Cures Act \nto help save lives, restore biomedical research leadership, and \nstrengthen America.\n  As Jonas Salk, the pioneer of the polio vaccine, would say: ``The \nonly way we can lose is if we stop too soon.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton).

Mr. President, I was very disappointed yesterday that \nthe Senate did not vote to proceed to the consideration of the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill. I hope we will have an opportunity to \nreconsider that vote and we will agree to take up the bill.\n  The need to fund the Department of Homeland Security for the \nremainder of this fiscal year should not be in question. We know that \nwe are living in a complex world with ever-changing threats to our \nNation's security. The Department that we created specifically to \ncombat those threats will operate better and more efficiently with a \nfull-year funding plan that reflects updated spending priorities. I \nhave heard no Senator dispute that.\n  The leaders of the Homeland Security Subcommittee--both Democrat and \nRepublican--put a great deal of effort into drafting this measure. The \nbill provides $10.7 billion for Customs and Border Protection--an \nincrease of $119 million over fiscal year 2014. This amount will \nsupport border infrastructure, technology needs, roads, air and marine \nassets, and higher levels of personnel, including Border Patrol agents \nand Customs and Border Patrol officers.\n\n  The bill provides nearly $6 billion for Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement--an increase of 13 percent.\n  The bill provides increased funds to identify, apprehend, and remove \ncriminal aliens and provides increases for investigations to help \ncombat human trafficking, cyber crime, child exploitation, and drug \nsmuggling.\n  The bill provides support for the Secret Service and congressional \noversight, including $25 million to address security needs at the White \nHouse complex.\n  The bill provides more than $10 billion for the Coast Guard. This \nincludes additional resources to continue the recapitalization of the \nCoast Guard fleet.\n  The bill provides funding for the Disaster Relief Fund. When disaster \nstrikes, it is important that the Disaster Relief Fund contain the \nresources necessary to support an effective response.\n  The bill also includes House amendments designed to reverse the \nPresident's unilateral actions on immigration enforcement. Given the \ntiming and breadth of the President's actions and the challenge to \ncongressional authority those actions represent, it can come as no \nsurprise that they provoked a congressional response.\n  I am speaking to remind Senators of the urgent and important need we \nhave for the adoption of funding for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and other provisions this bill contains. I urge my colleagues \nand the leadership to help ensure that we move the Senate in the \ndirection of early passage after thorough consideration of the \nprovisions of this bill, the passage of this bill to protect our \nnational security.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Lee pertaining to the introduction of S. 356 are \nprinted in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LEE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, as we continue this debate on funding \nfor the Department of Homeland Security, we face some fundamental \nquestions. Are we going to prioritize the safety and security of the \nAmerican people or are we going to put the country at risk because of \nan ideological disagreement? That is the choice we face with this bill.\n  We can debate immigration. I think Members of the Democratic caucus \nwould be happy to do that. The Senate did that 2 years ago when we \npassed a comprehensive immigration reform bill with 68 bipartisan \nvotes. But this is not the time for us to have this debate.\n  We need to fund the Department of Homeland Security now so they can \ncontinue to do their work. We can either pass a clean bill that makes \ncritical investments in our Nation's security or we can put our Nation \nat risk by playing politics with funding for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  I appreciate what the Appropriations Committee chairman, Senator \nCochran from Mississippi, did earlier today by coming down and laying \nout what is in the funding for the Department of Homeland Security and \nlaying out the important work of the Department of Homeland Security. I \nbelieve most of us appreciate the work they do and why it is so \nimportant to the safety and security of the country. That is why we \nneed to pass a clean bill to ensure that they are funded for the rest \nof this year.\n  For those who are in the Senate Chamber and for those watching at \nhome who have not been following what has gone on here in Washington \nwith this bill, I will provide a little history on how we got to where \nwe are today.\n  In the closing weeks of the 113th Congress, Senator Mikulski, then \nchair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Congressman Rogers, \nchair of the House Appropriations Committee, negotiated spending for \nthe entire government, including the Department of Homeland Security. \nThis was a compromise measure. Not everyone got what they wanted, but \nthe bill funded Homeland Security priorities at levels that would \nensure that the Department could fulfill its mission.\n  Then, sadly, politics came into play. Some Members of the House \nRepublican caucus demanded that the Homeland Security bill be removed \nfrom the larger budget because of immigration issues. They didn't like \nthe President's Executive action on immigration. Now the entire \nDepartment is funded on a short-term basis through February 27, which \nis just 23 days from now.\n  Last month the House of Representatives narrowly passed a bill to \nfund Homeland Security, but they added politically divisive language \nthat rolls back protections for immigrant children, among other anti-\nimmigrant measures. It also would roll back some of the efforts for \nsurveillance and efforts to address illegal immigrants who are \ncommitting crimes when they come into this country.\n  Because of these controversial immigration riders, President Obama \nimmediately announced that he would veto the House-passed bill. Last \nweek, the entire Democratic caucus of the Senate signed a letter to \nMajority Leader McConnell urging him to put the security of our Nation \nfirst, to put politics aside, and to work with us to pass a clean \nHomeland Security funding bill\n\n[[Page S746]]\n\nwithout controversial immigration riders attached--to pass a bill the \nPresident can sign.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letter from the Senate Democratic \ncaucus printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 27, 2015.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Majority Leader, The Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader McConnell: As we rapidly approach the \n     date on which the Department of Homeland Security's funding \n     expires, and as law enforcement officials face major threats \n     to our nation's safety and security, we write with one simple \n     request: work with us to pass a clean bill that funds \n     Homeland Security for the remainder of the fiscal year.\n       The House bill cannot pass the Senate. Democratic Leader \n     Harry Reid has called for a clean funding bill for the \n     Department of Homeland Security. The President has also made \n     clear that he will veto any bill that expressly limits his \n     authority to exercise prosecutorial discretion on immigration \n     matters. While we agree our current immigration system needs \n     comprehensive reform, including border security enhancements, \n     this appropriations bill is not the place for this debate.\n       In light of recent events in Paris, Ottawa and Australia, \n     the threat of ISIS and the proliferation of foreign fighters \n     that return home radicalized, DHS funding should not be tied \n     to divisive political issues that could jeopardize this \n     critical funding.\n       We are now four months into the fiscal year. A series of \n     short-term continuing resolutions to fund DHS should be off \n     the table. Secretary Jeh Johnson has noted that if DHS \n     continues to operate on CRs, counterterrorism efforts will be \n     limited, border security initiatives and grants to state and \n     local law enforcement will go unfunded, and aviation security \n     efforts will be hampered.\n       Every day, new threats emerge that endanger our citizens at \n     home and our allies abroad. We should not cast doubt on \n     future funding for the Department of Homeland Security at a \n     time when the entire nation should be marshalling collective \n     resources to defend against terrorism. Uncertainty undermines \n     security.\n       Last December, House and Senate negotiators reached a \n     bipartisan agreement on a bill to fund DHS for the entire \n     fiscal year. The best way to provide certainty and stability \n     for the men and women who fulfill DHS's mission to protect \n     the United States from harm is to immediately schedule a vote \n     so that this compromise bill can become law.\n       We know that you share our desire to keep our nation safe \n     in these dangerous times, and we thank you for considering \n     our request.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jeanne Shaheen; Richard J. Durbin; Patty Murray; \n           Elizabeth Warren; Edward J. Markey; Dianne Feinstein; \n           Heidi Heitkamp; Barbara A. Mikulski; Charles E. \n           Schumer; Debbie Stabenow; Thomas R.

Cloture was not invoked on the House bill. We saw that \nyesterday in our vote. It is a bill that cannot become law. There are \nonly 24 days left before funding for the Homeland Security Department \nexpires.\n  The House bill cannot move forward. So I urge my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle to work with us to pass a clean full-year \nbudget, without controversial riders, to fund Homeland Security.\n  As the ranking member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee, I am \nready to work with my colleague Senator Hoeven, who chairs the \nSubcommittee on Homeland Security, and the chair and ranking member of \nthe Appropriations Committee, Senator Cochran and Senator Mikulski, and \nthe entire committee to pass a bill to keep our Nation safe and to \navoid disrupting the work of the Department of Homeland Security and to \nkeep this critical agency operating at full strength. In fact, Senator \nMikulski and I introduced a bill last week, S. 272, which would do \nexactly that.\n  We live in dangerous times. Every day new threats emerge that \nthreaten our citizens at home and our allies abroad. The Department of \nHomeland Security's role in protecting our country from these threats \ncannot be overstated, and its funding should not be controversial.\n  Right now the U.S. law enforcement community is on high alert for \nterror threats after attacks in Sydney, Australia, and Ottawa, Canada, \nand, of course, the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, an Ohio man was arrested when authorities \ndiscovered he was plotting to blow up the U.S. Capitol in an ISIS-\ninspired plan. ISIS has thousands of foreign fighters, including \nAmericans among their ranks, who can return to their home countries to \ndo harm and who say they intend to do that.\n  We were all horrified yesterday by the news of the courageous \nJordanian pilot who was killed in such a barbaric and disgusting way by \nthe Islamic State.\n  We have recently learned that ISIS plans to take advantage of the \nSyrian refugee crisis and to move their fighters into Turkey and \nEurope. These are real threats. They are a clear and present danger to \nthis country, and because they are so real, we need our \ncounterterrorism intelligence community operating at full strength. An \nessential part of our Nation's counterterrorism and intelligence \ninfrastructure is within the Department of Homeland Security.\n  As Michael Chertoff, George W. Bush's Secretary of Homeland Security \nsaid, ``intelligence is not only about spies and satellites.''\n  Intelligence is also about the disciplined daily tasks of collecting \nand analyzing thousands of reports and investigations that are ongoing \nall across our country--from our local and State police, our Border \nPatrol agents, our port security personnel, and our Coast Guard \npatrolling our shores.\n  The Department of Homeland Security takes these thousands of bits of \ninformation, sifts out the critical details, coordinates with our \nforeign intelligence agencies, and gets critical information to our \nfirst responders on the ground as quickly as possible. This work is \ncritical to keeping our Nation safe from terrorism.\n  One of the chief criticisms of the 9/11 report was that we need to \nimprove intelligence information sharing between the intelligence \ncommunity and our first responders on the ground.\n  I was Governor on September 11. I know some of the challenges that we \nhad in New Hampshire with that information sharing. Well, that is one \nof the missions the Department of Homeland Security was created to \ncarry out.\n  If you talk to Governors and mayors, police chiefs and sheriffs, and \nthe folks on the ground who are responsible for keeping our citizens \nsafe every day, ask them about their fusion centers. Ask them whether \nthey want their law enforcement to go back to the days when all of our \nintelligence was bottled up in Washington, DC, and our towns and cities \nwere on their own. Of course they don't want to go back to being kept \nin the dark. There is too much at stake, but that is what could happen \nif the Department of Homeland Security is not fully functioning.\n  I wish to point out that we received a letter from the U.S. \nConference of Mayors. It is signed by Tom Cochran, CEO and executive \ndirector. He sent it to Senators Cochran, Mikulski, Hoeven, and \nShaheen. I will not read the whole letter, but they point out a number \nof issues which I believe are important in laying out the challenge and \nwhy we need to pass a clean funding bill.\n  Mr. Cochran says:\n\n       I write on behalf of the nation's mayors to urge you to \n     expeditiously report out a ``clean'' bill to fund the \n     Department of Homeland Security for the remainder of the \n     current fiscal year. A fully functioning Department of \n     Homeland Security is critical to the security of our nation, \n     our cities, and our citizens. A Department operating on a \n     short-term continuing resolution, despite its best efforts, \n     faces uncertainty and delays and simply cannot be fully \n     functioning.\n\n  He goes on to elaborate a number of the important programs and \nimportant work that the Department of Homeland Security does, and I \nwill not read all of that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S747]]\n\n\n                                                 The United States\n\n\n                                         Conference of Mayors,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 4, 2015.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran, Chairman,\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski, Ranking Member,\n     Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Hoeven, Chairman,\n     Hon. Jeanne Shaheen, Ranking Member,\n     Subcommittee on Homeland Security, Committee on \n         Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Cochran, Mikulski, Hoeven, and Shaheen: I \n     write on behalf of the nation's mayors to urge you to \n     expeditiously report out a ``clean'' bill to fund the \n     Department of Homeland Security for the remainder of the \n     current fiscal year. A fully functioning Department of \n     Homeland Security is critical to the security of our nation, \n     our cities, and our citizens. A Department operating on a \n     short-term continuing resolution, despite its best efforts, \n     faces uncertainty and delays and simply cannot be fully \n     functioning.\n       Under its current short-term continuing resolution, DHS \n     cannot undertake any new spending initiatives to respond to \n     national needs, including those along the border, or release \n     any grant funding for non-disaster programs. Among the non-\n     disaster programs it funds are the State Homeland Security \n     Grant Program and the Urban Areas Security Initiative, which \n     provide vital resources to our cities to help them prevent \n     and prepare for the threat of a terrorist attack. The Urban \n     Search and Rescue System is a national resource that provides \n     lifesaving aid to disaster-stricken communities both at home \n     and abroad. The Assistance to Firefighter Grant programs help \n     local fire departments meet their baseline readiness needs. \n     Emergency Management Performance Grants help to fund the \n     emergency managers so critical to our preparedness to prevent \n     and respond to disasters when events--manmade and natural--\n     occur.\n       Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson recently listed \n     just a few of the activities vital to public safety and \n     security that the Department has funded, including new \n     communications equipment for over 80 Los Angeles area public \n     safety agencies, surveillance cameras and environmental \n     sensors used by NYPD to detect in real time potential \n     terrorist activity, upgraded oxygen masks and tanks for over \n     30 Denver area; and 150 firefighter jobs in Detroit.\n       The current threat environment is serious, given the \n     terrorist attacks in Paris, Ottawa and Sydney and public \n     calls by terrorist organizations for further attacks on the \n     Western targets. It's vital that Congress provide stable \n     funding for the remainder of the year to the agency charged \n     with keeping all of us safe and secure, the U.S. Department \n     of Homeland Security.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Tom Cochran,\n                                       CEO and Executive Director.\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I will also point out a letter we \nreceived, which again, was addressed to Senator Cochran and Senator \nMikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 \nmore minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. This is from emergency managers, and it says:\n\n       The nation's local emergency managers urge you to include \n     full-year funding for programs at the U.S. Department of \n     Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency (FEMA) that support state and local emergency \n     management programs. These programs are critical to preparing \n     our nation for all hazards including terrorist attacks.\n\n  Again, they go on at length, and I ask unanimous consent to have this \nletter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      International Association of\n\n\n                                           Emergency Managers,\n\n                               Falls Church, VA, February 4, 2015.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,\n     Vice Chairwoman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Cochran and Vice Chairwoman Mikulski: The \n     International Association of Emergency Managers--US Council \n     appreciates the work of your committee as you consider the FY \n     2015 budget for the Department of Homeland Security. The \n     nation's local emergency managers urge you to include full-\n     year funding for programs at the U.S. Department of Homeland \n     Security (DHS) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     (FEMA) that support state and local emergency management \n     programs. These programs are critical to preparing our nation \n     for all hazards including terrorist attacks.\n       The Emergency Management Performance Grant (EMPG), called \n     ``the backbone of the nation's emergency management system'' \n     in an Appropriations Conference Report, constitutes the only \n     source of direct federal funding for state and local \n     governments to provide basic emergency coordination and \n     planning capabilities including those related to homeland \n     security. The grant is 50-50 cost shared and supports state \n     and local government initiatives for planning, training, \n     exercises, public education, as well as response and recovery \n     coordination during actual events. When a coordinated \n     response is required, it is always a complex undertaking. \n     Local emergency management is core to the coordination and \n     collaboration of multiple agencies, jurisdictions, and \n     sectors.\n       A recent example of the importance of EMPG is provided by \n     Dr. Russell Decker, Director of Emergency Management and \n     Homeland Security for Allen County Ohio.\n       In the case of our January 10 refinery explosion and fire, \n     EMPG funds made a successful response possible with trained \n     emergency managers and our public safety partners \n     implementing response plans developed and trained through \n     EMPG funding, hazard materials response and air monitoring \n     equipment funded through State Homeland Security Grant \n     Program funds ensured the safety of responders and nearby \n     residents. I'd hate to think what could have been the outcome \n     if that planning, training, and exercising had not occurred. \n     Since many locals rely on EMPG, extended delays can mean \n     staff layoffs or delays in filling vacancies, postponed \n     training exercises, delays in plan revisions and also delays \n     in acquisition of needed equipment for EOCs which could mean \n     increased costs when funds do become available.\n       The delay in receiving this annual EMPG funding causes \n     uncertainty for local governments. Some preparedness \n     activities must be put on hold until the reimbursement is \n     assured.\n       Also important are grant programs such as the State \n     Homeland Security Grant Program and the Urban Areas Security \n     Initiative which help support local government preparations \n     for the continued threat of terrorism. Funding is needed to \n     sustain currently established and critical programs.\n       We respectfully urge that full year funding be provided for \n     FY 2015 to end the uncertainty.\n           Sincerely,\n     John ``Rusty'' Russell,\n       President, International Association of Emergency Managers, \n     U.S. Council.\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. There are any number of reasons why we need to pass a \nclean funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security. We should \nbe working to do that now. We should stop the ideological debate and \nfocus on the risk to this country if we fail to act, the potential risk \nwe would face by passing a continuing resolution, and the risk to this \ncountry if we shut down the Department of Homeland Security. None of \nthose options are acceptable.\n  We need to work together and get this done. I urge my colleagues to \ndo that.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/04/senate-section/article/S747-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S747-S748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NET NEUTRALITY\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the importance \nof the issue of Net neutrality and the importance of it to our \ninnovation economy.\n  The Internet is a $638 billion economic force, and according to the \nMcKinsey Global Institute, it supports millions of jobs across our \nNation. Setting the right policy for the Internet is critical for the \ncontinuation of American job creation in an innovation economy.\n  Over the next 24 hours, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler is expected to \nannounce strong Net neutrality standards to support the growth of this \ninnovation economy.\n  According to news reports, the FCC will establish clear rules of the \nroad to ensure that no content is blocked and that the Internet cannot \nbe divided into fast and slow lanes. This announcement would set a \nclear framework for the innovation economy and the millions of jobs \nthat depend on it across our Nation. It would make a game-changing \nmilestone for American innovators and consumers because a comprehensive \nplan would protect consumers while still allowing for flexibility of \nbusiness growth and investment and making sure that American consumers \nand innovators are protected.\n  The Commission is expected to vote on this rule later this month, and \nI hope that all of our colleagues will be paying attention to this \ndecision because this decision is not just whether I can download or \nuse Netflix, it is really about equal access to the marketplace. It is \nabout how the future\n\n[[Page S748]]\n\nsuccess of these innovators are determined.\n  Over the last few years, we have been debating the future of the Web, \nand that is because broadband companies have tried to leverage what is \nto be established as a two-tier Internet--those with fast lanes because \nof their ability to pay more and slow lanes for those who can't pay \nmore.\n  I believe the President did the right thing. He called on the FCC to \nmake the right decision when it comes to the Internet and protecting it \nfrom cable companies who want to overcharge or slow down connections. \nThe FCC seems to be willing to make the right call, by protecting \nconsumers and the Internet, under a new order which, just like a \nutility, would give consumers the ability to be protected from bad \nservice or exorbitant fees. At this point in time, that is what we need \nto do to protect consumers.\n  According to the news reports, Chairman Wheeler will announce a plan \nto use the FCC authority in the most comprehensive way to protect Net \nneutrality, prohibit pay-to-play fast lanes, prohibit blocking and \nthrottling, require greater transparency for consumers, and apply the \nrules to wireless broadbands so that smart phones are treated just like \nthe browser on your desk.\n  This plan would cover what is known as the middle mile or Internet \ntraffic or the companies that content providers, such as Netflix, pay \nto bring traffic to cable companies, such as Comcast, to connect to \nyou, the end user. These important policies will provide certainty to a \nstartup in business, and they will make sure that those products get \nequal access.\n  Last month I had a roundtable in Seattle with several startups and \nexperts on Net neutrality, and many of those companies relied on the \nInternet to transform their ideas into successful businesses. They \nexplained how the debate affects more than just tech companies. They \nsaid software is revolutionizing every industry, from retail to health \ncare, everything from the way you pay for your coffee at Starbucks to \nhow you access your own personal health information.\n  If we allowed a two-tier system to develop, the big guys would have \nthe ability to pay more while the smaller customers would have \ndisruptions. What we have done, hopefully with an announcement today, \nis to make sure we are putting a stake in the ground to protect \nconsumers.\n  The CEO of the Washington Technology Industry Association put it best \nwhen he said:\n\n       We have a multi-trillion dollar evidence base study that \n     says the current rules of the game--which mean open, neutral \n     access to the Internet--work.\n\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  Our innovation economy depends on equal access for all ideas. The \nproof is in the numbers. Over 6 million U.S. jobs are tied to the \nInternet. That adds up to a payroll of $558 billion. In the Seattle \nmetropolitan area alone, from 2009 to 2014, there were 433 different \nventure capital deals related to Internet companies, totaling nearly \n$2.6 billion.\n  All of this growth in the Internet economy relies on an open \nInternet. That means no blocking, no throttling of these priorities. \nThat is why I support strong net neutrality rules. They need to be \nresponsible and efficient.\n  I thank Chairman Wheeler for his leadership in setting up strong \nrules. I hope this information on the Web continues to be one of our \ngreat economic engines and continues job development here in the United \nStates.\n  A strong net neutrality rule is the best tool in the toolbox for \npreserving the openness of the Internet today. It will go a long way to \nhelp us continue our economic prosperity.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/04/senate-section/article/S748-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S748-S750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I find it tragically ironic that on the \nsame day the Islamic State tragically took the life and murdered a \nJordanian pilot that the U.S. Senate failed to get a 60-vote majority \nto move to a motion to proceed to debate the most important issue \nfacing the United States of America. I agree with my colleagues who \nhave talked about the dangers of Islamic terrorism, the dangers of \nporous borders, and all the other dangers we have spoken about, but we \ncan't solve those problems unless we get the bill to the floor and \ndebate it.\n  I was elected in 2004. The No. 1 issue in my campaign and in the \ngeneral election was immigration policy in the United States of \nAmerica. Eleven years later, it is still the biggest domestic issue in \nthe State of Georgia. We still have a porous border and we know how \nvulnerable we are. It is time we move this bill to the floor and fully \ndebate it.\n  I know there are differences of opinion. I know each one of us would \ndo it differently. But we are part of a constitutional government to \nmake decisions for our people. We don't need Executive orders dictating \nwhat we should do. We need a House and a Senate to come to common \nground, we need a President who will sign a bill, and we need a bill to \nbe upheld. We are not going to get there until we have debate on the \nfloor and move forward on a motion to proceed to debate funding for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  I just left a Committee on Foreign Relations hearing on human \ntrafficking. We talked about the terrors of what is happening in terms \nof sexual abuse, sexual trafficking, child labor, minority labor--all \nof those horrors that are taking place. Do my colleagues know where \nthey are taking place in our country? They are taking place on the \nborder of the Southwest, in the Presiding Officer's home State of \nArizona, where our border is porous. And because of that, drugs and \nhuman beings are trafficked every single day. That should stop.\n  The No. 1 issue when we debated the Department of Homeland Security \nbill in 2005 was to put in a trigger to ensure that no changes in \nimmigration law took place until we first secured the border.\n  The border is still not secure. We are trying. I commend our brave \nsoldiers and the State of Arizona, as well as Fort Huachuca, one of the \nbeacons of the drones that are flying on the border with Mexico to try \nto identify people coming in, but we haven't done enough.\n  We should bring the Department of Homeland Security bill to the \nfloor. We should make sure the funding for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity is sufficient to secure our border. We will find our \ndifferences and we will debate our differences and we will come to \ncommon ground. But we can't come to common ground--we can't resolve our \nNation's No. 1 domestic problem--unless we agree to bring to the floor \nthe motion to proceed and bring a robust debate to the floor of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  I, as one Member of the Senate, ran for this job to be a part of the \nsolution, not someone who would throw up my arms and say we can't solve \nthe problems so I am going to sit on the sidelines. Let's get off of \nthe sidelines. Let's come to the floor of the Senate. Let's vote on the \nmotion to proceed. Let's fully amend and debate the bill. Let's send \nthe President a bill from a unified Congress that says we want a secure \nborder, we want an immigration policy that works, and we want to once \nagain be a government of checks and balances, not a government of \nExecutive orders.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to please notify me at 9 \nminutes into a 10-minute speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are in the odd situation by which our \nDemocratic colleagues are complaining that we are blocking funding for \nthe Department of Homeland Security when the House has passed a bill \nthat fully funds the Department of Homeland Security. It is sitting at \nthe desk today. The majority leader, Senator McConnell, has moved to \nproceed to that bill, and they are blocking it. Senator McConnell moved \nto invoke cloture on the motion to proceed--to just\n\n[[Page S749]]\n\nget on the bill--and he has indicated, as he has before, that there \nwould be amendments allowed to the bill. This would be the way to move \nforward with an appropriations bill in the regular order. So it is \nunbelievable, really, that our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle are trying to contend that the majority Republicans in Congress, \nin both Houses, are trying to block funding from the Department of \nHomeland Security when nothing could be farther from the truth.\n  Look at today's CNN headline. This is on their Web site: ``Democrats \nBlock Funding for DHS to Protect Obama's Immigration Orders.''\n  Why are they blocking it? To protect Obama's immigration orders that \nare contrary to Congress's will, clearly overwhelmingly rejected by the \nAmerican people, and contrary to law. Why should Congress fund unlawful \nactivities? Why should it fund policies it does not approve of? Why \nshould it fund policies the American people strongly reject? It has no \nduty to do that.\n  Congress is not a potted plant. It is not a rubberstamp. Congress has \na duty to the people, which is to ensure that the laws of this country \nare followed, that the American people have defense for the homeland, \nwith funding for the Department of Homeland Security, and they have \ndone that. What they have said is we are not going to fund actions by \nthe Department of Homeland Security that undermine the law. We are not \ngoing to approve money that undermines the laws of the United States, \nand we are not going to allow the President to take money, which was \ngiven to the Department of Homeland Security to enforce the law, so he \ncan undermine the law.\n  What has the President done with his Executive orders? It is a \nstunning action. He said over 20 times he didn't have the power to do \nthis. He doesn't have the power to do what he did. He just did it \nbecause political pressure, I guess, caused him to do so. He is going \nto provide legal status, not for children, for 5 million people. They \nwill be given Social Security numbers. Constitutional scholars have \ntold us, colleagues, the utilization of the idea of prosecutorial \ndiscretion is not appropriate in such a massive way as this. What I \nwant to tell you is it goes well beyond prosecutorial discretion. The \nPresident is going to provide a Social Security number to people who \nare unlawfully here. He is going to provide a photo ID for people who \nare unlawfully in America, providing work permits for them, the right \nto participate in the Medicare and the right to receive checks from the \nFederal Government in the form of earned income tax credit to the tune \nof billions of dollars.\n  One of the first things we do to try to establish a lawful system of \nimmigration is not provide financial benefit to people who come to the \nUnited States unlawfully. So this is a problem. I have to say it is a \nbig problem.\n  My friend and able Member of this Senate, Senator Durbin, the \nDemocratic whip, assistant minority leader, said this last night, \nyesterday: ``It is incredible to me that we have refused to provide \nfunds the Department of Homeland Security needs to keep America safe.'' \nHe said: ``It is incredible to me that we haven't passed a bill that \nthe House sent over here that fully funds Homeland Security.''\n  I am not blocking the bill. We want to go on the bill. We want to be \nable to amend the bill to keep America safe. Who is blocking it? It is \nmy Democratic colleagues. Senator Durbin is the leader of the blocking \ngame. He is the offensive line, the center, I guess, of the offensive \nline.\n  Senator Durbin goes on to say: ``There is nothing wrong with a debate \nover immigration policy.''\n  That is correct. He continues: ``In fact, the Republicans, now in the \nmajority control of the House and Senate, could have started the debate \nweeks ago. They didn't.''\n  Look, we debated Senator Durbin's vision. It was rejected by \nCongress, his ideas. Many supported the bill in this body. It didn't \ncome back this fall in part because of their actions on immigration.\n  President Obama had the choice to go from State to State trying to \nelect people to pass his immigration bill, but he either didn't do it \nor it didn't work. The American people do not want this kind of \nlegislation.\n  My friend Senator Durbin said further: ``Instead, they attached five \nriders to the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, and \nthey said: We will not allow that Department to be properly funded \nunless the President accepts these five immigration riders.''\n  This is just a normal bill that says how the money is going to be \nspent. It is going to be spent for enforcement, and we are not going to \nspend money to not enforce the law. It doesn't change. The bill the \nHouse has sent to us does not change one lawful immigration policy of \nAmerica, not one. It is the President who adopted a radical new \nimmigration policy contrary to law, contrary to the American people's \nwishes. In fact, quite a number of Democrats urged him not to issue \nsuch an order, but he did it anyway. Congress has a duty.\n  Senator Durbin talks about the DREAM Act that he offered. It had a \nchance for passage a number of times. But every time it was carefully \nread, it was an overreach. It went too far. But the point of which is \nit was rejected by Congress. Congress didn't pass that.\n  We need to be clear about who is objecting to what in this body, who \nwants to fund Homeland Security and who wants to advance a radical, \nunlawful, unpopular amnesty agenda the American people don't like.\n  Yesterday on the floor Senator Schumer asked if it wasn't possible \nfor the Senate to pass a Department of Homeland Security bill--without \nlanguage that would ensure the President complies with the \nConstitution, of course--and then send it back to the House.\n  Senator Schumer is one of our more able Members, for sure, in the \nSenate, and I respect him and his abilities. But the answer is this: \nThe House-passed DHS bill is the only vehicle because the House of \nRepresentatives would blue-slip a bill that originates in the Senate. \nThis is a basic tenet of how a bill becomes law. Article I, section 7, \nclause 1 of the Constitution states:\n\n       All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House \n     of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with \n     Amendments as on other Bills.\n\n  Over the years, the House of Representatives has asserted, and \nsuccessfully asserted, that this applied to revenue spending bills as \nwell. According to the Congressional Research Service, as a result, the \nHouse customarily originates all ``money'' bills, including \nappropriations bills. The Congressional Research Service states:\n\n       In practice, the Senate has generally deferred to the \n     House's insistence on originating appropriations.\n\n  Indeed, it has generally deferred because they won't move anything \nthat doesn't start over there. They successfully asserted that gray \narea to their benefit, and perhaps it is consistent with the \nConstitution.\n  My staff has been unable to find a single instance where the House \ntook up a Senate-originated appropriations bill in over 100 years, \nsince 1901.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 9 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  Our friends in the House have been unequivocal: The Senate must pass \nthe House bill. Speaker Boehner said, ``Senate Republicans and Senate \nDemocrats must stand together with the American people and block the \nPresident's actions.''\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S749, February 4, 2015, in the third column, the \nfollowing language appears: . . . Senator Boehner said, ``Senate . \n. .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . Speaker \nBoehner said, ``Senate . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers said the Senate, \n``should pass the bill, which funds a very vital national security \nagency but also turns back this blanket amnesty which is illegal and \nunconstitutional.''\n  That is where we are. The House has sent over the right bill. It does \nthe right thing. It defends the integrity of the Congress. It defends \nthe wishes of the American people, it defends the policy decision of \nthe Congress of the United States, and prohibits the President from \ndoing what he himself said over 20 different times he did not have the \npower to do. Professor after professor and historians have said the \nPresident doesn't have the power to do it. If the President can do \nthis, if he can execute laws Congress has rejected, what will he be \nable to do in the future?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, the good news is the country has made \nsubstantial economical progress in the last 6 years since President \nBush left office. Instead of losing 800,000 jobs a month as we were \nduring the final months of the Bush administration, we are now creating \nsome 250,000 jobs a month and have seen steady job growth over the last \n58 months.\n  Instead of having a record-breaking $1.4 trillion deficit as we did \nwhen President Bush left office in January 2009, the Federal deficit \nhas been cut by more than two-thirds. Today the 10-year deficit \nprojection is now $5.5 trillion lower than what the projections were \nback in 2010.\n  Six years ago the world's financial system, as we all remember, was \non the verge of collapse. Today that is not the case. In fact, some \nmight suggest that Wall Street is doing too well.\n  While we can take some satisfaction as to what has been accomplished \nin the last 6 years, one would be very naive not to appreciate there is \nalso a lot of very bad news in our economy, especially for working \nfamilies.\n  Most significantly, the simple truth of the matter is the 40-year \ndecline of the American middle class continues. Real unemployment is \nnot 5.6 percent--including those people who have given up looking for \nwork or people who are working part time when they want to work full \ntime--it is over 11 percent. Youth unemployment--something we almost \nnever talk about in this country--is a horrendous 17 percent, and \nAfrican-American youth unemployment is over 30 percent. It is totally \nunacceptable.\n  Real median family income has declined by nearly $5,000 since 1999. \nAll over this country--in Vermont and in every other State in this \ncountry--we have people working longer hours for lower wages. We have \nhusbands and wives working 50, 60 hours a week just to pay the bills. \nIncredibly, despite huge increases in productivity, in technology, and \nall of the global economy we hear so much about, the median male worker \nnow earns $783 less than he did 42 years ago. Let me repeat that. That \nAmerican male worker right in the middle of the economy now earns, \nafter inflation adjusted for wages, $783 less than he did 42 years ago. \nThe female worker right in the middle of the economy now makes $1,300 \nless than she made in 2007.\n  When you ask why people are angry, why people are stressed, why \npeople are frustrated, that is exactly why. Further, this country \ncontinues to have, shamefully, the highest rate of childhood poverty of \nany major country on Earth, and 40 million Americans still have zero \nhealth insurance.\n  In the midst of this tragic decline of the American middle class, \nthere is, however, another reality. The wealthiest people and the \nlargest corporations are doing phenomenally well. The result: The \nUnited States today has more income and wealth inequality than at any \ntime since the Great Depression. Today the top one-tenth of 1 percent \nown almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. Let me repeat that \nbecause that truly is a startling fact. Today the top one-tenth of 1 \npercent--which is what this chart talks about--owns almost as much \nwealth as the bottom 90 percent.\n  Today 1 family--the Walton family, owners of Walmart--owns more \nwealth than the bottom 40 percent of the American people, some 120 \nmillion Americans.\n  I don't believe most of our people think this is what the American \neconomy should be about. In fact, this is not an economy for a \ndemocracy. This is what oligarchy is all about. One-tenth of 1 percent \nowning almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, 1 family owning \nthe equivalent of what 131 million Americans own, that is wealth. In \nterms of income--which is what we make every year--what we have seen in \nthe last number of years since the Wall Street crash is virtually all \nnew income is going to the top 1 percent.\n  Last year--just as one example--the top 25 hedge fund managers earned \nmore income than 425,000 public school teachers. Does anybody believe \nthat makes sense? Twenty-five hedge fund managers making more income \nthan 425,000 public school teachers. That gap between the very rich and \neverybody else is growing wider and wider and wider.\n  The fact is that over the past 40 years, we have witnessed an \nenormous transfer of wealth from the middle class to the top 1 percent. \nIn other words, what we are seeing in our economy is the Robin Hood \nprinciple in reverse. We are taking from the poor and the working \nfamilies and transferring that income and wealth to the very wealthy.\n  From 1985 to 2013 the share of the Nation's wealth going to the \nmiddle class has gone down from 36 percent to less than 23 percent. If \nthe middle class had simply maintained the same share of our Nation's \nwealth as it did 30 years ago, it would have $10.27 trillion more in \ncumulative wealth than it does today. Almost $11 trillion would have \nstayed with the middle class but has disappeared since 1985.\n  But while the middle class continues to shrink, while millions of \nAmericans are working longer hours for low wages, while young people \ncannot afford to go to college or leave school deeply in debt, while \ntoo many kids in this country go hungry, we have seen, since 2009, that \nthe top 1 percent has experienced an $11.5 trillion increase in its \nwealth. So the top 1 percent in recent years sees an $11.5 trillion \nincrease in wealth, while in roughly the same period the middle class \nsees a $10.7 trillion decrease in wealth.\n  This $11.5 trillion transfer of wealth from the middle class to the \ntop 1 percent over a 5-year period is one of the largest such transfers \nof wealth in our country's history. Here is my point. This is not just \na moral issue, although it is a profound moral issue--and Pope Francis, \nby the way, deserves a lot of credit for talking about this issue all \nover the world. Are we satisfied as a nation when so few have so much \nand so many have so little? Are we satisfied with the proliferation of \nmillionaires and billionaires, at the same time as we have millions of \nchildren living in poverty? Is that what America is supposed to be \nabout? That is the moral component of this debate.\n  But this is not just a moral issue. It is also a fundamental economic \nissue. As we know, 70 percent of our economy is based on consumer \nspending. When working people do not have enough income, enough \ndisposable income, they are unable to go out and buy goods and services \nthat they would like or that they need. The so-called job creators that \nmy Republican friends often refer to are not the CEOs of the large \ncorporations.\n  The CEOs of large corporations cannot sell their products or services \nunless people have the income to buy them. Someone can come up with the \ngreatest product in the world, but if people do not have the money, \nthey are not going to sell that product, they are not going to hire \nworkers to produce that product.\n  The truth is that the real job creators in this country are those \nmillions of people who every single day go out and purchase goods and \nservices, but if they do not have adequate income, the entire economy \nsuffers. There was a very interesting article, I believe it was \nyesterday or today, in the Wall Street Journal, written by Nick \nTimiraos and Kris Hudson, talking about how a two-tier economy is \nreshaping the U.S. marketplace.\n  What they talk about is:\n\n       It is a tale of two economies.\n\n  Said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, a real estate brokerage \nin Seattle.\n\n       There is a high-end market that is absolutely booming. And \n     then there's everyone in the middle class. They don't have \n     much hope of wage growth.\n\n  The article continues.\n\n       Indeed, such midtier retailers as J.C. Penney, Sears and \n     Target have slumped.\n       ``The consumer has not bounced back with the confidence we \n     were looking for,'' Macy's chief executive Terry Lundgren \n     told investors last fall.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S751]]\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 28, 2015]\n\n        How a Two-Tier Economy Is Reshaping the U.S. Marketplace\n\n                   (By Nick Timiraos and Kris Hudson)\n\n       The advance of wealthy households, while middle- and lower-\n     income Americans struggle, is reshaping markets for \n     everything from housing to clothing to beer.\n       Woodinville, Wash.--Five years ago, Quadrant Homes churned \n     out starter houses in the Seattle area with an average sales \n     price of $269,000 and the marketing slogan, ``More House, \n     Less Money.''\n       But facing a debt-burdened middle class and rising land \n     prices, Quadrant has since exchanged entry-level buyers for \n     customers free of credit worries and ready to splurge. Its \n     new slogan, ``Built Your Way,'' accompanies homes with \n     vaulted ceilings and gourmet kitchens that last year sold for \n     an average price of $420,000. ``We used a lot of market \n     research to tell us that our old model wasn't going to \n     work,'' said Ken Krivanec, Quadrant's chief executive.\n       The emergence of a two-tiered U.S. economy, with wealthy \n     households advancing while middle- and lower-income Americans \n     struggle, is reshaping markets for everything from housing to \n     clothing to groceries to beer.\n       ``It's a tale of two economies,'' said Glenn Kelman, chief \n     executive of Redfin, a real-estate brokerage in Seattle that \n     operates in 25 states. ``There is a high-end market that is \n     absolutely booming. And then there's everyone in the middle \n     class. They don't have much hope of wage growth.''\n       The recession blew holes in the balance sheets of all U.S. \n     households and ended a decadeslong loosening of credit for \n     middle-class borrowers. Now, credit is tight, and incomes \n     have been flat or falling for all but the top 10th of U.S. \n     income earners between 2010 and 2013, according to the \n     Federal Reserve.\n       American spending patterns after the recession underscore \n     why many U.S. businesses are reorienting to serve higher-\n     income households, said Barry Cynamon, of the Federal Reserve \n     Bank of St. Louis. Since 2009, average per household spending \n     among the top 5% of U.S. income earners--adjusting for \n     inflation--climbed 12% through 2012, the most recent data \n     available. Over the same period, spending by all others fell \n     1% per household, according to Mr. Cynamon, a visiting \n     scholar at the bank's Center for Household Financial \n     Stability, and Steven Fazzari of Washington University in St. \n     Louis, who published their research findings last year.\n       The spending rebound following the recession ``appears to \n     be largely driven by the consumption at the top,'' Mr. \n     Cynamon said. He and Mr. Fazzari found the wealthiest 5% of \n     U.S. households accounted for around 30% of consumer spending \n     in 2012, up from 23% in 1992.\n       Indeed, such midtier retailers as J.C. Penney, Sears and \n     Target have slumped. ``The consumer has not bounced back with \n     the confidence we were all looking for,'' Macy's chief \n     executive Terry Lundgren told investors last fall.\n       In luxury retail, meanwhile: ``Our customers are confident, \n     feel good about the economy in general and their personal \n     balance sheets specifically,'' said Karen Katz, chief \n     executive of Neiman Marcus Group Ltd., last month. Reported \n     2014 revenues of $4.8 billion for the company are up from \n     $3.6 billion in 2009.\n       Revenue for such luxury hotel chains as St. Regis and Ritz-\n     Carlton rose 35% last year compared with 2008, according to \n     market research firm STR Inc. Revenues at midscale chains \n     such as Best Western and Ramada were down 1%.\n       On grocery aisles, the recession and its aftermath boosted \n     sales of economy brands. At the high end, Whole Foods Market \n     Inc. reported record sales per gross square foot last year.\n       ``Demand bifurcated,'' said Jason Green, chief executive of \n     the Cambridge Group, a growth strategy firm that is part of \n     Nielsen NV. ``The familiar stuff my middle-class family had \n     in the pantry, those are under significant pressure.''\n       In the grocery market's middle tier, Safeway Inc., the \n     second-largest supermarket chain in the U.S. was purchased \n     last year by the private-equity group that owns Albertsons, \n     the fifth-largest grocery retailer. Company officials said \n     the deal would allow the companies to reduce costs--and lower \n     prices for customers--as they fend off competition from low-\n     price outlets and high-end stores.\n       In the cold case, sales of premium lagers are up 16% since \n     2007 after adjusting for inflation, while sales of economy \n     brands grew 8%, according to research firm Euromonitor \n     International. Sales of midprice beers are down 1%.\n       The trend hit auto makers some years ago, when BMW AG's \n     former chief executive Helmut Panke described the U.S. market \n     as an hourglass: lots of demand for budget and luxury brands \n     but little in between. Steve Bates, general manager of BMW \n     Seattle for the past 12 years, said new-car sales at his \n     dealership were up 25% last year, while used-car sales were \n     flat. The M4 series, a sporty coupe priced from $64,000, \n     has been ``selling out as soon as it touches the ground,'' \n     he said.\n       Then there are consumers like Vicki Oliver, 68 years old, \n     of Temecula, Calif. She bought a used Hyundai Sonata last \n     year to replace a wrecked 1995 Ford Explorer. Ms. Oliver and \n     her husband, a real-estate agent, added onto their home two \n     years ago so her daughter and son-in-law, a general \n     contractor, could move in with their family.\n       ``That was a way to make things work in hard times,'' Ms. \n     Oliver said. Caribbean cruises and trips to Florida are now \n     memories. ``We haven't done that for years,'' she said.\n       The housing market illustrates how weakness among middle-\n     class consumers holds back the U.S. economy. Homes are \n     generally the biggest purchase Americans make. Housing \n     dollars ripple through the economy by triggering spending on \n     appliances, furniture and landscaping.\n\n\n                         Inequality in America\n\n       For the first time, U.S. builders last year sold slightly \n     more homes priced above $400,000 than those below $200,000. \n     As a result, the median price of new homes exceeded $280,000, \n     a record in nominal terms and 2% shy of the 2006 inflation-\n     adjusted peak.\n       Total sales last year, however, were up just 1% compared \n     with 2013, and more than 50% below their average from 2000 to \n     2002, before the housing bubble.\n       New homes are also getting bigger. The median U.S. home was \n     more than 2,400 square feet in the third quarter of 2014, a \n     20% increase from early 2000 and a 10% increase from the peak \n     of the housing market in 2006.\n       In Seattle, the median new-home size topped 2,500 square \n     feet last year, a record, according to research firm \n     Metrostudy Inc. Since the market hit bottom in 2011, sales of \n     new homes priced above $600,000 have tripled, while sales \n     below $400,000 are down 16%, according to CoreLogic \n     DataQuick. Builders boost profits selling more expensive \n     homes. But less construction overall means fewer new jobs and \n     reduced total spending.\n       ``Over the long haul, I worry that you can't run our \n     housing market, which depends on volume, on affluent buyers \n     alone,'' said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow \n     Financial in Chicago.\n       Young households have been slow to buy homes because of the \n     tough job market. Many would-be buyers can't save enough for \n     a down payment or don't earn enough to qualify for a \n     mortgage. Student debt holds others back.\n       A typical household, for example, would need around $60,000 \n     in cash to make a 20% down payment on the median-priced new \n     home in the U.S. To qualify for a mortgage, they would need \n     good credit and to show an annual income of about $45,000, \n     assuming little other household debt. A government-insured \n     loan in this example could call for an $11,000 down payment \n     but would require an annual income of $60,000.\n       Lisa and Nathan Trione are looking for a house in Denver \n     big enough for their five children. But there is little in \n     their price range: $250,000 and under.\n       ``You're already intimidated by the process,'' said Ms. \n     Trione, a 28-year-old paralegal and office manager. ``And \n     then you see this huge price, and you say, `I'm not ready to \n     do that right now.' ''\n       Ms. Trione is paying off debt she incurred while earning \n     her associate degree. She also is trying to raise her credit \n     score, which, she said, fell during a series of early \n     financial missteps.\n       Well-heeled customers, meanwhile, have their pick of \n     mortgages. At the same time, some banks have pulled back from \n     federally insured loans that allow for smaller down payments.\n       ``We would like to build a smaller, higher-quality and \n     less-volatile business,'' Marianne Lake, chief financial \n     officer at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., told investors last year. \n     With fewer potential customers, builders have largely \n     abandoned the entry-level market. ``If a builder can make \n     money on something, he'll build it. The problem is that they \n     can't make money at the entry level,'' said John Burns, of \n     Irvine, Calif., a consultant to builders.\n       But rentals, the low-end of the housing market, are \n     booming. Apartment construction has neared its fastest pace \n     since 1989. Two of the nation's largest home builders, Toll \n     Brothers Inc. and Lennar Corp., have both launched \n     multifamily construction divisions, each with around 5,000 \n     units in the pipeline. ``We all wished we had a big apartment \n     portfolio through this downturn,'' said Douglas Yearley, \n     Toll's chief executive, during an earnings call last year.\n       With sales plunging in 2009, Quadrant called in a research \n     firm that concluded more buyers might materialize if the \n     company built more expensive homes. ``When it's data driven, \n     the courage to make a remarkable change is easier than when \n     you're using your gut,'' said Mr. Krivanec, the company's \n     chief executive.\n       Quadrant, a unit of TRI Pointe Homes Inc., was finishing \n     seven homes per workday in 2004. They now finish less than \n     two of the more expensive houses a day. But the share of \n     buyers who back out of a deal, typically because they can't \n     get a loan, is down 10% since 2010. To serve more higher-end \n     buyers, Quadrant opened a design studio two years ago that \n     lets buyers choose from dozens of cabinets, countertops, \n     tiles and flooring. Some new buyers spend nearly twice as \n     much on such upgrades, the company said, which adds to the \n     profitability of home sales.\n       Common design features now include a walk-in closet and \n     bathroom nearly as big as the master bedroom. Kitchens have a \n     walk-in pantry.\n       On a recent Tuesday afternoon on Little Bear Creek Place, a \n     cul-de-sac in this Seattle suburb, electricians, landscapers \n     and framers worked on some 23 Quadrant home sites.\n       Nearby, Nick and Adriana Stoll unpacked boxes in their new \n     four-bedroom home. The\n\n[[Page S752]]\n\n     home is twice the size of the 1,200-square-foot, one-bedroom \n     apartment they rented in nearby Bellevue.\n       The Stolls customized almost every feature and finish, \n     including hinges on kitchen cabinets that prevent the doors \n     from slamming shut. ``I'm typically the kind of consumer \n     where I make a quick decision,'' Mr. Stoll said. ``But when \n     it comes to your home, well, we stared at 100 countertops for \n     an hour.''\n       The Stolls survived the recession and have prospered. Mr. \n     Stoll purchased a Seattle condominium in 2008, the day before \n     learning he was losing his job at Washington Mutual, the \n     thrift sold to J.P. Morgan after it was seized by the Federal \n     Deposit Insurance Corp.\n       Mr. Stoll changed jobs twice before he was recruited in \n     2011 to work at a technology company. He broke even on the \n     sale of his condo last year. ``Other people encountered \n     problems where maybe it's student loans or credit cards or \n     car payments,'' he said, ``and we have none of that.''\n       The couple put 20% down on their new home, which cost \n     $579,000. Ms. Stoll works as a client associate for a large \n     financial services company.\n       Growth in new home sales this year will depend, in part, on \n     whether builders revive their interest in first-time buyers.\n       Two years ago, D.R. Horton Inc., the nation's largest home \n     builder, launched Emerald Homes, a luxury division. Last \n     year, the company rolled out Express Homes, a division that \n     pioneered no-frills housing for the entry-level market. Mr. \n     Krivanec, Quadrant's CEO, said he doesn't see a return to his \n     company's former model. There are enough people with good-\n     paying jobs in the area--at Boeing, Amazon and Microsoft--to \n     keep sales going, even it means building fewer homes. ``We \n     like where we're at,'' he said.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. So what we are hearing--basically what this article \ntells us--is if people's income is going down, they are not going to \nMacy's, they are not going to Target. Those stores are not hiring \nworkers or are getting rid of workers because the middle class does not \nhave the income it needs.\n  Here is a very important point. Within President Obama's recent \nbudget--by the way, I think the President's budget is beginning to move \nus in the right direction--there was a very interesting projection that \nunfortunately got very little attention. Here is the point: Over the \nlast 50 years GDP growth in the United States of America averaged about \n3.2 percent. What the President's budget is suggesting is that more or \nless over the next 10 years we are going to see 3-percent growth, 3-\npercent--2.7, 2.5, 2.3. For the rest of the decade, 2.3 percent.\n  The bottom line is, if we continue along the same type of economic \ngrowth we have had over the previous 50 years, unemployment would be \nsubstantially lower, people would be paying more taxes, Social \nSecurity, among other programs, would be in much stronger shape.\n  The debate we are going to be having in the Budget Committee--I am \nthe ranking member of the Budget Committee--are two very different \nphilosophies. Our Republican friends believe in more austerity for the \nmiddle class and working families. Their goal, over a period of months \nand years, is to cut Social Security, cut Medicare, cut Medicaid, cut \nnutrition programs for hungry children, not invest in infrastructure, \nand then give huge tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires.\n  In other words, more austerity for the middle class, tax breaks for \nthe wealthy and large corporations. I believe that philosophy is wrong \nfor many reasons, the most important being that if we want to grow the \noverall economy, if we want to create jobs, we have to put money into \nthe hands of working people. We do not do that by cutting, cutting, \ncutting, and imposing more austerity on people who already desperately \nare hurting.\n  A far more sensible approach is to create the millions of jobs that \nour country desperately needs by, among other things, investing heavily \nin our crumbling infrastructure. Last week I introduced legislation \nthat would invest $1 trillion over a 5-year period into rebuilding our \ncrumbling roads and bridges, rail, airports, water systems, wastewater \nplants.\n  If we do that, we make our country more productive, safer, and create \nup to 13 million jobs, putting money into the hands of working people. \nIt not only will improve their lives, but they will then go out and \nspend their money in their communities, creating further economic \ngrowth. That is the direction we should be going.\n  We also have to raise wages. People cannot survive on the starvation \nminimum wage imposed at the Federal level of $7.25 an hour. If we raise \nthe minimum wage over a period of years to $15 an hour, we are going to \nhave billions of dollars go into the hands of people who need it the \nmost, improve their lives, allow them to go out and invest in our \neconomy, spend money and create jobs.\n  We need pay equity for women workers. It is not acceptable that women \nare making 78 cents to the dollar for men who are doing the same work. \nWe need to address the scandal of overtime right now, where we have so-\ncalled supervisors at McDonald's who work 50, 60 hours a week, but \nbecause they are so-called supervisors do not get time and a half.\n  We need to make college affordable for all of our workers. In a \nglobal economy we need the best educated workforce in the world, not \nthe one where people cannot afford a higher education. We need trade \npolicies that benefit working people and not just large multinational \ncorporations, which is why we should defeat the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership.\n  So there is a lot of work that needs to be done. But the bottom line \nis, if we are serious about dealing with the deficit and debt \nreduction, if we are serious about growing the middle class, we need an \nagenda which creates jobs, raises wages, makes college affordable, \ndemands that corporate America start investing in this country and not \nin China.\n  We need a proworker agenda, not an austerity agenda which will \nstrangle the middle class of this country even more than it is hurting \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Vermont for what \nhe has said. I would note that there are many in our State who agree \nwholeheartedly. We are not a wealthy State. We are a proud State. We \nare not a State that believes in such a huge disparity of income. So I \nthank the Senator for what he said, not only here but when he has made \nsimilar remarks around the country.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy pertaining to the introduction of S. 356 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/04/senate-section/article/S752-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S752-S755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yesterday our friends across the aisle \nblocked--filibustered, really--a $40 billion funding bill that would \nhave paid the funds necessary to keep the Department of Homeland \nSecurity running through the rest of this fiscal year. I understand \nthey had some differences over the content of the legislation the House \npassed, but it is undeniable that the House acted responsibly by \npassing this appropriations bill, particularly at a time of heightened \nsecurity concerns not only here at home but around the world.\n  Of course, the part that I guess confused me the most is our \nDemocratic friends said: Well, we don't want to debate the bill, but \nwhat we want is a clean DHS appropriations bill. So they wanted to get \nto the end of the process without even starting the process, which \nstrikes me as odd.\n  As I pointed out last week during the Senate debate on the Keystone \nXL Pipeline, Senator Durbin from Illinois, the assistant minority \nleader, spoke very sincerely in support of a process surrounding that \nbill. We didn't all agree that the Keystone Pipeline should be passed, \nbut we did at least have an open amendment process that allowed \neveryone to express their point of view and to get votes on amendments, \nup or down, before concluding that piece of legislation. I think the \nmost notable part of that was that we actually had more votes in the \nSenate during the 3 weeks we were on the Keystone XL Pipeline than we \nhad all of last year under the previous management.\n  So it was amazing to me to see that the Democratic leadership--the \nSenate minority--worked so hard to marshal their caucus together to \nblock debate on this $40 billion appropriations bill to fund the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, especially considering the\n\n[[Page S753]]\n\npromise of the Senator from Illinois to continue to work with us to \nfoster an open debate process and an open opportunity on both sides of \nthe aisle to offer good ideas and to put them up for a vote on how to \nimprove legislation.\n  It was also amazing to see this outcome considering what so many of \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle said last fall when the \nPresident made his Executive action on immigration.\n  As I said yesterday--and I want to repeat it again--we are not upset \nwith people who are seeking a better life in the United States. All we \nare asking for is a legal process. We are very upset with the President \nviolating his oath of office and purporting to make unconstitutional \nExecutive orders. That is the problem. That is what the House is \nfocused on like a laser.\n  In fact, this President's actions were a stunning display of \nExecutive overreach. You don't have to take my word for it; take his \nword for it--at least the first 22 times he talked about it. He said he \ndidn't have the authority to do it 22 different times.\n  Then there is the view of some of our colleagues in the minority. For \nexample, the senior Senator from West Virginia put it simply last \nNovember when he expressed, I think, the feeling of a lot of Democrats \nwhen he said, ``I wish he wouldn't do it.''\n  This was echoed also in a very straightforward manner by the very \njunior Senator from Minnesota, who said, ``I have concerns about \nexecutive action.'' Of course, it is easy to understand why because \nthis is a uniquely legislative responsibility. The President doesn't \nhave authority to make laws on his own--at least that used to be his \nposition.\n  Then the senior Senator from Missouri said of the President's \nunilateral action: ``How this is coming about makes me uncomfortable, \n[and] I think it probably makes most Missourians uncomfortable.'' Well, \nthe public opinion polls I have seen bear that comment out, that while \nmany people think we do need to fix our broken immigration system, the \nmajority of people in the public opinion polls I have seen disagree \nwith the way the President has tried to act by doing this \nunilaterally--or purporting to do it unilaterally.\n  Well, I have good news for Senator McCaskill, Senator Franken, and \nSenator Manchin. The House of Representatives has actually passed a \npiece of legislation that addresses their concerns and should give them \nsome comfort.\n  The legislation on which we are trying to open debate fully funds, as \nI said, the Department of Homeland Security while reining in the \nPresident's unconstitutional actions. This is one of the tools \navailable to Congress--using these legislative riders on appropriations \nto in effect express disapproval and defund certain acts by the \nExecutive. That is one of the tools we have available to us.\n  I will renew my request from yesterday to Senator Reid, the \nDemocratic leader, and ask the assistant minority leader to honor his \ncommitment that he made when we were debating the Keystone XL Pipeline. \nPlease work with us to achieve at least debate on the floor, if not \nsome significant legislation. But to just throw a fit and say ``We \nrefuse to even start debate on the legislation'' strikes me as more of \na political move than a legislative solution.\n  So I would ask my friends on the other side of the aisle, who so \nboldly stood up to express their concerns with the President's \nExecutive actions only a few short months ago, to again stand up--this \ntime to their own leadership--and to join us in reining in the \nPresident's Executive overreach and to not hold hostage the $40 billion \nthe House has appropriated to help fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity through the end of the fiscal year, through September 31.\n  If there are parts of the House bill you don't like--and there are \nparts of the House bill that I have concerns over and that I hope we \nhave a chance to vote on, but that is the way the House and the Senate \nare supposed to relate to one another. The House passes legislation, \nthe Senate passes legislation, and if they are different, then they get \nreconciled in a conference committee or through a ping-pong back-and-\nforth before they go to the President. But to throw a fit and say ``We \nrefuse to do our job of legislating'' just because they don't like \nwhere we are starting is extraordinarily counterproductive and is an \nunfortunate return to the dysfunction I believe the voters repudiated \nin their vote on November 4. So we will see whether there is a \ndifferent point of view.\n  I know the majority leader, Senator McConnell, will come back to the \nfloor and ask to reconsider the vote from yesterday, and so there will \nbe another opportunity for our friends across the aisle to reconsider \ntheir vote blocking even beginning considering this legislation. I hope \nthey will reconsider and join us and try to come up with a consensus \nsolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I wish to follow up on what the majority \nwhip has been talking about.\n  Clearly the country is and should be concerned by the President's \nunilateral Executive action on immigration. He announced this action on \nNovember 20 of last year. The majority whip has already gone down that \nlist of a number of our colleagues on the other side who said this is \nthe wrong way to do this. The House happens to agree. In fact, the \nHouse of Representatives has passed legislation that agrees that this \nis the wrong way to do it and try to come up with a remedy.\n  Frankly, there is a better remedy. We are not going to find that \nbetter remedy if we don't have a debate. We are not going to find that \nbetter remedy if we don't come to the floor and say: Here is how we \nthink that bill should be changed.\n  The action taken last November by the President was clearly Executive \noverreach. It was an affront, I believe, to the rule of law, and it was \nan affront to the Constitution. Article II, Section 3 of the \nConstitution states that the President ``shall take care that the laws \nbe faithfully executed.'' That is the end of the quote right out of the \nConstitution. It couldn't be clearer--``shall take care that the laws \nbe faithfully executed.''\n  That is why we call the President the Executive. The President's job \nis not to make the law. The President's job is not to rule as a court \nwould on the law. The President's job is to execute the law. The \nquestion here is: Does the law matter or not? The question here is: \nWhat do we do when the House of Representatives has passed a spending \nbill that would allow the funding for the U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity for the rest of the fiscal year--between now and September \n30--which does try to stop President Obama's Executive amnesty plan?\n  It appears, if you can believe what you read that people have said, \nthat a substantial majority of the Senate agrees the President \nshouldn't have done what he did. So what is our obligation to try to \nundo that? The House has done their part by sending a bill over that \ndoes that.\n  The President himself said 22 times that he didn't have the authority \nto do what he eventually did. I guess this is one case where I agree \nwith the President 22 times. So if anybody is thinking I don't agree \nwith the President, here are 22 times I agree with the President--the \n22 times he said he couldn't do what he eventually decided to do. And \nwhat was that? The President said he can't unilaterally change the \ncountry's immigration laws.\n  The President didn't have that authority the 22 times he said he \ndidn't have that authority. He didn't have that authority on November \n20, 2014, when he took actions that clearly were designed not to \nenforce the law, and he doesn't have that authority now. So the House \nsent a bill over that tries to clarify that the President doesn't have \nthat authority; that the legislative branch of the Federal Government \nis the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States. It \nis not whoever gets to act last.\n  Occasionally, the President will say: I am going to take Executive \naction if the Congress doesn't do its job. Well, the key point there is \nthat it is the job of the Congress to pass laws, not the job of the \nPresident. If the President wants to repeal the law, if the President \nwants to change the law, nobody is in a better position than the \nPresident of the United States to encourage the Congress and the \ncountry to do\n\n[[Page S754]]\n\nthat. But that doesn't mean the President has the default option, if \nthe Congress doesn't act by some certain date, to just do it himself. \nThat is not in the Constitution. The President is not going to find it \nthere.\n  I continue to believe the House-passed Department of Homeland \nSecurity funding bill is the way to send a message to the President \nthat he can't act unilaterally; that there is a constitutional way to \ndo this. I have not given up on winning over six Democrats in the \nSenate. Everybody understands the importance of 60 votes in the Senate. \nThere are 54 Republicans, not 60, but there are more than six Democrats \nwho have said they didn't agree with what the President did. I think in \nall cases they have said they agree with the funding levels or they \nwould vote for the funding levels for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. It seems to me those two things come together pretty nicely \nhere. They get a chance, by debating this bill, to undo what the \nPresident did and to fund the Department of Homeland Security. So there \nare at least six Democrats who have said those are two different things \nthey are for, and this is a case where we get to do that.\n  We need to pass this House measure that ensures spending at an \nimportant time with critical needs of homeland security, but it also \nwould stop the President's illegal amnesty. We should not let that \nstand. We don't know where these legislative fights will wind up until \nwe have them. Maybe that is why no Democrat yesterday was willing to \nhave this debate, because maybe they do not know what happens if \nattention is called to the past positions they have had or the need to \nfund the Department of Homeland Security. But we don't know how these \nlegislative battles work out if we don't have them. I think we need to \nhave this one.\n  Leader McConnell said our first choice is to try to pass the House \nbill. If the law shouldn't be followed, then advocate that it be \nrepealed, advocate that it be changed, but don't advocate that it be \nignored. The ignore clause of the Constitution doesn't exist. There is \nno ability of the Executive to do that.\n  The United States is a nation founded on the rule of law. With every \ntrade agreement we enter into, with all our relationships with other \ncountries, and with people who come here, we talk about this being a \ncountry where you can look at the law and rely on the law itself--no \nmatter what your status. The President is to take care that the laws \nare faithfully executed. Yet President Obama repeatedly has found ways \nto circumvent the Congress by picking and choosing which laws he wants \nto enforce.\n  Take the case of the overwhelmingly complicated health care law, \nwhere the President is picking and choosing what dates the law is to be \ncomplied with, even though the law often has very clear other dates. \nThe President said: Well, I think there is a better date. This is a \nbill of which the President was a major advocate. He had a chance to \nput the dates in there and didn't.\n  I recently reintroduced the ENFORCE the Law Act to ensure the \nPresident can't just continue to blatantly not do what the law says has \nto be done. This is a bill I introduced in the last Congress, where it \npassed the House with a bipartisan vote, but we weren't allowed to vote \non it in the Senate. Apparently, there are a number of my colleagues \nwho think that not only are we no longer allowed to vote on bills, but \nnow it is even a bad idea if we debate a bill. That is what the vote \nwas yesterday--to debate the bill. It wasn't approving anything except \nto debate the bill. That is what we should be moving towards now so we \ncan fund this part of the government. The President complicated the \nfunding of this agency with his action last November.\n  The ENFORCE the Law Act permits the Congress, if the Congress \nbelieves the President isn't enforcing the law, to go to court--not to \nwait months and years for an aggrieved citizen to go to court with \ntheir own money and say he or she does not believe the government has \nthe authority to do something. This allows the Congress to go to court \nand to go early and let a judge decide if the law is being enforced as \nwritten or not.\n  The ENFORCE the Law Act would reestablish the proper limits of the \nexecutive branch. It would restore checks and balances. It would also \nprovide a defender of citizens who, in their own capacity, don't have \nto defend or fight the government by themselves if the Congress itself \nbelieves the President has taken authority that he doesn't have or is \nenforcing the law in a way that wasn't intended.\n  I think we have to stand up for the rule of law. I have joined in a \ncourt case supporting the State of Texas. Texas is suing the \nadministration over what they believe are all kinds of added expenses \nput on them by the President's power grab in deciding on his own which \nimmigration laws would be enforced and which won't be. Senator Cornyn, \nSenator Cruz, and I were signatories to this brief filed in December, \nand 24 House Members joined us, including the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, saying we agree with these States and that many \nresponsibilities have been placed on them because the President of the \nUnited States chose not to enforce the law as written.\n  Twenty-six States have now joined that lawsuit filed by the State of \nTexas, and I look forward to the conclusion of that suit because I \nthink the judge is likely to decide that, no, there isn't the \nselectivity of which laws you enforce that the President has applied \nhere, and there are great costs created for States as a result of that.\n  Every Senator in this Chamber has a constitutional obligation to curb \nthe unilateral Executive overreach. We have a chance to do that with \nthe bill that could be before us. We have a chance to do that with the \nbill the House has sent over. This whole issue goes to the very heart \nof the system of checks and balances in our country and reiterates the \nimportance of the Constitution and following the Constitution--adhering \nto the rule of law.\n  I would like to see us have a chance to do that, as this Department \nof Homeland Security funding bill should--and eventually, I am \nconfident, will--come to the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, it is good to follow my good friend, \nthe chairman of the Committee on Rules and Administration, on which I \nam ranking member. I don't agree with him, but he is a fine man.\n  Now, I rise to dispel attempts by the other side of the aisle to \ndodge responsibility for funding the Department of Homeland Security in \na responsible way. Here is what is happening. The rightwing of the \nRepublican Party is risking a Department of Homeland Security shutdown \nto get their way on immigration. They are saying: Take our hard-right \nstance on immigration or we won't fund national security.\n  Most Americans don't agree with that view. Most Americans are for a \nrational immigration policy. A large majority in this body--bipartisan, \nled by Senator McCain and myself--voted on that in 2013. But we have a \nsmall group, led by the junior Senator from Texas, who say: It is our \nway or we are going to shut down one of the premier agencies dedicated \nto our security.\n  As I said when I engaged in a colloquy with my good friend from \nTexas, our Republican colleagues have the majority. They can debate \nimmigration any time they want. In fact, we welcome that debate. We \nthink the American people are on our side. We are willing to have that \ndebate. We are eager to have that debate but not with a gun put to the \nhead not only of us but of the American people. Do what we, a narrow \nminority, want or we are going to shut down the Department of Homeland \nSecurity--at a time when security is of utmost importance given what \nhas happened around the world and what we just saw happen to the \nJordanian pilot yesterday.\n  This strategy makes no sense. The junior Senator from Texas is \nleading his party at best into a cul-de-sac, and at worst over a cliff. \nWe are not going to be taken hostage. If my good friend the majority \nleader, Senator McConnell, thinks that by bringing this bill up again \nand again it is going to change what happened yesterday, it is not. So \nwe are saying to the other side: Now that you have seen the vote, now \nthat you have shown Speaker Boehner that we can't pass his bill in the \nSenate, get real. I say get real, to my friend the majority leader and \nto the Speaker of the House.\n\n[[Page S755]]\n\n  Let's roll up our sleeves, and let's work out a Department of \nHomeland Security bill and pass it. Let's not hold that agency hostage. \nLet's not just renew them every couple of months. As the Secretary of \nDHS said yesterday, that is like getting a car and only giving it five \nmiles of gas at a time. It just doesn't work. So get real. Let's \nnegotiate a DHS spending bill.\n  I know our Senator from Maryland, the ranking member of the Committee \non Appropriations, and the Senator from New Hampshire, the ranking \nmember of the Subcommittee on Homeland Security of the Committee on \nAppropriations, are eager to sit down and pass a bill that we can all \nagree on in terms of funding Homeland Security, and then we can debate \nimmigration. Then we can debate immigration--but no hostage taking and \nnone of this bullying. None of this: If you don't do it my way, I am \ngoing to hurt a whole lot of innocent people. That didn't work in 2013 \nwhen Republican numbers plummeted after they tried to shut down the \ngovernment, and it won't work today.\n  We will not allow a government shutdown. We will not allow hostage-\ntaking. We will ask our colleagues to get reasonable, do things the way \nthey used to be done, debate each issue on the merits. They have the \nfloor. They can debate any issue they want and move forward.\n  I will say one other thing to my Republican colleagues: The junior \nSenator from Texas has you tied in a knot. I say that to Speaker \nBoehner as well: Speaker Boehner, the junior Senator from Texas has you \ntied in a knot. Now you are going to have to find a way to untangle it. \nWe will not be bullied. We will not be told we have to negotiate \nbecause you seek to hurt innocent people and hurt our security. We will \nmove forward.\n  So let me suggest the way to go forward: Let's put a good, clean \nHomeland Security bill on the floor. Let's make America secure. Then, \nseparately, we are happy to debate immigration to the Republican \nParty's heart's content, but let's stop this govern-by-crisis \nmentality, especially when national security hangs in the balance.\n  So I urge Speaker Boehner, I urge Senator McConnell to come to their \nsenses, end this wild goose chase and let us vote on a clean bill \nforthwith.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I wish to talk about the necessity of \nhaving an appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security \nand the fact that it is being held up over the issue of folks in the \nHouse of Representatives who do not want to appropriate money for the \nactions that the President has taken in trying to improve a \ndysfunctional immigration system. Holding up the funding for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security appropriations is absolutely \nridiculous, in the opinion of this Senator.\n  The fact is the clock is ticking because the funding runs out in just \na couple of weeks--February 27. What does the Department's name imply? \nKeeping the homeland secure.\n  In one regard, that means cyber attacks. Doesn't it occur to someone \nthat we have had an extraordinary number of cyber attacks recently? \nMost everybody will remember Sony. People were attacking us because \nthey wanted to stop the expression of free speech, in this case with \nregard to a movie the Sony company had produced. Because they got in \nand got all of the personal data and were manipulating the internal \ncontrols of the company with this cyber attack, it is the Department of \nHomeland Security that is charged. Hopefully, if we can ever pass a \ncyber security bill that can be signed into law, the portal through \nwhich the early warnings will come will be the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. By the way, that cost the Sony corporation about $100 \nmillion.\n  How about what happened to all of the customers of Target: Addresses, \nphone numbers, and e-mail addresses were taken from 70 million \nAmericans who were customers of Target.\n  How about Yahoo: Passwords and user names were exposed to cyber \nattacks.\n  How about eBay: Users' passwords, because of a cyber attack, had to \nbe changed because they were compromised.\n  How about a number of major banks, including JPMorgan Chase: Seventy-\nsix million households and seven million small businesses' accounts \nwere affected by the attack.\n  How about Home Depot: Six million accounts were put at risk.\n  That ought to be enough to continue the funding of the Department of \nHomeland Security, but there is a lot more.\n  Most folks understand that TSA, which checks us as we go through the \nsecurity at airports, at seaports--TSA is a part of the Department of \nHomeland Security. Are we going to cut off the funding for TSA--TSA \nthat is now trying to stop the new kind of attacks with nonmetallic \nexplosives?\n  Remember, because of our intelligence apparatus, working through \nliaison partners in other countries, about 2 years ago a cartridge in a \nprinter was discovered ultimately going onto an airplane that was bound \nfor the United States--that was a nonmetallic explosive. We were \nfortunate we got that, but they continue.\n  These folks who are trying to attack us all over the world are trying \nvery ingenious ways to avoid the security, and we rely on TSA--\nespecially at American airports--to protect us.\n  We simply in a couple of weeks can't afford for the appropriations to \nstop.\n  How about immigration, U.S. Customs and Border Protection: Again, \nanother responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security, and we \nare going to cut off the funding on what kind of folks are coming \nacross our borders and what kind of folks we are going to be checking \nand rechecking and what kind of things they are bringing into the \nborders.\n  There are a lot of people who want to get into this country to do us \nharm. That is the responsibility of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  So it is not only ridiculous to this Senator, it is almost silly. But \nthe problem is it is tragic, and it could be horrendous given the fact \nthat people around the world are trying to harm us as we try to protect \nourselves in our national security every day.\n  This is a debate we should not be having. Unfortunately, it is a \ncondition our politics have come to, and we need to stop that \ncondition.\n  I leave the Presiding Officer on a happier note. As the Senate goes \ninto recess at the conclusion of my remarks, happily all of the \nSenators are going to a bipartisan luncheon where we are going to talk \nabout things we can do together. Indeed, that is the happiest thing I \nhave heard today.\n  Madam President, as I yield the floor, I understand that pursuant to \nthe previous order, the Senate will stand in recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/04/senate-section/article/S755-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 2:45 p.m. be equally divided in the usual form, with Senators \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I come to the floor in my position as \nthe vice chair of the Appropriations Committee to urge the Senate to \npass a clean Homeland Security appropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S756]]\n\n  Yesterday the Senate rejected a procedural vote to take up the House \nHomeland Security funding bill. This is not about debating the weeds \nover this bill versus that bill. There are two distinct differences. \nThe House bill has the funding for fiscal year 2015 in it that would \ntake care of every single agency under the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to defend and protect the Nation, but at the same time it is \nloaded with five immigration riders that we call poison pill riders \nbecause the President said if legislation to fund Homeland Security \npasses with these five immigration riders, he will veto the bill.\n  The President wants to fund an appropriations bill, and so do I. The \nHouse Homeland Security bill, if taken up by the Senate, would simply \nbe a delaying tactic. We would talk, we would debate, we would offer \nlots of amendments on immigration, and after we got lots of amendments \non immigration it might go to the President. The President would veto \nit, and it would come back, and after all is said and done, more would \nget said than gets done. We have to pass the funding for the protecting \nof the homeland.\n  Yesterday the entire world was gripped with poignancy and sorrow \nabout the ghoulish murder of a Jordanian pilot. The threat of terrorism \nis in the world--attacks by ISIL on people, the possibility of a lone \nwolf in our own country, a cyber attack in retaliation because we dare \nfight back against ISIL or because we are willing to challenge some of \nthe other international predators directed at us. We have to protect \nthe United States of America. That is what the Department of Homeland \nSecurity does. The Department of Defense protects us over there; the \nDepartment of Homeland Security protects us here.\n  After 9/11--one of the worst days in our country's history--the \nCongress came together, and we passed legislation to create the \nDepartment of Homeland Security so we could take every agency that was \ninvolved in protecting the homeland and put them under one umbrella so \nthey could look out for us. Now we need to look out for them. Every day \nwe ask men and women to serve in the Coast Guard, in the Secret \nService, in the Border Patrol protecting our borders, in Customs making \nsure fraudulent products such as counterfeit drugs are not crossing our \nborders into our country. Now we need to pass that bill. We need to \nmake sure we do not have a shutdown or a slamdown when the funding \nexpires on February 27.\n  In December when I chaired the committee, in the closing hours of the \npast Congress, I worked with my subcommittee chairman, Senator \nLandrieu, the vice chairman of homeland security, Senator Coats, and we \nput together a crucial funding bill that totalled $46 billion to invest \nin agencies that protect us. It was $1 billion more--$1 billion--than \nthe continuing resolution. We could have taken up that bill then, but \nthere was a desire, because of controversy over the President taking \nExecutive actions on immigration, not to do it. So now here we are in \nFebruary. Now it is our time to fund a clean Homeland Security bill.\n  Immigration is a serious policy issue. I don't dispute that. It \ndeserves serious debate. But don't add it as a series of riders on the \nfunding bill; rather, let's take up immigration separately.\n  I remind our colleagues that in the last Congress this Senate passed \na comprehensive immigration bill, only to have it die in the House. So \nwe say let's pass our bill again, let's have the House take it up, and \nlet's have a real debate on it, but in the meantime, we will have \nfunded the Homeland Security bill.\n  This isn't Barb Mikulski talking about more government spending. \nEvery past head of the Department of Homeland Security has urged the \nSenate to pass a separate bill. Tom Ridge, the original chief executive \nof this agency; Michael Chertoff, who also served under President Bush; \nand Janet Napolitano are calling for it, and so am I.\n  Right now our Coast Guard is out there safeguarding our waterways. We \nin Maryland just love our Coast Guard. We love them because, No. 1, \nthey are always there for search and rescue; No. 2, they are always \nthere to protect our bay. Whether it is against a possible oilspill or \ndrug dealers trying to sneak up the bay, they are there. We also know \nhow brave they were. We all recall how, with helicopters, they went in \nand rescued people during the horrific Hurricane Katrina, and they do \nit every day.\n  Then there is the Secret Service. The Secret Service is in the \nprocess of reforming itself. They need to protect the President, the \nVice President, the First Families. But you know what--they are also \nout there being the government G-men, fighting things such as credit \ncard fraud.\n  Then there are the cyber warriors protecting our critical \ninfrastructure--our banking, our power grid.\n  Then there is FEMA, which right now is responding to disasters, \nwhether it is a blizzard or a hurricane.\n  Then there are State and local responders. One of the programs I am \nso proud of in the Department of Homeland Security is the Fire Grant \nProgram. The Fire Grant Program is a competitive grant program--not an \nearmarked program, a competitive grant program--where local fire \ndepartments, particularly those in our rural communities, can apply for \na grant to buy the necessary equipment they need to protect them so \nthey can protect us.\n  I know the Presiding Officer is familiar with this in Nebraska. \nTurnout gear for a firefighter--the respiratory equipment to protect \ntheir breathing, the telecommunications, the fire-retardant/repellent \nmaterial--can cost as much as $1,000 to $2,000 per firefighter. They \ncannot do this with pancake breakfasts. They cannot do it with fish \nfries and chicken dinners. They need the help of their own government \nto help them.\n  So I say let's pass a clean Homeland Security bill. Let's stop \nterrorist threats. Let's secure our borders. Let's safeguard our \nwaterways. Let's make sure we are protecting our homeland and move to a \nclean bill.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided between the \nparties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I was very pleased to hear the ranking member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Mikulski, who has done such great work on the \ncommittee in putting together the bipartisan agreement that was \nnegotiated last December with the chairman of the House Appropriations \nCommittee, Congressman Rogers. That was a bill which, as the Senator \npointed out, funded the efforts of the Department of Homeland Security \nto keep people safe, to address emergencies, to try to protect us from \ncyber security threats--a whole range of efforts at the Department.\n  I want Senator Mikulski to hear a comment that I understand was made \nby the House Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee chairman \nJohn Carter, who is a Republican from Texas. When he was asked about \nwhat the outcome of this debate would be on funding the Department of \nHomeland Security, his comment was, ``Ultimately, there may be a clean \nbill.''\n  Well, I say to Senator Mikulski, if the House Republicans and the \nchair of the subcommittee in the House are acknowledging that \nultimately there may be a clean bill to fund the Department to do what \nwas negotiated by you and Congressman Rogers last December, doesn't it \nmake sense that we should get a clean bill done as soon as possible so \nthere is certainty for the Department of Homeland Security so they can \ncontinue the planning efforts and they can continue to address the \nthreats to our national security? Shouldn't we just get this done now \nand stop this ideological fighting and putting at risk people of this \ncountry because somebody has an ideological concern about this bill?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. First of all, I thank the Senator for bringing \nRepresentative Carter's comments to my attention. I absolutely agree \nwith the Senator's analysis and also with the comments by \nRepresentative Carter. We\n\n[[Page S757]]\n\nshould have a sense of urgency in passing the Homeland Security bill. \nThe terrorists and the bad guys--whether they are organized crime \ntrying to get across our borders, whether they are the terrorists \nwatching us--they are saying: Hey, they are so busy fighting each \nother, they don't have time to think about fighting us. They are \nwatching us and laughing at us because while we squabble and quibble \nand dribble, they are out there plotting against us.\n  I say to the ranking member of the subcommittee, I do think there is \na sense of urgency.\n  I also wish to comment on the House. When we were working in the \nclosing hours on the actual money part of the bill, I found remarkable \nbipartisan consensus. Left to our own analysis about how to be wise \nstewards of the taxpayer dollars for important security investments, \nthere was wide bipartisan agreement. There may have been a different \npriority here or there, but by and large we knew exactly which public \ninvestments to make. And you know what--we did it within the caps, we \ndid it within the allocation, and we got the job done.\n  We could do this job this afternoon. I feel a great sense of urgency \nbecause while the bad guys are plotting against us, we are busy \nplotting how we can fight each other.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I certainly agree with the ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Committee. I will just point out that in \nthe last 2 days, we have heard from the Conference of Mayors, which has \nurged us to pass a clean bill to fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. We have heard from the emergency managers across this country \nwho are concerned about the risks of assistance for disaster relief and \nfor FEMA, and today we got a letter from the National Association of \nCounties urging the passage of a clean bill to ensure that the safety \nof our communities can be maintained.\n  As the Senator said, we should not put these communities at risk, the \nefforts that are going on across this country to keep the Nation safe, \nbecause there are those people who are angry at the President about an \nExecutive action. We can have that debate, but we should have that \ndebate separately. We need to fund the Department of Homeland Security \nnow to ensure that there are no risks to our citizens.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski and the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, yesterday I spoke about the importance of \nvoting yes to proceed to the Department of Homeland Security \nappropriations bill for 2015, H.R. 240. That motion was unsuccessful. \nDespite all the voices from the other side of the aisle expressing \nsupport for the Department of Homeland Security, they refused to \nactually proceed to debate the bill.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle have expressed concern that \nthe bill is not 100 percent of what they want. In my experience, it is \nrare for anyone to get 100 percent of what they want when it comes to \npassing legislation, and that is certainly true when it comes to \npassing an appropriations bill. I am not talking about a vote on final \npassage or even a vote on amendments. I am talking about a vote to \nproceed to the debate on this bill. In addition to having the \nopportunity to offer amendments, an important part of the debate on a \nbill is the ability of any Senator to raise a budget point of order.\n  My counterpart, the distinguished ranking member of the Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations Subcommittee, has pointed out that there are \nbudget points of order against the bill. But the point I would make is \nthat in order for her to raise the budget point of order, you have to \nactually proceed to the bill.\n  I am certainly willing to acknowledge her budget points of order, \nwhich she brought up on the floor yesterday, but the point I am making \nis we have to proceed to the bill in order to debate those budget \npoints of order and, in fact, vote on them.\n  The minority refuses to move to the bill because they object to the \namendments added by the House of Representatives. The House went \nthrough its process, and now it is time for the Senate to go through \nits process. That is how the system works. That is regular order.\n  Last week, after the consideration of many amendments, we passed the \nKeystone XL Pipeline bill with a bipartisan vote of 62 Senators. There \nwere rollcall votes on 41 amendments.\n  Since I introduced the Keystone bill, I would have thought it would \nhave been great if we could have just passed it with an up-or-down \nvote, but that is not how the Senate is designed to legislate. Instead, \nwe vote to proceed to a bill so we can debate it, offer amendments, and \nwork to develop consensus.\n  I am aware that it has been a long time since we had regular order in \nthe Senate. We are not used to bringing a bill to the floor and \ndebating amendments. But instead of embracing regular order, something \nwe were denied in the previous Congress, we can't even proceed to \ndebate and offer amendments on this bill--an important bill that we \nneed to take up and address.\n  The contents of H.R. 240 represent the bipartisan prerogatives and \npriorities of Congress. Again, the House went through its process. What \nwe are asking for now is for the Senate to do the same--to go through \nthe process, go to the bill, and do the work we were sent here to do.\n  I discussed the merits of the bill at length earlier, but I will go \nthrough some of the highlights again just to remind my colleagues what \nis in the bill and why we are here. This bill will support the economic \nprosperity, public safety, and security of the American people.\n  This bill provides $39.67 billion in net discretionary \nappropriations, plus $6.4 billion in disaster funding. That includes \n$10.7 billion for Customs and Border Protection, CBP, and that is an \nincrease of $119 million over fiscal year 2014. It supports record \nlevels of personnel, tactical infrastructure technology, and air and \nmarine assets.\n  The bill provides $5.96 billion for Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, ICE. It maintains a record 34,000 adult detention beds and \n3,828 family detention beds.\n  The bill provides strong support for the Secret Service, an \norganization that requires congressional oversight, given some of the \nrecent incidents, and is $81 million above fiscal year 2014 funding.\n  The bill provides the funding necessary to construct the National Bio \nand Agro-Defense Facility, NBAF, in Manhattan, KS.\n  It provides more than $10 billion for the Coast Guard, including the \n8th National Security Cutter, and takes a serious step to address the \nnear-term, heavy-ice breaker needs with $8 million for preserving the \nship Polar Ice.\n  The bill supports our cyber security efforts, both protecting \ngovernment operations and working with the private sector to share \nthreat information and protective measures.\n  Since homeland security is a national effort, the bill provides \ncontinued funding for grant programs to State and local firefighters, \nemergency managers, and law enforcement.\n  The bill also provides for research and development, TSA's aviation \nsecurity screening operations, the Federal Law Enforcement Training \nCenter, and E-Verify, which supports businesses across the United \nStates in hiring legal workers.\n  Finally, the bill provides a requested $7 billion for the Disaster \nRelief Fund to assist with recovery costs for communities when they are \nhit by natural disasters.\n  What the bill does not fund is the President's Executive actions. The \nHouse bill includes several amendments that are targeted at reversing \nthe President's actions and articulating priorities for immigration \nenforcement. If that is concerning to my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle, then allow us to proceed to the bill so we can debate \nthese important issues.\n  We have returned to regular order in this Chamber, and with that \ncomes the responsibility to debate, offer amendments, and vote on \nlegislation. That is\n\n[[Page S758]]\n\nwhat we are asking to do, and that is what we are calling on our \ncolleagues to do. That is what the American people want us to do. That \nis what we are here to do.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of proceeding to H.R. 240 so we \ncan do our work.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, will my colleague from North Dakota, the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Homeland Security, yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I will.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I appreciate the work my colleague has done on this \nfunding bill, and I think we certainly agree on the funding that is in \nthe bill. That is not what the debate we are having is about.\n  I ask the Senator from North Dakota if he has heard the comments of \nChairman John Carter of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on \nHomeland Security, a Republican from Texas, who said: ``Ultimately, \nthere may be a clean bill.''\n  If the House is acknowledging that ultimately we may have a clean \nbill to fund the Department of Homeland Security, doesn't it make sense \nthat we would move forward to get this funding done, and we would make \nsure there is certainty to address the risks facing this country?\n  We can debate immigration. I don't think there is anybody on the \nDemocratic side who doesn't want to have an immigration debate. We are \nhappy to have it. But we should have that as a separate debate. As the \nRepublican majority knows, they control the debate in the Senate. So \nthey can decide to bring up an immigration bill as soon as we pass \nfunding for the Department of Homeland Security. So I hope, as the \nHouse suggests, ultimately there is going to be a clean bill and that \nwe would pass it as soon as possible to provide certainty and then move \non to debate the other issues facing this country.\n  I ask my colleague from North Dakota if he has spoken to the chairman \nof the House Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee, and does he \nshare his view that ultimately there may be a clean bill?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to respond to the question of \nmy counterpart on the Subcommittee on Homeland Security in the Senate, \nand I want to begin by acknowledging and stating again that I enjoy \nworking with her. We have worked together on other committees and other \nissues, and I think there will be other issues we will work on \ntogether.\n  I am pleased to have this discussion with her because this is exactly \nthe kind of debate we are asking for. We are asking to proceed to this \nbill so we can debate and, in fact, offer amendments. So what we are \nsaying is--whether it is our colleagues on the House side or whether it \nis Members of the Senate--let's follow regular order, have the \ndiscussion, have the debate, offer amendments, and see where we end up.\n  Now, I believe the President's actions exceeded his authority in \nregard to his Executive order regarding immigration. Let's have that \ndebate. Let's go to the bill so we can actually do the work we were \nsent here to do, where we discuss, debate, and offer amendments. If my \nesteemed colleague feels there is an amendment she should offer that \nwould change this bill to bring it in line with the opinions of House \nMembers or other Members of the Senate, then she will have the \nopportunity to do that, as will her colleagues, as will we. That is the \npoint.\n  So the answer to the question is: We don't know where we end up if we \ndon't get started. So let's get started. That is what we are saying. \nPlease join with us. Just as in our committee, we will have many \ncommittee meetings where we will debate issues and where we will take \namendments from our fellow Senators who are on that committee. But we \ncan't do that if we don't bring the bill to the committee and get \nstarted. That is what we are asking to do on the Senate floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I point out to my colleague that Senator \nMikulski and I have introduced a clean bill that addresses funding for \nthe Department of Homeland Security.\n  The fact is we find ourselves in this situation on the appropriations \nbill because of the riders that were attached by the House of \nRepresentatives. Those riders defund immigration directives that were \nissued by the President last year.\n  Yesterday, the senior Senator from Texas suggested that Senate \nDemocrats don't want to debate immigration. In fact, we are happy to \ndebate immigration. In fact, this body, in 2013, passed a comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill with a very strong bipartisan vote.\n  The debate we are having today is about whether we are going to fund \nthe Department of Homeland Security. The bill that is before us raises \nconcerns about what is in the original clean bill that funds the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota and I were just discussing, Senate \nRepublicans control the Senate. If they want to vote on immigration \nmeasures, they can bring a bill that would do that to the floor by the \nend of this week because they control what we consider in the Senate. \nBut the issue that is before us today is whether we are going to fund \nthe Department of Homeland Security. This is an issue that is critical \nbecause right now our Nation faces serious national security and \nterrorism threats.\n  This bill is not about the President's Executive action; it is about \nwhether we are going to fund the Department of Homeland Security. Since \nwe have heard from so many of our Republican colleagues that they want \nto discuss immigration and border security, I spent some time yesterday \nspeaking about all of the important investments that a clean, full-year \nfunding bill for the Department of Homeland Security would make in our \nborder security. If we don't pass a clean funding bill, we will fail to \nmake significant upgrades to technology on the border. We will fail to \nfund expanded enforcement activities for immigration officers. If we \nare serious about border security, we should support a clean full-year \nbill to fund the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank the Chair.\n  I also think it is instructive at this time to note for the Record \nthat included in the Executive actions that Republicans are trying to \ndefund are provisions that increase border security, prioritize \nenforcement resources, and ensure accountability in our immigration \nsystem. The House bill that is before us today defunds--takes away the \nmoney--for the new policy of prioritizing criminals and national \nsecurity threats for removal from the United States. So one of the \norders that have been issued by DHS that Republicans want to defund \ndirects law enforcement officers to place top priority on removing \nnational security threats, convicted felons, gang members, and illegal \nentrants apprehended at the border.\n  The House bill also defunds increased and strategic border security.\n  Another one of the memos issued by DHS is on the Southern Border and \nApproaches Campaign, which establishes three joint task forces to \nreduce the terrorism risks to the Nation, combat transnational criminal \norganizations, and prevent the illegal flow of people and goods along \nour border. So that is another part of this legislation our colleagues \nwant to defund.\n  It doesn't make sense, if we are concerned about border security, \nthat we would want to pass a bill that includes measures to defund \nthese efforts.\n  I understand my time has expired. I certainly hope everybody \nunderstands what the bill before us, which includes those five House \nriders, would actually do.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to respond to some \nof the points made by the Senator from New Hampshire. She indicated \ndefunding provisions, but understand that this relates to Executive \naction undertaken by the President. The very same prioritization in \nterms of enforcement is funded in the underlying bill\n\n[[Page S759]]\n\nfor enforcement of immigration law. Those prioritizations are there.\n  The other point I wish to make is that the Senator speaks about \nfunding the Department of Homeland Security and their desire to fund \nthe Department of Homeland Security. That is exactly what this bill \ndoes. This bill fully funds the Department of Homeland Security. There \nreally is consensus between the House and the Senate that it does it \nvery well. That is what this bill does. It funds the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  So they are saying they want to fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. That is what this bill does, and that is why we have to \nproceed to it in order to accomplish full-year funding for DHS.\n  The third point I will make briefly is that the Senator referred to a \nbill that she is sponsoring with the Senator from Maryland to fund \nDHS--to fund the Department of Homeland Security--and she wants to \nproceed to that bill. Well, the way to do that is to vote with us to \nget on the bill before us--H.R. 240--and then they can offer that as an \namendment, and we will debate it and we will have the vote.\n  So if the Senator from New Hampshire wishes to have the opportunity \nto debate her legislation and vote on her legislation, then let's vote \nto invoke cloture on this motion to proceed, let's proceed to the bill, \nand we will allow our colleagues to offer amendments which we can \ndebate and vote on. We are offering the other side the opportunity to \ndo exactly what they have asked to do.\n  Most importantly, again, I wish to go back to the point I just made. \nThis bill fully funds the Department of Homeland Security for the full \nyear, and we are being blocked from going to the bill, debating the \nbill, allowing amendments on the bill, and getting to the final product \nfor the American people, while working with the House. Remember, we \nhave to produce a product that passes the House, too, to fund the \nDepartment of Homeland Security for this country.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to proceed to the motion to \nreconsider the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to \nH.R. 240.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 240.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to H.R. 240, making appropriations for the Department \n     of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2015.\n         Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, Richard Burr, Jerry Moran, \n           John Thune, Johnny Isakson, Marco Rubio, Roy Blunt, Pat \n           Roberts, Deb Fischer, John Boozman, David Vitter, Tim \n           Scott, Roger F.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to H.R. 240, an act making appropriations for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September \n30, 2015, and for other purposes, shall be brought to a close, upon \nreconsideration?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 53, nays 47, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 52 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--53\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Barrasso\n     Blunt\n     Boozman\n     Burr\n     Capito\n     Cassidy\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Cotton\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Daines\n     Enzi\n     Ernst\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Gardner\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Hoeven\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kirk\n     Lankford\n     Lee\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Paul\n     Perdue\n     Portman\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rounds\n     Rubio\n     Sasse\n     Scott\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Sullivan\n     Thune\n     Tillis\n     Toomey\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Baldwin\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Booker\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Coons\n     Donnelly\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Heller\n     Hirono\n     Kaine\n     King\n     Klobuchar\n     Leahy\n     Manchin\n     Markey\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n     Nelson\n     Peters\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Sanders\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall\n     Warner\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey).

Mr. President, I wish to make some remarks about the \nPresident's budget, which was presented to us on Monday of this week as \nhis annual proposal to Congress.\n  Given our country's enormous fiscal challenges and the results of the \n2014 midterm election, I think there was hope among many of us that the \nrelease of this budget would be an opportunity for the President to \nwork with us.\n  There was a lot of talk about working with Congress, working \ntogether. The message from the November 2014 election was that the \nAmerican people want Congress to get some things done. And by the way, \nwhat about the continuing deficit? Are we going to get back to this \ndraconian knife held over our throats, where the budget continues to \nput us in a position where debt and deficit continue to be the plague \nwhich is going to have enormous, negative consequences on the future of \nthis country?\n  Given these enormous challenges, there was really hope the President \nwith his last 2 years, would see as part of his legacy an opportunity \nto work together to put us on a sound fiscal path. But much like the \ncoach of the Seahawks on the 1-yard line, the President chose to make \nthe wrong call.\n  In this case, in my opinion--and I think the opinion of many--the \nright call would have been a plan that actually puts us on a path for a \nbalanced budget, addresses a skyrocketing mandatory spending burden and \nreforms our outdated Tax Code. These are, hopefully, ideas that both \nRepublicans and Democrats could agree on. They would be in our national \ninterest to move forward on. The time is now--with a Democratic \nPresident and a Republican Congress--to work together to achieve what \nRonald Reagan and Tip O'Neill agreed to and what Bill Clinton and Newt \nGingrich agreed to on welfare reform and on a number of other major \ninitiatives that had been undertaken in Congress with support from both \nparties. They could be addressed.\n  But instead of pursuing a path of consensus on these issues, the \nPresident comes forward with $2.1 trillion in additional tax increases \nover the next 10 years. Is there any end to the obsession the President \nhas for raising taxes on the American people?\n  All the debate at the end of the last cycle--the previous cycle \nbefore the last cycle--was over the fiscal cliff. Let's raise taxes on \nthe richest people in America and the high earners, and that will \naddress the problem of taxes. But we never could get to the spending \nissue.\n  So if you like government to just keep increasing: Send your tax \ndollars\n\n[[Page S760]]\n\nto Washington, and we will spend it. That seems to be what the \nPresident had to say. Rather than looking at the dire consequences of \nnot addressing these long-term problems, the President proposes to \nspend nearly $4 trillion in fiscal year 2016, a 7-percent increase from \nfiscal year 2015 and about $1 trillion more than what was spent in \n2008. The President wants to eliminate the very budget caps that his \nadministration proposed and he signed into law in 2011.\n  Well, it may be one thing to adjust those budget caps, particularly \nas it impacts our national defense and national security, but if that \nwas done in conjunction with a larger proposal to address this out-of-\ncontrol mandatory spending, wasteful spending, and unnecessary spending \nthat is taking place here in Washington, that would be one thing to \nconsider.\n  But this simply is just more of the same, going in the same \ndirection, proposing unbalanced budgets each year, and adding more and \nmore to our deficit and to our debt.\n  The President likes to talk about his veto pen and, with the release \nof this budget, we can only conclude that pen only contains red ink. \nThe President has taken a pass on the golden opportunity to move \nforward and work together. Instead, his budget takes us in the same \ndirection we have been going in the past 6 years without any proposal \nto address it in any kind of serious way. I think it is imperative that \nwe do that.\n  Just last week, the Congressional Budget Office released its latest \neconomic report and the findings were, once again, very sobering. This \nnonpartisan report warned that under current law our ``large and \ngrowing federal debt would have serious negative consequences, \nincluding increasing federal spending for interest payments; \nrestraining economic growth in the long term; giving policymakers less \nflexibility to respond to unexpected challenges; and eventually \nheightening the risk of a fiscal crisis.''\n  The CBO projects that the gross Federal debt is expected to raise \nanother $10 trillion over the next decade. The report also says that we \nwill spend down almost $800 billion of the Social Security Trust Fund \nover the next 10 years.\n  Ten years from now, it is projected that spending on mandatory \nprograms and interest on the debt will consume almost 94 percent of all \nFederal revenues, leaving far fewer funds for other important national \npriorities, such as strengthening our infrastructure, national defense, \nmedical research, education, and any number of issues that could be \ndealt with on a national basis that would affect the future of this \ncountry. But it will not be able to be done because we have not taken \nthese steps. Time is running out to make the tough fiscal choices now \nso future generations will not be saddled with an even higher burden of \ndebt.\n  I regret the President has yet to come forward with the serious \nintent of working with us to deal with one of our country's most \nchallenging and most pressing problems with creative solutions. We will \nonly be able to accomplish the results we need if we work together, as \nthe President has said. But it takes his engagement if we are going to \nsucceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. First, Mr. President, I commend my good friend, the \nSenator from Indiana, for his good work on laying out, with the Senator \nfrom Oregon, one approach on reforming the Tax Code and his willingness \nto look at this issue of our national debt.\n  Let me echo, at $18 trillion--he cited some statistics--interest \nrates go up 1 percent. That is more than $120 billion a year off the \ntop. That is more than we spend each year on the issues I am going to \nspeak to--the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The only issue I would raise with my friend is that we do need that \ngrand bargain. But no one who has looked at this problem hasn't said: \nYou are not going to solve it without revenues being part of the mix. \nYou have to do entitlement reform. But even with the so-called revenues \nfrom the fiscal cliff, let me just point out that we brought the \ncountry to the brink of unforeseen financial areas.\n  To raise $600 billion, well, in the past few years we have had \nunprecedented one-time revenues from the Federal Reserve north of $400 \nbillion, $200 billion-plus that CBO counts as revenue from paybacks of \nFannie and Freddie. We do not have the revenue streams. If we can get \nback to revenue streams from the late 1990s, revenue as a percent of \nour GDP, when the economy was booming and jobs were being created and \nthere was bipartisan collaboration, I think that, combined with \nentitlement reform--to make sure Social Security and Medicare are truly \nsustainable for the next 50 years--there is a path there and I thank \nthe Senator for his work.\n  Mr. COATS. If I could ask the Senator from Virginia to yield for a \nresponse without yielding the floor, and I will yield right back to \nhim.\n  I wish to say that the perception of the public is that this is a \npartisan issue. It is not. The Democratic Senator from Virginia has \ntaken a lead in this effort and committed an extraordinary amount of \neffort--only to come up short.\n  I have been privileged to work with him and a number of Members from \nthe other side of the aisle together with Republicans, and we see the \nneed to work together on this. We have lacked one thing. We have lacked \nsupport from the executive branch. Until we have that, I don't believe \nwe will be able to take serious steps forward in addressing this \nproblem.\n  But that is not something that can be defined as one party versus \nanother.\n  Most of us on both sides of this aisle have recognized the disastrous \npotential consequences of our not taking action. I appreciate the \ntremendous work the Senator from Virginia has done in leading this \neffort, and I know we both regret that we haven't achieved success.\n  I thank the Senator, and I yield back.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator for his comments. We might agree or \ndisagree on the role the President has played, but that still doesn't \nbeg the fact that we need to continue our efforts in this body and in \nthe body down the hall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/04/senate-section/article/S760-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S760-S761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the subject of our debate today is that it \nis wholly inappropriate that at this moment in time some in Congress \nare deciding that they are going to hold hostage Homeland Security \nfunding unless they get 100 percent of what they want.\n  I think immigration reform is a terribly important issue. I was proud \nto join in one of the broadest, bipartisan votes in the past few years \nto pass bipartisan immigration reform. I was disappointed when our \nfriends in the House didn't take up that legislation and pass it.\n  Subsequent to that failure to act on the part of the House, the \nPresident has acted--and I believe there are even folks here watching \nthese proceedings now who are beneficiaries of those Executive actions, \nsome of the DREAMers.\n  Now if this body wants to redebate immigration, that is a fair topic, \na fair subject. And I, for one, would welcome that full-throated debate \nagain. But it should not--it should not--be tied to a critical part of \nnational homeland security funding.\n\n  The remarkable thing is this is actually an area where both parties \ncame to agreement on the size of the budget and the program \nprioritization. There was an agreement. But instead, extraneous items \nwere added that now some are saying if we don't get these items we are \nwilling to roll the dice or potentially shut down the most essential \nparts of our government at a time of enormous international and \npotentially domestic challenge.\n  All of us, obviously, can come and speak about the unspeakable \ntragedies we saw reported coming out of the Middle East. We see as well \nchallenges that ISIL presents potentially--not just in that region but \nto the homeland and in terms of trying to encourage homegrown \nterrorists. The notion there would be Members of this body or any body \nwho would say it is okay to cut off funding to DHS at this moment in \ntime is remarkable.\n  The American people--as someone who just went through a refreshing \nreminder of what they are looking for through my last election \nprocess--do\n\n[[Page S761]]\n\nnot want us to legislate in this way. They want us to get things done. \nThey want us to actually find common ground. And on homeland security \nwe have made the hard choices on where the dollars ought to come from \nand where they ought to be prioritized.\n  But if the loudest voices get their way and hold this funding \nhostage, not only would it make our country more vulnerable to \nterrorist threats but a DHS shutdown would jeopardize our national \nsecurity by disrupting other important programs, such as grants to \ntrain local law enforcement and to protect our communities. And as many \nas 240,000 people responsible for frontline security--more than 80 \npercent of DHS employees--will still have to show up to work--they just \nwon't get paid for it. Many of them in the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n  This is a threat to the homeland, it is a threat to our law \nenforcement, it is a threat in terms of our ability to respond to \ncrises with FEMA, and there is threat even without those potential \ntragedies of the normal course of an American citizen as they pass \nthrough airports and other venues. Ultimately, for an agency that has \nbeen under some strain, these 240,000 people who are working hard to \nprotect our homeland have to provide for their families.\n  This is not the way this body should operate. I want to commend the \nmajority for trying to say we will bring back an open process. But the \nnotion that we will have a repeat of what we saw when we self-inflicted \ndamage upon this whole economy when we shut down the government a few \nyears ago because of an unwillingness of a few to compromise--if that \nis repeated now around homeland security, it would be a dreadful \nmistake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/04/senate-section/article/S761-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO FEDERAL EMPLOYEE ANTHONY REGALBUTO\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I come to the floor to continue a \ntradition that was begun by my esteemed former colleague, the former \nSenator from Delaware, Ted Kaufman. Senator Kaufman would come to this \nfloor from time to time to celebrate members of the Federal workforce \nwho exemplify excellence in public service. In that tradition I want to \nhonor a great Federal employee: CAPT Anthony Regalbuto.\n  Captain Regalbuto is a constituent of mine from Burke, VA. He \ncurrently serves as the Chief of the U.S. Coast Guard's Office of \nInternational and Domestic Port Security. But, in fact, Captain \nRegalbuto has spent his entire adult life in service to the Coast \nGuard, with 31 years on active duty and more than 12 years as a \ncivilian--a total of 43 years of service. In this role he has been \nresponsible for addressing the security weaknesses facing our Nation's \nports. He has also assisted other countries with improving the safety \nof their own ports.\n  More than 90 percent of the imported goods of the United States go \nthrough our ports. The security risks facing the ports are many, and \nworkers such as Captain Regalbuto help ensure they remain safe and \nsecure from threats. For our Nation's ports to remain safe, we must \nensure our foreign shipping partners follow established international \nport security requirements. So part of Captain Regalbuto's job is to \nmake sure foreign countries that want to conduct business using U.S. \nports adhere to these requirements.\n  Captain Regalbuto has developed a solution--a model code that \ncountries could use as a guide to strengthen their own laws to improve \nthe security of their ports. He also oversaw the creation of the \nMaritime Security Risk Analysis Model. It helps the Coast Guard analyze \nand address major port security weaknesses by measuring a variety of \nfactors. This risk analysis model has helped the Coast Guard evaluate \nmore than 30,000 potential targets and 100,000 attack scenarios across \nthe country.\n  Furthermore, this data has helped to efficiently allocate more than \n$2.7 billion in grants where they can best help improve port security \nand get the best bang for the taxpayer dollars.\n  CAPT Anthony Regalbuto is just one of many Federal employees. He also \nhappens to be a Federal employee who would potentially be affected by \nDepartment of Homeland Security funding, which is the current issue on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  One of the challenges, even as we move past this particular debate, \nis to make sure in these tight budget times--going back to the comments \nof the Senator from Indiana--that we husband our resources. We are \ngoing to have to do more with less. One of the things that is terribly \nimportant--as someone who has spent more time in business than I have \nin politics--if you want your workforce to do more, you find ways both \npsychically, monetarily, and through appropriate review to reward them.\n  Too often Members come to this floor and sometimes tend to demonize \nour Federal workforce. Too often over the past few years the Federal \nworkforce is the first to receive the cuts in funding. If we are going \nto make sure our country remains strong, we want to make sure folks \nsuch as Captain Regalbuto keep our ports and keep our homeland safe. We \nneed to recognize their service and, by all means, make sure we don't \nput in particular the DHS through another ill-fated, politically driven \ngovernment shutdown.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the House of Representatives has voted \nto fully fund homeland security, as the President has requested. It \nsent a bill to the Senate that fully funds all the lawful policies and \nprograms in homeland security. The bill will not deny a penny of \nfunding. In fact, it says, spend the money, but on enforcing the laws \nof the United States. Don't spend money undermining the laws of the \nUnited States. Don't spend money in violation of the laws of the United \nStates. Don't spend money in violation of the established policies of \nCongress, which rejected the President's ideas that he is now \nexecuting. And don't spend money in violation of the will of the \nAmerican people who overwhelmingly oppose the President's unlawful \nExecutive amnesty.\n  That is what we are talking about today, and my colleagues continue \nto suggest that somehow Republicans are not funding the Homeland \nSecurity Department. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  Our colleagues have now voted to block going to the bill. If they \ndon't like some of the provisions that came over from the House, well, \nlet's get on the bill and let's have some relevant amendments and let's \nvote on it. That is what Congress is about. That is the way we are \nsupposed to do business here.\n  But our colleagues have gotten spoiled. They think they can block \nanything and turn around and blame the Republicans for it and that \nsomehow everybody is going to agree with them.\n  Look, the American people get this. The President is not entitled to \nspend money to implement a system of immigration that Congress, \nrepresenting the American people, rejected. If our Democratic \ncolleagues are unhappy, then, as I said, they can offer amendments.\n  I feel it would be a stunning event if the Senate removes language \nfrom a bill that simply restores the separation of powers and prevents \nthe President from overreaching in violating the Constitution. But if \nthey want to bring up amendments that would allow the President to do \nthis activity, let's do it, let's bring it up, and let's vote on it. \nPerhaps they might win it. But I think it is untenable constitutionally \nand it is untenable legally, because it is contrary to the law and the \nwill of the American people.\n  My good friend Senator Schumer is one of our able Members of this \nbody. He spoke earlier today and he said: The\n\n[[Page S762]]\n\nright wing of the Republican Party is risking a DHS--Department of \nHomeland Security--shutdown to get their way on immigration. They are \nsaying: Take our hard right stance on immigration, or we won't fund \nnational security.\n  That is not so, Senator Schumer. Give me a break. Come on. You are \nblocking the bill. The House has voted to fund homeland security. It is \non the floor. We need to pass it, and we will give you an opportunity \nto offer your amendments if you are not happy with it. It is absolutely \nnot so that they are doing that.\n  So how is it being reported? Republicans frequently complain they \ndon't get fair reporting in the press, but let's look at this:\n  U.S. News and World Report, today: ``Senate Democrats Block Bill \nUndoing Immigration Actions.'' That is the headline, ``Undoing \nImmigration Actions.'' Those are President Obama's unlawful actions. So \nthey are defending his actions, not defending homeland security.\n  How about this one, USA Today: ``Democrats again block efforts to \nderail immigration order.'' The effort would derail the President's \nunlawful Executive amnesty--but it funds homeland security, as the \narticle makes clear.\n  Fox News: ``Senate Dems nix debate on Homeland Security bill, \nblocking it, in protest over immigration.''\n  Who is blocking the bill?\n  Politico: ``Democrats filibuster Department of Homeland Security \nbill.''\n  That is exactly what is happening. The bill has passed the House. It \nis on the floor. We are trying to bring it up. We are trying to have \ndebate. We are trying to have amendments. And they are blocking the \nbill--according to Politico, no rightwing publication.\n  The Washington Post: ``Senate Democrats block DHS spending bill \ntargeting Obama's immigration actions.''\n  The Atlantic. This is a good one. For those of us who have been \naround here a long time, and I think for reporters who cover it, this \nis really humorous, to have our Democratic colleagues, having \ncomplained for years about what Republicans do. This is the headline in \nthe Atlantic: ``The New Democratic Obstructionists.''\n  Here is the headline in the New York Times: ``Senate Democrats Block \nRepublicans' Homeland Security Bill.''\n  So I would say, colleagues, the American people know better. The \nmedia knows better. They know who is blocking this bill. They know that \nthe Congress of the United States--that the House of Representatives \nand the Senate is not required to fund any program it doesn't like.\n  It is absolutely not required, and it has a duty not to fund \nPresidential expenditures that are illegal. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity is provided funds to enforce the laws of the United States. \nThe President right now is taking money that was sent to Homeland \nSecurity to enforce laws and he is redirecting it and moving it over to \na building just across the river in Crystal City, hiring 1,000 persons \nto process applications of people illegally in the country and to \nprovide them the earned-income tax credit, which is a direct check from \nthe United States of America, provide them a Social Security number, \nthe right to participate in Social Security, legal status in the \ncountry, the right to work in the country, and participation in \nMedicare, when the law of the United States says if someone is here \nunlawfully, they cannot work. So that is what this is all about.\n  I just want to push back. I urge my colleagues--at least seven of my \nDemocratic colleagues have said they oppose President Obama's actions. \nWhen do they have a clearer chance to confront that action and \ndemonstrate with conviction that they meant what they said than on this \nvote?\n  It allows the bill to come forward. It allows us to have a vote. It \nallows anybody in the Senate to offer amendments that would be relevant \nto the bill. I feel strongly about that.\n  I see the Senator from New York. I think she was in line to speak \nbefore I was, and I was able to grab a few minutes. So I would just say \nthis. Colleagues, please review your position on this. Let's move to \nthis bill. Let's fund Homeland Security. Let's discuss and have \namendments and vote on the President's Executive order, and the one who \nwins the votes, so be it. That is the way the Congress of the United \nStates works.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to do \nthe right thing and pass a bill that would fully fund the Department of \nHomeland Security, without the politically driven riders that are the \nfocus of this debate.\n  Protecting our country from terrorist attacks should be our top \npriority in Congress and we should not be playing games with Homeland \nSecurity funding. That is the least our constituents expect of us. I \nknow that for many of my colleagues the question of immigration is a \nvery contentious one and an important one worthy of debate. We should \nhave that debate without risking the safety of our families by once \nagain putting an immigration bill on the floor of the Senate.\n  But this funding bill for such a vitally important part of our \nnational security is simply not the place for an ideological debate. If \nwe fail to pass and fund the Department of Homeland Security, the \nconsequences for our safety could potentially be devastating. Take for \nexample the Urban Areas Security Initiative. This is the program that \nhelps our cities pay for things such as surveillance equipment, secure \ncommunications systems, training for law enforcement personnel, all in \norder to increase our security and prevent terrorism. These grants \nensure that all of the places terrorists have targeted and will \ncontinue to target are able to effectively prevent those violent acts \nfrom happening.\n  New York City is my home State. It is the No. 1 terror target in the \nNation. It relies on the urban security program to keep its millions of \nresidents and tourists safe. It also relies on our Homeland Security \nnetwork to stop the plans of would-be terrorists.\n  Since 9/11, New York City has thwarted at least 16 terrorist attacks, \nand it has done so because of the constant support the Department of \nHomeland Security provides. If we cannot pass this bill, the Urban \nAreas Security Initiative and the extensive network of security systems \nin New York City would lose their funding, and every visitor to an \nurban area in this country, including right here in Washington, DC, \nwould be less safe.\n  If we cannot pass this bill, not only would our security suffer, but \nthe inspectors at our ports would not be paid, our security personnel \nwould not be paid, and our Border Patrol agents would not be paid. If \nwe don't pass this bill, then we have failed at our most solemn \nresponsibility, to keep the American people safe.\n  I urge all my colleagues to please put politics aside, vote to pass a \nbill free of divisive policy riders and fully fund the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the rest of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to pass \na clean Homeland Security funding bill for fiscal year 2015. This is an \nissue of national security, and we cannot allow politics to divert \nattention from our responsibility as Senators.\n  The majority in the House sent the Senate a bill with five poison \npills that they know will prevent the passage of this legislation. \nYesterday and again today, my Senate colleagues and I sent a clear \nmessage that these politically divisive immigration provisions have no \nplace in this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to dispense with any further delays and allow \nfor an up-or-down vote on the bill as originally drafted.\n  The Department of Homeland Security funding bill--created in the wake \nof 9/11, as Senator Durbin reminded us earlier--is not the place to \nlitigate immigration policy; rather, those issues are appropriately \naddressed in a comprehensive immigration bill, and I hope\n\n[[Page S763]]\n\nthe House will draft and vote on that type of legislation soon.\n  The recent executions of the Japanese and Jordanian hostages by the \nterrorist group ISIL and the attacks in Paris, Ottawa, and Australia \nserve as reminders of the very real threat we face.\n  Each day we delay in providing adequate, reliable resources to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, we undermine the Department's efforts \nto defend the home front. That is why I am calling on my colleagues to \ntake up and pass a clean bill.\n  My colleagues on the Appropriations Committee Senator Shaheen and \nVice Chairwoman Mikulski have introduced a clean DHS funding bill that \nreflects the bipartisan agreement reached between the House and Senate \nappropriators. This bill funds a wide range of programs that keep \nAmericans safe and secure.\n  For example, the clean version of this bill funds a host of \ncounterterrorism, intelligence, and security functions; investments in \ncyber security defense technologies and personnel, investments to \ndetect and protect against biological threats, research and development \nof nuclear detection technologies, TSA and Coast Guard operations to \nkeep our skies and our waters safe. The clean version also funds $6 \nbillion in disaster funds to help States, localities, businesses, and \nindividuals rebuild after a natural disaster, staffing nearly 24,000 \nCustoms and Border Protection officers who ensure legitimate travel of \nindividuals who seek to enter the country, and staffing 20,000 Border \nPatrol agents who protect the 6,000 miles of our land border and 2,000 \nmiles of coastal waters.\n  Department of Homeland Security Secretary Johnson has been clear that \nwhile the Department operates under the current CR, it cannot fund key \nhomeland security initiatives.\n  A short-term CR would prevent the Department from awarding new \ndisaster preparedness grants that support our local emergency \nresponders. It would delay the hiring of more investigators for cases \nrelated to human trafficking and smuggling. It would also prevent the \nSecret Service from training for the next Presidential election, and \nthe list goes on.\n  We cannot expect DHS to do long-term strategic planning with short-\nterm funding measures. The Department needs reliable funding to operate \nefficiently and effectively.\n  The House majority is unfortunately playing politics with our \nhomeland security because the President has taken an action that every \nPresident since the 1950s has taken: He has provided commonsense \ndirection to our immigration enforcement efforts.\n  The President's Executive actions on immigration are fundamentally \naimed at keeping families together, making our communities safer, and \nusing our resources efficiently. It is hard to understand how someone \ncould oppose that.\n  The President's actions will ensure that our immigration enforcement \nefforts are used to secure the border, prevent threats to national \nsecurity, and protect public safety. These should be our top \npriorities, and I support those efforts, but if Members of the House \ntake issue with them, they should draft and adopt immigration reform, \njust as the Senate did on a bipartisan basis 18 months ago.\n  Our path forward is simple: Pass a clean funding bill. If my \ncolleagues want to fix our broken immigration system, then let's take \nup a bill, but let's not use this critical funding bill to play \npartisan politics.\n  The dedicated men and women of the Department of Homeland Security \ndeserve better. The American people deserve better. Let's put aside \npolitics and let's pass a clean Department of Homeland Security funding \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee).

Mr. President, last night I had the honor of speaking \nat a bourbon event hosted by the Henry Clay Center for Statesmanship \nand the Kentucky Distillers' Association here in Washington, DC. This \nevent was for Kentuckians and by Kentuckians and featured the so-called \n``Bourbon Barrel of Compromise'' that had been delivered from Ashland, \nthe Henry Clay Estate in Lexington, KY. I would ask that my remarks at \nthat event last night be entered into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             [Feb. 3, 2015]\n\n              Leader McConnell's Remarks at Bourbon Event\n\n       Thank you, Robert [Clay, co-chairman of the Henry Clay \n     Center for Statesmanship].\n       It's a pleasure to be here to celebrate the spirit of \n     Kentucky--literally. Tonight we honor two of Kentucky's most \n     important gifts to the nation: the drink that is Bourbon \n     whiskey and the revered statesman Henry Clay. I'm glad to be \n     here to talk about both.\n       There are a lot of good Henry Clay stories, but let me \n     share one of my favorites--a story that demonstrates Clay's \n     sense of humor and quick wit.\n       On one occasion, a long-winded colleague of Clay's, \n     Alexander Smyth of Virginia, was giving a speech. He turned \n     to Clay in mid-speech and said disdainfully, ``You, sir, \n     speak for the present generation; but I speak for \n     posterity.''\n       Without batting an eye, Clay retorted, ``Yes, and you seem \n     resolved to speak until the arrival of your audience.''\n       Taking that wisdom to heart, I will be brief.\n       I want to thank the Henry Clay Center for Statesmanship and \n     the Kentucky Distillers' Association for hosting this grand \n     event--not only tonight's affair, but shipping a barrel of \n     Bourbon whiskey from Henry Clay's estate in Ashland to \n     Washington, DC, just as the Great Compromiser reportedly \n     often did some two centuries ago.\n       The history of Bourbon whiskey and the legend of Henry Clay \n     have long been intertwined. It is said that whenever Clay \n     went to Washington, he carried a barrel with him, to \n     ``lubricate the wheels of government.''\n       Clay is also credited with writing the first historical \n     recipe for the mint julep and introducing it to the public in \n     this very hotel.\n       He recorded in his diary his own method for making the \n     cocktail. Clay called for ``mellow bourbon, aged in oaken \n     barrels'' and also instructed that ``the mint leaves, fresh \n     and tender, should be pressed against a coin-silver goblet \n     with the back of a silver spoon.''\n       The historical record also shows that Clay used Bourbon as \n     an aid to legislating. One observer from that era recalls \n     witnessing Clay and fellow Senate great John Calhoun sipping \n     whiskey in the Old Senate Chamber.\n       Together they would drain their glasses behind the vice \n     president's chair--and Clay, with good humor, would say to \n     Calhoun, ``Well, Mr. Senator, I will admit that you have had \n     the better of me today; but I'll be your match tomorrow.''\n       Legend also holds that Clay's oratorical skills were often \n     enhanced by his consumption of Kentucky's favorite beverage. \n     Some have said that it is the lime in the water used to make \n     Kentucky Bourbon that lends both Bourbon whiskey and Clay's \n     oratory their special flare.\n       Whatever it may be that gives Bourbon whiskey its unique \n     taste, Kentucky is proud to be the birthplace of Bourbon.\n       The drink itself is named for Bourbon County, where the \n     product first emerged. Kentucky produces 95 percent of the \n     world's Bourbon supply, and Kentucky's iconic Bourbon brands \n     ship more than 30 million gallons of the spirit to 126 \n     countries, making Bourbon the largest export category among \n     all United States distilled spirits.\n       Bourbon also gives much back to Kentucky. It is a vital \n     part of the state's tourism and economy. Many a visitor to \n     the Commonwealth has traced the famous Kentucky Bourbon \n     Trail. And the industry is responsible for nearly 10,000 jobs \n     in our state.\n       And both Bourbon and Clay have one thing in common: They \n     excel at bringing people together in a spirit of compromise.\n       I'd like to think that this Kentucky spirit of compromise \n     lives on in the Senate today. With the new Senate of the \n     114th Congress, it's great to see some real debate on the \n     floor of the Senate once again.\n       It's been great to see both sides able to offer amendments \n     once more.\n       I know many of the Democratic Senators are glad to be able \n     to give more of a voice to their constituents too. I believe \n     they welcome our vision of a Senate where we're doing some \n     real legislating.\n       A more open Senate presents more opportunities for \n     legislators with serious ideas to make a mark on the \n     legislative process. It can give members of both parties a \n     real stake in the outcome. And it helps lead, I hope, to \n     greater bipartisan accomplishments down the road.\n       Just because we have a Republican Congress and a Democrat \n     in the White House\n\n[[Page S764]]\n\n     doesn't mean we can't deliver for the American people. On the \n     contrary--divided government has frequently been a time to \n     get big things done. That's something Henry Clay would have \n     well understood and appreciated.\n       Because principled compromise across party lines was very \n     familiar to Henry Clay.\n       Three times in the early years of the American Republic, \n     the split between North and South threatened to tear the \n     country apart. And three times before the Civil War finally \n     began, Henry Clay kept the nation together, through \n     compromise and negotiation.\n       Were it not for his leadership, America as we know it may \n     not exist today.\n       The Henry Clay Center for Statesmanship rightly keeps his \n     spirit of compromise alive today through its education \n     programs for high school and college students. The Center \n     teaches Kentucky's future leaders about Henry Clay and the \n     art of meaningful dialogue and discourse.\n       It makes me proud as a Kentuckian to see Henry Clay's \n     legacy live on, whether it is through the Clay Center, \n     through the U.S. Senate, or through all of us here today.\n       It makes me proud as a Kentuckian to see the imprint the \n     Bluegrass State has made on the history of this country. Not \n     only Clay, but famous Kentuckians like Abraham Lincoln. John \n     Sherman Cooper. Alben Barkley. And the recently departed \n     Wendell Ford.\n       And it makes me proud as a Kentuckian to see how many other \n     Kentucky traditions have made a lasting imprint on our \n     country. Not least of which is the Run for the Roses on the \n     first Saturday of every May.\n       So thank you for allowing me to be here tonight.

Mr. President, not long ago Liberia, Sierra Leone, and \nGuinea, the World Health Organization, WHO, and the United Nations, and \nthe United States, Great Britain, France, and other countries were \nfrantically trying to bring the Ebola crisis in West Africa under \ncontrol.\n  Thousands of people died due to a disastrous failure by WHO's Africa \nregional representative, serious miscalculations by local officials and \nglobal health experts, and a myriad of other problems ranging from weak \nlocal health systems that were quickly overwhelmed to a lack of \naccurate information and cultural practices that helped spread the \ndisease rather than contain it.\n  But in the past few weeks there has been some good news about \nprogress in stopping Ebola. According to WHO, Liberia, Sierra Leone, \nand Guinea recorded their lowest weekly numbers of new cases in months. \nThe United Nations special envoy on Ebola stated that the epidemic \nappears to be slowing down, and the Government of Liberia has set a \ntarget of zero new Ebola cases by the end of February.\n  It is heartening to see that the hard work by Liberia, Sierra Leone, \nGuinea, and the international community are bringing results. But we \nare not out of the woods yet and there are important lessons to be \nlearned from the mistakes and lost opportunities in the early response \nto this disease outbreak.\n  Ebola pushed governments, international organizations, and the \nprivate sector and health care responders into unknown territory, \nforcing everyone to think and act in new ways. Unfortunately, with the \nexception of the nongovernmental organization Doctors Without Borders, \nwe were all too slow to recognize this. The initial response missed key \nopportunities to prevent the crisis from becoming an epidemic, and as a \nresult thousands of people died who might have avoided infection. The \nsymptoms of the initial victims were not recognized as Ebola, signs \nthat the epidemic was spreading rather than receding, as some believed, \nwere misinterpreted, and governments and international organizations \ndid not effectively communicate or coordinate with local communities \nimpacted by the virus, nor were the necessary resources to combat the \ndisease available in-country early enough.\n  As work was done to overcome these missteps and challenges, the \nepidemic spread further across borders, as did rumors, and fear \nincreased, people in the affected areas became increasingly distrustful \nof those who were trying to help, and already scarce health care \nworkers became harder to recruit.\n  The consequences of not containing the disease in the early stages \nhave been catastrophic. As of January 28, WHO estimates that 8,795 \npeople have died from the Ebola virus, and according to UNICEF's \npreliminary estimates, as of December 29 at least 3,700 children in \nGuinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have lost one or both parents to the \ndisease. The children of those countries have not attended school since \nmid-2014. While Guinea reopened their schools in mid-January, \nattendance has remained low. Liberia is preparing to reopen schools in \nmid-February, and Sierra Leone hopes to reopen its schools by the end \nof March.\n  Unemployment and business closures have increased, cross-border trade \nhas plummeted, and there are concerns that food shortages and \nmalnutrition will increase because food stock that would normally be \nkept for next year is already being eaten.\n  According to the World Bank's December estimates, the growth in GDP \nin 2014 for Liberia and Sierra Leone fell by over 60 percent in each \ncountry and Guinea's GDP growth in 2014 is down by 89 percent.\n  Much of our investments in the rebuilding of Liberia and Sierra Leone \nsince the civil wars there have been obliterated by Ebola. These \ncountries are back at square one.\n  The world's initial response to the Ebola crisis illustrates how \nunprepared we are for future global health crises which may be far more \ndevastating and fast spreading than Ebola, if that is possible to \nimagine.\n  How can we avoid repeating our mistakes? Are we going to provide our \nown government agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention and the U.S. Agency for International Development and \ninternational organizations such as WHO the resources they need? Can we \ncount on them to take the steps to ensure that the right people are in \nthe right places with the authority to make the necessary decisions in \na timely manner?\n  Too often it seems that we have to relearn the same lessons each time \nfor different situations and countries. There are already reports, \nincluding a January 19 article in the Washington Post that describes \nnewly built Ebola response centers, paid for by the United States \nGovernment, that stand empty or have closed because the number of new \nEbola cases has dropped sharply. It is far better to be prepared than \nunprepared, but we need to reassess the situation and be sure that we \nare adjusting our response appropriately.\n  The fiscal year 2015 Consolidated Appropriations Act includes $2.5 \nbillion for the Department of State and USAID response to the Ebola \ncrisis. As ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee that funds \nthose agencies, I hope they will ensure that we use these funds to \navoid past mistakes, by improving flexibility to respond to the crisis \nas it changes, relying less on international nongovernmental \norganizations and foreign contractors, and increasing support for \nbuilding local public health capacity and a sustainable and resilient \nprivate sector, increasing awareness and sensitivity to cultural norms \nof those impacted by the crisis, and improving communication and \ncoordination among local communities, local and national governments, \nand the international community. These are not new ideas but they \nemerge time and again.\n  Finally, we need to be far better prepared for protecting American \ncitizens from contagious diseases that can spread like wildfire from a \nsingle health care worker or other infected individual who returns from \nan affected country. Fortunately, only one death from Ebola occurred in \nthe U.S., but it could have been far worse.\n  Now is the time to reassess how we should respond domestically and \ninternationally to regional epidemics and prepare accordingly. We \ncannot afford to waste time and resources making the same mistakes and \nrelearning old lessons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/04/senate-section/article/S764-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S764-S765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   A RETURN TO DEMOCRACY IN SRI LANKA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for hundreds of millions of people around \nthe globe, including in countries whose governments are allies of the \nUnited States, democracy and human rights are aspirations that seem \nbeyond reach. According to a recent report by Freedom House, the state \nof freedom in the world declined in almost every region over the past \nyear. But while we\n\n[[Page S765]]\n\nshould be deeply concerned by this discouraging trend, we should also \nrecognize where progress is being made.\n  On January 8, the people of Sri Lanka stunned a repressive government \nthat had been rapidly centralizing power and dismantling democratic \ninstitutions. President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who sensed his increasing \nunpopularity, called a snap election 2 years early hoping to take \nadvantage of his fragmented opposition. However, to his surprise and \nthe surprise of many observers, a broad coalition of Sri Lankans voted \nto oust his administration and to chart a new course. Rather than balk \nat forfeiting the chance for an unprecedented third term, President \nRajapaksa, under pressure from the international community, stepped \ndown within hours of the election results being published.\n  This was welcome news. After suffering decades of on-and-off conflict \nthat is estimated to have cost as many as 100,000 lives, only to have \nthe violence replaced by increasing repression and political and ethnic \npolarization, the peaceful transfer of power has helped breathe life \ninto the hopes of Sri Lankans for reconciliation and a better future. \nFor that hope to become reality, newly elected President Maithripala \nSirisena will need to gain the trust of all Sri Lankans, regardless of \ntheir ethnicity or political views. In too many countries democracy has \nbeen treated as an election rather than a way of governing, but for it \nto succeed all citizens must have the ability to participate \nmeaningfully. As President Sirisena stated in his inaugural address, \nwhat Sri Lanka needs ``is not a King, but a real human being''.\n  Of course, democracy alone will not heal Sri Lankan society. No one \nknows this better than those who lost family, friends, and loved ones \nin the war with the LTTE, or Tamil Tigers. In the final months of that \nwar, many thousands of civilians died, mostly as a result of shelling \nby the Sri Lankan military of civilians who had been uprooted by the \nfighting. The United Nations, the United States, other governments and \nhuman rights organizations have long called for thorough, independent \ninvestigations and punishment of those responsible for war crimes and \ncrimes against humanity.\n  While President Sirisena has pledged to launch a domestic inquiry \ninto alleged war crimes, I agree with those who insist that nothing \nless than an international investigation, as called for by the U.N. \nHuman Rights Council, will likely suffice to overcome the suspicion and \ndistrust concerning this issue. It would be far better if the \ngovernment seeks the assistance of the UN High Commissioner for Human \nRights in developing a credible plan for investigating violations of \nhuman rights by both sides in the conflict, and holding those \nresponsible accountable.\n  I am encouraged that President Sirisena has pledged to return the \ncountry to a parliamentary democracy with independent police and \njudicial institutions, and inclusive governance. He has also committed \nto taking steps to address the cases of those detained under the \nPrevention of Terrorism Act, PTA, many of whom are political prisoners \nlike Jeyakumari Balendran. The reviews should be carried out \nexpeditiously. While the release of 572 prisoners at the time of Pope \nFrancis's visit on January 14 was a positive step, it is the cases of \npolitical prisoners detained under the PTA that will demonstrate the \nSirisena government's commitment to reconciliation. The sooner innocent \nvictims of the Rajapaksa government's repression are freed, the faster \nSri Lanka will be able to recover.\n  Over the years I have spoken in this Chamber in support of \nindependent investigations of war crimes and justice and reconciliation \nin Sri Lanka. I have met the relatives of victims of the war. President \nSirisena's election offers the chance for all Sri Lankans to finally \nrecover from that tragic period by rebuilding their country in a spirit \nof tolerance, respect, and common purpose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/04/senate-section/article/S765-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  FIXING NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND: INNOVATION TO BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF \n                                STUDENTS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nmy remarks at the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee hearing yesterday be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Fixing No Child Left Behind: Innovation To Better Meet the Needs of \n                                Students\n\n       This is the 27th hearing in the last six years about fixing \n     No Child Left Behind or a related elementary and secondary \n     education issue. I hope we are not far from a conclusion--\n     from moving from hearings and discussions to marking up a \n     bill. From the beginning of our work on No Child Left Behind, \n     we concluded it would be better, rather than start from \n     scratch on a new Elementary and Secondary Education Act, to \n     identify the problems in the law and try to fix them. \n     Generally speaking, we agree on the problems, and on several \n     solutions we are not far from reaching consensus. We still \n     have some work to do on accountability. And by \n     accountability, I mean goals, standards, annual tests, \n     disaggregated reporting of test results, and defining success \n     or failure for teachers and schools as well as the \n     consequences of that success or failure. On some of these \n     things, we pretty much agree, like the need for a new goal. \n     On other things, we still have some work to do, like whether \n     or not to keep the 17 annual federal standardized tests.\n       This morning we are holding a roundtable discussion on \n     ``Fixing No Child Left Behind: Innovation to Better Meet the \n     Needs of Students.'' We aim for this to be different than a \n     hearing. Senator Murray and I will each have a short opening \n     statement and then we will introduce our roundtable of \n     participants. Then we're going to jump right into the \n     conversation, posing two questions to help guide the \n     discussion.\n       First, what is your state, district, or school doing to \n     implement innovative approaches to improve academic outcomes \n     for students, particularly low-income and at-risk students? \n     Second, how can we improve the federal law to encourage more \n     states, districts, and schools to innovate?\n       And when I say law, I should also draw attention to the \n     regulations that have followed these laws. For example, every \n     state has to submit a plan to the federal government to \n     receive its share of the $14.5 billion Title I program \n     distributed to states for low-income children. That's about \n     $1,300 for every child who lives at or below the federal \n     poverty line. Those Title I applications are reviewed by the \n     Department of Education, as well as by outside experts, \n     before you can spend a dime of that money. In addition, 42 \n     states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico are \n     operating under waivers from the out-of-date and unworkable \n     regulations in No Child Left Behind. To receive those \n     waivers, states have to submit waiver applications. In \n     Tennessee, that waiver application was 91 pages long with \n     more than 170 pages of attachments. Since 2012, the state has \n     had to submit eight different updates or amendments to the \n     plan.\n       In addition to all this, the U.S. Department of Education \n     spends another $9-10 billion or so on about 90 different \n     programs that are either authorized or funded under No Child \n     Left Behind, with separate application and program \n     requirements. These programs include Promise Neighborhoods \n     and Investing in Innovation.\n       So are we spending this money in a way that makes it easier \n     or harder for you to innovate and achieve better academic \n     outcomes?\n       My own view is that the government ought to be an enabler \n     and encourager, rather than a mandater, of innovation. It can \n     do this well. For example, last year Congress overwhelmingly \n     supported reauthorizing the Child Care and Development Block \n     Grant program that gives grants to states that allow parents \n     to receive a voucher for the child care of their choice so \n     they can attend school or go to work.\n       Seven decades ago the G.I. Bill enabled World War II \n     veterans to attend a college of their choice, helping them \n     become the greatest generation. Today, half our college \n     students have federal grants or loans that follow them to the \n     colleges of their choice, enabling them to buy the surest \n     ticket to a better life and job. About 98 percent of the \n     federal dollars that go to higher education follow the \n     student to the school they attend. In K-12, the only money \n     that follows students to the school they attend is the school \n     lunch program.\n       Now, I'll turn to Ranking Member Murray for her opening \n     statement and then we'll get the conversation going.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/04/senate-section/article/S765-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S765-S766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SCHOOL CHOICE\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nmy remarks at the Brookings Institution earlier today be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             School Choice\n\n       I am delighted to be here, but I should warn you: Based on \n     my track record, I'm probably not your most reliable observer \n     on school choice.\n       If I take you back to September 1992, I gave a speech at \n     Ashland University in Ohio, and I predicted that by the year \n     2000 ``school choice will not be an issue.''\n       I suggested that an Ashland student writing a thesis in \n     2000 ought to make the subject parental choice of schools, \n     because by then, I said, ``It will be a matter of history.\n\n[[Page S766]]\n\n       ``Your colleagues will wonder along with you as you examine \n     this strange era when we granted government monopolies \n     control of the most valuable and important enterprises in \n     town, and so many people fought furiously to keep doors to \n     many of the best schools closed to poor children.\n       ``They will ask, how could this have ever happened in \n     America, at a time when the ideas of freedom, choice and \n     opportunity were sweeping the rest of the world?''\n       My prediction might not have been right, but not because we \n     didn't try.\n       In 1984, I gave a speech at the University of the South \n     outlining the ``deep ruts'' into which American K-12 \n     education had fallen. One of those was the lack of school \n     choice for parents.\n       In 1985, the National Governors Association (NGA) embarked \n     on a project called ``Time for Results.'' We divided into \n     seven task forces, each chaired by a governor, to ask seven \n     of the toughest questions you could ask about American \n     education. One of those questions was, ``Why not let parents \n     choose the schools their children attend?'' The task force \n     working on that question was chaired by the Democratic \n     governor of Colorado, Richard Lamm, who said then, ``You \n     know, it is interesting that America is a land of choices. We \n     have 100 breakfast cereals to choose from, 200 different \n     makes of cars. But in this one educational area . . . we have \n     not done a lot in choice.''\n       Then in 1992, President Bush proposed his ``GI Bill for \n     Children,'' which was a plan to allow states and cities to \n     give $1,000 annual scholarships in new federal dollars to \n     each child of a middle- and low-income family in a \n     participating state or locality.\n       Families could spend the scholarships at any lawfully \n     operated school--public, private or religious.\n       And up to half of the scholarship could be spent on other \n     academic programs, like a Saturday math tutoring program or a \n     summer accelerated language course.\n       That year, the Carnegie Foundation had reported that 28 \n     percent of our nation's parents would like to send their \n     child to a different school.\n       Today, that number is even higher--it is, in fact, more \n     than twice as high. A recent 2013 Luntz Global study found \n     that 64 percent of parents said that ``if given the financial \n     opportunity,'' they would send one or all of their children \n     to a different school.\n       The last 23 years have seen some positive changes in the \n     ability of parents to choose their children's schools.\n       Today all 50 states and Washington, D.C. offer to some \n     students alternatives to the school they would normally be \n     assigned based on their residence.\n       Approximately 15 percent of school-age children attend a \n     school other than their school of residence through open-\n     enrollment programs.\n       Policies in 42 states allow some, or all, parents to send \n     their children to public schools outside their districts.\n       Of those 42 states--15 states require districts to \n     participate, 23 allow them to participate, and three require \n     it specifically for low-income students and students in \n     failing schools.\n       In 31 states, parents are allowed to choose among schools \n     within their district.\n       Of those 31 states--16 states require districts to \n     participate, 10 allow them to participate, and 6 require it \n     for low-income students or students in failing schools 6 \n     states.\n       More than 2.5 million--or nearly five percent of all public \n     school children--are enrolled in more than 6,000 public \n     charter schools in 42 states and D.C. Typically parents \n     choose to enroll their children in these schools.\n       In addition, today more than 300,000 children are served by \n     41 private school choice programs across 19 states, D.C., and \n     Douglas County, Colorado. These programs often give students \n     who meet certain criteria--usually based on income, special \n     needs, or academic performance--an opportunity for a voucher, \n     tax credit program, or education savings account to allow \n     them to attend private schools.\n       Also, the option for homeschooling is available in all \n     states and parents of about three percent of school-age \n     children choose to homeschool.\n       Allowing students to choose among schools is not a new idea \n     for the federal government.\n       Allowing federal dollars to follow students has been a \n     successful strategy in American education for 70 years.\n       In 1944, the G.I. Bill allowed veterans to choose among \n     colleges, public or private.\n       Today, about $136 billion in federal grants and loans \n     continue to follow students to the college or university of \n     their choice.\n       Just last year, Congress reauthorized the $2.4 billion \n     Child Care and Development Block Grant program, or CCDBG, \n     which, when combined with other federal and state funding, \n     helps approximately 900,000 families pay for child care of \n     their choice while they work or attend school, mostly through \n     vouchers.\n       These are among the most successful and popular federal \n     programs--why is it so hard to apply the same sorts of \n     choices to elementary and secondary schools?\n       What can the federal government do now to expand the \n     opportunity parents have to choose the most appropriate \n     school for their children?\n       The first is Scholarships for Kids. This is a bill I \n     introduced that would use $24 billion of the federal dollars \n     we spend each year on K-12 education and allow states to \n     create $2,100 scholarships to follow 11 million low-income \n     children to any public or private school of their parents' \n     choice.\n       Also, the discussion draft I've just released to fix No \n     Child Left Behind gives states the option of using $14.5 \n     billion in Title I money to follow 11 million low income \n     children to the public school they attend.\n       Most people agree that Title I money, which is supposed to \n     help low-income kids, gets diverted to different schools \n     because of a formula that targets money to districts based on \n     how much states spend per student. That is largely influenced \n     by teacher salaries.\n       The simplest way to solve that problem is to let that money \n     follow the child to the school they attend. You could do that \n     to just public schools, which has been the tradition with \n     Title I money, or to private schools, which is what I would \n     prefer.\n       The second is the CHOICE Act. This is a proposal by Senator \n     Tim Scott to allow about $11 billion the federal government \n     now spends for children with disabilities to follow those six \n     million children to the schools their parents believe provide \n     the best services.\n       I think it's important to note that these bills do not \n     require states to do anything--instead they give them the \n     option to have money follow the child.\n       The third is the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program. \n     Senator Scott's CHOICE Act would also expand the D.C. \n     Opportunity Scholarship Program that began in 2004 and has \n     provided about 6,000 low-income students in Washington, D.C. \n     with the opportunity to receive a scholarship to attend a \n     private school of their parents' choice. Today, far more \n     parents in the city have applied for the scholarships than \n     have received them.\n       The fourth is expanding charter schools. In my final year \n     as education secretary under President George H. W. Bush, I \n     wrote every school superintendent in America asking them to \n     try this new idea from Minnesota called ``start-from-scratch \n     schools.'' At the time there were only twelve of them. They \n     were the first charter schools. Today there are more than \n     6,000.\n       Charter schools have had strong bipartisan support--\n     including from President Clinton and Secretary Duncan.\n       We've got in our discussion draft provisions that would \n     streamline and update the existing Charter Schools Program \n     to:\n       Provide grants to State entities to start new charter \n     schools and to replicate or expand high-quality charter \n     schools.\n       Provide grants to entities to enhance credit methods to \n     finance charter school facilities.\n       Provide grants to charter management organizations, like \n     KIPP or Rocketship in my home state of Tennessee, to \n     replicate or expand high-quality charter schools.\n       Our goal is to grow the federal investment in expanding and \n     replicating high-quality charter schools with a demonstrated \n     record of success, and hold charter schools accountable for \n     their performance.\n       Other senators also have some good proposals. Senators Paul \n     and Lee both have bills to allow federal dollars from Title I \n     of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to follow low-\n     income children to the public or private school of their \n     parents' choice. Senator Rubio has a bill that creates a new \n     federal tax credit for individual and corporate donations to \n     organizations that provide low-income students with private \n     school scholarships.\n       As for the future, I think I've learned my lesson--I'm not \n     about to make a prediction.\n       It looks like it will be a while before school choice will \n     be a matter of history.\n       But the progress so many have made is impressive--there is \n     plenty of opportunity to do more.\n       As Ross Perot told me in 1984, ``Changing the public \n     schools of Texas was the hardest, meanest, bloodiest thing \n     I've ever tried to do.''\n       Since I'm not going to make a prediction then I'll end with \n     a question--the same one I asked in 1992: If we trust parents \n     to choose child care for their children, and we trust them to \n     help their children choose a college to attend--and both \n     those systems have been so successful--why do we not also \n     trust them to choose the best elementary or high school for \n     their children?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/04/senate-section/article/S766-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S766-S767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n       Navy Special Warfare Operator First Class William Marston\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I wish to honor the life of William \n``Blake'' Marston, a Navy SEAL from New Hampshire who was tragically \nkilled in the line of duty.\n  Blake Marston was an extraordinary man who served our Nation with \nhonor, courage, and commitment. His decision to become a Navy SEAL and \ntake risks in training and combat missions alike speaks to his love of \ncountry and his dedication to serving his fellow Americans. His \nultimate sacrifice in the line of duty leaves all New Hampshire \ncitizens in Blake's debt.\n  Blake grew up in Bedford, NH, where he excelled as a student athlete \nand was known by his coaches for being a hard worker and dedicated team \nmember. He loved baseball and was an alpine ski racer. It is clear that \nBlake\n\n[[Page S767]]\n\nwas special from an early age. From his involvement in the church youth \ngroup, to his mentorship of young athletes, Blake was devoted to \nhelping others.\n  At Stonehill College, Blake majored in criminal justice and studio \narts, and it was during his senior year that he decided that he wanted \nto become a Navy SEAL--a member of the most elite special forces unit. \nBlake's athleticism, leadership, and determination provided him with \nthe physical and mental toughness he needed to endure one of the most \ngrueling training experiences in the world in order to become a SEAL. \nAnd he succeeded.\n  Blake's service to our Nation included two tours of duty in \nAfghanistan. He never let up on his desire to improve and be the best \nSEAL he could be. Just as he put in the time in his backyard with his \ndad honing his baseball skills, he also worked tirelessly at being the \nbest that he could be as a defender of our country.\n  Blake died training to conduct the kinds of missions that keep \nAmericans safe. We owe our freedom and security to Blake and the men \nand women like him in our armed services.\n  During the Celebration of Life service held in Blake's honor, his \nfamily, friends, and classmates described a young man who was kind, \ncompassionate, thoughtful, and funny--a gentle giant, yet also a highly \ntrained, elite warrior. In describing his devotion to his fellow SEALs, \nBlake once remarked to his father, ``You know, Dad, I can't possibly \nimagine being in any other profession where I have such respect and \nlove for my teammates.''\n  Blake will be laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery, a hero \nsurrounded by his brothers in arms.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with Blake's parents Nancy and Bill, and \nsister Emily, who have lost a loving son and brother. May God bless \nBlake and his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/04/senate-section/article/S767-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             REMEMBERING MASTER SERGEANT JAMES WILLIAM HOLT\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, this Saturday, February 7, 2015, \nmembers of the Hempstead County community will gather for a memorial \nservice for MSG James William Holt of Hope, AR, who was killed in \naction in Vietnam in 1968.\n  The service will take place on the 47th anniversary of Master \nSergeant Holt's heroic actions and will coincide with the return of his \nremains for proper burial.\n  In the early morning hours of February 7, 1968, the North Vietnamese \nArmy launched a massive, coordinated tank and infantry assault on the \nSpecial Forces Camp at Lang Vei that created numerous casualties among \nthe troops defending the base.\n  As a Special Forces medic, Master Sergeant Holt raced around the \ncompound, while under heavy fire, to administer aid to the wounded and \nmove them to safety. His valiant actions during the assault did not end \nthere.\n  While not a weapons specialist, Master Sergeant Holt nonetheless was \na professional Special Operations soldier who knew how to fire every \nweapon in that camp accurately and effectively. He was also a decisive \nleader who took charge of a silent 106 mm recoilless rifle and brought \nit to life, destroying three enemy tanks before running out of \nammunition.\n  Master Sergeant Holt then supplied himself with light anti-tank \nweapons and charged into the face of the enemy, single-handedly \nattacking the tank formation, and allowing time for his brothers-in-\narms to fight their way to safety. When two enemy tanks broke through \nthe perimeter, Master Sergeant Holt delivered deadly fire on them, \nscoring a direct hit on one of the armored vehicles.\n  The Battle of Lang Vei was a short, but costly battle that could have \neven worse for American forces if it were not for Master Sergeant \nHolt's heroics. For his acts of bravery, Master Sergeant Holt was \nposthumously awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in action and the \nPurple Heart.\n  I was at the ceremony in 2013 when Master Sergeant Holt was \nposthumously inducted into the Arkansas Military Veterans Hall of Fame \nand I wish I could be onhand when the community honors him this \nweekend. These tributes will help ensure Master Sergeant Holt's \nremarkable story of bravery and selfless sacrifice forever lives \non.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/04/senate-section/article/S767-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT JUSTIN MAHANA\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Sgt Justin \nMahana for his courageous act to help others. After driving from Las \nVegas to Lake Havasu, AZ, to help a coworker whose car had broken down, \nSergeant Mahana stopped at a gas station to check that his own car was \nready for the trip back to Nevada. While there, Sergeant Mahana \nwitnessed a car crash into a median, leading him to investigate the \naccident and pull the driver out of the car as it lit into flames. It \ngives me great pleasure to recognize his bravery and his commitment to \nothers both in this moment and throughout his life.\n  Sergeant Mahana, a 17-year veteran, joined the U.S. Air Force because \nhe wanted to make a difference in the lives of others. His job entails \nthe maintenance and upkeep of military vehicles that are used by \npararescuemen when conducting combat search and rescue missions, as \nwell as humanitarian relief operations. Both his commitment to the Air \nForce, as well as his daily actions, prove his regard for others.\n  I extend my deepest gratitude to Sergeant Mahana for his courageous \ncontributions to the United States of America and to freedom-loving \nnations around the world. His service to his country and his bravery \nearn him a place among the outstanding men and women who have valiantly \ndefended our Nation.\n  His commitment to helping those around him, as well as serving the \ncountry, demonstrates his unwavering selfless character. His actions \nrepresent only the greatest of Nevada's values, including a sense of \ncommunity and an obligation to help others.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I recognize \nthat Congress has a responsibility not only to honor these brave \nindividuals who serve our Nation, but also to ensure they are cared for \nwhen they return home. I remain committed to upholding this promise for \nour veterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout the Nation.\n  During his tenure, Sergeant Mahana has demonstrated professionalism, \ncommitment to excellence, and dedication to the highest standards of \nthe Air Force. I am both humbled and honored by his service and am \nproud to call him a fellow Nevadan. Today, I ask my colleagues to join \nme in recognizing Sgt. Justin Mahana for all of his accomplishments and \nwish him well in all of his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/04/senate-section/article/S767-3", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S767-S768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING DAVID LEE THOMAS, SR.\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nDavid Lee Thomas, Sr. of Mobile, AL, who passed away on January 22, \n2015. He and I were friends for many years. I first got to know him \nwhen I was a young Assistant U.S. attorney in Mobile and he was already \na proven and respected Federal law officer. He had been hired as the \nfirst African-American investigator in the southeast region, with the \noffice of inspector general, U.S. Department of Agriculture. He was \ninvestigating fraud by stores and businesses that were buying food \nstamps for cash or carrying on other unlawful activities. One of the \nhighlights of his career with the OIG was receiving a letter from \nPresident Ronald Reagan for solving a fraud case which saved the U.S. \nGovernment $10 million. During that time, we worked a number of cases \ntogether. Several went to trial, and he taught me a great deal about \nlaw, trials, and how fraud and abuse occur.\n  David retired from the OIG in 1990, but that retirement lasted all of \n6 months. He began working at the Mobile Drug Coalition, and from there \nhe began the second most rewarding career when he became the assistant \ndirector of the Mobile County Community Corrections Center. In that \nrole, he established the Court Police Department and helped develop the \nMobile County Drug Court Program, which was the first of its kind in \nAlabama.\n  David loved his community and was involved in many organizations to \nmake Mobile a better place to live. He\n\n[[Page S768]]\n\nwas also very active in his church. He was a great law enforcement \nofficer, citizen, friend, and devoted father and grandfather. This \nNation has many excellent Federal employees and officials. David was \none of the best. His record speaks for itself. I extend my sympathy to \nhis friends and family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/04/senate-section/article/S768-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/04/senate-section/article/S768-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/04/senate-section/article/S768-3", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS DECLARED \n   IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13396 ON FEBRUARY 7, 2006, WITH RESPECT TO THE \n           SITUATION IN OR IN RELATION TO COTE D'IVOIRE--PM 4\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency, unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

A bill to improve the provisions relating to the privacy of \nelectronic communications; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act was \nfirst enacted in 1986. I would ask my colleagues, what were you doing \nin 1986? Mr. President, 1986 was a long time ago. In 1986 I was in the \nninth grade. This was an age when not everyone had a personal computer. \nMy family didn't have a computer. Most of the people I knew who had a \ncomputer had something like the Commodore VIC-20, which was a very \nsmall computer with very little processing power compared to what we \nhave today. But this law, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act--or \nECPA, as it is sometimes known--was and still is an important law with \nan increasingly important objective; that is, to ensure that government \nagencies respect the Fourth Amendment in accessing an individual's \nelectronic communications.\n  In the nearly three decades since ECPA became law, technology has \nadvanced rapidly, dramatically, far beyond the capacity of this \nparticular law, ECPA, to keep up. The prevalence of email and the low \ncost of electronic data storage have made what were once robust \nprotections vastly insufficient to ensure that citizens' rights are \nprotected with respect to their electronic communications, such as \nemail.\n  There is no reason we should still be operating under a law written \nin the analog age when we are living in a digital world. This is a \nlittle bit like operating with a DOS-based operating system in the age \nof much more sophisticated software systems that help us interact \nrelatively seamlessly with our computers. That is why Senator Leahy and \nI have come together to craft this truly bipartisan piece of \nlegislation which would modernize ECPA and bring constitutional \nprotections against worthless searches and seizures into harmony with \nthe technological realities of the 21st century.\n  The Lee-Leahy ECPA Amendments Act of 2015 would prohibit electronic \ncommunications or remote computing service providers--such as Gmail or \nFacebook or Twitter, for example--from voluntarily disclosing the \ncontents of customer emails or other communications. It eliminates the \nambiguous and outdated 180-day rule that some government agencies \nbelieve grants them warrantless access to the content of older emails. \nThat is any emails older than the very young age of 180 days old. \nInstead, all requests for the content of electronic communications \nwould require a search warrant--a search warrant required by the Fourth \nAmendment, a search warrant based on probable cause--and law \nenforcement agencies would be required to notify within 10 days any \npersons whose email accounts were searched, subject to some logical and \nnarrow exceptions, of course.\n  This legislation is also carefully crafted so that it would not \nimpede the ability of law enforcement agencies to conduct legitimate \ninvestigative activities consistent with the Fourth Amendment.\n\n[[Page S774]]\n\n  I am pleased to say that our bill enjoys very broad support from the \ntechnology industry, from privacy advocates, constitutional scholars, \nand policy groups on both ends of the ideological spectrum in America.\n  The Lee-Leahy ECPA Amendments Act of 2015 is truly bipartisan in \nnature. The Senate bill, in addition to Senators Leahy and myself as \nthe principal sponsors, also has six additional cosponsors. We have \nRepublican Senators Cornyn, Moran, and Gardner and Democratic Senators \nShaheen, Merkley, and Blumenthal. I hope and expect that we will have a \nlot of additional Senators of both political parties who will join us \nin this effort. The House version of this bill has 228 additional \ncosponsors--a very critical majority.\n  By working together as a Democrat from Vermont and a Republican from \nUtah, we hope all Senators will join with us to pass this meaningful, \nbipartisan legislation that would benefit all Americans. Congress \nshould pass ECPA reform this year, and President Obama should sign \nthese important privacy reforms into law.\n  I will end this discussion as I began. What were you doing in 1986? \nAs it relates to your interaction with the digital world with \ncomputers, I would imagine that even though your life might be in many \nrespects similar to what it was in 1986, it is very different in the \nway you interact with computers, with technology, with the online \nworld, which basically no one was even aware of in 1986. Since 1986 the \nworld has changed. We need to change the world to keep up with the \ntimes. We need to change the law to hold in place those protections \nthat have been in our Constitution since 1791 to make sure the privacy \nrights of the American people are respected.\n  I encourage each of my colleagues to support this bill\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to talk about privacy because \nprivacy is not a partisan issue. It never has been, and never should \nbe. Remember, 30 years ago I was in the minority. The Republicans were \nin the majority and controlled the Senate. It was then that I worked \nwith my colleagues and led the effort to write the Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act, ECPA.\n  It required a lot of education because back then, electronic mail was \nan emerging technology. The World Wide Web was unimaginable. Electronic \ndata storage was astronomically expensive. No one could have envisioned \nthe way mobile technologies would transform our lives. Yet fortunately \nmany of us in Congress had the foresight to anticipate that these new \nelectronic communications would also need privacy protections.\n  That was 30 years ago. Look at what has changed since then. Now three \ndecades later, that law is out of date. So today the Senator from Utah, \nMr. Lee, and I are reintroducing the Electronic Communications Privacy \nAct Amendments Act of 2015. We want to bring this law into the 21st \ncentury. Our legislation is very straightforward. It ensures that the \nprivate information that we Americans electronically store in the cloud \ngets the same protections as the private information we Americans \nphysically store at home. As it did in 1986, I hope the Senate will \ncome together on a bipartisan basis to support these commonsense \nprotections.\n  All of us have an expectation that the things we store in our house \nare private. If law enforcement wants access to them, they have to get \nthe proper search warrants. Today, there seems to be an idea that if \nthey are stored electronically, these rules should not apply.\n  I believe they should.\n  The bill Senator Lee and I introduced today protects Americans' \ndigital privacy--in their emails and all the other files and \nphotographs they store in the cloud. It promotes cloud computing and \nother new technologies by building consumer trust. And it also provides \nlaw enforcement agencies with the tools they need to ensure public \nsafety.\n  I would remind my colleagues that several years ago the U.S. Circuit \nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found that email was fully \nprotected by the Fourth Amendment. It said that ``the Fourth Amendment \nmust keep pace with the inexorable march of technological progress, or \nits guarantees will wither and perish.'' This bill takes up that \nchallenge.\n  Obviously we have technologies today that nobody would have dreamed \nof just a couple of generations ago. But we have a Constitution that \nhas protected this country for well over 200 years, and we hope it will \nprotect it for hundreds of years into the future. We need to make sure \nour laws keep up with the protections we Americans expect from our \nConstitution.\n  First and most importantly, the bill enshrines in statute the \nfundamental Fourth Amendment warrant requirement for email, texts, and \nother electronic data. It requires that the government have a criminal \nsearch warrant based on possible cause to obtain the stored content of \nAmericans' email and other electronic communications from third-party \nproviders. This ensures that email communications have the same \nprotections as phone calls and private documents stored in your home.\n  However, the bill's warrant requirement contains an important \nexception to address emergency circumstances. It explicitly states that \nit does not affect current authorities under the Wiretap Act or the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act. And it ensures that law \nenforcement can continue to investigate corporate wrong-doing by using \ngrand jury subpoenas to obtain emails directly from corporate entities \nwhen held on their internal systems.\n  The second major component of the bill requires law enforcement \nagencies to promptly notify individuals when the government has \nobtained their emails through their service providers, but permits a \ndelay of that notice to protect the integrity of ongoing \ninvestigations--no different from what we do in other law enforcement \nmatters. The bill would also require service providers to notify the \ngovernment three days before they inform a customer that the provider \ndisclosed their information to the government.\n  This is not a Republican or Democratic issue, nor is it liberal or \nconservative. In fact, Senator Lee and I would note that we have a \nbroad coalition of more than 50 privacy, civil liberties, civil rights, \nand technology industry groups and leaders from across the political \nspectrum who have endorsed this reform effort. Support spans from the \nHeritage Foundation and Americans for Tax Reform, to the Center for \nDemocracy and Technology and the ACLU.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe January 22, 2015, coalition letter in support of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 January 22, 2015.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Chairman,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy: We, the \n     undersigned companies and organizations, are writing to urge \n     speedy consideration of Sen. Leahy's and Sen. Lee's ECPA \n     Amendments Act that we expect will be introduced in the \n     coming weeks. The bill would update the Electronic \n     Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) to provide stronger \n     protection to sensitive personal and proprietary \n     communications stored in ``the cloud.'' The legislation was \n     considered and adopted by a voice vote in the Committee in \n     the 113th Congress.\n       ECPA, which sets standards for government access to private \n     communications, is critically important to businesses, \n     government investigators and ordinary citizens. Though the \n     law was forward-looking when enacted in 1986, technology has \n     advanced dramatically and ECPA has been outpaced. Courts have \n     issued inconsistent interpretations of the law, creating \n     uncertainty for service providers, for law enforcement \n     agencies, and for the hundreds of millions of Americans who \n     use the Internet in their personal and professional lives. \n     Moreover, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in US v. Warshak \n     has held that a provision of ECPA allowing the government to \n     obtain a person's email without a warrant is \n     unconstitutional.\n       The ECPA Amendments Act would update ECPA in one key \n     respect, making it clear that, except in emergencies or under \n     other existing exceptions, the government must obtain a \n     warrant in order to compel a service provider to disclose the \n     content of emails, texts or other private material stored by \n     the service provider on behalf of its users.\n       This standard would provide greater privacy protections and \n     create a more level playing field for technology. It would \n     cure the constitutional defect identified by the Sixth \n     Circuit It would allow law enforcement officials to obtain \n     electronic communications in all appropriate cases while \n     protecting\n\n[[Page S775]]\n\n     Americans' constitutional rights. Notably, the Department of \n     Justice and FBI already follow the warrant-for-content rule. \n     It would provide certainty for American businesses developing \n     innovative new services and competing in a global \n     marketplace. It would implement a core principle supported by \n     Digital Due Process, www.digitaldueprocess.org, a broad \n     coalition of companies, privacy groups, think tanks, \n     academics and other groups.-\n       This legislation has seemingly been held up by only one \n     issue--an effort to allow civil regulators to demand, without \n     a warrant, the content of customer documents and \n     communications directly from third party service providers. \n     This should not be permitted. Such warrantless access would \n     expand government power; government regulators currently \n     cannot compel service providers to disclose their customers' \n     communications. It would prejudice the innovative services \n     that all stakeholders support, and would create one procedure \n     for data stored locally and a different one for data stored \n     in the cloud.\n       Because of all its benefits, there is an extraordinary \n     consensus around ECPA reform--one unmatched by any other \n     technology and privacy issue. Successful passage of ECPA \n     reform sends a powerful message--Congress can act swiftly on \n     crucial, widely supported, bipartisan legislation. Failure to \n     enact reform sends an equally powerful message--that privacy \n     protections are lacking in law enforcement access to user \n     information and that constitutional values are imperiled in a \n     digital world.\n       For all these reasons, we strongly urge all members of the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee to support the ECPA Amendments \n     Act.\n           Sincerely,\n       ACT--The App Association, Adobe, Amazon, American \n     Association of Law Libraries, American Booksellers for Free \n     Expression, American Civil Liberties Union, American Library \n     Association, Americans for Tax Reform and Digital Liberty, \n     AOL, Apple, Association of Research Libraries, Automattic, \n     Autonet Mobile, Brennan Center for Justice, BSA |, The \n     Software Alliance, Center for Financial Privacy and Human \n     Rights, Center for Democracy & Technology, Center for \n     National Security Studies, Cisco, Competitive Enterprise \n     Institute, Computer & Communications Industry Association, \n     Consumer Action, Council for Citizens Against Government \n     Waste, Data Foundry, Deluxe Corporation, Demand Progress, \n     Direct Marketing Association, Discovery Institute, \n     Distributed Computing Industry Association (DCIA).\n       Dropbox, eBay, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Engine, \n     Evernote, Facebook, First Amendment Coalition, Foursquare, \n     FreedomWorks, Future of Privacy Forum, Gen Opp, Golden Frog, \n     Google, Hewlett-Packard, Information Technology Industry \n     Council (ITI), Internet Association, Internet Infrastructure \n     Coalition (I2Coalition), Intuit, Less Government, Liberty \n     Coalition, LinkedIn, NetChoice, New America's Open Technology \n     Institute, Newspaper Association of America, Oracle, \n     Personal, R Street, ServInt, SIIA: Software & Information \n     Industry Association, Snapchat, Sonic, Taxpayers Protection \n     Alliance, TechFreedom, TechNet, The Constitution Project, The \n     Federation of Genealogical Societies, Tumblr, Twitter, U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, Venture Politics, Yahoo.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

I commend them because we do have an opportunity this year \nto make progress on bipartisan, commonsense legislation to protect the \nprivacy of Americans' email and update our laws to keep pace with \ntechnology. And I also congratulate our House partners, Representatives \nYoder and Polis, who are introducing this legislation today in the \nHouse of Representatives with 228 cosponsors from both parties.\n  In the last Congress, the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously \nsupported this bill, Republicans and Democrats alike. We have continued \nthe hard work of building a broad bipartisan coalition in support of \nthis bill. Now is the time to act swiftly to bring our privacy \nprotections into the digital age.\n  I will continue to work with Senator Lee, Senator Cornyn, Senator \nMoran, Senator Shaheen, Senator Merkley, Senator Gardner, and Senator \nBlumenthal on this issue because while I am proud to have them as \ncosponsors, I am also proud that we are doing the right thing\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. Ayotte, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Ms. Heitkamp, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Brown, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. \n        Stabenow, Mrs. Capito, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Casey, Ms. Hirono, \n        Mrs. McCaskill, Ms. Warren, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 370. A bill to require breast density reporting to physicians and \npatients by facilities that perform mammograms, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, even though we have made great strides \nin the treatment and diagnosis of breast cancer, this disease continues \nto be the second leading cause of death for women in the United States.\n  When women receive their mammography report and it comes out normal, \nthey usually move on with their day thinking everything is just fine. \nThis may be the case, but for women with dense breast tissue this \n``normal'' report doesn't capture the whole picture. This is because \ncancer may still be present and missed on their mammogram because it is \nobscured by dense breast tissue.\n  It is vital for women to be told this simple, yet potentially life-\nsaving, information about their own health so they can discuss with \ntheir doctor if additional screening makes sense for them. That could \nbe the difference between catching breast cancer early and surviving, \nor waiting until its too late because you were never told your full \nmedical information.\n  Even though there is a risk for cancer being missed, when women \nreceive their mammogram report there is currently no federal \nrequirement to include notice that they have dense breast tissue. This \nis the case even though the radiologist makes that determination upon \nreading the mammogram\n  This bill is a simple solution. It requires that women be informed on \nthe mammogram report, that they already receive, if they have dense \nbreast tissue, and that they may want to talk with their doctor if they \nhave questions and if they might benefit from additional screening. \nWithholding this kind of medical information from women just doesn't \nmake any sense.\n  This bill doesn't change any state laws. It sets a minimum Federal \nstandard, so any state that wants to have additional reporting \nrequirements may do so. The bill also requires the Department of Health \nand Human Services to focus on research and improved screening for \npatients with dense breast tissue. Early detection is the key to \nbeating cancer. Every patient deserves access to their own information, \nespecially when it may be what saves their life.\n  I want to thank Senator Ayotte for working with me on this bill. I \nurge my colleagues to join us, and Senators Gillibrand, Boxer, \nHeitkamp, Baldwin, Brown, Mikulski, Stabenow, Capito, Shaheen, Casey, \nHirono, McCaskill, and Warren in cosponsoring the Breast Density and \nMammography Reporting Act. This bill is supported by organizations \nincluding the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, Are You \nDense Advocacy, Breast Cancer Fund, and Susan G. Komen.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. \n        Cochran, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Carper, Ms. Murkowski, \n        Mr. Casey, Mr. Portman, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Coons, Mr. Heinrich, \n        Ms. Hirono, Mr. King, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Markey, Mr. Menendez, Mr. \n        Merkley, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schumer, \n        Mr. Wyden, and Ms. Klobuchar):\n  S. 375. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na reduced rate of excise tax on beer produced domestically by certain \nqualifying producers; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today with my friend \nand colleague, the senior Senator from Maine, Senator Collins, to re-\nintroduce the Small Brewer Reinvestment & Expanding Workforce Act of \n2015, otherwise known as the Small BREW Act. Our esteemed former \ncolleague, Senator Kerry, now Secretary of State, introduced this bill \nin the 112th Congress. I was honored to take up the mantel in the 113th \nCongress.\n  The Small BREW Act of 2015 would reduce the excise tax on America's \ncraft brewers. Under current Federal law, brewers producing 2 million \nor fewer barrels annually pay $7 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels \nthey brew, and $18 per barrel on every barrel thereafter, one barrel = \n31 gallons. The Small BREW Act would create a new excise tax rate \nstructure that helps\n\n[[Page S776]]\n\nstart-up and small breweries and reflects the evolution of the craft \nbrewing industry. The rate for the smallest packaging breweries and \nbrewpubs would be $3.50 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels. For \nproduction between 60,001 and 2 million barrels, the rate would be \n$16.00 per barrel. Thereafter, the rate would be $18.00 per barrel. \nBreweries with an annual production of 6 million barrels or less would \nqualify for these recalibrated tax rates.\n  The small brewer threshold and tax rate were established in 1976 and \nhave never been updated. Since then, the largest multinational producer \nof beer has increased its annual production from 45 million barrels to \n97 million barrels domestically and 325 million barrels globally. To \nput the matter in perspective, the biggest domestic craft brewer \nproduces 2.7 million barrels of beer annually. Raising the ceiling that \ndefines small breweries from 2 million barrels to 6 million barrels \nmore accurately reflects the intent of the original differentiation \nbetween large and small brewers in the U.S. Because of differences in \neconomies of scale, small brewers have higher costs for raw materials, \nproduction, packaging, and market entry compared to larger, well-\nestablished multi-national competitors. Adjusting the excise tax rate \nwould provide small brewers with an additional $67 million each year \nthey could use to start or expand their businesses on a local, \nregional, or national scale.\n  This past November, the Joint Committee on Taxation, JCT, estimated \nthe bill would cost $253 million through 2019 and $641 million over 10 \nyears. A March 2013 study on the costs and benefits of the Small BREW \nAct bill which then-Harvard University economist John Friedman prepared \non behalf of the Brewers Association, BA, indicates that the bill would \ndirectly reduce the excise tax revenue the Federal Government collects \nby $67.0 million the first year after enactment. But Professor Friedman \nnotes that such a loss would be offset in large part by $49.1 million \nin new payroll and income taxes collected on increased economic \nactivity. Professor Friedman believes that demand for craft beer will \ncontinue to increase and the Federal Government would collect an \nadditional $1.1 million in excise taxes from the increased sales. The \nnet revenue loss, therefore, would be $16.9 million the first year \nafter enactment. The total net revenue loss over 5 years would be $95.9 \nmillion. The bill would lead to the creation of 5,230 new jobs in the \nfirst 12-18 months after passage and the cost of each new job in \nforegone revenue would be just $3,300.\n  While some people may think this is a bill about beer, it is really \nabout jobs. Blue collar jobs and white collar jobs. Small brewers are \nsmall business owners in communities in each and every State across the \ncountry. Roughly 75 percent of Americans now live within 10 miles of a \nbrewery. Nationally, small and independent brewers employ over 110,000 \nfull- and part-time employees, generate more than $3 billion in wages \nand benefits, and pay more than $2.3 billion in business, personal and \nconsumption taxes, according to the BA. As the craft beer industry \ngrows so, too, does the demand for American-grown barley and hops and \nAmerican-made brewing, bottling, canning, and other equipment. That \ndemand creates more good jobs.\n  Maryland is home to 43 craft brewers, up from 34 in 2013, with 24 \nmore in the planning stages. The existing breweries and brew-pubs \nemploy roughly 600 people who were directly involved in producing craft \nbeer in the State last year, and another 700 to 1,400 part-time workers \nincluding brew-pub restaurant staff and associated employees. In 2012, \nthe Brewers Association determined that the economic impact of the \ncraft brewing industry on the State was $455 million and that the \nindustry created a total of 5,422 ``full-time equivalent'', FTE, jobs \nin Maryland, including indirect and induced jobs, paying over $185 \nmillion in wages. Based on 2013 production figures, the Small BREW Act \nwould provide Maryland's small brewers with roughly $570,000 to \nreinvest in their growing businesses and hire more workers.\n  Small brewers have been anchors of local communities and America's \neconomy since the start of our history. Indeed, there is a Mayflower \ndocument published in 1622 that explains why the Pilgrims landed at \nPlymouth Rock which states, ``For we could not now take time for \nfurther search or consideration: our victuals being much spent, \nespecially our beer.'' Presidents from George Washington to Barack \nObama have been homebrewers. Going back much further, the oldest extant \nrecipe is for beer. And many people would argue that our thirst for \nbeer is what drove man from being a hunter-gatherer to a crop \ncultivator since the earliest domesticated cereal grains were various \ntypes of barley better suited for beer production than making bread. \nSaint Arnulf of Metz, also known as St. Arnold, who lived from roughly \n582 to 640 AD, is known as the ``Patron Saint of Brewers'' because he \nrecognized that beer, which is boiled first, contains alcohol and is \nslightly acidic, was much safer to consume than water. French chemist \nand microbiologist Louis Pasteur, 1822-1895, who discovered yeast and \npropounded the germ theory that is the basis of so much of modern \nmedicine, worked for breweries for much of his career. The pH scale, \nthe standard measurement of acidity, was developed by the head of \nCarlsberg Laboratory's Chemical Department in 1909. Dr Soren Sorensen, \n1868-1939, developed the pH scale during his pioneering research into \nproteins, amino acids and enzymes--the basis of today's protein \nchemistry. So it is fair to say that civilization and beer go hand-in-\nhand.\n  In addition to making high-quality beers, craft brewers such as \nMaryland's Flying Dog, Union Craft, Ruddy Duck, Baying Hound, Heavy \nSeas, and The Brewers Art create jobs and reinvest their profits back \ninto their local economies. The Federal Government needs to be \ninvesting in industries that invest in America and create real jobs \nhere at home. With more than 3,200 small and independent breweries and \nbrew-pubs currently operating in the United States--and many more being \nplanned--now is the time to take meaningful action to help them and our \neconomy grow. An article in today's New York Times entitled ``Betting \non the Growth of Microbreweries'' quotes BA economist Dr. Bart Watson \nas saying, ``Brewery after brewery is looking for ways to grow because \nwhen you talk to these companies, the biggest constraint is capacity. \nThey're selling beer as fast as they can make it.'' Let us help them \ngrow.\n  I am proud to announce that Senators Baldwin, Blumenthal, Cantwell, \nCarper, Casey, Cochran, Coons, Heinrich, Hirono, King, Kirk, Klobuchar, \nLeahy, Markey, Menendez, Merkley, Mikulski, Murkowski, Murphy, Portman, \nSanders, Schumer, and Wyden have all signed on as original co-sponsors \nof the Small BREW Act, and I encourage the rest of my Senate colleagues \nto consider joining us in this worthwhile legislative endeavor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 375\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to impose certain limitations on consent decrees and \nsettlement agreements by agencies that require the agencies to take \nregulatory action in accordance with the terms thereof, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an important \npiece of regulatory reform legislation.\n  A study released this past fall by the National Association of \nManufacturers estimates that U.S. Federal Government regulations \nimposed over $2 trillion in compliance costs on American businesses in \n2012. This is an amount equal to 12 percent of our Nation's GDP.\n  The study also demonstrated--and this should come as no surprise--\nthat the cost of complying with all those regulations falls \ndisproportionately on small businesses. Small manufacturing firms, in \nparticular, grapple with regulatory compliance costs that are more than \nthree times those felt by the average company in the United States.\n  It is no wonder why many American businesses are shuttering or moving \ntheir entire operation overseas. And how many folks dreamed of starting \na small business but ultimately decided against taking the risk because \nof the overwhelming burden and uncertainty of our regulatory state?\n  We have to do better.\n  Small businesses are fed up with excessive Federal regulation, and \nthey are making sure we know about it. A November 2014 survey conducted \nby the National Federation of Independent Business asked small business \nowners across the country to rank the ten most pressing problems they \nface. Overwhelmingly, the top two answers from small business owners \nwere taxes and complying with government red tape. I am happy to say \nthat this Congress intends to confront these issues head-on.\n  The Federal Government needs to do everything possible to promote an \nenvironment that will allow private sector employers to create jobs. To \naccomplish that, common sense would tell us that the government needs \nto remove barriers to job creation rather than put up new ones.\n  Unfortunately, the Obama administration has proven time and again \nthat it would rather push forward with its interest-driven regulatory \nagenda than ease the heavy burden upon our economy and our \nentrepreneurs.\n  To make matters worse, this administration is pursuing new \nregulations through litigation tactics that take an end-run around the \nlaws enacted by Congress to ensure transparency and accountability in \nthe regulatory process. This strategy has come to be known as sue-and-\nsettle, and regulators have been using it to speed up rulemaking and to \nkeep the public, industries, and even the States away from the table \nwhen regulatory decisions are negotiated behind closed doors.\n  Sue-and-settle cases typically follow a similar pattern. First, an \ninterest group files a lawsuit against a Federal agency, claiming that \nthe agency has failed to take a certain regulatory action by a \nstatutory deadline. Through the complaint, the interest group seeks to \ncompel the agency to take action by a new, often-rushed deadline. The \nplaintiff-interest group frequently will be one that shares a common \nregulatory and policy agenda with the agency that it sues, such as when \nan environmental group sues the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.\n  Next, the agency and interest group enter into friendly negotiations \nto produce either a settlement agreement or consent decree behind \nclosed doors that commits the agency to satisfying the interest group's \ndemands. The agreement is then entered by a court, binding executive \ndiscretion to undertake a regulatory action. And noticeably absent from \nthese negotiations are the very parties who will likely be most \nimpacted by the new regulation.\n  Sue-and-settle tactics by advocacy groups and complicit government \nagencies have severe consequences on transparency, public \naccountability, and ultimately on the quality of the resulting public \npolicy.\n  Such tactics undermine congressional intent by shutting out affected \nparties, such as industries and even the States that are charged with \nimplementing new regulations.\n  The Administrative Procedure Act, APA, which has been characterized \nas the citizens' ``regulatory bill of rights,'' was enacted to ensure \ntransparency and public accountability in our Federal rulemaking \nprocess. A central aspect of the APA is the notice-and-comment process, \nwhich requires agencies to notify the public of proposed regulations \nand to respond to comments submitted by interested parties.\n  Rulemaking driven by sue-and-settle tactics, however, frequently \nresults in reprioritized agency agendas and truncated deadlines for \nregulatory action. This renders the notice-and-comment requirements of \nthe APA a mere formality, depriving regulated entities, the States and \nthe public of sufficient time to have any meaningful input on the final \nrules. The resulting regulatory action is driven not by the public \ninterest, but by special interest priorities, and often comes as a \ncomplete surprise to those most affected by it.\n  Sue-and-settle litigation also helps agencies avoid accountability. \nInstead of having to answer to the public for controversial regulations \nand policy decisions, agency officials are able to simply point to a \ncourt order entering the agreement and maintain that they were required \nto take action under its terms.\n  Further, the abuse of consent decrees as a method for taking \nregulatory action can have lasting negative impact on the ability of \nfuture administrations to adapt the Federal regulatory scheme to \nchanging circumstances. Not only does this raise serious concerns about \nbad public policy; it also puts into question the constitutional impact \nof one administration's actions binding the hands of its successors.\n  Sue-and-settle, and the consequences that come with such tactics, is \nnot a new phenomenon. Evidence of sue-and-settle tactics and closed-\ndoor rulemaking can be found in nearly every administration over the \nprevious few decades.\n  But there has been an alarming increase in sue-and-settle tactics \nunder the Obama administration. A study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nshows that just during President Obama's first term, 60 Clean Air Act \nlawsuits against the EPA were resolved through consent decrees or \nsettlement agreements, an increase from 28 during President George W. \nBush's second term.\n  Since 2009, sue-and-settle cases against the EPA have imposed at \nleast $13 billion in annual regulatory costs.\n  In November 2010, environmental advocacy groups filed a complaint \nagainst the EPA under the Clean Water Act to compel the agency to \nrevise wastewater regulations. Interestingly, the same day that the \ncomplaint was filed, the plaintiff-advocacy groups filed a proposed \nconsent decree already signed by the EPA and requiring prompt \nregulatory action. As is characteristic of sue-and-settle cases, \npotentially affected parties were kept out of the lawsuit and \nnegotiations. Such a scenario should raise serious concerns over how \ntruly adversarial these lawsuits really are.\n  In another case, environmental advocacy groups filed suit against the \nEPA to compel the agency to issue new air quality standards for \npollutants from coal and oil-fired power plants. The plaintiff-advocacy \ngroups alleged that the EPA had violated its statutory duty to issue \nnew standards.\n  An industry group intervened in the case to represent utility \ncompanies but was ultimately left out of subsequent negotiations \nbetween the plaintiffs and the EPA, which resulted in a consent decree. \nThe industry group challenged the consent decree on numerous grounds, \nincluding the rulemaking timeframe established under the decree\n\n[[Page S778]]\n\nwhich was arguably too short to allow the public to participate fully \nin the rulemaking process.\n  Nevertheless, the court approved and entered the consent decree, with \nthe judge concluding that ``[s]hould haste make waste, the resulting \nregulations will be subject to successful challenge. . . If EPA needs \nmore time to get it right, it can seek more time.''\n  The resulting rule, despite its opaque promulgation, was estimated by \nthe EPA to cost $9.6 billion annually by 2015. And according to \nestimates by the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, the \nrule promulgated under the consent decree would contribute to a loss of \n1.44 million jobs in the U.S. between 2013 and 2020.\n  The EPA could have done things right the first time by crafting a \nsensible, workable rule that protects the environment without causing \nunnecessary job losses or higher electricity prices for hard-working \nAmerican families. But as a result of backroom, sue-and-settle tactics, \nwe were left with a controversial regulation that fails to properly \ntake into account the impact on affected parties and that remains the \nsubject of litigation to this day.\n  The EPA, it seems, has turned a blind eye to the calls for more \ntransparency and public accountability in our Federal rulemaking \nprocess. In February 2014, EPA's General Counsel issued a statement \ndeclaring:\n\n       The sue and settle rhetoric, strategically mislabeled by \n     its proponents, is an often-repeated but a wholly invented \n     accusation that gets no more true with frequent retelling.\n\n  I think many would take issue with that assessment. In fact, the \nEnvironmental Council of the States, or ECOS--a national non-profit, \nnon-partisan association made up of State and territorial environmental \nagency leaders--adopted a resolution entitled ``The Need for Reform and \nState Participation in EPA's Consent Decrees which Settle Citizen \nSuits,'' stating, among other things:\n\n       [S]tate environmental agencies are not always notified of \n     citizen suits that allege U.S. EPA's failure to perform its \n     nondiscretionary duties, are often not parties to these \n     citizen suits, and are usually not provided with an \n     opportunity to participate in the negotiation of agreements \n     to settle citizen suits[.]\n\n  ECOS further resolved that:\n\n       [G]reater transparency of citizen suit settlement \n     agreements is needed for the public to understand the impact \n     of these agreements on the administration of environmental \n     programs[.]\n\n  I agree.\n  Clearly, the EPA has no intention of acknowledging the use or \nconsequences of sue-and-settle tactics. And unfortunately, I think this \nsentiment is shared by other executive branch agencies today.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Sunshine for Regulatory \nDecrees and Settlements Act of 2015. Senators Blunt, Hatch, Cruz, Paul, \nCornyn, Rubio, Inhofe, Fischer, Flake, Lee, Capito and Gardner are \ncosponsors of this important bill, and I thank them for their support.\n  In the House, Representative Doug Collins of Georgia is introducing a \ncompanion bill.\n  By enacting reasonable, pro-accountability measures, the Sunshine \nbill aims to address many of the problems I have outlined so far.\n  This bill provides for greater transparency by shedding light on sue-\nand-settle tactics. It requires agencies to publish sue-and-settle \ncomplaints and notices of intent-to-sue in a readily accessible manner.\n  The bill requires agencies to publish proposed consent decrees and \nsettlement agreements at least 60 days before they can be filed with a \ncourt. This provides a valuable opportunity for affected parties to \nweigh-in, which will increase public accountability in the rulemaking \nprocess. It will also prevent those scenarios where lawsuits are filed \non the same day as previously negotiated agreements, a practice that \neffectively blocks any meaningful participation by affected parties.\n  The bill also makes it easier for affected parties such as States and \nbusiness owners to take part in both the lawsuit and settlement \nnegotiations to ensure that their interests are properly represented. \nIt requires the Attorney General or, if appropriate, the head of the \ndefendant-agency, to certify to the court that he or she has personally \napproved certain proposed consent decrees or settlement agreements \nthat, for example, convert a discretionary authority of an agency into \na non-discretionary duty to act. It requires that courts consider \nwhether the terms of a proposed agreement are contrary to the public \ninterest.\n  The bill promotes greater transparency by requiring agencies to \npublicly post and report to Congress information on sue-and-settle \ncomplaints, consent decrees and settlement agreements.\n  Finally, the bill resolves key constitutional concerns by making it \neasier for succeeding administrations to modify the effect of a prior \nadministration's consent decrees. It does so by providing for de novo \nreview of motions to modify existing consent decrees due to changed \ncircumstances.\n  The Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act will shed \nlight on the problem. It will help rein in backroom rulemaking, \nencourage the appropriate use of consent decrees and settlements, and \nreinforce the procedures laid out decades ago to ensure a transparent \nand accountable regulatory process.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with me and support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 378\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

MOTIONS TO MODIFY CONSENT DECREES.\n\n       If an agency moves a court to modify a covered consent \n     decree or settlement agreement and the basis of the motion is \n     that the terms of the covered consent decree or settlement \n     agreement are no longer fully in the public interest due to \n     the obligations of the agency to fulfill other duties or due \n     to changed facts and circumstances, the court shall review \n     the motion and the covered consent decree or settlement \n     agreement de novo.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Res. 6. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relative to balancing the budget; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am introducing a resolution \nproposing a constitutional amendment to require that Congress and the \nPresident handle the American people's money more responsibly and \nbalance the Nation's debt and budget. Like the last two Congresses, the \nentire Republican Conference has cosponsored this proposal.\n  I know the Constitution sets a high threshold for Congress to propose \nan amendment, but it is critical we do so for three reasons:\n  First, piling up more debt year after year is imposing greater and \ngreater harm to our economy and to our society. Last week, \nCongressional Budget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf testified before \nthe House Budget Committee, noting that the national debt is expected \nto swell by another $7.6 trillion--trillion with a T--over the next 10 \nyears. He said:\n\n       Such large and growing national debt would have serious \n     negative consequences, including increasing Federal spending \n     for interest payments; restraining economic growth in the \n     long term; giving policymakers less flexibility to respond to \n     unexpected challenges; and eventually heightening the risk of \n     a fiscal crisis.\n\n  He is the Director of the Federal budget office and he said that on \nJanuary 21, 2015. Just think about that. And he is a Democrat. He has \nbeen a very good budget director, as far as I am concerned, and I have \nenjoyed looking at his analyses over the years.\n  Our Nation is on an unsustainable path and we simply cannot wait any \nlonger to make responsible decisions for our future.\n  Second, Washington will not keep our fiscal house in order unless \nrequired to do so by the Constitution. Congress has pretended that good \nintentions alone would keep our checkbook balanced. Congress has tried \nputting limits in place by legislation or other rules. Congress has \nstuck its head in the sand or at other times cried that the sky would \nfall if we really did get our fiscal act together. Over many decades we \nhave demonstrated that nothing short of a constitutional requirement \nwill work.\n  Third, the American people have the right to set rules for how \nWashington handles their money. The Constitution is a rulebook for \ngovernment and it belongs to the American people. Proposing an \namendment does not add it to the Constitution but only sends it to the \nStates for debate and consideration. And while it takes two-thirds of \nCongress to propose an amendment to the Constitution, it takes three-\nfourths of the States to ratify it. That high level of national \nconsensus may or may not exist, but the American people deserve the \nopportunity to find out.\n  On June 7, 1979, nearly 36 years ago, I stood on this floor when I \nintroduced Senate Joint Resolution 86, my first balanced budget \namendment. In today's dollars the budget deficit that year was $95 \nbillion and the national debt was $2.6 trillion, which was about 30 \npercent of our gross domestic product. I said then that only in \nWashington could this situation be described as anything less than \nobscene.\n  The more things change, the more they stay the same. I concede a few \nthings have changed since 1979. For example, the deficit for the \ncurrent fiscal year is six times higher than it was in 1979, and the \nnational debt is seven times as large. To put that number in \nperspective, the national debt is now larger than our entire economy.\n  The situation is not only getting worse, it is getting worse faster \nthan ever. More than 40 percent of the national debt accumulated since \nour founding has piled up under President Obama, and he has 2 more \nyears in office. While those things have changed, and changed for the \nworse, the choice before us remains the same.\n  Some of my colleagues might disagree with the CBO Director and think \nthat piling up trillions and trillions of dollars in debt is no big \ndeal; that these are just numbers in the air with no impact on the real \nworld. Perhaps they think our large and growing national debt won't \nhave any negative consequences, won't impede economic growth, won't \nrestrain policymakers' flexibility to respond to challenges, and won't \nheighten the risk of the fiscal crisis. Some of my colleagues might \nbelieve we have no obligation to handle the American people's money \nresponsibly or perhaps they believe this money belongs to government \nand not the American people at all.\n  Some of my colleagues might insist, despite decades of demonstrated \nfailure, that Congress can somehow get its fiscal act together on its \nown. One definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over \nand expecting different results.\n  Some of my colleagues might say the American people should not be \nable to set fiscal rules for the government they elect. Perhaps they \nthink the Federal Government should control the Constitution, not the \nother way around.\n  I say to my colleagues who think those things: I can understand why \nyou would oppose sending this balanced budget amendment to the States \nfor consideration.\n  But now a word to my other colleagues: If you think this growing \nmountain of debt is dangerous and must be stopped, if you believe we \nhave exhausted every other means of stopping it, and if you say the \nAmerican people have the right to decide how their government should \noperate, then I invite you to support this joint resolution, S.J. Res. \n6.\n  The Senate has on four separate occasions voted on a balanced budget \namendment since I introduced that proposal in 1979. You can see it on \nthis chart. We actually passed one in 1982 when the national debt was \n$2.5 trillion. But the House, controlled by Democrats at the time, did \nnot take it up.\n  The Senate voted on another balanced budget amendment in 1994 when \nthe national debt was $6.9 trillion. It fell a few votes short.\n  Three years later, when the national debt was $7.9 trillion, we came \nwithin a single vote of passage in 1997.\n  And in 2011, the fourth from the left there on the chart, we voted on \nthe last balanced budget amendment I introduced. At that time, the \nnational debt had grown to $15.1 trillion, and it is almost $3 trillion \nhigher today.\n\n  CBO tells us not only that the national debt will swell by an \nadditional $7.6 trillion in the next 10 years, but that interest on \nthat debt will be a larger and larger portion of the budget. The low \ninterest rates we see today, after all, will not last forever.\n  CBO warns that, on our current path, interest costs alone will \nquadruple from $200 billion today to nearly $800 billion in 10 years. \nIn only 6 years, if we do not change course, spending on interest will \nsurpass either defense or nondefense spending. Every dollar spent to \nservice debt cannot be spent protecting our country or helping our \ncitizens. This is the fiscal equivalent of fiddling while Rome burns. \nThe debt keeps growing, the danger keeps building, while Congress keeps \npretending and stalling.\n  What if we had sent a balanced budget amendment to the States in the \n1970s, 1980s, or even 1990s? How different would the budget process be \ntoday?\n  When I spoke here in June 1979, I offered two additional reasons for \nadopting a balanced budget amendment.\n  First, I said a fixed spending ceiling ``requires that Congress think \nin order of budget priorities.''\n  Second, I said:\n\n       In my mind, a balanced budget or spending limitation \n     amendment offers the potential to impose new limits upon the \n     National Government, replacing those that have largely been \n     eroded over the years.\n\n\n[[Page S781]]\n\n\n  That is why the American people have never been able to use their \nConstitution to set fiscal rules for Washington--because doing so would \nset limits the national government does not want. But our liberty \ndepends on setting and enforcing such limits.\n  I will repeat what I said here in 1979:\n\n       This is certainly not a trivial objective. Rather, it goes \n     to the heart of what our system of government is going to be \n     in the future.\n\n  That is the choice before us, and before the American people.\n  I have to say that if we look at the current budget, it is a fraud \nthe President has submitted. It is pathetic. And even with that current \nbudget, saying they are going to save us money, we are about a half \ntrillion dollars in debt--in further debt, I might add. It is piling up \nin irreducible ways. It is something we have to do something about. We \ncan no longer sit around and pretend that, somehow, Congress is going \nto take care of it, when Congress doesn't have the will to take care of \nit. A balanced budget amendment is an important part of changing that.\n  I will speak later on the actual amendment and what it says and what \nit means and how it will work. I believe it is an appropriate way of \nbringing this country under control and getting us to live within our \nmeans. It will take time even if we start today. But we are not \nstarting today.\n  This administration cannot get anywhere near what it wants in this \nbudget without a huge tax increase. We have had tax increase after tax \nincrease after tax increase, and it never makes a dip in the Federal \ndebt. We have to wake up around here and start doing some things right, \nor this country--the greatest country in the world--will not be able to \nremain so. But it has to.\n  If we look at the rest of the world--we are in terrible shape \nthroughout the rest of the world. There is no other country in this \nworld that can lead like ours can--except for evil. There are countries \nthat can really lead, but they would lead for evil. We have got to stop \nthat. And the only way we can is to have a nation that lives within its \nmeans, does what is right, and balances its budget. It is going to take \nyears, if we pass this amendment, to balance the budget. If the \namendment gets passed and then is supported by three-quarters of the \nStates--38 States--this amendment will do the job.\n  Whatever we do, it is going to be tough. But that is better than a \nprofligacy that is continuing to go along under all kinds of phony \narguments that, when we look back on them, are really phony. They act \nas though they are really trying to do something about this, while \nspending us into bankruptcy, and more and more causing us to not be \nable to live within our means.\n  We have got to change this, and I am convinced the only way we will \nis with a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. It is the only \nway we can find enough people in this country who respect the \nConstitution to cause the result that we live--or at least start \nliving--within our means.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/04/senate-section/article/S781-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S781-S783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 65--SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO BRING AN END TO VIOLENCE \n  PERPETRATED BY BOKO HARAM, AND URGING THE GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA TO \n         CONDUCT TRANSPARENT, PEACEFUL, AND CREDIBLE ELECTIONS\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Coons, Mr. Isakson, Mr. \nBoozman, and Mr. Durbin) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S. Res. 65\n\n       Whereas Nigeria is the most populous nation in Africa, with \n     the largest economy;\n       Whereas the Governments of the United States and Nigeria \n     have had a strong bilateral relationship, and Nigeria has \n     been a valued partner of the United States since its \n     transition to civilian rule;\n       Whereas the Government of Nigeria is currently confronted \n     with threats to internal security by terrorists, insurgents, \n     and communal violence that have caused considerable \n     population displacement, and at the same time must administer \n     transparent and peaceful elections with a credible outcome;\n       Whereas the government and those who aspire to hold office \n     in Nigeria must demonstrate the political will to address \n     both of these challenges in a responsible way, including by \n     ensuring full enfranchisement, with particular emphasis on \n     developing a means for enfranchisement for the hundreds of \n     thousands displaced by violence;\n       Whereas the members of Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati \n     wal-Jihad, commonly known as Boko Haram, have terrorized the \n     people of Nigeria with increasing violence since 2009, \n     targeting military, government, and civilian sites in \n     Nigeria, including schools, mosques, churches, markets, \n     villages, and agricultural centers, and killing thousands and \n     abducting hundreds of civilians in Nigeria and the \n     surrounding countries;\n       Whereas the Department of State named several individuals \n     linked to Boko Haram, including its leader, Abubakar Shekau, \n     as Specially Designated Global Terrorists in 2012, and \n     designated Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization \n     (FTO) in November 2013;\n       Whereas, in May 2014, the United Nations Security Council \n     added Boko Haram to its al Qaeda sanctions list, and on \n     January 19, 2015, the United Nations Security Council issued \n     a presidential statement condemning the recent escalation of \n     attacks in northeastern Nigeria and surrounding countries and \n     expressing concern that the situation was undermining peace \n     and security in West and Central Africa;\n       Whereas the over 200 school girls abducted by Boko Haram on \n     April 14, 2014, from the Government Girls Secondary School in \n     the northeastern state of Borno, whose kidnapping sparked \n     domestic and international outrage spawning the Twitter \n     campaign #BringBackOurGirls, are still missing;\n       Whereas the militant group is an increasing menace to the \n     countries along Nigeria's northeastern border, prompting the \n     African Union, the Lake Chad Basin Commission, the European \n     Union, and the United Nations Security Council to recognize \n     that there must be a regional response;\n       Whereas the United States Government has stepped forward to \n     offer assistance through intelligence sharing, bilateral and \n     international sanctioning of Boko Haram leaders, \n     counterterrorism assistance through the Global Security \n     Contingency Fund program for countries in the region to \n     counter the militant group, and humanitarian services to \n     populations affected by and vulnerable to Boko Haram \n     violence;\n       Whereas Boko Haram emerged partially as a response to \n     underdevelopment in northeastern Nigeria, and inequality, \n     elite impunity, and alleged human rights abuses by security \n     forces may be fueling anti-government sentiment;\n       Whereas it is clear that a military approach alone will not \n     eliminate the threat of Boko Haram, and gross human rights \n     abuses and atrocities by security forces causes insecurity \n     and mistrust among the civilian population;\n       Whereas it is imperative that the Government of Nigeria \n     implement a comprehensive, civilian security focused plan \n     that prioritizes protecting civilians and also addresses \n     legitimate political and economic grievances of citizens in \n     northern Nigeria;\n       Whereas Nigeria is scheduled to hold national elections in \n     February 2015, and the elections appear to be the most \n     closely contested in Nigeria since the return to civilian \n     rule;\n       Whereas election-related violence has occurred in Nigeria \n     in successive elections, including in 2011, when nearly 800 \n     people died in clashes following the presidential election;\n       Whereas President Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, General \n     Muhammadu Buhari, and other presidential candidates pledged \n     to reverse this trend by signing the ``Abuja Accord'' on \n     January 14, 2015, in which they committed themselves and \n     their campaigns to refraining from public statements that \n     incite violence, to running issue-based campaigns that do not \n     seek to divide citizens along religious or ethnic lines, and \n     to supporting the impartial conduct of the electoral \n     commission and the security services;\n       Whereas Secretary of State John Kerry visited Nigeria on \n     January 25, 2015, to emphasize the importance of ensuring the \n     upcoming elections are peaceful, nonviolent, and credible;\n       Whereas tensions in the country remain high, and either \n     electoral fraud or violence could undermine the credibility \n     of the upcoming election;\n       Whereas the people of Nigeria aspire for a fair, \n     competently executed, and secure electoral process, as well \n     as an outcome that can be accepted peacefully by all \n     citizens; and\n       Whereas it is in the best interest of the United States to \n     maintain close ties with a politically stable, democratic and \n     economically sound Nigeria: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns Boko Haram for its violent attacks, \n     particularly the indiscriminate targeting of civilians, \n     especially women and girls, and the use of children as \n     fighters and suicide bombers;\n       (2) stands with--\n       (A) the people of Nigeria in their right to live free from \n     fear or intimidation by state or nonstate actors, regardless \n     of their ethnic, religious, or regional affiliation;\n       (B) the people of Cameroon, Chad, and Niger who are \n     increasingly at risk of becoming victims of Boko Haram's \n     violence; and\n       (C) the international community in its efforts to defeat \n     Boko Haram;\n\n[[Page S782]]\n\n       (3) supports the Abuja Accord, and calls on candidates, \n     party officials, and adherents of all political movements to \n     comply with the code of conduct spelled out therein, by \n     refraining from any rhetoric or action that seeks to demonize \n     or delegitimize opponents, sow division among Nigerians, or \n     otherwise inflame tensions;\n       (4) condemns any and all abuses of civilians by security \n     forces of the Government of Nigeria;\n       (5) urges the Government of Nigeria--\n       (A) to conduct timely, credible, transparent, and peaceful \n     elections;\n       (B) to refrain from using security services for political \n     purposes in connection with the elections;\n       (C) to prioritize the safety and security of Nigerians \n     vulnerable to Boko Haram attacks;\n       (D) to implement a comprehensive, civilian security focused \n     response to defeat Boko Haram that addresses political and \n     economic grievances of citizens in the north;\n       (E) to improve the capacity and conduct of Nigeria's \n     security forces, including respect for human rights, and take \n     steps to hold accountable through a transparent process those \n     members of the security forces responsible for abuses;\n       (F) to recognize that security forces are intended to \n     protect the safety and security of all citizens equally; and\n       (G) to cooperate with regional and international partners \n     to defeat Boko Haram;\n       (6) urges all Nigerians to engage in the electoral process, \n     to insist on full enfranchisement, and to reject inflammatory \n     or divisive rhetoric or actions; and\n       (7) reaffirms that the people of the United States will \n     continue to stand with the people of Nigeria in support of \n     peace and democracy.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I am here today to speak to the \ntroubling situation in Nigeria, one of our strongest allies in Africa \nsince its transition from military dictatorship to civilian rule over a \ndecade ago.\n  Nigeria is currently facing two grave threats to its stability. \nFirst, the country is preparing to vote next month in the most closely \ncontested presidential election in recent history, but there is a very \nreal danger of prolonged violence across Nigeria and mass casualties if \nthe election results are not deemed credible.\n  Second, in the last 2 months, Boko Haram, infamous for kidnapping \nover 200 schoolgirls in Chibok in 2014, has stepped up its murderous \nscorched-earth campaign, killing thousands of innocent civilians, \ngaining control over an increasing amount of territory in the \nnortheastern portion of the country, and threatening to disrupt \nelections.\n  It is in the face of these dual challenges, that I, along with \nSenators Isakson, Shaheen, Boozman and Coons, have submitted a \nresolution which calls on Nigerian leaders to step-up to the plate and \nshow real leadership in prioritizing the safety and security of \nNigerians in the elections and doing everything possible to combat Boko \nHaram.\n  For over 5 years, Boko Haram has shocked the conscience of the world \nand terrorized Nigerian citizens of all religions and ethnic groups. It \nhas targeted schools, mosques, churches, markets, villages and \nagricultural centers with a wave of kidnappings, killings and suicide \nbombs. Boko Haram terrorists have abducted hundreds, including the \nChibok girls, who to this day remain missing; and has killed \nthousands--by some accounts over 6,000 last year alone and, since 2009, \nmore than a million have been displaced.\n  In January, Boko Haram staged a 4 day assault on the northeastern \ntown of Baga, abducting civilians, and forcing thousands to flee. \nEyewitnesses claim as many as 2000 dead, though the government disputes \nthis number. Satellite photographs show disturbing images of towns \nburned and razed. What began as a localized insurgency that targeted \nthe military and government has grown into a sub-regional menace. Boko \nHaram has metastasized, effectively denying the government control over \na significant swathe of territory in the three most affected states of \nnortheast Nigeria, and undertaking bold incursions into neighboring \ncountries. The Nigerian government's response has been ineffective at \nbest. At worst, the actions of the security forces, who have been \naccused of alarming excesses, may have exacerbated the problem. These \nare things the Nigerian government must acknowledge and address if they \nwant to end the reign of Boko Haram in communities most affected by the \nterrorist group.\n  The international community, the African Union, European Union, the \nLake Chad Basin Commission, and United Nations Security Council--have \nall recognized that there must be a regional response to Boko Haram. On \nJanuary 26, AU Commission Chairwoman Dlamini Zuma said that Boko Haram \nis a threat to the whole continent. Just days ago, the AU Peace and \nSecurity Council approved a 7500 strong regional force to combat the \ngroup. Recent U.S. efforts to provide assistance have been unilaterally \nrebuffed. Clearly, the international community is concerned and \nengaged. What is not so clear is the commitment of the Nigerian \ngovernment to a thoughtful strategy of engagement.\n  During my meeting with President Jonathan at last year's African \nLeaders' Summit, I urged him to implement a comprehensive approach to \naddress the Boko Haram insurgency--one that addresses both the security \nthreat as well as the legitimate grievances of local communities. At \nthe end of the day, Nigerian officials must come to terms with the fact \nthat a military solution alone will not solve the problem. To date, the \ngovernment does not appear to have formulated a comprehensive strategy, \nand as a result, the insurgency continues to gain momentum.\n  Against this backdrop of government inaction and Boko Haram's \nunspeakable terrorism raging in the north, presidential elections are \nscheduled for February 14. For the first time since Nigeria \ntransitioned from military rule to democracy in 1999, a unified \nopposition party will challenge the ruling People's Democratic Party, \nPDP. This election will test the strength of an electoral process that \nhas been marred by violence. In 2011, more than 800 people were killed \nin clashes that followed what international observers deemed to be the \nmost free, fair, and best-administered elections to date.\n  Despite the history of electoral violence, the Nigerian Government \nhas yet to implement reforms recommended by the Independent National \nElectoral Commission, INEC. INEC itself has taken a number of steps to \nimprove the legitimacy of the voting process, including conducting \nwidespread voter registration programs and introducing biometric voter \nidentification cards. INEC is engaged in a valiant effort to distribute \npermanent voter cards in time for next month's elections, and we should \ncontinue to support such efforts until the job is done to protect the \nlegitimacy and integrity of the elections.\n  National Security Advisor Sambo Dasuki has said the voter card \ndistribution is too slow, and recently suggested that the elections be \npostponed. I think this suggestion has understandably raised suspicion \nand skepticism as to his motives and those of the PDP given that the \nrace between President Jonathan and his challenger, Muhammadu Buhari, \nis by all accounts close to a dead heat. It is true, however, that \nincreasing violence in three northern states threatens to \ndisenfranchise a significant number of voters. And it is unclear how \nthose who have been internally displaced will be given the opportunity \nto vote. In my view, there must be an effort to develop a consensus \nabout how these twin challenges should be addressed or Nigerians may \nwell dispute the results.\n  The two leading presidential candidates have made a public commitment \nto non-violence during the elections. They should be commended for \ntheir verbal assurances, and they should be held responsible if they \nrenege. As Secretary Kerry said in Lagos at the end of last month, \n``the international community is paying very close attention to this \nelection.''\n  Nigeria has the largest economy and is the most populous country in \nAfrica. So goes, Nigeria, so goes West Africa. We cannot, from a \nstrategic standpoint, afford for it to fail. That is why the \ninternational community must continue to urge Nigerian political \nleaders to listen to all voices, regardless of ethnic, religious, or \nregional affiliation, and to safeguard the right of the Nigerian people \nto shape their own destiny.\n\n[[Page S783]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/04/senate-section/article/S783-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 66--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF \nFEBRUARY 12, 2015, AS ``DARWIN DAY'' AND RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF \n                 SCIENCE IN THE BETTERMENT OF HUMANITY\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I am especially pleased to see that the \nSenator from Utah is presiding this afternoon because I come to the \nfloor today to offer a resolution which is his inspiration, really, and \non which I am pleased to be working with him.\n  Simply put, this is a resolution to establish a majority vote on \nPresidential nominations. This would establish by rule the Senate \ntradition of approving Presidential nominations by a simple majority \nvote. The rules change we propose would establish by rule this \ntradition of approving Presidential nominations of Cabinet Members and \njudges by a simple majority vote, which existed from the time Thomas \nJefferson wrote the rules in 1789 until 2003, when Democrats began \nfilibustering Federal Circuit Court of Appeals nominees.\n  Most importantly, it would change the rules in the right way, through \na two-thirds vote, which is what the existing rules of the Senate \nprovide. Unfortunately, on November 21, 2013, Democrats broke the \nSenate rules without even attempting to get the 67 votes required to \nchange the rules, which caused former Senator Carl Levin, a Democrat \nfrom Michigan, to say at the time, quoting former Senator Arthur \nVandenberg of Michigan, that ``if a majority of the Senate can change \nits rules at any time, there are no rules.'' We are the Nation's \nrulemaking body. If we cannot follow our own rules, how can we expect \nthe American people to show respect for and follow the rules we help to \ncreate?\n  The proposal Senator Lee and I have made will be considered by the \nSenate Committee on Rules and Administration, according to the Senator \nfrom Missouri, Senator Blunt, the chairman of the Rules Committee. It \nwould ultimately require a two-thirds vote of the Senate to change the \nSenate rules. This all has to do with the so-called nuclear option.\n  If I might say an additional word about the so-called nuclear option, \nI came to the Senate in 2003, which was when our Democratic friends \ndecided they would use cloture, which requires 60 votes to cut off \ndebate, as a way of denying a Presidential nomination on a Federal \ncircuit judge. It had never in the history of the Senate been used \nbefore in that way. Cloture had been used twice, I believe, based on my \nresearch, to deny a sub-Cabinet member a position in the 1990s, but \nthat was the first time it had ever been used on any such position with \nthe exception of Abe Fortas.\n  It is important, given all the misinformation that has been spread \nabout the nuclear option, to know what the facts are. The tradition has \nalways been in the Senate that Presidential nominations deserved an up-\nor-down, 51-majority vote. That has basically been the tradition. Even \nwith the most controversial nominations, such as that of Clarence \nThomas, the Supreme Court Justice--I believe the vote was 52 to 48--\nthere never was a suggestion that someone might use cloture to require \nit to be 60 votes. Cloture didn't apply to nominations until 1949, so \nit was never used between the time Jefferson wrote the rules at the \nbeginning of the Senate and 1949.\n  It was first used in 1968, but not really. President Johnson was \ntrying to save face for Abe Fortas, his friend who was a Supreme Court \nJustice. He had nominated him for Chief Justice. A problem came out, \nand President Johnson engineered a 45-to-43 cloture vote, which Fortas \n``won.''\n  That is really the only exception in the whole history of the Senate \nuntil 2003, when the Senate said it is going to take 60 votes to \nconfirm a Presidential nomination for a judge rather than the \ntraditional 51.\n  I have talked to several of my colleagues on the other side about \nthis issue. They are fairly straightforward about why they did it. They \nthought President George W. Bush's nominees were ``too conservative.''\n  I knew some of those judges--Judge Pickering of Mississippi, for \nexample. He put his children into a public school in Mississippi in the \n1960s, and he was being accused of being a segregationist when he was \nactually leading the charge in his State of Mississippi to desegregate \nthe public schools.\n  William Pryor of Alabama was a law clerk for Judge John Minor Wisdom. \nI know the distinguished Senator from Utah, who was a Supreme Court law \nclerk, knows of Judge Wisdom. He was regarded by everyone as one of the \nfinest Federal circuit judges in the country. He had the greatest \nrespect for William Pryor. He would have been shocked to hear what was \nsaid about him at the time.\n  It was a shocking thing to me to arrive in the Senate in 2003 and \nfind my friends on the other side of the aisle for the first time in \nSenate history saying it would take 60 votes to confirm President \nBush's judges. I strongly objected to that. I even suggested that if a \nfew Senators on this side and a few Senators on that side would work \ntogether, we could break the stalemate. A Gang of 14 was created. It \ndid break the stalemate, but as a result, five judges nominated by \nGeorge W. Bush were not confirmed because the other side decided they \ndidn't like their philosophical views. So instead of a 51-vote margin, \nthey required 60, and so they weren't confirmed.\n  This is the tally in the history of the Senate. The number of Supreme \nCourt nominees in the history of our country who have ever had their \nnomination denied by filibuster, by a cloture vote, is zero, with the \nexception of the Fortas nomination, if you want to\n\n[[Page S784]]\n\ncount that. Not a single one. Supreme Court nominations are among the \nmost controversial nominations ever before the Senate.\n  The number of Cabinet members who have ever had their nominations \ndenied by a filibuster, by requiring 60 votes in the history of the \nSenate--zero. Not one. Not an Obama nominee. Not a Clinton nominee. Not \na Bush nominee. Zero. Not one.\n  Let's go to district judges. There has been a lot of talk about \ndistrict judges and how difficult it was for President Obama to have \ndistrict judges confirmed. There is no truth to that whatsoever. I was \nin the Senate; I know that. I will give an example. There was an effort \nto deny a seat to a judge from the State of Rhode Island by 60 votes, a \njudge whom I didn't support, but I and a group of other Republicans \nmade sure we did not use cloture to deny a seat to a President's \ndistrict judge nominee for the first time in history, and so we did \nnot.\n  So the number of Federal district judges in the history of the United \nStates who have ever had their nomination denied by a filibuster, by \nthe 60-vote cloture rule, is zero.\n  So Supreme Court Justices, except for Fortas, Cabinet members, \ndistrict judges--zero. Filibusters have not been widely used in the \nhistory of this Senate to deny a President his nomination. However, \nthere are other problems that nominations have.\n  I was nominated once. I came to be nominated to be the Secretary of \nthe Department of Education. A Senator from Ohio, Senator Metzenbaum, \nput a so-called secret hold on my nomination and held me up for 3 \nmonths, but then when I came to the floor, I was confirmed. We have \nabolished those kinds of secret holds. We have made changes in the \nrules to make it easier for the President's nominees to be confirmed.\n  There have been seven sub-Cabinet members, including John Bolton--\nthree Republicans and four Democrats--who have had their nominations \nrejected because of a cloture vote, all since 1994. So no Cabinet \nmembers, no Supreme Court Justices, no district judges, seven sub-\nCabinet members.\n  What is the score on circuit judges? This is what brought up the fuss \nin 2003 when the Democrats filibustered 10 nominations because they \nwere too conservative. As I mentioned earlier, five were confirmed and \nfive were rejected as part of the compromise. Since that time, \nRepublicans have rejected two Democrats. So the score is the Democrats \nhave rejected five Federal Circuit judges and Republicans rejected two. \nRepublicans actually rejected three others, but that led to the events \nof November 21, 2013, when the Democrats broke the rules to change the \nrules.\n  It would be as if in a Super Bowl or in a playoff game, let's say, \nSeattle gained 9 yards and they needed 10, so they changed the rules \nbecause they were the home team and said that is a first down. No one \nwould have any respect for the game if they did that, and no one will \nhave any respect for the Senate if we keep doing that, which is the \npoint Senator Lee and I would like to make because the tradition of the \nSenate has always been to give to a President the prerogative of \nallowing his nominations to be confirmed by 51 votes or a simple \nmajority of Senators duly chosen and sworn. We propose to change the \nrule to reflect the tradition of the Senate.\n  Some say: Well, why don't you do to them what they did to you?\n  I don't think that is a very good way to live your life. I mean, if \nthe Democrats did the wrong thing, if they brought the Senate to its \nknees, if they made the Senate into a place that doesn't follow its own \nrules, then we should do that to them? No. I think what we should do is \nreplace bad behavior with good behavior, and good behavior means we \nadopt changes to the rules in the way the rules require, which is, in \neffect, 67 votes or two-thirds of the Senators present and voting.\n  So we will be offering our resolution, as we do today. We will be \noffering it in the Senate Rules Committee. We hope the Senate Rules \nCommittee will approve it and report it to the floor. We hope Senator \nMcConnell will find time on the floor to bring it up. We hope that 67 \nof our colleagues will agree with it. We will show the country that we \nknow how to follow our own rules and that we know how to take the \ntradition of the Senate, which has been there since Thomas Jefferson \nwrote the rules, with very few exceptions, to make sure that \nPresidential nominees are entitled to an up-or-down vote by a majority \nof the Senate. That has been the rule, that has been the tradition, and \nthat should be the rule, and the rules should be changed in the way \nthat rules are supposed to be changed.\n  There is one other issue I wish to mention without going into any \nlength about it. What happened in the Senate on November 21, 2013, was \nthe lowest point in the Senate that I have seen. The majority decided \nthat because it didn't have the votes to put three judges--liberal \njudges--on the DC Court of Appeals, it would break the rules to change \nthe rules, and it just put them there anyway. It pretended that the \nreason it did that was because President Obama couldn't get his \nnominees confirmed.\n  Well, on every Senator's desk is an Executive Calendar. Everyone who \ncan be confirmed has been reported by a committee to the floor and is \nlisted on the Executive Calendar. There is only one way to get on this \ncalendar--there was only one way on November 21, 2013, and that was for \na Democratic majority in a committee to report a nominee to the floor \nof the Senate. That was the only way you could get there. Republicans \ncouldn't do it; only the Democrats could. So on November 21, 2013 the \ncalendar was filled only with people the Democratic majority had \napproved of.\n  There was only one way for anyone to get off the Executive Calendar \nand onto the floor of the Senate to be confirmed, and that was for the \nDemocratic leader, the majority leader, to move to do that. We can't \nobject to that. We have to vote on it. There is no motion to proceed \nwith a nomination; he can bring it up anytime he wants to.\n  The charge was made that there was a big backlog of people on this \ncalendar. Well, here are the facts, and anyone who doubts it can look \nat the Executive Calendar for November 21, 2013, and they will see what \nthe backlog was. There were 78 regular order nominations on November \n21, 2013. Fifty-four of those nominees had been on the calendar less \nthan 3 weeks. Sixteen had been on the calendar between 3 and 9 weeks. \nEight had been on the calendar for more than 9 weeks.\n  There was an informal agreement between the floor staffs that 40 of \nthe uncontroversial nominees on this calendar--40 of the 78--could be \nconfirmed before the Senate left at the end of the week.\n  Let me use a specific example--district judges. We hear a lot about \ndistrict judges. We had changed the rules at the request of the \nmajority leader to make it easier to confirm district judges. We \nbasically said that there could only be 2 hours of debate on a district \njudge and the majority could give back 1 of those hours.\n  On the date the Democrats said there was a big backlog, there were 13 \ndistrict judges on the calendar. Those were the only ones who could \nhave been brought up by the majority leader. One had been waiting for \nmore than 9 weeks. Four had been waiting for between 3 and 9 weeks. \nEight had been waiting for less than 3 weeks. But the important point \nis that we could have confirmed them all over the weekend. All the \nmajority leader had to do was to move the nomination of each of the 13, \nwait an intervening day, and then if they did that on Thursday, the \nintervening day would be Friday, and then we would come back on Monday \nand we would have 1 hour of debate for each of those nominations. So \nthere was no excuse. There was no backlog.\n  The Washington Post and the Congressional Research Service said that \nPresident Obama's nominees were moving through the Senate at about the \nsame speed that President Clinton and President George W. Bush's \nnominees had been at that time in their terms. That is what the \nCongressional Research Service and the Washington Post said.\n  The calendar speaks the truth about the absence of a backlog. And I \nwas involved three times in working to change the rules to make it \neasier to do Presidential nominations. It was nothing more than a power \ngrab. So our friends should just admit that and admit that it was the \nwrong thing to\n\n[[Page S785]]\n\ndo for the Senate. A lot of Senators weren't here then.\n  The resolution Senator Lee and I have proposed gives the Senate a \nchance to abandon bad behavior and begin to adopt good behavior, to \ntake a tradition of the Senate that has been followed almost without \nexception since 1789 and make it the order of the day and to do it the \nway the Senate rules say it should be done--with 67 votes.\n  In closing, let me simply say that I appreciate the fact that I am \nable to work on this with Senator Lee. This legislation developed \nreally from a conversation and a suggestion he made to me on the floor \nof this Senate. I thought about it, and I said: I think you may be \nright about that. We worked together, and because of his background in \nthe law and his experience in the Supreme Court, his leadership on this \nissue has been invaluable.\n  I thank the Senator for his suggestions, I thank him for his \nleadership, and I look forward to working with him when it comes before \nthe Senate Rules Committee. I hope we can persuade our fellow Senators \nin a bipartisan way that a good way to begin this year would be to \nbegin to change the rules the right way and to reject the bad behavior \nand bad habits of the last session of Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly in support of this \nresolution. First of all, I wish to thank my distinguished colleague, \nthe senior Senator from Tennessee, for his leadership in introducing \nthis legislation. The Senator from Tennessee has shown great leadership \non this issue. With his mastery of the Senate rules, his familiarity \nwith the procedures of the Senate, the Senate's history, and his love \nfor the Senate as an institution, the sponsor of this measure \nunderstands and appreciates the importance of maintaining order in the \nSenate. It is to this issue I would like to speak briefly.\n  When the Senate made this change in November of 2013, what happened \nwas all of a sudden we had a split--a split that occurred between on \nthe one hand the wording of the rule itself that governs cloture, on \nthe other hand the precedent by which the Senate purports to be \ngoverned. So separate and apart from what the history tells us--from \nhow often the Senate either has or hasn't used cloture on the Executive \nCalendar--there is this separate distinction that has now arisen.\n  The cloture rule says it takes three-fifths--a vote of three-fifths \nof the Senators--to bring end to debate on a particular matter. The \nrule itself makes no distinction between the Executive Calendar and the \nlegislative calendar. It makes no distinction between ordinary \nlegislative business where we are legislating and making law on the one \nhand and on the other we are meeting to decide whether to confirm a \nPresidential nominee. The rule doesn't distinguish, but the precedent \nnow does.\n  When our colleagues on other side of the aisle voted in November \n2013, appealing the ruling of the Chair, they reversed the precedent. \nThey acted contrary to the language of the rule itself. This creates a \ncertain amount of uncertainty, and that uncertainty I think needs to be \nresolved. We don't want to operate in an environment in which we have \nthe rule saying one thing and the Senate precedent saying another \nthing.\n  So it was out of a certain amount of practical necessity that we \nlooked to this as an alternative. In order to bring Senate practice \nback into harmony with the rules of the Senate, the best way we could \ncome up with to do that would be to change the language of the rule.\n  Of course to change the language of the rule it takes 67 votes. While \nwe are not certain what is going to happen, this is perhaps the only \nthing we could think of that could possibly get 67 votes--67 Senators \nsaying yes, we can do that.\n  So it is very important that we have rules that are clear--rules that \nwill apply regardless of who is in the White House, regardless of which \nparty happens to control the majority of the seats in this body. If, \nafter all, we are making the rules that would govern the country, if, \nafter all, we are being asked to confirm Presidential nominees to high \npositions, we need to be following our own rules.\n  We have to remember also that one of the things we have prided \nourselves on, one of the things that has distinguished the Senate from \nother legislative bodies--we call ourselves the world's greatest \ndeliberative legislative body--is because from the very beginning this \nhas been the kind of place where in theory we will continue to debate \nthings as long as basically any one Member wants to continue to debate. \nCloture is an exception to that. Cloture allows for three-fifths of the \nSenators present to decide it is time to bring the debate to an end, \neven if a minority of Senators want to continue. But it requires a \nsupermajority.\n  There are many reasons to do this, but one of the reasons I think is \nimportant to point out is because it protects the right of each Senator \nto continue to offer improvements, to point out flaws and offer \npotential improvements to legislation--the amendment process. The \namendment process is itself of course different in the context of \nlegislation than it is in the context of a Presidential nominee.\n  I am personally not aware of any means by which one can amend a \nnominee. I am not aware of any process by which one can confirm a \nPresidential nominee's right hand but not his left.\n  I support this change. I think this change is important for this body \nand for the continuity of the Senate rules and I am grateful to the \nsenior Senator from Tennessee for his efforts in this regard, which I \nwholeheartedly support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/04/senate-section/article/S785-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S785-S786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 68--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n JANUARY 24, 2015, ATTACKS CARRIED OUT BY RUSSIAN-BACKED REBELS ON THE \n CIVILIAN POPULATION IN MARIUPOL, UKRAINE, AND THE PROVISION OF LETHAL \n             AND NON-LETHAL MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO UKRAINE\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON (for himself and Mrs. Shaheen) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S. Res. 68\n\n       Whereas Russian-backed rebels continue to expand their \n     campaign in Ukraine, which has already claimed more than \n     5,000 lives and generated an estimated 1,500,000 refugees and \n     internally displaced persons;\n       Whereas, on January 23, 2015, Russian rebels pulled out of \n     peace talks with Western leaders;\n       Whereas, on January 24, 2015, the Ukrainian port city of \n     Mariupol received rocket fire from territory in the Donetsk \n     region controlled by rebels;\n       Whereas, on January 24, 2015, Alexander Zakharchenko, \n     leader of the Russian-backed rebel Donetsk People's Republic, \n     publicly announced that his troops had launched an offensive \n     against Mariupol;\n       Whereas Mariupol is strategically located on the Sea of \n     Azov and is a sea link between Russian-occupied Crimea and \n     Russia, and could be used to form part of a land bridge \n     between Crimea and Russia;\n       Whereas the indiscriminate attack on Mariupol killed 30 \n     people, including 2 children, and wounded 102 in markets, \n     homes, and schools;\n       Whereas any group that fires rockets knowingly into a \n     civilian population is committing war crimes and is in \n     violation of international humanitarian law;\n       Whereas, even after the Russian Federation and the Russian-\n     backed rebels signed a ceasefire agreement called the Minsk \n     Protocol in September 2014, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, \n     General Philip Breedlove, reported in November 2014 the \n     movement of ``Russian troops, Russian artillery, Russian air \n     defense systems, and Russian combat troops'' into Ukraine;\n       Whereas, on January 24, 2015, NATO Secretary General Jens \n     Stoltenberg stated, ``For several months we have seen the \n     presence of Russian forces in eastern Ukraine, as well as a \n     substantial increase in Russian heavy equipment such as \n     tanks, artillery, and advanced air defense systems. Russian \n     troops in eastern Ukraine are supporting offensive operations \n     with command and control systems, air defense systems with \n     advanced surface-to-air missiles, unmanned aerial systems, \n     advanced multiple rocket launcher systems, and electronic \n     warfare systems.'';\n       Whereas, on January 25, 2015, after Russian-backed rebels \n     attacked Mariupol, European Council President Donald Tusk \n     wrote, ``Once again appeasement encourages the aggressor to \n     greater acts of violence; time to step up our policy based on \n     cold facts, not illusions.'';\n       Whereas, on November 19, 2014, at a Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate confirmation hearing, Deputy National \n     Security Adviser Anthony Blinken stated that the provision of \n     defensive lethal assistance to the Government of Ukraine \n     ``remains on the table. It's something we're looking at.'';\n       Whereas the Ukraine Freedom Support Act (Public Law 113-\n     272), which was passed by Congress unanimously and signed \n     into law by the President on December 18, 2014, states\n\n[[Page S786]]\n\n     that it is the policy of the United States to further assist \n     the Government of Ukraine in restoring its sovereignty and \n     its territorial integrity to deter the Government of the \n     Russian Federation from further destabilizing and invading \n     Ukraine and other independent countries in Central and \n     Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central Asia; and\n       Whereas the Ukraine Freedom Support Act authorizes \n     $350,000,000 in fiscal years 2015-2017 for the President to \n     provide the Government of Ukraine with defense articles, \n     defense services, and military training for the purpose of \n     countering offensive weapons and reestablishing the \n     sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, including \n     anti-tank and anti-armor weapons; crew weapons and \n     ammunition; counter-artillery radars; fire control and \n     guidance equipment; surveillance drones; and secure command \n     and communications equipment: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the attack on Mariupol by Russian-backed \n     rebels;\n       (2) urges the President to provide lethal and non-lethal \n     military assistance to Ukraine as unanimously supported by \n     Congress in the Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014 (Public \n     Law 113-272);\n       (3) calls on the United States, its European allies, and \n     the international community to continue to apply economic and \n     other forms of pressure on the Russian Federation, especially \n     in the form of sanctions, if the Government of the Russian \n     Federation continues to refuse to cease its aggression in \n     Ukraine;\n       (4) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     immediately end its support for the rebels in eastern \n     Ukraine, allow Ukraine to regain control of its \n     internationally-recognized borders, and withdraw its military \n     presence in eastern Ukraine; and\n       (5) expresses solidarity with the people of Ukraine \n     regarding the humanitarian crisis in their country and the \n     destruction caused by the military, financial, and \n     ideological support of the Government of the Russian \n     Federation for the rebels in eastern Ukraine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/04/senate-section/article/S786-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 249.

(a) The Congress finds that--\n       (1) under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n     (Public Law 111-148), many individuals and businesses are \n     required to purchase health insurance coverage for themselves \n     and their employees;\n       (2) individuals who were unlawfully present in the United \n     States who have been granted deferred action under the \n     Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program undertaken by \n     the Executive Branch and who then receive work authorization \n     are exempt from these requirements;\n\n[[Page S798]]\n\n       (3) many United States employers hiring United States \n     citizens or individuals legally present in the United States \n     are required to either offer those persons affordable health \n     insurance or pay a penalty of approximately $3,000 per \n     employee per year; and\n       (4) an employer does not have to provide insurance, or in \n     many instances pay a penalty, if they hire individuals who \n     were not lawfully present but who have been granted deferred \n     action under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \n     Program and work authorization.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) this disparate treatment has the unacceptable effect of \n     discouraging the hiring of United States citizens and those \n     in a lawful immigration status in the United States; and\n       (2) the Executive Branch should refrain from pursuing \n     policies, such as granting deferred action under the Deferred \n     Action for Childhood Arrivals Program and work authorization \n     to unlawfully present individuals, that disadvantage the \n     hiring of United States citizens and those in a lawful \n     immigration status in the United States.\n       Sec. 582.  It is the sense of the Congress that the \n     Director of United States Citizenship and Immigration \n     Services (USCIS) should--\n       (1) stop putting the interests of aliens who are unlawfully \n     present in the United States ahead of the interests of aliens \n     who are following proper immigration laws and procedures by \n     adjudicating petitions and applications for immigration \n     benefits submitted by aliens unlawfully present in the United \n     States. When USCIS adjudicators and resources are used to \n     adjudicate petitions and applications for aliens who are \n     unlawfully present, the time it takes to process petitions \n     and applications submitted by other aliens is significantly \n     increased and a backlog is created. In addition, it is unfair \n     to use the fees paid by other aliens to cover the costs of \n     adjudicating petitions and applications for aliens unlawfully \n     present in the United States; and\n       (2) use the funds available under existing law to improve \n     services and increase the efficiency of the immigration \n     benefits application process for aliens abroad or who are \n     lawfully present in the United States.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Homeland \n     Security Appropriations Act, 2015''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/04/senate-section/article/S798-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, we are in an odd world. Our Democratic \ncolleagues continue to have the gall to suggest and state that the \nRepublicans are blocking funding for homeland security in America when \nnothing could be further from the truth.\n  I guess they have gotten away with blaming Republicans for blocking \nthings, so they just keep on saying it. But the House has fully funded \nall the legal policies and programs within Homeland Security, and they \nsent the bill over here.\n  What did they do? They simply said: You can't take money out of \nhomeland security enforcement for immigration and border security, and \nspend it on activities that violate the law, that undermine immigration \nlaw, that in fact are contrary to immigration law--that the President \nhas said he intends to do no matter what Congress does, no matter what \nthe American people want. He says he is going to do it anyway. They \nsimply say we are not going to fund that.\n  So it comes over to pass. It fully funds the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. It doesn't change any of the laws in Homeland Security--and \nthey say this is being obstructed by the Republicans.\n  But look. What does the media say about it? How is it being reported?\n  Here is Politico: ``Democrats filibuster Department of Homeland \nSecurity bill.'' That was yesterday. And that is exactly what is \nhappening. They are filibustering the bill and saying Republicans are \nblocking it, when all that the Republicans are saying is: Let's get on \nthe bill. We can't even get on the bill so amendments can be offered \nbecause they are filibustering the motion to proceed to the bill, \nblocking us even getting on the legislation so amendments can be \noffered.\n  If they are not happy with anything in the bill--the language the \nHouse put in or anything else--they can offer amendments to deal with \nit and strike it out.\n  That is what Politico said.\n  How about the New York Times. They are always favoring Democratic \nimmigration policies. This is their headline: ``Senate Democrats Block \nRepublicans' Homeland Security Bill.'' Isn't that true? That is exactly \ntrue.\n  How about the Atlantic. I think this is almost amusing: ``The New \nDemocratic Obstructionists.'' That is the headline in their \npublication.\n  So I would push back at this. Are we through the looking glass? Are \nwe down the rabbit hole into never-never land? Where are we?\n  My good friend Senator Schumer, one of our able advocates here--and I \nreally admire him. But this is what he said earlier today:\n\n       The right wing of the Republican party is risking a D.H.S., \n     a Department of Homeland Security, shutdown to get their way \n     on immigration.\n\n  This is how Senator Schumer framed it:\n\n       They're saying take our hard right stance on immigration or \n     we won't fund national security.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       We think the American people are on our side. We're willing \n     to have that debate.\n\n  Well, why don't we have it? Why don't we bring the bill up and let's \nhave the debate if he wants to offer amendments contrary to what the \nHouse did?\n  But remember, the House didn't do anything but say we are going to \nspend money on all the programs in Homeland Security. It didn't defund \nany of them. It didn't change any of those rules.\n  So, is it really true? Do only rightwing Republicans want to end the \nPresident's unlawful actions? No, no, no. That is not what the truth \nis.\n  Why don't I share with our colleagues here what many of our \nDemocratic Senators have said about the President's unlawful action. \nHere is what the junior Senator from Indiana said:\n\n       It is clear the immigration system in this country is \n     broken, and only Congress has the ability to change the law \n     to fix it . . . I am as frustrated as anyone that Congress is \n     not doing its job, but the President shouldn't make such \n     significant policy changes on his own.\n\n  That was just November last year.\n  The senior Senator from Missouri said:\n\n       Our immigration system is broken, and I support a \n     comprehensive plan to fix it, but executive orders aren't the \n     way to do it.\n\n  The senior Senator from West Virginia:\n\n       I disagree with the President's decision to use executive \n     action to make changes to our immigration system.\n\n  The junior Senator from North Dakota:\n\n       I'm disappointed the president decided to use executive \n     action at this time on this issue. . . . It's Congress' job \n     to pass legislation and deal with issues of this magnitude.\n\n  Isn't that true.\n  The junior Senator from Maine:\n\n       I also have constitutional concerns about where \n     prosecutorial discretion ends and unconstitutional executive \n     authority begins.\n\n  Well, I share that thought.\n  The junior Senator from Minnesota:\n\n       I have concerns about executive action. . . . This is a job \n     for Congress.\n\n  The senior Senator from Virginia:\n\n     . . . the best way to get a comprehensive solution is to take \n     this through the legislative process.\n\n  So are those right-wingers? Are those people who can't be trusted to \nput the public interest first? Are they exaggerating? Are they somehow \nall in error to question the power of the Presidency to execute this \npolicy?\n  No, and I will cite one more national leader that is well known. I \nwould cite President Obama himself, who on 20\n\n[[Page S800]]\n\ndifferent occasions said he did not have power to do what he now has \ndone. So Congress is not passing any new law. Congress is not passing \nany new power. Congress is simply saying: Mr. President, you cannot \ncreate new laws and fund new programs that are contrary to existing \nlaw, in violation of existing law, and in violation of the wishes of \nthe American people and the decided actions of Congress itself.\n  Remember all these ideas were presented to Congress, and Congress \nrejected them. They were elected to represent the people of the United \nStates of America, and they rejected these policies. So why should \nCongress fund the President, who goes and does what they now reject?\n  Well, Senator Schumer says he believes the American people are on his \nside, or ``our side,'' the obstructionist side, the side that is \nblocking Homeland Security.\n  Let's look at the polling data. This is a poll from Paragon Insights. \nThe question to the American people was: Should you focus on bettering \nwork situations for Americans? Should that be our focus and not \nimmigration advancements or expansion. Among Democrats, 64 percent said \nyes. Among Independents, 75 percent said yes.\n  What about this: Do you believe providing amnesty encourages illegal \nimmigration? Democrats, 63 percent. Is that part of the great rightwing \nconspiracy? How about Independents--68 percent; Republicans, 88 \npercent.\n  How about this: Do you believe illegal immigrants take jobs from \nvulnerable citizens? Democrats, 57 percent; Independents, 73 percent.\n  How about this one: Do you believe amnesty is disastrous and \nunconstitutional? Democrats, 53 percent; Independents, 70 percent.\n  How about the question that illegal immigrants take jobs from \nvulnerable citizens. What do Hispanics say about that? Mr. President, \n65 percent of Hispanics agree with that.\n  What about the question that providing amnesty encourages illegal \nimmigration? We all know that it does, and 63 percent of Hispanics \nagree with that. What about the question: Amnesty will hollow out the \nmiddle class. We had a lot of talk about what to do with the middle \nclass. Ask the middle class what they think for a change. Will amnesty \nhollow out the middle class? Independents--not Republicans, not \nDemocrats, not rightwingers--73 percent agree; 62 percent of Hispanics \nagree with that statement.\n  This idea somehow that the American people support blocking the \nHomeland Security bill to protect the President's unlawful Executive \namnesty, that the American people support the Democrats in doing that \nis not true. The data shows that, and that is consistent with my \nunderstanding.\n  How about this question in a poll by Kellyanne Conway's polling \ncompany, a nationwide survey: ``President Obama recently said that he \nmay go around Congress and take executive action on immigration \npolicy.'' This was done back in August of last year. ``Which do you \nsupport more: President Obama changing immigration policy on his own, \nor President Obama working with Congress to change immigration \npolicy?'' Well, 74 percent said he should work with Congress. Only 21 \npercent said he should do it on his own.\n  How about Independents? How about the Independents--not conservative \nrightwingers? What do they view as to whether the President should work \nwith Congress and pass a law in the orderly business according to \nlegitimate processes or do it on his own? Among Independents, 81 \npercent said he should work with Congress, and only 14 percent say he \nshould do it on his own.\n  So this idea that somehow the American people are all in support of \nPresident Obama's outrageous actions, which he himself 20 times said he \nhad no power to do but did anyway, is just false. It is not true, and \nit is not true the Republicans are blocking the Homeland Security bill, \neither. The Democrats are filibustering the bill, not allowing it to \ncome to the floor so even an amendment can be voted on.\n  What do our colleagues do? They seem to think that if they say the \nRepublicans are causing it to happen, then the media will accept it. \nBut the media is not accepting this, and nobody is accepting this. And \nI hope the Democratic colleagues who openly question this policy will \nre-evaluate where they stand and think back.\n  Isn't this the thing to do? Let's move to the bill, and then we can \ndebate all the language and all the issues that are relevant and see \nwhere we go from there--not just block the bill. So I would urge \ncolleagues to think that through and change their view from what they \nhave been doing, which is supporting unanimously a filibuster.\n  Now there is some simple Paragon Insights polling data. It asked a \nsimple policy question without reference to Republicans and Democrats \nor President Obama. What did they find in their poll, by a 50-point \nmeasure?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I didn't know we had a time limit.\n  By a 50-point margin voters want to pass legislation making it harder \nto hire workers now illegally in the country--71 to 21. They want us to \nprotect American workers, to make it harder for businesses to hire \npeople unlawfully in the country. We are not doing any of that. The \nPresident has given an Executive order that provides 5 million people \nwith work authorizations, Social Security cards, Social Security \nnumbers, and the right to take any job in America when we have a \nshortage of jobs in America.\n\n  Female voters support this action by a 3-to-1 margin. Hispanic voters \nsupport the measure by a 19-point margin, 56 to 37 percent. I would say \nblue-collar voters, people who go to work every day, strongly oppose \nthe President's action by more than a 3-to-1 margin. One in three Obama \nvoters opposes his Executive action, overall.\n  We are not going to stop. President Obama does not have the authority \nto do this. It is a challenge institutionally to this body. No matter \nwhat you feel about amnesty or providing benefits for people here \nunlawfully, it is Congress's job, and we have to face up to it and \nwrestle with it.\n  Some say that if we don't approve it, then we are not facing up to \nit. I don't agree. I think it is worth discussing and voting on it. So \nfar Congress has rejected the President's ideas of how it should be \nhandled. I think they will continue to do so. The American people \noverwhelmingly want the Congress to defend their interests, to defend \ntheir right to work, to defend their declining wages, and to do \nsomething about the wages that are declining, to do something about the \ndifficulty their children have in finding a decent job--even college \ngraduates. We don't have a shortage of workers in this country; we have \na shortage of jobs in this country. That is absolutely clear.\n  We can do this country a great service, and we can do the struggling, \nhurting middle-class workers a great service if we slow down a bit in \nthis unlawful immigration flow. We have a generous lawful flow. Let's \nend the lawlessness and protect them, and maybe their wages will begin \nto rise, for a change, instead of falling, as they have done for a \ndecade.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Mr. President. First, let me say to my \nfriend from Alabama, I couldn't agree more that we need to focus on \njobs. There is no question about it.\n  I couldn't agree more that we need to have a legal immigration system \nthat works and that protects Americans first, in terms of jobs, people \nwho are here legally, whether it is those working in agriculture, \nwhether it is those working in manufacturing or any other part of our \neconomy. We can very quickly, if the new majority wants to, bring an \nimmigration bill and address it. I think there are 68 of us, if I \nremember right, who voted for a pretty big bipartisan effort last year, \na major effort to actually fix a very broken system. There were \nimportant protections in there for American workers. It is something \nthat would have been incredibly important to get done and to put those \nprohibitions in. So this is not about that.\n  It is very simple. The majority could very quickly pass the funding \nfor Homeland Security to keep us safe and\n\n[[Page S801]]\n\nimmediately go to the issue of immigration, and I would support it \nwholeheartedly, as would colleagues on this side of the aisle.\n  Here is what we don't support: holding the security of our country \nhostage while others debate policy, frankly, that was already agreed to \nby the majority of the Senate last year. Regardless of your feelings \nabout the immigration policies, if you ask folks at this time, when \nterror threats are all around us, do they want games being played with \nthe funding of our homeland security, the answer would be no--a \nresounding no.\n  So let's get on with the business in a bipartisan way of funding our \nnational security effort, and then let's immediately go to a vigorous \nand important debate about immigration. I would agree that should be \ndone as soon as possible.\n  Since the attacks of 9/11 in 2001, we have had a Department of \nHomeland Security that we organized and put together to play a critical \nrole in protecting America against acts of terror. Make no mistake, as \nI said, we have terrorist threats all around us, yet, unfortunately, \nour Republican colleagues are willing to shut down our Homeland \nSecurity Department to make a political point.\n  Yesterday ISIS released a video showing the horrendous burning of a \nJordanian pilot. It was unbelievable. But while that is happening, the \nSenate can't pass a Homeland Security funding bill. We need to pass a \nHomeland Security bill. Colleagues who are fighting about immigration \nare willing to shut down Homeland Security in order to make a point \nwith the President.\n  This past weekend ISIS beheaded a Japanese contractor. Yet \nRepublicans are willing to shut down Homeland Security to make a point. \nLast week at a hotel in Libya an American was killed in an attack by \nISIS. Yet colleagues on the other side of the aisle are willing to shut \ndown Homeland Security in order to make a political point. Last month \n11 people were killed in a terrorist strike against America's oldest \nally, France. Yet Republicans are willing to shut down Homeland \nSecurity.\n  In November, a Canadian soldier was killed in an attack near the \nCanadian Parliament, just 60 miles from the U.S. border. Michigan is on \nthat northern border. Yet Republicans are willing to shut down Homeland \nSecurity. In fact, we heard Republicans in the House say it wouldn't be \nthat big of a deal to shut down Homeland Security. Really? Anybody who \nreads the paper or watches the news can see what is happening every day \naround us, and Republicans in the House say it wouldn't be a problem to \nshut down Homeland Security? That is stunning.\n  Detroit, MI, has the busiest northern border crossing in the country. \nIt is the busiest northern border crossing for commerce, products, and \npeople. We rely on our Customs and Border Patrol every single day. \nCustoms and border security, airport security, and police and \nfirefighters are on the frontlines every day protecting us. Let's not \nforget about the Coast Guard. All those folks are on the frontlines \nprotecting our families in America. That is what we are debating.\n  Do we want to play games with that? Do we want to hold Homeland \nSecurity hostage because of a debate with the President on another \nissue or do we fund Homeland Security and then have that debate? We can \ndo it immediately--the same day. We could fund Homeland Security and \nthen the Republican leader could immediately call up any bill he wants \non immigration and then have that debate. Unfortunately--with terrorist \nthreats all around us--Republicans are willing to shut down Homeland \nSecurity.\n  Boko Haram is gaining strength in West Africa and hoping to inspire \nattacks against Americans. We know what they have done. Yet here we are \ndebating whether Homeland Security is going to be shut down.\n  In the months to come, we will need all of the hard-working men and \nwomen who work in every part of that agency to be full speed so they \ncan protect us. Unless Republican colleagues are willing to support a \nspending bill and get that done right away, we are going to see the \nDepartment of Homeland Security management and headquarters stop \nfunctioning. Some 30,000 employees will be furloughed. People will be \nasked to work without pay--talk about jobs for people.\n  In Detroit alone--and all over Michigan--we get firefighter grants. \nThe budget has already started, and we have 150 firefighters in the \ncity of Detroit alone whose ongoing funding has been stalled. We have \nfirefighters all across Michigan. We have very important law \nenforcement grants all over Michigan that at the moment are on hold and \ncan't go forward.\n  We are talking about disrupting programs used to detect weapons of \nmass destruction and the training of local law enforcement officers who \nare on the frontlines of our defense. This makes no sense.\n  It would be one thing if Republican colleagues were in the minority \nand they felt the only way we could have the debate they want to have \nis to tie the two together, but that is not the case. Republican \ncolleagues are in the majority. We can pass Homeland Security \ntogether--100 to 0--and then get on to whatever immigration debate the \nmajority wants to have or whatever else they would like to debate. We \ndon't have to hold the Homeland Security funding hostage in order to do \nit.\n  This past August our Defense Secretary said of ISIS:\n\n       They are as sophisticated and well-funded as any group we \n     have seen. They're beyond just a terrorist group.\n\n  When we think about it, we are talking about a well-funded terrorist \ngroup at the same time we are debating whether to fund our Homeland \nSecurity agencies that keep us safe from ISIS and other terrorist \nthreats.\n  I implore Republican colleagues to join with us, regardless of the \npassion on this other issue. We can debate it. It can be addressed.\n  There are Republican majorities in the House and Senate that can \ndebate the President's actions or debate anything for that matter, but \nwe can certainly debate immigration at any moment. We do not have to \nhold the funding for the national defense of our homeland hostage to do \nit.\n  I encourage my colleagues to get on to the business of passing the \nfunding.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/04/senate-section/article/S801-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10:30 A.M.
