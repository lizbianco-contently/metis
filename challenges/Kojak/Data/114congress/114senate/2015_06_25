Mr. President, in less than 18 months, Americans all over \nthe country will cast their ballots in the 2016 elections. This \nexercise fulfills one of the most basic promises of our constitutional \ndemocracy: that all citizens have the right to vote, regardless of \nrace, gender, or social status.\n  This right to vote and the guarantee that each vote counts equally is \nthe foundation of our form of government. It ensures that as this \ncountry changes, the elected officials who represent its citizens will \nalso reflect those changes. The electorate should be able to elect \nthose who represent them, their thoughts, and their ideals. Yet, there \nis an ongoing effort all over America to obstruct the work of \nperfecting our Union by hindering progress where it is needed the most.\n  We see this reflected in the debate about whether the Confederate \nflag--a symbol of bigotry and racism--still has a place on public \nlands. There should be no debate. The answer to this question is no. \nAnd that matter should have been settled long ago. It was not. It took \nthe deaths of nine innocent people, perhaps, to move this issue \nforward.\n  We see this reflected in the debate about whether gay people have the \nright to marry. After all that has gone on, there should be no debate \nin this regard. The answer to this question is yes. The matter should \nhave been settled long ago.\n  We see this reflected in the insidious fight to keep certain citizens \nfrom exercising their constitutional right to vote by instituting voter \nID laws. There should be no debate. The answer to this question is no \npoll tax or any sort of maneuver designed to prevent voting should \nexist anyplace at any time. That matter was settled long ago--or at \nleast we thought it was.\n  The fight is not new. It is deeply rooted in our Nation's history. I \nfinished many years ago now a book, ``Freedom Summer,'' about these \ncourageous, brilliant young men and women who went to Mississippi and \nspent one summer. It pointed out how the people of Mississippi at that \ntime would do anything they could to keep an African American from \nvoting. That is wrong. The Constitution now grants women and citizens \nof all races the right to vote. There have long been efforts to \nundermine that right. We also see it playing out in State capitols \nacross the country. Districts are being gerrymandered to ensure that \nminority votes have the least possible impact on election outcomes. We \nhave seen it playing out in courtrooms, where the Voting Rights Act has \nbeen under attack.\n  Congress passed the Voting Rights Act 50 years ago--hard to believe \nbut 50 years ago. Historically, it is one of the country's most \nimportant laws--or was an important law. It aimed to clear the path to \nthe ballot box for all citizens who choose to vote. But 2 years ago, \nthe Supreme Court, in one of their questionable decisions, struck down \na crucial section of the Voting Rights Act, in a 5-to-4 decision in the \ncase of Shelby County v. Holder. As a result of the Court's decision, \nit is now easier for States to enact laws making it harder for citizens \nto vote, and they have taken that way past where they should have. \nVoter ID, shortening the time for early voting--they are doing so many \ndifferent things to prevent people from voting. It is hard to believe \nthere would be efforts made to stop people from voting.\n  In the States where we have same-day registration, I am not aware of \na single case--not a single case of any type of fraud. The voter \nturnout where we have same-day registration is tremendous.\n  In the Presiding Officer's State and my State, there have been \nefforts made over the years to make sure that 30 days before an \nelection, either a primary or general, no more registrations. How \nridiculous. I personally have tried to get that changed for decades, \nbut no luck. The county clerks from 15 rural counties have enough juice \nin the State legislature to prevent that from happening. It is too bad. \nWhy in the world\n\n[[Page S4620]]\n\nshould we stop registration a month before an election? Election day is \nwhen people are so excited about voting. So I am really very \ndisappointed in what is happening in my own State regarding keeping \npeople from voting.\n  The Voting Rights Act was very important, but now it is harder and \nharder for people to vote. There is little question that Republican-\ncontrolled State legislatures have taken advantage of this decision. I \nrepeat: In States all across this country, Republican-controlled State \nlegislatures have passed burdensome voter ID laws that target minority \nvoters especially, college students especially, and many other groups, \nto prevent them from voting.\n  In Ohio--a State that experienced the longest voting lines in the \nNation, even longer than the questionable Florida election--the \nRepublican legislature scaled back early-voting hours in an effort to \nkeep people from voting. The legislature in North Carolina eliminated \nsame-day registration when it worked so well and the turnout--it helped \nsignificantly. How can we work to form a more perfect union when some \nStates actively work to prevent our fellow citizens from voting?\n  We have a moral obligation to protect the right to vote for every \nAmerican citizen. Our country is stronger when every eligible voter \nparticipates. The Dean of the Senate, Senator Leahy, has introduced \nrobust legislation to repair the damage from the Supreme Court's Shelby \nCounty decision. I am happy to support the efforts made by the senior \nSenator from Vermont. His bill will restore the heart of the Voting \nRights Act. It will create a new nationwide coverage formula that \napplies to any State with repeated voting rights violations in the last \n25 years. It will also establish a targeted process for reviewing \nvoting changes and also any changes these jurisdictions make all around \nthe country that have a record of discrimination against voters. This \nbill requires reasonable public notice for voting changes and also \nallows the Attorney General to request Federal observers to be present \nin places where a serious threat of racial discrimination may occur.\n  We must do everything we can to restore and reestablish and defend \nthe Voting Rights Act. Congress must act to protect one of the most \nimportant legislative accomplishments of the civil rights era. We \nshould ensure that every American has equal access to the ballot. It is \nthe right thing to do. As Dr. King said many years ago, ``There comes a \ntime when one must take a position that is neither safe nor politic, \nnor popular, but he must take it because conscience tells him it is \nright.'' To push forward, under the words of Dr. King, is so important.\n  Let's do everything we can to have people vote. Let's stand together \non increasing, not diminishing, one's ability to vote. Why? Because it \nis the right thing to do.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the road to yesterday's win for the \nmiddle class on TPA was never going to be an easy one. It was hardly a \nquick one.\n  We always knew that was going to be the case, but I thought we owed \nit to the working men and women of our country to push ahead anyway. So \nwe did. Through every bump and twist along the way, Republicans and \nDemocrats held together.\n  In achieving something that can open more opportunities for working \nfamilies, we proved the growing power of good ideas in the new \nRepublican Congress. In passing legislation that can facilitate the \nlowering of barriers and the lifting up of our workers in the 21st \ncentury, we proved that this is a new Congress that is back to work on \nbehalf of the American people.\n  Passing trade wasn't the first bipartisan achievement of this new \nCongress, and it won't be the last, but it is significant. It opens the \ndoor for more wins for the middle class as trade negotiators move \nforward under this President and, importantly, under the next President \nas well.\n  I thank everyone who worked with us to get here on both sides of the \naisle. It is thanks to continued cooperation and no end of \ndetermination that we were able to achieve another important \naccomplishment for our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4620-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WARRIOR GAMES 2015\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, \nyesterday I had the pleasure of meeting with some of our Nation's \nheroes. These men and women are taking part in Warrior Games 2015, an \nannual DOD-organized sporting event for both veterans and wounded, ill, \nand injured servicemembers from every corner of the country. This \nyear's games featured approximately 250 athletes from the Army, Navy, \nCoast Guard, Air Force, and Marine Corps. All of these wounded warriors \ngave it their all in heated competition. Their bravery and their \nperseverance through adversity serve as a source of inspiration to the \nrest of us. Their determination serves as a continuing reminder that \nheroism endures long after events on the battlefield.\n  It was a great honor to meet some of these courageous athletes and \ntheir families yesterday afternoon. They were here in the Capitol. I \nshared the thanks of a grateful nation with many men and women who wear \nour Nation's uniform or who recently have. I shared my personal \ngratitude as well, because their heroism and their sacrifice represent \nan enduring source of freedom for every other American.\n  I hope they never forget it. I hope they are reminded when looking \nout to cheering crowds on the field, because America won't forget what \nthe men and women who stood in our defense have given all of us for our \nfreedom.\n  So let us hope that our Nation will always find brave warriors like \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4620-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on one final matter, Saturday, June 27, \nis Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Day.\n  Sadly, post-traumatic stress disorder is an affliction that touches \ntoo many of our veterans. Raising awareness of PTSD and combatting the \nmyths and misinformation that surround it are incredibly important. \nThere are effective treatments for PTSD, and all of us can do a few \nsimple things in honor of PTSD Awareness Day.\n  First, we can learn more about PTSD by getting the facts on the \ncondition and its treatment. We can also reach out to somebody who \nmight have PTSD or be at risk, particularly among the veterans \ncommunity. And, finally, we can pass along what we learned to others to \ncontinue to raise awareness.\n  So I hope Americans will take action on this PTSD Awareness Day to \nshed some light on an often misunderstood condition and hopefully to \nreach out to someone in need.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today in this great country of ours the \nAffordable Care Act--ObamaCare--has survived the latest partisan \nattempt to deny health coverage to working families. Millions of \nworking families won today. America won today. The Supreme Court ruled \nagainst Republicans who were seeking to strip 6.5 million Americans of \nthe subsidies that enable them to buy health insurance coverage. \nAmerica won, I repeat, very pure, very simple.\n  More than 10 million Americans are covered in the exchanges operating \nacross the country, many of them insured for the first time, and 85 \npercent of these men and women receive tax credits that help them \nafford that coverage.\n  On top of that, 12 million more Americans now have coverage through \nthe Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Programs. The Commonwealth \nFund recently found that more than 8 in 10 adults--four-fifths--of \npeople who have these programs are satisfied with them. The Affordable \nCare Act is not perfect. No law ever is. But this law is working for \nmillions--approaching 20 million--Americans.\n  Once again, the Affordable Care Act prevailed. So I say to my Senate \ncolleagues, respectfully--and I mean that--stop banging your heads \nagainst the wall. This legislation passed. It is the law of this \nNation. Stop. Move on. Republicans should pause for a minute and look \nback.\n  I don't know the number anymore. I don't know, I lost count--is it \n75? It is certainly approaching 100--of the actual votes which have \ntaken place to repeal the law. Never even came close to passing, but \nthey have done it time and time again. Stop it. Think of the time \nwasted doing it. As Einstein said, the pure definition of insanity is \nsomeone who keeps doing the same thing over and over again and gets the \nsame results.\n  I would hope the Republicans would rethink what they have been up \nto--their reckless, cynical attempts to increase taxes on millions of \nmiddle-income families. That is what it amounts to.\n  I was interested in looking at the paper today regarding what \nRepublicans have suggested doing if the Supreme Court ruled against \nthis law. Every one of them, without exception, would be a tremendous \nblow to the budgeting process of America. This bill makes America \nmoney. It has cut the deficit significantly. That is why I say it makes \nthe country money. It allows for a more healthy nation.\n  Republicans weren't content to jeopardize the health of Americans in \nneed of coverage assistance in order to exact political revenge against \nPresident Obama. They were happy trying to do that. I also think it is \nimportant to note that Republicans who worked on this legislation in \nthe process going through the committees here admitted that the \nlegislation drafters never discussed withholding subsidies in the \nmanner suggested by the plaintiffs. Republicans who worked on the \nlegislation said that.\n  So I think the public has basically had it with Republicans trying to \ntake away a law that protects them from insurance company \ndiscrimination when they get sick or hurt. Enough is enough.\n  I had a ``Welcome to Washington.'' I have them every Thursday. I had \na group of people here from Nevada who have family members who suffer \nfrom cystic fibrosis. They were able to tell me that for the first time \nin the lives of their children they could not be denied insurance. They \nare adults now. They can't be denied insurance coverage because of this \nlaw. If this had been repealed, people with cystic fibrosis and many \nother diseases would not be able to get health insurance. So let's move \non. Stop this. Stop wasting the time of the American people by trying \nto repeal the law.\n  I appreciate the work done by the Supreme Court, a 6-to-3 decision. \nIt was a good decision, a strong decision that upheld the law. Enough \nis enough. Let's move on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4621-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, that we are even discussing another of \nObamaCare's self-inflicted brushes with the brink--yet again--is the \nlatest indictment of a law that has been a rolling disaster for the \nAmerican people, a rolling disaster for the American people.\n  Today's ruling will not change ObamaCare's multitude of broken \npromises, including the one that resulted in millions--literally \nmillions--of Americans losing the coverage they had and wanted to keep. \nToday's ruling will not change ObamaCare's spectacular flops--\nspectacular flops--from humiliating Web site debacles to the total \ncollapse of exchanges in States run by the law's loudest cheerleaders. \nToday's ruling will not change the skyrocketing costs in premiums, \ndeductibles, and copays that have hit the middle class so hard over the \nlast few years.\n  The politicians who forced ObamaCare on the American people now have \na choice: They can crow about ObamaCare's latest wobble toward the edge \nor work with us to address the ongoing negative impact of a 2,000-page \nlaw that continues to make life literally miserable--miserable--for so \nmany of the same people it purported to help.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I have two very brief comments. One \ninvolves our national security and the world at large and the other \ninvolves our Nation as a whole.\n  First, as to the Supreme Court ruling. I am surprised. I am \ndisappointed. But the ruling is now in. Senator McConnell said it well: \nThis doesn't mean ObamaCare is fixed; it means it is going to continue \nuntil somebody\n\n[[Page S4622]]\n\nfinds a better way or we are going to be left with ObamaCare for the \nrest of our lives and children's lives and those who follow.\n  The 2016 race domestically will be centered on health care as the \nmost dominant domestic issue in the country. If you are running for the \nHouse, if you are running for the Senate or if you are running for \nPresident, here is what this Supreme Court ruling means: If the public \nwants to continue ObamaCare--which I think would be a huge mistake--\nvote Democrat. If you want to repeal and replace ObamaCare with \nsomething better for you and your family, bipartisan, vote Republican.\n  Hillary Clinton, the most likely Democratic nominee, will make \nObamaCare her own. Whomever the Republican Party may nominate, the one \nthing I can assure you is that they will repeal and replace ObamaCare \nwith something better.\n  So to the people of the United States: You finally have a chance to \nhave your say. This election in 2016 for the House, the Senate, and the \nWhite House will give you a chance to stop ObamaCare and replace it \nwith something better for you and your children. Take advantage of this \nopportunity. Because if we fail to have the people in place in 2016 to \nchange course, ObamaCare becomes cemented in terms of the American \nhealth care system and our economic future.

Mr. President, as I speak, Secretary Kerry is on his way \nto Geneva to try to conclude nuclear negotiations with the Iranian \nregime.\n  To Secretary Kerry: I urge you to suspend negotiations until we clear \nup two matters.\n  No. 1, the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini said on state-run \ntelevision in Iran, yesterday and the day before, ``All economic, \nfinancial and banking sanctions, implemented either by the United \nNations Security Council, the United States Congress or the \nadministration, must be lifted immediately when the deal is signed.'' \nSecretary Kerry, would you please tell the Ayatollah that is \nunacceptable and repudiate that statement before you negotiate any \nfurther.\n  The Iranian Parliament, several days ago, passed draft legislation \nprohibiting the international community from having access to Iranian \nmilitary facilities to determine the state of the Iranian nuclear \nprogram. Secretary Kerry, please suspend negotiations until the Iranian \nGovernment repudiates this concept. The P5+1 should be firm in these \nareas: There will never be a deal signed with Iran that does not allow \nfor anytime, anywhere inspections of nuclear sites, particularly \nmilitary sites. How can you negotiate any further until they repudiate \nthe actions they have taken?\n  Please tell me--and I will send you a letter--what to tell my \nconstituents who are very worried about this. I am being overwhelmed by \nquestions: Does the Iranian Parliament action represent the position of \nthe Iranian Government? My answer would be yes. Nothing happens in Iran \nunless the Ayatollah wants it to happen.\n  So Secretary Kerry and the P5+1, please tell the Iranians that the \naction of the Parliament--the statement they have made that we will not \nbe allowed to inspect military facilities as part of a deal--is a \nnonstarter and walk away until they repudiate that. Please send a \nmessage to the Ayatollah through the negotiators that we will not lift \nsanctions until there is full compliance, until the IAEA has a chance \nto tell us about the possible military dimensions of their nuclear \nprogram. How can you lift sanctions and go forward and give them money \nuntil you know exactly what they have been up to in the past?\n  Secretary Kerry, now is a time for you and President Obama to send a \nclear message to the Iranians: repudiate these two statements or we \nwill not negotiate any further.\n  This is the most important decision any President of the United \nStates will make, and we are about to go into negotiations in the final \nstages with two thought processes on the table coming from the highest \nlevel of the Iranian Government: You will not be allowed to inspect \nmilitary facilities, and we will demand immediate sanctions relief \nbefore there is verification.\n  Those two statements coming from the Iranian leadership must be \nrepudiated--and repudiated now. Walk away, Secretary Kerry, until they \nrepudiate these statements. No more negotiations until we understand, \nis this a red line for the Iranians. Because if this is their red line, \nI will now ask you in public: Secretary Kerry, are these positions red \nlines for the Iranian Government? Have they now adopted a red line that \nyou will never be allowed to inspect military facilities as part of an \ninspection regime to determine the past development of nuclear weapons \nin Iran? Secondly, is this now a red line by the Ayatollah; that they \nwill never agree to a deal that doesn't allow for immediate sanctions \nrelief?\n  I need to know the answer to that question. Are these red lines? And \nif they are red lines, walk away. And if they are not red lines, have \nthese statements repudiated because this is the most important decision \nthe world will ever make.\n  God help us all if we enter into a deal with this regime that is not \nsound, with every i dotted and every t crossed, because the Iranians \nhave been cheating and lying about their nuclear ambitions for well \nover a decade, and at the end of the day, you can't trust the Iranians.\n  I urge as strongly as possible that the P5+1 suspend negotiations \nuntil the Iranians set the record straight and repudiate these \nstatements about denying us access to military facilities and requiring \nimmediate sanctions relief as part of any deal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit today about jobs \nand the economy and people's health care, and they are all related. We \nare in the midst of one of the slowest growth periods for the economy \nin the recent history of the United States. They just revised the \nfigures again. That makes three times the figures have been revised for \nthe last quarter. They now show a two-tenths of 1 percent growth. They \nshould be showing about 2 percent growth for the year.\n  Why is that a problem? If the economy increases by just 1 percent, it \nresults in $300 billion to $400 billion more tax revenue without \nraising taxes. That is where we need to be. When it is less than that 2 \npercent, that means we are losing that much in additional money. We \nmake these decisions on about $1,100 billion a year, and we are \noverspending that by $468 billion. That is almost 50 percent \noverspending. No family can afford to do that, no city can afford to do \nthat, and no State can afford to do that, but apparently the Federal \nGovernment can because we just borrowed more. So far, there is a lot of \nconfidence in this country that we can continue to borrow.\n  One of the areas where job growth and economy growth are impeded is \nwith health care. President Obama is disconnected from the harsh \nreality that this health care law has created for people. Almost 2 \nweeks ago, speaking about his health care law, the President said:\n\n       Part of what's bizarre about this whole thing is, we \n     haven't had a lot of conversation about the horrors of \n     ObamaCare because none of them have come to pass.\n\n  None of them have come to pass? How insulated is our President? I \njust want to emphasize what he said--none of those horror stories have \ncome to pass.\n  Apparently that message didn't make it very far because I hear a \ndrastically different story from folks across Wyoming and other parts \nof the country.\n  A rancher from Gillette complained to me that her and her husband's \nhealth insurance went up from $11,000 per year to $20,000 per year and \nthen had a deductible thrown in that was $6,500. She said: How is that \naffordable?\n  A retired nurse from Casper told me that if you add the premium \nincreases and the deductible increases, she and her husband are up \n$36,000 per year.\n  She wrote: Health care is unaffordable. It is a huge burden and \nworry. How can people afford to pay more for health care than they make \nin a year?\n  She said that ObamaCare doesn't provide them with coverage for their \nmedical needs and added that it goes\n\n[[Page S4623]]\n\nagainst everything they believe in for America.\n  A man from Cheyenne said the President's health care law is forcing \nhim to choose between paying for his health care or paying for his \nmortgage.\n  A small business owner in Newcastle said that before the affordable \nhealth care law, she could afford to pay for her employees' health \ncare. After the law went into force, she couldn't. Her employees \ncouldn't afford it, either, so they might leave for a bigger company--\nwhich probably isn't possible--and the small business owner might have \nto sell out to a bigger company, which in many of the towns in Wyoming \nalso isn't going to be possible. She loves her community and wants to \nstay an active part of it. She is discouraged by the situation this \nhealth care law has created and is asking for help.\n  We have been asking for help for several years now. The President has \nrecognized that there needs to be some help; otherwise, there will be \nsome real calamities. Why haven't they happened? Well, some of them \nhave. I have described some of them to you. But some of them haven't \nhappened. That is because the President has given waivers on some of \nthe things that he knows are atrocious and will cause a huge problem \nwith the economy of the United States. Does he have the authority to do \nthe waivers? Not really, but he did them, and that is to put off the \ntragedies until later. That is not what we ought to be doing. We ought \nto be making health care more affordable. There are lots of plans \naround here for making it more affordable; most of those were just \ndiscarded.\n  The bill that went through here went through--there was a 60-vote \nmajority on that side of the aisle. Sixty votes is enough to pass \nanything through here. I hope neither party has a 60-vote majority \nagain because you don't have to listen to the other side. You don't \nhave to listen to the unintended consequences that might come from \nsomebody who is knowledgeable because of their background. There are a \nbunch of different backgrounds who serve here and another 435 \nbackgrounds who serve on the House side. Why do we have so many people \nin Congress? So that we have those diverse backgrounds and we can find \nthose unintended consequences and adjust for them.\n  The people I mentioned are real people, real families. They didn't \nwrite the story. They and many more like them contacted me. They are \ntelling me and they are telling all of us in Washington to do something \nabout this unworkable health care bill for millions of Americans that \nis far from affordable, breaks promises, and makes lives harder. I am \nlistening to them, and so should the torch carriers of this federally \nmandated dream that was broken before it began.\n  Today's Supreme Court ruling on King v. Burwell is surprising, but it \nreminds all of us who warned against this health care law that we will \nhave our work cut out for us to move our country away from the failed \npolicies. This law was written and implemented in its entirety by one \nparty, as I mentioned, and has been informed from the start by ideology \nrather than reality.\n  There are a number of us who were working on health care before the \nPresident even became a Senator, and we have continued to work on it. \nWe have had a lot of discarded ideas that could have increased \ncompetition and brought prices down.\n  This law was written and implemented in its entirety by one party, \nand it has been informed from the start by ideology rather than \nreality. Yet, it has fallen to us to make things better and help people \nget through these difficulties caused by this law.\n  The Federal Government cannot possibly know what is best for each \nindividual, and, as we have seen, a one-size-fits-all dictate doesn't \nwork. The Wyoming folks whose stories I just relayed and the millions \nmore like them from every State are a testament to that. That is just a \nvery small sample out of the hundreds of people who write to me or talk \nto me as I travel across Wyoming. Our focus is to offer each of them \nnew choices for quality affordable health care. Our focus is not \nprotecting this failed law, this busted political legacy. We want to \nprotect families as we get rid of ObamaCare and transition away from \nthis fiasco. That is what it is, as is illustrated by the testimonials \nthat I talked about earlier and the hundreds more that I have.\n\n  It is time for Republicans and Democrats to truly deliver on the \nPresident's broken promise of a health care system that expands access \nand promotes quality and has patient-centered care while actually \nbringing the costs down. That is possible, just not under that bill. \nThis is an opportunity for both parties to work together and put into \nplace real solutions that rely on these principles.\n  I think they just announced that one of the Federal insurance co-ops \nis going out of business. All of them are severely in the red. Those \nwould be government-sponsored entities that said too much was being \ncharged for health care by many of the insurance companies, and they \nwent for far lower premiums. The hope was that it would bring down the \nprice, but it didn't. That is not the way to encourage the kind of \ncompetition we need if we are going to bring down health care costs.\n  One of the things that has been focused on around here for a long \ntime has been small business health plans or small businesses. Small \nbusinesses are the ones that are really having the problem.\n  I ran into a man who said: I have a very successful business, and I \njust got a tremendous location that is only 50 miles away where I could \nopen another one. But that would put me over 50 employees, and that \nputs me in a different category on health care costs. The people who \nare working for me like the health care costs I am providing, and I \nwould have to go to a whole different level or pay huge fines, and I \ncan't afford to do that. So I am not going to open that other location; \nI am not going to put 50 more people to work.\n  For too long, the debate over health care has placed politics over \nthe best interests of patients. No matter the Court's ruling, it is \ntime for Democrats and Republicans to deliver what the President \npromised but ultimately failed to deliver. We need a health system that \nexpands access and promotes quality, patient-centered care while \nactually bringing down the costs. We must allow States the freedom and \nflexibility to ensure that hard-working Americans can get the care they \nneed. It is time for both parties to work together on real solutions \nthat rely on these principles. We should move forward on a bipartisan \nbasis to provide more choices and a better health care system for hard-\nworking Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor to congratulate my \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Wyoming, whom I have worked with for \nmany years and who has been a true leader in true health care reform \nwith proposals he has made that would actually help people get \naffordable care.\n  The Obama health care law, regardless of the ruling of the Supreme \nCourt, continues to be an expensive failure. There have been so many \nbroken promises by this President about health care in America, which, \nto me, is the reason this health care law--the support for it across \nthe country remains at an alltime low.\n  People were promised that if they liked their coverage, they could \nkeep their coverage. Millions have lost coverage. The President \npromised: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. Millions \nhave lost their doctors. The President said premiums would go down by \n$2,500 per family. Instead, premiums have gone up, and there is no end \nin sight.\n  When I take a look at this and say ``Why is the support so low?'' it \nis because most people believe that for them personally, it is a bad \ndeal. They are paying more in premiums, higher copays, and higher \ndeductibles, all of which makes it a bad deal for them personally.\n  I would say that ObamaCare cannot be fixed, but health care in \nAmerica must be fixed.\n  They say: What are you going to do about it as a Republican?\n  There are incredible Republican plans out there, each of which is \nmuch better than the President's health care law. We still have 30 \nmillion Americans without insurance, concerned about the fact that they \nstill need care. We are going to continue to work to repeal and replace \nthis health care law with a law that will allow people to get what\n\n[[Page S4624]]\n\nSenator Enzi had been talking about. We need patients to get the care \nthey need from a doctor they choose at lower costs. That is what \nRepublicans are committed to, and that is what Republicans, in spite of \ntoday's ruling by the Supreme Court, will continue to work for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer).

Madam President, hopefully, we can move on. After a \nPresidential election, two Supreme Court cases, 60-plus votes to repeal \nthe Affordable Care Act in the House of Representatives, and endless \ndebates here in the Senate, maybe now is the moment where Republicans \nwill choose to close the books on trying to strip away from millions of \nAmericans the benefits they have received from the Affordable Care Act. \nThis is an important day for over 10 million Americans who have health \ncare right now because of the Affordable Care Act. I would argue it is \nan important day as well for the separation of powers and the \nrecognition that it is the legislative body that sets the policy for \nthis country.\n  I just wanted to come down to the floor for a few minutes to express \nmy hope and my desire that proponents of the Affordable Care Act--such \nas myself, Senator Stabenow, and Senator Baldwin--who have come down to \nthe floor over and over during the course of the last 3 years don't \nhave to do it anymore. I would love to come down to the floor and talk \nabout the need to fix our transportation system or the need for mental \nhealth reform. I would love to talk about tax reform. I have come down \nto the floor over and over to defend the Affordable Care Act simply \nbecause it has been perpetually under attack despite the fact that its \nsuccesses are now unparalleled.\n  Justice Roberts, in the decision today--I won't quote from it at \nlength--said: ``Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve \nhealth insurance markets, not to destroy them.'' That is essentially \nthe operative phrase in today's decision. We passed the Affordable Care \nAct to improve health insurance marketplaces, not to destroy them, and \nthat is what it has done. It has improved marketplaces all across the \ncountry. Why? Because people have voted with their feet. The 10 to 11 \nmillion people who signed up for either expanded Medicare, Medicaid \ncoverage or these exchanges have shown us that the law works as \nintended because they didn't stay out or deem it to be unaffordable. \nThey stepped in and bought coverage.\n  We should now be in the business of perfecting this law. None of us, \nfrankly, think that this law is perfect. Many of us are open to \nconversations about how to make it better and how to perfect it. Now \nthat the Supreme Court has completely shut the door to a judicial \nrepeal of the act, and after having debate after debate, hopefully it \nis clear that there are not the votes--nor the support, obviously, in \nthe executive branch--to repeal the act, and we can move on to \nsomething else.\n  This is an old chart of mine that I have in the Chamber. I brought \nthis down to the floor several months ago when a colleague of ours \nsuggested that the administration shouldn't be celebrating the \nsuccesses of the Affordable Care Act, as if people receiving health \ninsurance for the first time in their life wasn't something to \ncelebrate, as if 17 million children with preexisting conditions who \nwill never have their health care taken away from them wasn't something \nto celebrate, and as if 9.4 million senior citizens who are saving $15 \nbillion on drugs isn't something to celebrate. I get excited when I \ntalk about the Affordable Care Act not only because it is a really \nsober and important topic but because when I talk to my constituents \nback home, they are excited. They are bubbling over with enthusiasm. \nThose of them who never had the chance to get health coverage before \nthe Affordable Care Act and those who worried every single night, sick \nthat their child wouldn't be able to live a normal life because their \nexistence would be obsessed with whether they were able to cover their \ncomplicated illness with insurance, are bubbling over with enthusiasm.\n  There are millions of people who are celebrating this decision today, \nand it is a sober day because, hopefully, we will be able to have a \nconversation about how we can move on to another topic. But it is a day \nto celebrate, not only for the 6.4 million Americans, first and \nforemost, who would have had their insurance taken away by an adverse \ndecision, but for all Americans who would have been caught up in an \ninsurance death spiral had the decision gone the other way.\n  I hope we can limit our discussions about the Affordable Care Act to \nways in which we can make it work better.\n  So I hope we can now spend more time talking about other topics that \nmatter to this country. I hope the House of Representatives decides to \ngive up this obsession with repealing the Affordable Care Act, which is \nsomething that is simply not going to happen. And for its opponents out \nin the field, the Supreme Court has shut the doors to a judicial repeal \nof the Affordable Care Act today.\n  I think of a lot of stories when I think about what the Affordable \nCare Act has meant to the people of Connecticut. We have cut our \nuninsurance rates in half in Connecticut. We have one of the best \nrunning exchanges in the country. But one of the simplest stories is \nthe only one I will convey as I wrap up this morning.\n  I was at the community pool that my family goes to in Cheshire, CT, \nand I was in the pool with my then 2-year-old just shortly after \npassage of the Affordable Care Act.\n  A young man about my age came up to me, and he said: Listen, I am \nsorry, Mr. Murphy, to disturb you; I know you are here with your son, \nbut I have a little boy, too, and he has a congenital heart problem. \nEvery single day since he has been born, I have worried that he \nwouldn't get to live out his dreams because his life decisions would be \ndictated by whether or not he could get insurance to cover all of the \ncomplicated health care needs he is going to have and that would be \ndeterminative of his path in life, not his dreams, his desires for \nhimself.\n  He said: I get it that this is going to help a lot of people in very \npractical and economic ways, but I just want to thank you because now I \nsleep better at night knowing that my son is going to be able to get \ncovered, that my son is going to be able to lead a relatively normal \nlife, and that he can be whatever he wants to be.\n  That is the benefit the Affordable Care Act brings people. It is not \njust practical. It is not just economic. It is not just the battle over \nwhether somebody has health insurance. It is psychological. It is peace \nof mind.\n  The Supreme Court protected 6.4 million people from losing their \nhealth insurance today, but they also protected tens of millions of \npatients and parents and sons and daughters and grandparents from \nlosing that peace of mind that comes with the protections from an \nAffordable Care Act that is working.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner).

BURWELL DECISION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, earlier today the Supreme Court issued its \nlong-awaited ruling in King v. Burwell. As we now know, the Court has \nonce again decided to rule against common sense and the plain meaning \nof statutory language in order to uphold the poorly drafted Affordable \nCare Act--which, by the way, Justice Roberts says has a lot of \nambiguity and poor draftsmanship. Even worse, with today's decision, \nthe Court's ruling failed to hold the Obama administration accountable \nfor its reckless execution of its own law.\n\n[[Page S4625]]\n\n  The plain text of the Affordable Care Act authorizes subsidies only \nthrough State exchanges, not the Federal exchange. This decision will \nallow the administration to continue to ignore the law in order to \nimplement its own preferred policies.\n  (Mrs. FISCHER assumed the Chair.)\n  As Justice Scalia said in his dissent, ``We should start calling this \nlaw SCOTUScare.'' Only Justice Scalia would come up with something like \nthat, which I find extremely humorous.\n  Justice Scalia continued, saying:\n\n       Perhaps the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will \n     attain the enduring status of the Social Security Act or the \n     Taft-Hartley Act; perhaps not. But this Court's two decisions \n     on the Act will surely be remembered through the years. The \n     somersaults of statutory interpretation . . . they have \n     performed will be cited by litigants endlessly, to the \n     confusion of honest jurisprudence. And the cases publish \n     forever the discouraging truth that the Supreme Court of the \n     United States favors some laws over others, and is prepared \n     to do whatever it takes to assist its favorites.\n\n  I couldn't have said it any better myself.\n  Needless to say, I am disappointed at this decision, as I know many \nthroughout the country are, but at the same time I am undeterred.\n  As I said on the floor last week, ObamaCare has been nothing but a \nlong series of broken promises that include skyrocketing costs, reduced \naccess to care, and more government mandates hanging over our health \ncare system.\n  Today's ruling changes none of that. Just because the Court decided \nto misinterpret, in my opinion, the statute doesn't mean that the law \nsuddenly works and that all is now right with the world. For the good \nof our health care system and hardworking taxpayers throughout our \ncountry, we still need to chart a new course on health care policy. \nUnfortunately, with the current occupant of the White House, those \nkinds of reforms are not currently possible.\n  But make no mistake, Republicans in Congress have a plan to help the \nAmerican people by repealing ObamaCare and replacing it with reforms \nthat will put patients--not Washington bureaucrats--in charge of their \nown health care decisions.\n  I am coauthor of the Patient CARE Act, a legislative proposal that \nwould replace ObamaCare with real reforms that would actually reduce \nhealth costs without all the burdensome mandates that have come part \nand parcel with the so-called Affordable Care Act--which is anything \nbut affordable. Moving forward, I, along with the coauthors of this \nproposal, Senator Burr and Chairman Upton over in the House, will \ncontinue to seek input from experts and stakeholders and use every \nopportunity to give States more freedom and flexibility.\n  Once again, any workable reform must lower costs and put patients \nfirst. That is the only way we will end the negative consequences of \nObamaCare and help the American people move past this misguided attempt \nat health care reform.\n  The American people deserve better, and Republicans in Congress are \nunited in our commitment to make sure we do better on health care \nreform in the future.\n  Now, I had suspected that this is the way the court would decide and \nit is a big enough bill that extremely clever judges could find a way \nto rule how they did today. And there are few justices as clever as the \nChief Justice. I have tremendous respect for him.\n  And though he used his talents to uphold this law, he did it with \naplomb and unparalleled legal skill. I have had colleagues bad-mouth \nthe Chief Justice for this case and especially the Sebelius case.\n  What few of my colleagues remember, however, is that in the Sebelius \ndecision, the Chief Justice led the way to preserve for States the \nright to make their own decisions with regard to whether to undertake a \nMedicaid expansion or not.\n  Under Obamacare, the Democrats wanted to force the hands of the \nStates--either expand the program, or you would lose all access to \nMedicaid funds.\n  That was coercion, pure and simple, and the Court ruled accordingly. \nAnd Justice Roberts wrote the opinion, which was joined, at least with \nregard to the Medicaid expansion, by all conservative justices on the \nCourt.\n  The Court's decision preserved a real and meaningful choice for the \nStates, and States have used that ability to choose in different ways. \nSome have expanded Medicaid. Some have not. Some have tried to use \nwaiver authority to craft solutions that work for them. This \nflexibility is how it should work.\n  All I can say is that the Chief Justice is a remarkable judge. He is \na tremendous human being. I have a tremendous confidence in him and I \nbelieve in him. I differ with him on this opinion though. This ruling \nwill not solve any of the problems inherent in Obamacare, as we can see \nfrom the continually sky-rocketing costs of health care and insurance \ncoverage.\n  As I have said, clever judges can find ambiguities where none exist. \nClever judges can find ambiguities that others may not be able to find. \nAnd despite the Chief Justice's brilliance and integrity of character, \nwe need to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something better.\n  I believe, with Chairman Upton in the House, and Senator Burr, that \nthe Patient CARE Act is one of the best solutions out there. I urge all \nof my colleagues to read through our proposal and offer constructive \ncriticism. We need an off-ramp from Obamacare to an actually \naffordable, and privatized, health care system. Only then can we give \nevery day Americans the economic growth and prosperity they deserve.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4625-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4625-S4626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               REACH ACT\n\n  Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, today I wish to discuss the REACH Act, \nlegislation that I have introduced with my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, to establish a new category for \ncritical access hospitals in financial distress.\n  Rural hospitals are an essential yet vulnerable part of our health \ncare system. Rural residents face a unique set of challenges in \nrelation to their urban counterparts. According to the American \nHospital Association, rural residents are typically older, poorer, and \nmore likely to have chronic diseases than those living in more \ndeveloped cities. The unique challenges of caring for patients in \nunderserved areas are not the only hurdles that face rural hospitals \ntoday. They have a hard time simply keeping their doors open.\n  Since January of 2010, approximately 55 rural hospitals nationwide \nhave closed because they could not generate the kind of support or the \nvolume necessary to continue operation. In Colorado, nearly 60 percent \nof care for patients in underserved areas is provided by hospitals \ndependent on rural payment mechanisms, and many hospitals are in danger \nof closing their doors.\n  I would like to share with you a story about the impact of a rural \nhospital in my hometown of Yuma, CO, as shared by the CEO of the \nhospital. Now, I will also tell you that the name of the CEO of the \nhospital is John Gardner. John Gardner also happens to be the name of \nmy father. They are two different people. My father sells farm \nequipment. This John Gardner runs a hospital. I think I can tell you \nthat both of them have gotten complaints.\n  My dad has gotten complaints about the emergency room bill, and John \nGardner, this CEO of the hospital, has gotten complaints about a \ntractor overhaul bill. But they are two different people. But this John \nGardner, the CEO of the hospital, does live right next to me in this \nsmall town of right around 3,000 people. This is what he said, the CEO \nof the hospital:\n\n       Because we are located in a rural farming community, we see \n     many farming accidents and motor vehicle accidents. Gravel \n     roads are not the driver's friend. In partnership with the \n     city ambulance service, we have invested a lot of time and \n     training and equipment to be prepared to respond to these \n     accidents. We have two young adults in our community who were \n     involved in serious automobile accidents on gravel roads. \n     Both had severe head trauma which without immediate \n     stabilization would have had terminal outcomes.\n       Because of our hospital we were able to treat and transport \n     both to level 1 trauma centers for complete treatment and \n     following extensive rehabilitation are now back with their \n     families.\n\n  Stories like this and the invaluable lifesaving services provided by \nrural\n\n[[Page S4626]]\n\nhospitals are why we need a new system, a new system that recognizes \nthe financial challenges and obstacles that rural hospitals face today. \nWithout an adjustment, there may be more facilities closing. A 2014 \nreport by the National Rural Health Association identified 283 \nadditional hospitals at risk of closing.\n  Now, we saw 55 nationwide hospitals already close. An additional 283 \nrural hospitals around the country are at risk of closing. Ensuring \nthat rural communities have access to the lifesaving care they need is \nwhy I am introducing--and joining Senator Grassley--the Rural Emergency \nAcute Care Hospital Act or the REACH Act.\n  The REACH Act aims to allow rural hospitals which are in financial \ndistress to become a new category of hospital, called a rural emergency \nhospital. Here is the problem and why we need to pass the REACH Act. \nUnder current law, critical access hospitals are classified as \nhospitals maintaining no more than 25 acute care beds. These hospitals \nrely on rural payment mechanism for Medicare reimbursements for \noutpatient, inpatient, laboratory, therapy services, and post-acute \nswing-bed services.\n  As the medical service industry has evolved, patients find it more \nand more attractive to have services requiring rural hospital admission \nperformed in large city hospitals because inpatient services are \ndelivered there on a more routine basis. We see more people leaving \nrural hospitals to go to the city hospitals because they perform these \ninpatient services more regularly.\n  The problem, of course, is that leaves rural hospitals without enough \ninpatient volume to cover their costs, oftentimes resulting in hospital \nclosures. So when a critical access hospital--again, these are \nhospitals defined under the law as 25 acute care beds. When a critical \naccess hospital has to shut its doors for inpatient services, it has to \nstop providing inpatient services, it also means the emergency care \ncloses with it.\n  So now you have a hospital no longer providing inpatient services and \nno longer offering emergency care. But as highlighted by my hometown \nstory--the story I just shared from the CEO of the hospital, timely \naccess to emergency services is truly the difference between life and \ndeath. Those two young men who would have faced a terminal outcome were \nsaved because of the availability of a rural hospital emergency room.\n  So when dealing with life-threatening injuries, it is critical for \npatients to receive the kind of health care they need, that lifesaving \ncare to prevent the terminal outcome within the golden hour. That is \nsomething doctors and hospitals use--a term for medical professionals--\nmeaning that hour after injury where it is absolutely critical that \nthey receive treatment, that can make the difference between survival--\nif they do not receive their care during this critical golden hour, \ntheir condition could rapidly deteriorate.\n  Recent statistics from the National Conference of State Legislatures \nfound that 60 percent of trauma deaths in the United States occur in \nrural areas but only represent 15 percent of the overall population. So \nif we are talking about why we need access to rural emergency \nhospitals, the statistic is very clear: 60 percent of rural trauma \ndeaths in this country occur amongst a population that only represents \n15 percent of the overall population. That is a pretty dramatic number.\n  It is critical that we provide rural hospitals that are under \nfinancial distress the necessary tools to prevent closures for those \nliving in isolated areas, to make sure they have the same access to \nemergency services. The solution is the REACH Act, a solution Senator \nGrassley and I are working on together, to allow rural hospitals in \nfinancial distress to switch from being a critical access hospital to \nthis new category called a rural emergency hospital.\n  This new category would offer reimbursement rates that are consistent \nwith the care, needs, and capabilities of rural hospitals, but more \nimportantly allowing them to remain open, keeping that critical \nemergency room service open. Now, the emergency hospital must provide \nemergency medical care and observation 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by \nonsite staff.\n  So we are still providing quality care, but we are allowing them to \novercome the fact that they have seen their inpatient services decline, \nenabling them to keep their emergency services open 24 hours a day, 7 \ndays a week, to make sure trauma patients can see the doctor and be \nprovided the necessary medical care they need during that all-important \ngolden hour.\n  The bill would also establish protocols for the timely transfer of \npatients in need of a higher level of care and patient admittance. The \nPresiding Officer and I both came from rural States, where we know--\nthere are hospitals in our States that are facing financial challenges. \nThere have been stories in newspapers in Colorado about the struggles \nsome communities are having maintaining their services, keeping their \ndoors open. But there are stories in each and every one of these \ncommunities like the story John Gardner told about those two young \npeople in my hometown who otherwise would have had a terminal outcome \nbut for the availability of the emergency care in rural Colorado.\n  So to avoid missing out on the services necessary to keep people \nalive, to make sure rural patients have access to care during that \ncritical golden hour, the REACH Act provides our hospitals with an \nopportunity to keep health services and hospitals available across \nrural America--available, open with emergency care, giving troubled \nhospitals an avenue to keep their doors open and to keep providing the \nlifesaving care we all so desperately want in each of our communities, \nrural or urban.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time on the floor today. I urge \nmy colleagues to support the REACH Act. We are always reaching out for \nmore cosponsors in a bipartisan fashion to make sure we can do the best \njob possible providing health care to rural America, to urban America, \nand to make sure we keep these hospitals open.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to discuss my hometown of \nBaltimore and the city's recovery after the civil unrest related to the \nFreddie Gray case. But first let me say a few words about the \nheartbreaking events in South Carolina. Words are inadequate to express \nthe heartache of yet another mass shooting. Gun violence regularly \ntakes far too many victims in Baltimore and other cities across the \ncountry, but to have a place of worship violated in such a hateful way \nis inexplicable.\n  My prayers are with the Mother Emanuel AME Church, its congregants, \nand the people of Charleston, SC, at this difficult time. I appreciate \nthe Department of Justice's swiftness in opening a hate crimes \ninvestigation of this tragedy. Despite the alarming frequency of such \nshootings, we as a nation cannot become complacent and immune to the \npain and anguish caused by these instances.\n  Every time a senseless shooting takes place, there should be more and \nmore of us who shout to the Heavens in protest as loudly as we can. As \nparents, we have a responsibility to teach our children to focus on \nthings that unite all people and to view differences as strengths, \nrather than seeds for hatred and resentment. As lawmakers, we need to \nmove from a place of political inertia to stop guns from getting into \nthe hands of people who use them for the wrong reasons. We have mourned \ntoo many good people--men, women, and children--to stand idly by.\n  I am pleased State leaders have come together for the removal of the \nConfederate flag from the grounds of South Carolina's statehouse. I \nurge the State legislature to move quickly to permanently remove this \nsymbol of intolerance from government facilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4626-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4626-S4628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BALTIMORE ACT\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Now, as I travel around Baltimore, and particularly the \nneighborhoods that are trying to recover, I hear a recurring theme from \nconstituents: They don't feel their government truly represents them \nand their interests. They don't feel government has fully invested in \nrecovery efforts in\n\n[[Page S4627]]\n\ntheir communities. They don't feel fully enfranchised.\n  So what steps have the local government and Federal Government taken \nso far? We have seen our State's attorney in Baltimore indict several \npolice officers on numerous criminal charges as a result of the death \nof Freddie Gray. Mr. Gray suffered a severe spinal cord injury while in \npolice custody, which ultimately led to his death.\n  The judge in this case has scheduled a trial to begin in October. At \nthe Federal level, even before the Freddie Gray case, I had called for \nthe Justice Department to intervene regarding allegations of brutality \nand misconduct by the Baltimore Police Department. In October 2014, the \nMaryland congressional delegation sent a letter to the Justice \nDepartment in support of greater Federal involvement with our local \npolice force.\n  DOJ agreed to this request and opened a collaborative review process \nwith their COPS Office in Baltimore City. Shortly after the Freddie \nGray case came to light in April of 2015, I sent a letter, along with \nthe Maryland congressional delegation, asking the Justice Department to \nopen a pattern or practice investigation into civil rights violations \nin the Baltimore Police Department.\n  DOJ agreed to this request and opened the investigation, which is \nstill ongoing, at the same time that the State trial for the police \nofficers is occurring. For those of us who live in Baltimore, the \nevents over those last couple of weeks have been heartbreaking. The \ncity we love has gone through very difficult times. I wish to thank my \ncolleagues who have contacted Senator Mikulski and me for offering \ntheir help, for offering their understanding, and for their willingness \nto work together so we can deal with the issues that have been raised \nin Baltimore and other cities and other places around our country.\n  It is our responsibility to move forward. The people of Baltimore \nunderstand that. We understand the national spotlight will be leaving, \nand we are going to deal with the issues that are left behind. I want \nto thank the administration for their high-level involvement as \nBaltimore gets back on its feet. Our congressional delegation and Mayor \nStephanie Rawlings-Blake has had the opportunity to meet at the White \nHouse with senior administration officials and Cabinet Secretaries to \nsupport our local priorities, including jobs, economic growth, \neducation, housing, and law enforcement.\n  I thank President Obama for making Baltimore a top priority. Team \nMaryland is committed to working with the White House and Cabinet \nagencies to ensure that the tools and resources available from the \nFederal Government--from improving housing and increasing quality jobs \nto supporting our schools and small businesses, to providing citizens \nwith second chances and expanding programs to rebuild the trust between \nneighborhoods and law enforcement--are brought to bear in Baltimore as \na national model for the restoration of hope and opportunities in our \ncities.\n  As Congressman Cummings has said: This is a transformational moment \nfor Baltimore. It is finally time that we look at comprehensive steps \nto restore hope and trust in our neighborhoods. We need to ensure that \nall our citizens' rights are preserved, while giving police the tools \nthey need to reengage with families and individuals that they are there \nto protect.\n  Last week, I introduced the BALTIMORE Act, S. 1610, with Senator \nMikulski as my cosponsor. The legislation stands for Building and \nLifting Trust in Order to Multiply Opportunities and Racial Equality. \nThe components of the BALTIMORE Act are powerful antidotes to many of \nthe long-term ills facing our city and others. We must simultaneously \npromote economic development and opportunities for our cities.\n  But this bill gives individuals and law enforcement a second chance \nto do the right thing and contribute in a positive way to their \nfamilies, their neighborhoods, and the larger community. The BALTIMORE \nAct contains legislation from this Senator and other Senators as well \nas new legislative ideas. The BALTIMORE Act consists of four titles. \nThe first title deals with law enforcement. The BALTIMORE Act contains \nthe text of my legislation, S. 1056, which is the End Racial Profiling \nAct. I have talked on the floor before about ending racial profiling. \nIt should have no place in law enforcement in our communities. It is \ncounterproductive, it turns communities against law enforcement, it is \ncostly, and it can be deadly.\n  Now, if you have specific information about a person who has \ncommitted a crime, you can use that. That is not profiling. But when \nyou target a community solely because of race, that has to end. The \nfirst title of the BALTIMORE Act also contains several reforms \nchampioned by Senator Mikulski, as part of the Commerce, Justice, \nScience appropriations bill, approved by the committee for fiscal year \n2016.\n  The legislation would require local law enforcement officials \nreceiving Byrne-JAG and COPS Hiring Program funds to submit officer \ntraining information to the DOJ, including how their officers are \ntrained in the use of force, countering racial and ethnic bias, \ndeescalating conflicts, and constructive engagement with the public. It \nrequires State and local police departments to promptly submit the use-\nof-force data to the FBI.\n\n  The legislation requires the Department of Justice to issue a report \non a plan to assist State and local law enforcement agencies to improve \ntraining in the use of force, in identifying racial and ethnic bias, \nand in conflict resolution through the course of officers' careers.\n  The final piece of this title I act establishes a pilot program to \nassist local law enforcement in purchasing or leasing body-worn cameras \nand requires privacy study. I thank Senators Schatz and Paul for \nintroducing this legislation as the CAMERA Act, S. 877.\n  The second title involves voting rights reform and civil rights \nrestoration. It includes the text from my legislation, S. 772, the \nDemocracy Restoration Act.\n  My legislation will restore voting privileges for those who have \ncompleted their prison terms. I know I have support on both sides of \nthe aisle. We have had a vote on this, and a near majority have agreed \non it. Those who opposed it said it was on the wrong bill. Well, let's \nmove it forward.\n  Once individuals have completed their sentencing, they should be \nwelcomed back to our community so that they can be productive, law-\nabiding citizens, so they know they have become part of our community \nand they believe they have a future.\n  They should be able to serve on our juries. There is not a person in \nthe Senate who didn't have a second chance sometime in their life. We \nshould look at second-chance opportunities. In part our legislation \nprovides additional funding for second-chance type programs that would \nemploy those who have had criminal convictions. We also have the sense \nof Congress to end ``check-the-box'' so that in Federal contracts all \npersons have an opportunity to participate.\n  The third title deals with sentencing reform. I have spoken to some \nof my colleagues about some of the sentencing guidelines we have in \nthis country. We need to take a look at our criminal justice system and \nthe sentencing guidelines to recognize that if a person is of a certain \nrace, a certain religion or ethnic background, that person is much more \nlikely to end up in prison today even though the instance of violating \nthe laws are not different in that community than in other communities \nin the country. We have to deal with it. The country has to deal with \nit.\n  The fourth title of the bill--the last title--deals with the reentry \nprograms that I have already talked about. We need to finance those.\n  It may take time for Baltimore to recover fully from the damage done \nto its business and national image by the tragic events following the \nrecent death of Freddie Gray, but this great city will come back. I am \noptimistic when it comes to Baltimore's future. From its earliest days, \nBaltimore's industrial and financial business sectors have proven \nthemselves resilient and innovative, and these same qualities will be \nvital in the days ahead.\n  I am confident that together we can find ways to help Baltimore \nrecover and grow all sectors of its diverse economy, spurring community \nimprovements along way.\n\n[[Page S4628]]\n\n  We also need to have a serious discussion about sentencing reform and \nfinding ways to restore the lost trust between law enforcement and the \ncommunities they serve. The BALTIMORE Act will allow us to move \ndecisively in that direction by ending racial profiling, increasing \naccountability, collecting critical crime data such as officer-related \nshootings, and providing real strategies and resources to strengthen \npolice-community relations. These measures will help protect the rights \nof every American on every side of our justice system.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, when I have constituents come to \nWashington, DC, I typically will describe this as being a little bit \nlike Disneyland. It is a lot of fun to visit, with a lot of excitement. \nA lot of things happening here, but it is not real. It is not real.\n  What I mean by that is that what is real are the lives that are lived \nby the average American families all across this country, whether it is \nNebraska, Texas or elsewhere and the struggles they have trying to \nraise their children, trying to get a good education, trying to keep a \njob--to keep a job that has good wages and one that hopefully grows \nover time. But in Washington, the focus is typically on winners and \nlosers--winners and losers. If you look at almost any newspaper each \nweek in Washington, they will talk about the winners and the losers. \nUsually, they are talking about political figures such as the President \nof the United States.\n  So I just happened to catch one headline that talked about the \nPresident being the biggest winner of the week in Washington, DC.\n  Why? Well, one is because of the trade promotion authority \nlegislation that we passed that we worked with the President on. That \nhappened to be a subject that I agreed with the President on--the \nimportance of opening new markets to the things that we grow, the \nlivestock we raise, and the manufactured goods we make. Hopefully, we \nwill be able to enter into a good deal on the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, opening up 40 percent of the world's economy in Asia to \nthe new markets for the things that we make, grow, and the livestock we \nraise.\n  So that happened to be a subject on which I agreed with the \nPresident. He had more problems with his own party. We got 13 Senate \nDemocrats to join us in passing this legislation, but we got it done. I \nthink in that instance--maybe you could call the President a winner if \nyou want--you could say that the American people were the winner, and I \nthink that would be accurate too.\n  But on the loser's side of the ledger, we had a disappointing \ndecision by the U.S. Supreme Court today, where they ignored the clear \nlanguage that Congress wrote when the Affordable Care Act was passed in \nMarch of 2010. Even worse, while the press may consider that this \nrepresents a win for the President, there is no question in my mind \nthat the vast majority of the American people are the losers as a \nresult of this decision. The fact is that ObamaCare has been a disaster \nfor millions of hard-working families, and it was really sold under \nfalse pretenses.\n  The President said: If you like your doctor, you can keep your \ndoctor.\n  Well, that ended up not being true.\n  If you like your policy, you can keep your policy.\n  Well, that ended up not being true for roughly 5 million people who \nlost their insurance coverage that they liked because the law said they \ncouldn't keep it anymore.\n  Then there was the fact that the President said this: Prices of \nhealth coverage for an average family will come down $2,500.\n  None of those proved to be true.\n  So despite the Supreme Court's disappointing decision, I will not \nstand down in my opposition to this bad law, because I know we can do \nbetter. I look forward to working with our colleagues to eventually \nprotect the American people from the harmful effects of ObamaCare and \nget the American people what they thought they were going to get out of \nhealth care reform in the first place--coverage they wanted at a price \nthey could afford, neither one of which is delivered under ObamaCare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4628-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4628-S4629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WORKING TOGETHER IN THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as I indicated initially, this \nCongress--and particularly the Senate--has had an unusually productive \nperiod of time of late. It may be hard for some people to believe, but \nthe most common word I heard used to describe Congress last year, and \nin recent years, has been ``dysfunctional.'' But we have actually been \nfunctioning very well. We have been able to accomplish quite a bit.\n  Today the Senate is marked by something that we refer to as regular \norder. What does that mean? It means that we operate according to the \nrules, where not only the majority but also the minority get to \nparticipate in the process, both at committees and on the floor of the \nSenate. If anybody has a good idea, they can offer that idea, and they \ncan actually get a vote on it up or down.\n  I was pleased to read in the Wall Street Journal yesterday that two \nformer Republican majority leaders wrote that they were encouraged to \nsee ``the Senate addressing big problems after years of inaction.'' I \ncouldn't agree more.\n  Bringing the amendment process back is one obvious way we have done \nso under the new majority after years of inaction. Now that may sound \nlike inside baseball or just talking about procedure, but by allowing \nMembers of both parties--the minority and the majority--to offer their \nideas on legislation, we have restored the ability of all Members of \nthe Senate, as elected representatives of the people, to cast our votes \non numerous issues that affect all of our constituents and the country.\n  But restoring such a simple process, one that had been largely absent \nduring the years the minority leader held the reins, represents a real \nsign of progress.\n  At the beginning of this year, it was reported that just 3 weeks into \nthe new Senate, we had voted on more amendments than the minority \nleader had allowed during the last year in its entirety. Let me say \nthat again, because it is pretty shocking. In the first 3 weeks of this \nyear, we had voted on more amendments than the minority leader--when he \nwas majority leader--allowed in the entire previous year.\n  Well, it would mean nothing if it didn't reflect the core philosophy \nof the new leadership of this Chamber. In other words, our successes on \namendment votes didn't stop after our first month in the new Congress. \nI am now proud to say that voting is now the norm, instead of the \nexception to the rule.\n  What did our constituents send us here to do, if not to vote? During \nthe last 6 months, the Senate has voted on 136 amendments in \nlegislation, compared to just 15 last year. We are working for the \nAmerican people, and, more importantly, the Congress is now working on \ntheir behalf and actually beginning to solve real problems that have \nlingered for years.\n  But we have done more than just allow amendments and votes on \namendments. During the last few months, we have passed more than 40 \nbipartisan bills. Now, if anybody has been here for very long, one of \nthe things they learned, perhaps to their chagrin, is that you can't do \nanything around here on a purely partisan basis. You just don't have \nthe numbers to do it--with some notable exceptions. But we passed more \nthan 40 bipartisan bills, and we have seen 18 of those already signed \ninto law by the President.\n  This includes important legislation that I am very proud of called \nthe Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, which passed this Chamber \n99 to 0 and is focused on making sure we help the victims of modern-day \nslavery recover and rebuild their lives and making sure that these \nwomen, typically teenage girls, are treated as victims and not \ncriminals.\n  We have also passed other important legislation, such as the Iran \nNuclear Agreement Review Act. This law will give Congress the time and \nspace to closely scrutinize any deal that the President negotiates with \nIran concerning its pursuit of nuclear weapons. In so doing, we will \nmake sure that the American people, through their elected \nrepresentatives, can voice their opinions on what could be a bad deal \nthat\n\n[[Page S4629]]\n\ncould jeopardize our national security and that of our allies, such as \nthe nation of Israel.\n  Then there is the National Defense Authorization Act, which was \npassed this last week and which will provide our men and women in \nuniform the authorities and the resources they need to protect and \ndefend our Nation against rising threats around the world.\n  And, as I mentioned at the beginning, just yesterday we passed trade \npromotion authority, which will soon be heading to the President's \ndesk. It provides Texas farmers, ranchers, and small businesses the \nopportunity to find new markets around the world through pending and \nfuture trade agreements.\n  We also see significant progress in many other bills that the Senate \nmay soon consider, bills that our committee chairs have been tirelessly \nmoving forward. This includes more than 110 bills that have been \nreported out of committee and legislation such as the PATENT Act, a \nbill I have been very involved in, which helps startups and small \nbusinesses that are too often wasting their time and money fighting \ncostly, frivolous litigation.\n  It is good to see that the Senate is back working for the American \npeople, and it is my hope that we can, on a bipartisan basis, continue \nto build on our strong record so far this Congress and to continue to \nwork productively, where we can, to serve those who elected us.\n  The Senate is starting to build some momentum. With several \nappropriations bills looming, we need to keep getting things done and \nto continue providing real solutions to the problems it faces.\n  Although my friends across the aisle suggested that they will launch \na filibuster summer, I would like to stress that would undercut the \ngood progress and the productivity we have demonstrated so far, and it \nwould also frustrate the American people and only harm those whom we \nare sent here to represent, not the least of which are our troops and \nveterans.\n  So let's do away with this irresponsible idea of a filibuster summer, \nand let's work together to try to do the Nation's business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I wish to say a couple of things \nbefore I speak to the issue that brought me to the floor today.\n  I have been listening to our leader from Texas talk about so many of \nthe advances we have seen in the Senate this session. I think it is \nimportant to acknowledge and note that we are making progress. Often we \nget labeled in the media for being that ``do-nothing Congress,'' that \nentity which is just engaged in loggerheads and deadlock. But I think \nthe truth is and the facts on the ground are that we are seeing \nsubstantive legislation passed, just as the Senator from Texas has \nnoted.\n  I was pleased to lead off the Senate with the first bill on the floor \nin this Congress--the Keystone XL Pipeline. It was good to be back at \nwork in a body that was entertaining amendments from both sides and \noffered by my colleagues without any direction or dictation from the \nmajority side--an opportunity for the give-and-take that comes with not \nonly good debate but not knowing whether your amendment is going to \npass or fail. That is how the legislative process works.\n  The occupant of the Chair is a former member of a State body, as am \nI. We know that is how you build legislation, the good, constructive \nback-and-forth. We saw that with the Keystone XL debate. We moved that \nthrough both bodies. The President chose to veto it. I think it is a \nmistake on his part. I would like to see us resolve that eventually. \nBut I do think it reflects the way that we as a Chamber can work and \nthe way a constructive majority can work. So I applaud the leadership \nof the majority in getting us to this point and through some very \ndifficult issues. We are going to have some good things coming up, and \nI look forward to further engaging in debate on those.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4629-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FIRES IN ALASKA\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I want to mention very quickly what \nis on the front page of my newspapers in the State of Alaska this week \nand has been for a couple of weeks now. Our fire season started very \nearly and with an intensity that has really attracted concern not only \nwithin the State but outside the State. Currently, we have about 545 \nfires that have begun within the State, both in the interior, where we \ntraditionally see them, but also down in Southcentral, fires that have \ntaken homes and properties.\n  In the first part of the fire season, there was a great deal of \nattention on the community of Willow, an area that hosts the homes of \nmany of our famous and our infamous dog mushers, mushers who mush along \nthe Iditarod Trail and other parts. The articles have been about the \ndislocation of not only the mushers who have lost their homes but also \ntrying to find places for up to 600 sled dogs for temporary relocation.\n  So there has been a great deal of concern about the fire status in \nAlaska. As I mentioned, 545 fires have burned, 427,881 acres as of \nyesterday evening. That is a significant total. It is a very \nsignificant total, but it is pretty small in comparison to where we \nwere in 2004 when we saw almost 5 million acres burn. In 2004, 4.7 \nmillion acres burned, and in 2005, we had 2.2 million acres.\n  We are hopeful that the weather is going to change and that we will \nget on top of this. But when I was home in Fairbanks in the interior on \nSaturday, on Saturday alone we saw 6,500 lightning strikes at a time \nand a place where it is very dry in the interior and has been for some \ntime. So fire danger is very real.\n  My point this morning is not to give the weather report but to \nacknowledge publicly the efforts of the men and women who have been \nengaged so bravely and so heroically in fighting these wildland fires, \nfighting these fires all over the State in extreme conditions, in \ndifficult conditions where wind can come in at the last minute and \nchange the direction of the fires and not only threaten the property \nbut the safety of our firefighters.\n  Right now, we have about 3,300 fire personnel in the State of Alaska. \nAbout 2,200 of them are fighting fires on the ground. Over 1,000 of \nthese are men and women from Alaska. Many of them are hotshots and are \nfirefighters from the villages who have a great deal of expertise, but \nwe also rely on many who come from the lower 48 to assist us during \nthis time of our wildfires. We thank them and we pray for their safety \nand for those who have been left homeless, whose property has been \ndamaged, whose lives have been upended by these very difficult fires. \nKnow that our hearts go out to you, and whatever efforts we are able to \nprovide for assistance, we stand ready to do so. And a very heartfelt \nthank-you to those who are fighting these fires.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4629-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4629-S4631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                EPA RULE ON WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I came to the floor today to speak \nabout an issue--a regulation that has raised a level of concern and \ncontroversy in my State of Alaska like no other we have seen in a long \ntime, and this is in regard to the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers \nand their release of a final version of a rule that significantly \nincreases the ability of these agencies to regulate more of our land \nand our water. I am speaking specifically to the rule that expands the \ndefinition of ``waters of the United States'' under the Clean Water \nAct.\n  Coming from the State of Nebraska, an agriculture State, I am sure \nthe Presiding Officer has heard concerns from constituents and farmers \nabout the expansion of this definition and what it may mean to our \neconomies.\n  The EPA claims this rule--and we lovingly refer to it as WOTUS--is a \nclarification to provide certainty and predictability as to where clean \nair permits are required. But the view of so many Alaskans--and really \nthe view around the country--is that this rule is far beyond a simple \nclarification because it substantially increases EPA's regulatory \nreach. It will subject countless new projects to permitting \nrequirements that will be difficult to satisfy, increasing cost and \ncertainly increasing project delays.\n  The application of the WOTUS in Alaska is expansive and it is \nnegative. It is something I have described as a showstopper in the \npast, and none of the changes in the final rule alter that\n\n[[Page S4630]]\n\ndescription. If anything, they just serve to reinforce it. The rule \nreally was a showstopper when it was drafted, and it remains at least \nas bad and damaging today.\n  According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, there are more than \n174 million acres in Alaska that are wetlands. There are 174 million \nacres in the State that are considered wetlands, so compare this: The \nentire State of Texas is 172 million acres. Everyone in the lower 48 \nthinks Texas is a pretty big State. My friend John Cornyn was here \nearlier. Texas has 172 million acres. In Alaska, we have 174 million \nacres of wetlands. So take the whole State of Texas and turn it into \nwetlands, and that is what we are looking at in Alaska.\n  Look at this map for a little bit of context. Under the old rule, \n43.3 percent of Alaska's surface is considered wetlands compared to \nabout 5.2 percent of the surface area in the lower 48. This map is \npulled from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's wetlands finder Web \nsite. It may be difficult to see, but these areas in the brighter green \nare all the wetlands. The area of southeastern Alaska, where I was born \nand raised, is entirely wetlands. The entire southeastern part of the \nState is wetlands--in Fairbanks, in the interior area, Southcentral, \nall around Prince William Sound, all the southwest.\n  But I think it is important to note that this Web site which Fish and \nWildlife has is lacking data for a significant part of Alaska, and so \nthe map is effectively incomplete. The last study conducted by the \nService on the status of wetlands in the State was done back in 1994, \nwhich really puts it out of date. It doesn't take into account the \nrecent Supreme Court decisions of Rapanos and SWANCC. So we have \nanother map here that I think is instructive to look at as well.\n  This map is pulled from a study by the University of Michigan and the \nJet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology. In \nthis map, they use L-band radar satellite imagery. It probably produces \na more complete and accurate view of the wetlands in the State. Again, \nwe see all of these areas that are considered wetlands, but, in effect, \nmore parts of the State are considered wetlands or viewed as wetlands \nthan not.\n  So what we have between these two maps--between what Fish and \nWildlife has done and what the University of Michigan and the \nCalifornia Institute of Technology has done--are some discrepancies, \nbut it illustrates the problem. The problem is that nobody really knows \nwhat will be considered wetlands by the EPA and by the Corps, and if \nthe new rule takes effect, that problem will only be compounded because \nit declares that any water or wetland within 4,000 feet of a \n``categorically jurisdictional water'' will now be subject to this \n``significant nexus'' analysis. That analysis will include the entire \nwater at issue even if only a tiny part of that lies within the 4,000-\nfoot boundary.\n  If you are like most Americans, you probably and understandably have \nno idea how to define a categorically jurisdictional water. You \nprobably don't have any interest in learning how to define it. But what \nyou may soon find is that it is going to impact you because it will \ninclude all waters used or susceptible to use in interstate commerce, \nall interstate waters, the territorial seas, all tributaries to those \nbodies of waters, and all waters adjacent to all those other enumerated \nwaters. That is a lot of water.\n  Again, you probably and understandably aren't familiar with this \nsignificant nexus analysis, either. I mean, really, what does that \nmean? Here is a way to help put it into context. If you have a 500-acre \nplot of land and within that 500 acres you have 10 square feet that are \nwithin 4,000 feet of any jurisdictional water, your entire parcel--the \nwhole 500-acre plot--will now be evaluated as a whole. Even though the \narea we are talking about where there are wetlands is like 10 square \nfeet out of 500 acres, the whole thing is considered as a whole. The \nsignificant nexus analysis must include all similarly situated waters. \nSo, again, you will have a situation where EPA and the Corps are going \nto interpret broadly.\n  What does all this mean in terms of application? It is interesting, \nlooking at maps and having this discussion about categorically \njurisdictional waters and significant nexus, but let's take a specific \nexample.\n  Take the community of Fairbanks, where I spent a lot of time growing \nup. Fairbanks is in a valley, it is in the Tanana Valley surrounded by \na pretty large watershed. The Tanana River, Chena River, we have a \nsituation in this area in Fairbanks where all of the wetlands in the \nbasin have been declared similarly situated. What that means is that a \nlandowner will be forced to prove that none of the wetlands in the \nbasin, as a whole, have a significant physical, chemical or biological \nconnection to either the Tanana or the Chena Rivers. That is \npractically an impossible hurdle. There are thousands of acres of \nwetlands in that basin that are now all effectively subject to \njurisdiction under this new rule. Every single person who wants to do \nany sort of development in Alaska's second-largest city will now be \nrequired to get some form of a permit. This includes the guy who wants \nto build a cabin up on Chena Ridge or the small dredge operator out in \nthe Goldstream Valley or the developer out in North Pole who wants to \nput in a new subdivision. To all of them: Go out and get your permit.\n  The bureaucratic mess that is the 404 permitting process has already \nheld back crucial development within the State, and this new rule is \nonly going to make things worse. Now, I wish to go further to the \nFairbanks example and to tell the story of Richard Schok. He has a \ncompany called Flowline. He has been engaged in an ongoing battle with \nthe Corps since May 21, 2008. That was the day Richard submitted a \npermit application to the Corps. It was a reapplication for a permit \nwhich had been granted back in 2003. We might think, OK, this is just a \nreapplication. This is a permit which has been in place now for 5 \nyears. It should have been an easy matter. Instead, Richard is still \nfighting the Corps--this many years after, still fighting the Corps for \na new permit. Since 2008, the Corps has connected the piece of property \nat issue to the Tanana River, the Chena River, and something known as \nChannel B, which is a manmade waterway used for flood control purposes.\n  The Agency's first attempt to establish jurisdiction over his private \nland, which consists of 455 acres outside of Fairbanks, was through the \nTanana River. They looked at it, and after administrative review, it \nwas held there was no connection between the subject land and the \nTanana. So we would have thought we were done with it. But, no, rather \nthan just allow Mr. Schok to develop his private land, the Corps then \nswitched theories on him and said: No, we think the land is connected \nto the Chena River instead. But then they went further than that. They \nsettled on a third theory, and that was that the wetlands had a direct \nconnection to Channel B. Channel B is over 2 miles away from Mr. \nSchok's property via a small 20- to 50-foot-wide wetland arm, since \nChannel B drains into the Chena River. So when you are talking about a \nsignificant nexus, how remote could you possibly be.\n  So there are a couple problems with this analysis. First, the strip \nof land they labeled as wetlands wasn't wetlands at all. People drive \nfour-wheelers on it. You can walk on it in tennis shoes. Basically, \nthis is the land they are describing as wetlands. The guy has taken a \ncore sample here. It is muddy underneath, but effectively this is what \nis being considered the wetlands. Second, Channel B contributes less \nthan 1 percent of the total flow to the Chena River. We would think \nthat should not suffice for a finding of a significant nexus, but the \nCorps thinks it does. So to date, this permitting battle has cost Mr. \nSchok over $200,000, and that doesn't count the 1,000 man-hours he and \nhis staff have put into the project. All he is trying to do is move his \nbusiness from its current location, which is limited in size, to this \nnew piece of land--his private property--and open a new powder coating \nplant. The move would allow him to expand his operations, employ more \npeople, and contribute to the growth of Alaska. But since 2008, he \ncan't make it happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to continue \nfor an additional 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4631]]\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I also wish to speak to how the rule impacts the \ndevelopment of hydropower in the State of Alaska. We are looking to \nfind energy solutions, clean energy solutions. Hydropower is huge for \nus. Alaska has nearly 300 prime locations for hydrodevelopment, nearly \n200 in Southeast Alaska alone, but many of them require the \nconstruction of powerhouses or transmission lines that may rest on \nwetlands or cross wetlands as defined by the new rule--and that is a \nbig problem.\n  A good example of this is Crater Lake, a fishing community of \nCordova, down in Prince William Sound. Crater Lake is at an elevation \nof 1,600 feet, straight up from the ocean. Cordova has been looking at \nthis small hydro opportunity to advance their energy solutions. It is \nclean. It is renewable. It is carbon free. There are no fish issues. So \nthis is perfect for them. Prior to WOTUS, it was anticipated that it \nwould be about a 12- to 18-month process to permit this small \nhydroproject. What the Federal nexus WOTUS brings, this project is now \nlikely to end up in the FERC process, and what was expected to be about \n$150,000 to $200,000 in permitting costs is now looking to be closer to \n$1 million and take potentially 3 to 5 years. Think about it. For a \nsmall community like Cordova that is trying to find small energy \nsolutions for this fishing community, these additional costs are likely \ngoing to kill this small project. And what happens? The community \ncontinues providing their power by diesel, when we have a clean \nopportunity, but that opportunity is going to be suffocated by this \nrule.\n  Most of coastal Alaska, with its rugged mountains filled with \nrivulets and waters, will be subject to these case-by-case \ndeterminations. Simply performing the science and providing \njustification to the EPA for these adjacent water determinations will \nadd cost to projects and likely delay any development as the \ndeterminations are litigated.\n  If any projects do make it to the finish line, their higher costs \nunder this rule will mean their electricity is ultimately less \naffordable for Alaskans. The costs we face when developing in Alaska \nare already steep enough. They will be magnified and worsened by the \nfinal WOTUS rule. I am grateful to our colleagues on the EPW Committee, \nwho recently reported out bipartisan legislation, which I cosponsored, \nwhich requires the agencies to develop a better rule.\n  These two bills will help provide relief to local governments. The \nInfrastructure Rehabilitation Act will allow the Secretary of the Army \nto waive the notice and comment period required by the Clean Water Act \nwhen a natural disaster has damaged critical infrastructure and a local \ngovernment needs to rebuild.\n  We also have the Mitigation Facilitation Act, which will allow the \nSecretary to provide loans to local governments in order to ease the \nburden created by 404 permits and the overreaching scope of the new \nWOTUS rule. If the Federal Government is going to require hugely \nburdensome and expensive mitigation projects, effectively an unfunded \nmandate, the government should assist municipalities by providing loans \nand loan guarantees to small local entities. So I have introduced these \ntwo bills and am looking forward to having them move forward, in \naddition to what the EPW Committee has done.\n  Alaska will be the State most heavily impacted just because of the \nnature of our wetlands. An analyst done by EPA and the Corps suggests \nthat at the high end, the mitigation costs to Alaska could be $55,000 \nper acre--$55,000 an acre. With 43 percent of our land requiring \nmitigation for any sort of development, these costs will halt many \ndevelopment projects. And when combined with the cost of even getting a \npermit, which averages about $270,000, economic development will be \nseemingly impossible in many parts of the State.\n  But it goes further than that because EPA can also issue civil \npenalties for violations of a permit or for failing to have a permit \nwhen it thinks you should have one. These penalties can be assessed at \na rate of up to $37,500 per day and doubled if the person being fined \nhas been issued an administrative compliance order and EPA decides \nthere has been a violation of that order. The threat of these penalties \nis another cost that people have to take into account when they are \ndeveloping property.\n  There are so many places in Alaska that are more than 4,000 feet away \nfrom some kind of water. We are close to water. We are close to water \neverywhere. We have too many rivers, too many lakes, too many wetlands. \nWe love them all. But we are the only State that has permafrost, and we \nhave no idea at this point in time whether or not, and under what \ncircumstances, these areas might be regulated. We have incredible \nuncertainty working against.\n  The bottom line is that the new WOTUS rule will have results that in \nmany cases will just be absurd in Alaska and add significant, \nsignificant costs. For us, this rule is the equivalent of the Roadless \nRule that killed off logging in the Tongass National Forest, ending \nhundreds of jobs.\n  I know this is an issue that many of us in this body care about, many \nof us in this country care about. It speaks to what we see when we have \nagencies that go beyond their jurisdictional authority, that go beyond \nthe scope of the laws that were passed with good intentions. I want us \nto get back to that place of laws that allow us to have clean air, \nclean water. But when we see interpretations like we have with this, it \nis time to stop them.\n  Madam President, I thank my colleague for the indulgence of some \nadditional time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise as negotiations between the P5+1 \nnations and Iran enter their final phase. The President deserves our \nthanks for his commitment to eliminating the nuclear threat we face \nfrom Iran, and we owe the negotiating team our gratitude for their \ntireless and ongoing work to achieve a meaningful deal.\n  For decades, Iran has posed a serious, real, and ongoing threat to \nthe U.S. national security interests. Iran's pursuit of its hegemonic \nambitions in the Middle East has manifested in the training and arming \nof Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces and terrorist \norganizations such as Hezbollah. More recently, Iran's increased \nintervention in the conflicts in Yemen and Iraq pose dangerous and \nunpredictable regional consequences. Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei \ncontinues his horrific and unacceptable calls for the destruction of \nthe State of Israel and has not yet come clean about the dimensions of \nIran's nuclear program.\n  The stakes of these nuclear negotiations clearly could not be higher. \nNothing less than the peace and security of the Middle East hangs in \nthe balance.\n  The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, the hard-fought legislation \ncrafted by Senators Bob Corker, Ben Cardin, and New Jersey's own \nSenator Menendez--of which I am a cosponsor--sets up a clear and \nconstructive process for Congress to weigh in on any final deal that \ntouches upon the statutory sanctions Congress has enacted.\n  With just days remaining before a final deadline, Congress must \ncontinue to voice its concerns and exercise its oversight authority. To \nme, this role is at the bedrock of our role, and Congress must play its \nrole. As my senior Senator, Senator Menendez, has stated: If the \ninterim period is just a short-term pause that preserves for Iran the \nability to quickly restart its nuclear program, we will have failed the \nAmerican people, and we will have our allies and friends to whom we \nhave vowed to protect from Iranian aggressions.\n  Any final agreement must build in the ability to hold Iran to its \ncommitments and to prevent the absolute nightmare of a nuclear Iran \nfrom being realized.\n  My intent today is to ensure that the administration, which has \nworked tirelessly to prevent Iran from gaining access to a nuclear \nweapon, has the best possible chance of success once the final \nagreement reaches Congress. The framework agreement released on April \n2, 2015, leaves gaps, some of which I would like to spend a few moments \nhighlighting today.\n  First, a robust and comprehensive inspections and verification regime \nmust be the foundation of any deal that is\n\n[[Page S4632]]\n\nreached. With Iran's known enrichment facilities at Natanz and Fordow, \nas well as a heavy water reactor at Arak, under international \noversight, the country's leaders would almost certainly look elsewhere \nto conduct any secret nuclear work.\n  Iran, of course, denies any desire to build a bomb, but distrust of \nIran is based on deep historical precedence. Iran secretly built and \noperated Natanz and Fordow, and they still haven't come clean about \ntheir past military nuclear activities at Parchin. Therefore, ensuring \na robust inspections regime is critical for my support of a final deal.\n  The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action--JCPOA--fact sheet released on \nApril 2 stated that Iran will be required to grant access to the IAEA \nto investigate suspicious sites or allegations of covert facilities \nanywhere in the country.\n  It was hoped that rapid inspections would underwrite the \nverifiability of the agreement, so if Iran were suspected of violating \nthe agreement, the IAEA would have access to those suspected sites.\n  According to the latest reports, the IAEA would have the ability to \ninvestigate undeclared sites; however, Iran would still be able to \ndispute those requests in an international forum made up of five \npermanent members of the U.N. Security Council--the United States, \nBritain, France, Russia, and China--plus Germany, the EU, and Iran. As \nwe look forward to examining the contours of an inspection regime, we \nmust be wary of any proposal that allows Iran to jam up the IAEA and \nthe dispute resolution process, while removing any evidence of \nviolations that are occurring.\n  Our negotiators should expect questions from this Chamber: Are there \nclear loopholes for cheating? Does the administration have high \nconfidence that Iran is not making bomb material at its declared \nnuclear facilities and that the inspectors are able to detect \nclandestine facilities?\n  Our standard will be an arrangement that prevents Iran from dodging \nor hiding from an inspections regime. Our intelligence, together with \nenhanced inspections, must be able to ensure that the United States \nwill catch Iran if it takes the risk of pursuing a secret pathway to \nnuclear weapons and pursuing secret nuclear activities.\n  Let's not forget that Iran has a dismal record of compliance with its \ninternational obligations. Iran has a 30-year record of cheating on the \nnonproliferation treaty--30 years of cheating. Iran has a 30-year \nrecord of cheating, but already the Ayatollah stated that Iran will not \nallow inspections at military sites today. Khamenei is already \nbacktracking on major commitments agreed to by negotiators on all \nsides.\n  This is a serious issue, and in my opinion, it is a clear ploy by \nIran to frustrate the negotiations and move the goalpost on these \nnegotiations. Even more so, understanding the history, this reinforces \nhow much we don't know about the military dimension of Iran's past \nactivities. We have no baseline for monitoring Iran moving forward \nwithout an understanding of what has been sought in the past.\n  This is not new. The IAEA has raised these concerns. The April 2 \nJCPOA says: ``Iran will implement an agreed set of measures to address \nthe IAEA's concerns regarding the past military dimensions of its \nprogram.''\n  Secretary Kerry stated in April that past military dimensions ``will \nbe part of a final agreement. If there's going to be a deal, it will be \ndone.'' I applaud the Secretary's commitment to ensuring that the \nIranians' past behavior will play a clear role in the ongoing \nnegotiations.\n  We know that in this Chamber, my colleagues will examine this \nclosely. We will also examine timelines. In the best-case scenario, for \n10 to 15 years, Iran will limit its research and development, limit its \ndomestic enrichment capacity, will not build new enrichment facilities \nor heavy water reactors, will limit its stockpile of enriched uranium, \nand will accept enhanced transparency measures. After 15 years, when it \nis allowed under the terms of the agreement to build its stockpile, it \nwill only be able to do so for peaceful purposes.\n  But I believe we have to be clear-eyed about the other scenario, \nwhich is that after 10 to 15 years--a blip in time for a regime that \nhas been under sanctions for decades--Iran ramps up its research and \ndevelopment efforts on advanced centrifuges, installs these \ncentrifuges, and decides to break out.\n  Would this deal enhance the intelligence picture of Iran's nuclear \ncapability? That is an important question. If so, would it adequately \ninform our military options should Iran attempt that breakout?\n  Are there assumptions being made that in the short term Iran may \nundergo internal political changes that will make them more favorable \nto the West? Are we assuming that in making this deal? Relying on such \nassumptions would be a dangerous gamble. There are no assurances about \nwhat the future state of their regime will be.\n  Finally, Congress must be clear that this deal must not only be \ncredible to Congress, but it must also satisfy Iran's neighbors that \nhave much to gain from an Iran that follows established international \nnorms and far too much to lose if we allow a deal that leaves Iran's \nneighbors vulnerable to reckless rhetoric and aggression. If other \ncountries believe we have wavered in our resolve to get the strongest \npossible deal, it will be very difficult to discourage other countries \nfrom developing or pursuing a weapon. This could lead to proliferation, \nand such proliferation would be catastrophic. It would be a \ncatastrophic blow to an already unstable and unpredictable region. This \nis not an abstract concern; Iran's neighbors are watching these \nnegotiations carefully.\n  While I sincerely hope that in 50 years future Senators will discuss \nhow the United States did what no other nation was able to do--build a \ncomprehensive sanctions regime that brought Iran to the negotiating \ntable, neutralized the threat of nuclear proliferation in the Middle \nEast, and succeeded in putting an end to dangerous calls for the \ndestruction of Israel--success is not certain. Success is not an \ninevitability.\n  I will not judge this deal before I see a final agreement. I \nencourage my colleagues to read the final text, as I am sure they will, \nbefore making judgments about the deal. We need to see what is in it.\n  Under the Joint Plan of Action, we have seen unprecedented \ninspections of Iran's nuclear infrastructure take hold. Iran's enriched \nstockpile has shrunk. There are limitations on their enrichment \nprocesses. Enrichment has been confined to one facility. This is \nprogress. It is my hope that the negotiators are building upon this \nprogress and working toward a comprehensive final deal. There is much \nat stake. The bar is set high--as it should be--for a deal, and the \nquestions I have raised are among the many that will be asked and that \nmust be asked as we examine a final deal in the coming weeks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4632-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4632-S4633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THANKING SENATE PAGES\n\n  Mr. BOOKER.

We see these groups of pages, and it is \nextraordinary to see young people come from all over America. Some of \nthem may go on to government, but most of them will go on to do other \nthings. We see them come into this Chamber and continue a tradition \nthat has been going on for decades. They come and they go. But I want \neveryone to know that they really do enrich our experience here as \nSenators, and they help the staff do invaluable work for the operations \nof the Senate. They may be viewed as the lowest on the totem pole in \nthis institution, but their value and the legacy they are continuing is \na noble one.\n  Today, on the penultimate day of this group of pages, I wish to offer \nthem my gratitude for their service to our country.\n  Thank you.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S4633]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4633-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4633-S4634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        KING V. BURWELL DECISION\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, today's decision in King v. Burwell is \njudicial activism, plain and simple. For the second time in just a few \nyears, a handful of unelected judges has rewritten the text of \nObamaCare in order to impose that failed law upon millions of \nAmericans. The first time, the Court ignored Federal law and magically \ntransformed a statutory ``penalty'' into a ``tax.'' Today, these robed \nHoudinis have transmogrified a ``Federal exchange'' into an exchange \n``established by the State.'' This is lawless.\n  As Justice Scalia rightfully put it, ``Words no longer have meaning \nif an exchange that is not established by a State is `established by \nthe State.' '' Justice Scalia continues: ``We should start calling this \nlaw SCOTUScare.'' I agree.\n  If this were a bankruptcy case or any other case of ordinary \nstatutory interpretation, the results would have been 9 to 0, with the \nCourt unanimously reversing the Obama administration's illegal actions. \nBut instead, politics intervened. For nakedly political reasons, the \nSupreme Court willfully ignored the words that Congress wrote, and \ninstead read into the law their preferred policy outcome. These \nJustices have joined with President Obama in harming millions of \nAmericans. Unelected judges have once again become legislators--and bad \nones at that. They are lawless, and they hide their prevarication in \nlegalese. Our government was designed to be one of laws, not of men, \nand this transparent distortion is disgraceful.\n  These Justices are not behaving as umpires calling balls and strikes. \nThey have joined a team, and it is a team that is hurting Americans \nacross this country. ObamaCare is the biggest job killer in America. \nMillions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-\ntime work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors. \nMillions of Americans have seen their health insurance premiums \nskyrocket, and it is a direct result of President Obama, of Democrats \nin the Congress, and of lawless Justices at the U.S. Supreme Court who \nhave joined the team of the Obama administration. If those Justices \nwant to become legislators, I invite them to resign and run for office. \nThat is the appropriate place to write laws--on this floor, not from \nthat courtroom.\n  I began my career as a law clerk of the U.S. Supreme Court, clerking \nfor Chief Justice William Rehnquist, one of the greatest Chief Justices \never to serve our Nation. I have spent the majority of my adult life \nlitigating before the U.S. Supreme Court, both on behalf of the State \nof Texas and on behalf of private parties. What this Court has become \nis heartbreaking. If Chief Justice Rehnquist could see this Court \ntoday, he would be filled with sorrow at what has become of the Supreme \nCourt of the United States.\n  The obligation of fidelity to the Constitution and fidelity to law \nmatters. We are not living in a platonic oligarchy with philosopher \nkings governing us who believe they get to write the laws, interpret \nthe laws, and enforce the laws. That is not the American system of \ngovernance.\n  At the same time, crocodile tears are flowing here in our Nation's \nCapital over the Supreme Court's decision to illegally rewrite \nObamaCare, which has been a disaster since its inception. But one day \nof faux outrage from the Washington cartel won't fool the millions of \ncourageous conservatives all across our country. They know that far too \nmany career politicians--Democrats and Republicans--in this Nation's \nCapital are quietly celebrating the Court's decision. If they believe \nthis issue is now settled so they don't have to address it, they are \nsorely mistaken.\n  I have made repeal of this disastrous law a top priority since the \nvery first day I entered into this body, and I have made its repeal \ncentral to my tenure in office. Republicans all across the country, \nincluding my friend the Presiding Officer, campaigned on repealing this \nlaw and were elected in a historic tidal wave year--historic majorities \nin both Chambers of this Congress and in statehouses all across the \ncountry. It is now up to us to keep our promises.\n  I believe 2016 will be a national referendum on repealing ObamaCare. \nThis law is profoundly unpopular. It is unpopular with Republicans, it \nis unpopular with Independents, it is unpopular with Democrats, it is \nunpopular with young people, it is unpopular with Hispanics, and it is \nunpopular with everybody it has hurt, and there are millions being hurt \nby this law.\n  The Court adopted and put its stamp of approval on the IRS's \nblatantly unlawful reading of the statute to make subsidies and taxes \napplicable to individuals on Federal exchanges when Congress explicitly \nprovided the opposite. Jonathan Gruber famously said Obamacare was \nbuilt on exploiting the stupidity of the American people. Well, \nunfortunately the Supreme Court is now complicit in that deception. The \nSupreme Court has joined President Obama, whose statement ``if you like \nyour health insurance plan, you can keep your health insurance plan'' \nwas rightfully noted as the lie of the year as millions of Americans \nlost their doctors. Now those rogue Justices are complicit in that lie, \nin setting aside their oath of office to lie to the American people.\n  After today's ruling, ObamaCare will now be responsible for imposing \nillegal taxes on more than 11 million individuals and for burdening \nhundreds of thousands of businesses with illegal penalties on their \nworkers, killing jobs and further slowing economic growth.\n  You are a young person right now. You come out of school. You have \nstudent loans up to your eyeballs. You are struggling. You don't know \nif you are going to get a job. The dismal Obama economy means your \nfuture is bleak. You have no hope or optimism of actually getting a \ncareer, getting skills, moving towards the American dream. Well, today \nthe U.S. Supreme Court has joined arm in arm with President Obama and \nthe IRS in illegally imposing taxes on you--you, that young person \nstarting your career, struggling to make your student loan payments.\n  Working as a part-time employee making coffee doesn't pay those \npayments, and yet you are stuck with the individual mandate, which is a \ntax, so says the Supreme Court and so the Obama Justice Department \nargued. Right after President Obama told the American people it wasn't \na tax, the Obama Justice Department said yes, it is a tax. The Supreme \nCourt agreed. You, the single person, the single mom trying to feed \nyour kids, are paying an illegal tax because of the lies emanating from \nWashington, DC.\n  You, the teenage immigrant, as my father was 58 years ago, washing \ndishes, making 50 cents an hour--he couldn't speak English, but he was \nfilled with hopes and dreams. He was filled with an aspiration for the \nAmerican dream. Ours is the greatest Nation in the history of the world \nbecause people can start with nothing and achieve anything. That is the \npromise of America.\n  ObamaCare is strangling that promise. You, the teen, are paying \nillegal taxes right now today because of President Obama's deception, \nbecause of the IRS's lawlessness, and because of the Supreme Court's \njudicial activism, violating their oaths of office.\n  I remain fully committed to repealing every single word of ObamaCare. \nMark my words. Following the election in 2016, the referendum that we \nwill have, in 2017, this Chamber will return and we will repeal every \nword of ObamaCare. We will bring back economic growth, we will bring \nback opportunity, and then we will pass commonsense health reform that \nmakes health insurance personal, portable, and affordable and that \nkeeps government from getting between us and our doctors.\n  We will recognize that this horrible experiment has failed. When \nmillions of Americans lose their jobs, are forced into part-time jobs, \nlose their health care, lose their doctors, when millions of Americans \nsee their premiums skyrocket, it is incumbent on Members of this body, \nit is incumbent on the Federal Government to fix the wreckage they \ncaused, to fix the wreckage the Supreme Court has now embraced \nlawlessly.\n  We will repeal ObamaCare, and I will fight with every breath in my \nbody to make sure that happens in 2017.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S4634]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first I have to say that clearly there \nare two Americas on how we view health care, that is for sure, after \nhearing my colleague speak about the ``disaster'' of providing tens of \nmillions of people health insurance, affordable health insurance.\n  Where I live in Michigan, it is great that families no longer have to \nput the kids to bed and then say a little prayer: Dear God, don't let \nthe kids get sick. For millions of Americans, the Supreme Court \ndecision has reaffirmed the fact that they will have that peace of \nmind.\n  When Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the majority today, said \n``Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance \nmarkets, not destroy them,'' I think he was absolutely right. I commend \nhim and the majority--substantial majority--for understanding that in \nthe competitive, private marketplace that we set up through insurance \nexchanges, we meant for all Americans to have the opportunity for the \ntax cuts that allow them to be able to purchase insurance, most people \npurchasing insurance for under $100 a month, which, contrary to \ndestroying America, I think is making incredible differences in \npeople's lives and creating the opportunity going forward for a \ncompetitive marketplace for small business.\n  Certainly now, I hope from here that we will go forward and stop all \nof the repeal discussions and get down to the business of improving \nhealth care because I think there are still things we need to do. We \nneed to look at how things are working and make sure things are going \nas well as possible, particularly with small businesses, and I feel we \nhave some work to do. But it would be nice if we could get beyond the \nunfortunate commentary that has gone on for too long that somehow \nproviding affordable health insurance for Americans is going to be the \nend of our country.\n  I certainly think that on something like health care, where nobody \ncontrols whether they get sick or mom and dad get sick or the kids get \nsick or their friends get sick--we are in a situation where our job is \nto figure out the best way to support people taking responsibility to \npurchase insurance and make sure that it is affordable, high quality, \nand low cost. And that is something which we--in the greatest country \nin the world, with all of the innovators, all of the smart people we \nhave, the wonderful doctors, the wonderful hospital facilities we have, \ncertainly we can do that.\n  That is, in fact, what is happening through health reform. Right now, \n16.4 million Americans who were without insurance before the Affordable \nCare Act now have the confidence and security of knowing they have \nhealth care coverage. Now, 6.4 million Americans, because of the \nSupreme Court decision, will be able to keep the tax credit. They are \nnot going to see their taxes go up. They are going to be able to keep \nthe tax credits that are going to allow them to make sure that \ninsurance is affordable. That includes over 228,000 people in my home \nState of Michigan. That is a lot of people.\n  What is also so incredibly important is that of those people who \nalready have insurance--the majority of Americans--they are having \nbetter opportunities to keep it, not be blocked, not be dropped, not \nhave caps.\n  Some 129 million Americans have preexisting conditions, whether it is \ndiabetes, juvenile diabetes, cancer. Colleagues here have been in \nsituations of announcing various kinds of cancer, diseases, and so on. \nSome 129 million Americans--including 17 million children--no longer \nhave a risk of being denied coverage because of the insurance company \nbeing able to stop them if they have a preexisting condition.\n\n\n                    ``Beat the Press'' Softball Game\n\n  I was with a wonderful group of women from Congress--if I can just \ndivert from that serious moment to say that last night we raised money \nfor breast cancer survivors in a wonderful game between the press and \nthe women Members of Congress. Despite both teams doing a great job--I \nwas very impressed with both sides, but the great news is that the \nCongresswomen won. We called it ``beat the press.'' It was great. But \nwhat was most important last night was seeing all the breast cancer \nsurvivors who were there, women who had been able to get that checkup, \nbeen able to get that treatment, knowing that going forward, wherever \nthey work--if they move from one job to another, if they change \ninsurance, they are still going to be able to get the coverage they \nneed. They are going to be able to get that mammogram with no copay as \npreventive health care. They are going to be able to get the care they \nneed. If they need treatment, they are not going to arbitrarily have an \ninsurance company come in and say ``We don't really care what your \ndoctor says about how many sessions you need or radiation treatments. \nYou get 10 and that is it'' or ``You get 5 and that is it'' or whatever \nthe number is.\n  Mr. President, 129 million Americans with preexisting conditions \ntoday can breathe a sigh of relief because they are going to be able to \ncontinue to have the health insurance they need. Some 105 million \nAmericans no longer have a lifetime cap on coverage, including mental \nhealth and substance abuse coverage, which is so very significant, and \n76 million Americans with private coverage are eligible for expanded \npreventive services, such as mammograms and prostate screening.\n  We all wish our wonderful friend and colleague Senator King all the \nbest as he gets his treatments next week. We know he will come back \nstrong, as well as all of our colleagues who have been in similar \nsituations.\n  This is a big deal. This really is about saving lives. That is what \nthis is all about. It is not a political game. It is not just going \nback and forth between Republicans and Democrats. This is health. This \nis medical care. If you get that horrible diagnosis--you are sitting in \na doctor's office, and you are told you have cancer or a heart \ncondition or any number of other things--you are going to be able to \nget medical care.\n  We also know that consumers have saved $9 billion since 2011 because \nthe law requires insurance companies to spend at least 80 cents on \nevery dollar we give them on medical care. That was not always the \ncase. You can get a rebate if they don't.\n  So I hope that at this moment in time, we will stop the efforts to \nrepeal health reform. I know it is in the budget that passed. The \nRepublican budget--House and Senate--sets up a process to be able to go \nback and one more time try to repeal health insurance for tens of \nmillions of Americans. I hope we will not do that. I hope the other \nside will not do that. We certainly will not do that. I hope that, \ninstead, we will get about the business of making sure it works as well \nas possible and that we are strengthening the quality measures, the \nopportunities for competition, and continuing to bring rates down.\n  We know that if health reform is repealed, it will increase deficits \nby hundreds of billions of dollars and cause 19 million Americans to \nlose their health insurance just next year, according to the budget \noffice--19 million people--and 24 million people in the next few years. \nThe Congressional Budget Office says that a repeal would result in a \n$353 billion increase in the budget.\n  I congratulate the Supreme Court for common sense today and for \nunderstanding what we meant, what legislative intent was all about, and \nurge that we now decide we are going to work together on health care \nmoving forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4634-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4634-S4635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HIGHWAY BILL\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I have one more topic I would like to \nspeak about today, and that is the fact that we have a looming \ndeadline. In 36 days, the highway trust fund is going to be at zero--\nempty. In 36 days as of today, if we do not act together, there will be \na shutdown of the highway trust fund, which will have a ripple effect \nthrough the entire economy and harm businesses and workers and families \nin every single one of our States coast to coast. The harm will be felt \nequally--Republicans, Democrats, Independents, people who don't \nparticipate in the political process, people who do. Everybody will \nsuffer if we cannot come together and address the highway trust fund. \nIf this happens, Congress fails in its responsibility.\n  With all due respect, I have to say that it falls right on the \nmajority because we have been saying and will\n\n[[Page S4635]]\n\ncontinue to say that we want to work together on a bipartisan basis to \nget this done.\n  There was a time when it was not a partisan issue, when Republicans \nwere leaders on building our infrastructure. In fact, President \nEisenhower said in 1952: ``A network of modern roads is as necessary to \nour national defense as it is to our national economy and our personal \nsafety.''\n  What is interesting is that tomorrow is the day when it is 59 years--\ntomorrow, 59 years ago, Congress approved the Federal Highway Act, \nconnecting all of our country for commerce, for farmers, for families. \nThe rollcall, interestingly, was almost unanimous. Only one Senator \nvoted no. Everybody else voted yes. Ninety-nine voted yes. Then it \npassed in the House on a voice vote.\n  Think about all the discussions we are having today. The Federal \nHighway Act passed on a voice vote in the House. Only one person in the \nSenate voted no. It was signed by President Eisenhower 3 days later. It \nwas the biggest public works project in our Nation's history. It could \nnot have happened if not for a triumph of bipartisanship. A Republican \nPresident working with a Democratic Congress got this done.\n  When we look at who benefited from taking that dirt road, paving it, \nand being able to go across our country, it certainly was colleagues in \nthe West, colleagues in the South. It wasn't just the cities. In fact, \nthey probably had roads already. It was everybody else, as we moved \nacross the country. So this should not be regional. It should not be \npartisan. It doesn't make any sense for us not to come together and get \nthis done.\n  Behind the teamwork at the time, after they worked together to pass \nthis, construction began on a system of 40,000 miles of highways, \nenough to circle the globe 1\\1/2\\ times. That is what was done when \npeople worked together to build the strong infrastructure of the 20th \ncentury.\n  It didn't take long before the economic impact was felt. By the late \n1950s, our interstate highways were responsible for 31 percent of the \nannual growth of the economy. Over 30 percent of the growth in the \neconomy came from that one act, developing the infrastructure to move \ngoods and services and people across our country.\n  The people of this country were getting to their destinations faster, \nmore safely than ever before. Every rural community was flourishing \njust as our urban communities had been.\n  Thanks to President Eisenhower's leadership and a Democratic-\ncontrolled Congress, our roads in the mid-21st century were the envy of \nthe world. Other nations noticed. Those nations aspired to be like us, \nto be like America in a global economy.\n  They now are making huge investments in their infrastructure, from \nChina, at 9 percent of their GDP--four times more than we are--to \nBrazil.\n  I have said before that when I was in China a couple of years ago, \nthey rolled out 20 new international airports--20 international \nairports. That didn't count anything else they were doing.\n  In Brazil they rolled out for us--when I was there with the Secretary \nof Agriculture--their new rail system and road system that was going to \nget agricultural commodities to the ports and move people around their \ncountry so they could move forward as a global, economic power.\n  Today our European competitors spend twice as much as we do, and now \nit is time for America to step forward because, unfortunately, we are \nnow playing catchup. The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness \nReport for 2014 and 2015 ranks America 16th in the world in the quality \nof our roads. America is one spot behind Luxembourg and just one spot \nahead of Croatia, as I said before. Yay, we are beating Croatia. It is \nan embarrassment, and it is not what our people need or our businesses \nneed or what our farmers need or what our workers need.\n  In 2002, that same report had us at No. 5--the fifth best \ntransportation system. Now we are 16th, and the American Society of \nCivil Engineers has given America a D. And how many of us would be \nsatisfied if our children came home from school with a D? I know I \nwouldn't be.\n  It also said that 32 percent of America's major roads are in poor or \nmediocre condition. We know what has happened when bridges have fallen. \nWe know what happens. I have seen it in Michigan and heard the stories \nof people driving under overpasses and cement falls down on the car. \nPeople's lives are threatened. People's lives have been taken.\n  Driving on bad roads costs motorists $109 billion in road repairs a \nyear. I talked to one colleague who told me that he had to replace all \nfour tires on his car when he went through one pothole not long ago, \nand that in the last year he had bought seven new tires for his car, \nwhich is way more than he would have been paying if we had created a \nway to fund our roads on a long-term basis that made sense.\n  It is not right for Congress to neglect our responsibility to \nmaintain and, in fact, strengthen our infrastructure. In fact, we, as \nindividuals and business people driving on roads, driving across \nbridges, and moving across our country, are paying for the fact that we \nhave not come together with a long-term plan. We cannot expect our \nworkers and companies to compete in the 21st century global marketplace \nif we are forced to use 20th century roads and bridges.\n  So I would say, in conclusion, that we have 36 days left to act. Now, \nwhen we want to, we can act pretty quickly.\n  I commend colleagues from the EPW Committee who have come forward \nwith a 6-year bill. We have in front of us a policy passed by the \ncommittee.\n  I congratulate Senator Inhofe and Senator Boxer for coming forward \nwith a proposal that will increase the funding over time, and I believe \nand hope we will do it in an even more robust way. They put forth \npolicies that will, in the long term, create the economic stability for \nour businesses and the jobs for our workers and our families that they \nneed. The DRIVE Act, as we call it, is an important step forward. I \ncommend the chairman of the Finance Committee for holding hearings on \nhow we finance that, because that is our responsibility.\n  I say, again, we have enough time to get this done because President \nEisenhower, over 50 years ago tomorrow, with a Democratic Congress, got \nit done. Thirty-six days is enough time for us to meet the expectations \nof the American people on this issue.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been interested in how the Democrats \nare constantly pushing to get moneys for the Federal highway system. \nAll of us are. Every one of us in this body wants to do everything we \ncan for the highway system. However, they are talking in such big terms \nthat the only way you could possibly reach those kinds of moneys would \nbe with further tax increases.\n  Now, my experience here is that when our friends on the other side \ncall for tax increases, it is so they can spend. Frankly, I would tell \nyou, if we raised the amount of money they are asking for in tax \nincreases, I could tell you all of the projects that are going to be \ndone, and many of them are not the crucial projects in this country.\n  All I can say is that we are going to try to find the moneys, but we \ndon't want to raise taxes, and we certainly don't want to raise the gas \ntax at this time. We will find enough moneys to do, hopefully, a \nmultiyear approach toward the highway plan. I am dedicated to try to \nfind that way.\n  The other committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, is, \nI believe, the committee that has passed a bill calling for a 6-year \nhighway program. I hope that it would meet my highest goal, if we could \ndo that, but I don't think we would be able to do that under the \ncurrent monetary and economic systems that we have today.\n  But, nevertheless, I am going to do my best to try to help to get the \nhighway bill through and to do it the right way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hatch \nbe recognized following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor someone I have had \nthe\n\n[[Page S4636]]\n\nprivilege of calling a friend for many years and who is retiring after \nserving the State of Delaware for the past 6 years, Alan Levin. Alan \nand I both had our first tours of duty in Washington working for the \nsame Republican Senator. I was an intern for Senator William Roth in \nthe early 1980s and Alan was his counsel in the mid-1980s. Alan, a \nwell-known and respected statewide leader in Delaware's Republican \nParty, has, since 2009, served as the director of the Delaware Economic \nDevelopment Office, where he has worked every day to attract businesses \nto Delaware and to help them create good jobs in our communities.\n  Alan took over at a time when communities throughout Delaware were \nhemorrhaging jobs and feeling the very worst effects of the great \nrecession. Today Delaware's unemployment rate sits a full point below \nthe national average at 4.5 percent, in part thanks to the great effort \nof Alan Levin's.\n  During his tenure, Alan exemplified what it means to be a public \nservant. It didn't matter to Alan if someone came to him who was \nthinking of starting a small business that would employ 4 people or if \nit was a company thinking of moving to Delaware and bringing 400 jobs. \nNo matter what, if it was going to help Delaware, Alan was ready to \nmeet with anyone and show them why there was no better place than the \nFirst State, our home State of Delaware, to run a business.\n  Of course, Alan's service to our State began well before 2009. Long a \nleader in the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce for more than two \ndecades, Alan ran Happy Harry's Pharmacy, a family business that he \ngrew over decades of discipline and capable leadership, ultimately \nexpanding it to 76 stores in our region. That success is an important \npart of who Alan is, because to really know him is to know that his job \nat the Delaware Economic Development Office was not one he needed; it \nwas one he chose.\n  Alan could have continued and built his success in the business \nworld--anyone could tell you that--but he made a decision at that key \npoint in his life to strive for something else, something more to make \nhis home State a better place. He recognized his considerable skills, \ntalents, and knowledge and decided to use them to help families and \nbusinesses across our State succeed. That is a profound thing. In a \nworld where there are far too many people who shun public life and \npublic service for good reason, Alan stepped up to the plate when \nDelaware needed him most.\n  Now, fortunately for all of us, Alan isn't going far. We will still \nget to see him in southern Delaware, where he will be working with \nSoDel Concepts in their successful restaurants. It is hopeful that he \nwill get a chance to trade in his business suit for flip-flops and a \nbeach chair from time to time. I just wanted to take this moment on the \nfloor to thank Alan and to thank especially his wife Ellen and his \nwonderful sons, Andrew, Daniel, Jason, and Jess, for letting us have \nAlan in public service for so many years where he has made such a \ndifference. It is my hope he will get to enjoy his family, his \ngrandchildren, and the entire Delaware community, which is so grateful \nto Alan for his public service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4636-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4636-S4638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WORKING TOGETHER IN THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the progress of the \nSenate under the new Republican leadership. In the first 6 months of \nthis Congress, we have passed bipartisan, commonsense legislation that \nhas delivered meaningful results to the American people.\n  As we work to return the Senate to regular order--and that has not \nbeen an easy thing--we are rebuilding this institution's reputation as \nthe world's greatest deliberative body, something that it has not been \nover the last number of years. To that end, we have renewed our \ncommitment to the open amendment process and the committee system, \nwhich give all Members--from the most seasoned chairman to the \nfreshman--a hand in drafting and improving legislation.\n  The progress we have made is remarkable, especially considering the \ndifficult situation we inherited. At the end of the 113th Congress, \npartisan grandstanding and festering dysfunction had tarnished this \nbody's reputation. This Senate was beset by gridlock and weak \nleadership more focused on political messaging than constructive \nlegislation. At the end of the 2014, Congress had a historically low \napproval rating of only 9 percent and, in many respects, the way the \nCongress was being run, we deserved it. Americans had every reason to \ndisapprove of what was going on. These persistent low approval ratings \nreflected the American people's frustration with their Federal \nGovernment and the direction of our country under the failed policies \nand leadership of the President and his party.\n  Under our new leadership, we are working to regain the trust of the \nAmerican people. Already, the Senate has taken up and passed nearly 40 \npieces of bipartisan legislation, and our extensive efforts to restore \nconfidence in the legislative branch are beginning to bear fruit. \nConsider our legislative accomplishments thus far.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, Republicans and Democrats came \ntogether to pass the Hoeven-Manchin bill to authorize the unreasonably \ndelayed Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  We also passed my Amy and Vicky act, a bill I authored to create an \neffective, balanced restitution process for victims of child \npornography. Others deserve lots of credit on that bill.\n  In a bipartisan manner, Republican leaders cooperated with Democrats \nto repeal and replace Medicare's sustainable growth rate. Instead of \nresorting to patch after patch, year after year--that is what we had \nbeen doing here for so long; that is really a tremendous achievement--\nwe came together to work out a balanced package that both protects \nseniors and includes important cost controls. It demonstrated the scope \nof what Congress can do when Members work together, and it represented \nan important step forward in reforming our Nation's entitlement \nprograms. With regard to that, we paired it with the CHIP bill, which \nwas the Hatch-Kennedy bill for young children who were left out of the \nhealth care system, and that passed too.\n\n  We built on this positive momentum when the Senate passed the Cornyn-\nKlobuchar human trafficking bill--a very important bill. With this \nlegislation, Congress established a special fund providing victims of \nhuman trafficking the resources they need to repair their shattered \nlives.\n  This bill suffered a number of hiccups along the way. Yet ultimately \nwe were able to come together in a collaborative fashion to overcome \nour differences.\n  We again bridged the partisan divide when we passed the Iran Nuclear \nAgreement Review Act--a monumental piece of legislation. This \nlegislation ensures Congress's right to oversee any agreement the \nPresident reaches with Iranian leaders and reasserts the Senate's \nvaluable role in approving international treaties. Despite our \ndivergent opinions on the Obama administration's negotiation efforts, \nwe were able to devise a compromise that earned the support of nearly \nevery Senator.\n  These are not small achievements. It is amazing we have been able to \ndo so many in these first 6 months. Just last week, we worked together, \nyet again, in a bipartisan fashion to pass the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, reauthorizing important defense programs critical to \nour national security--a complex and very difficult bill to handle. And \nno less than our wonderful Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, handled \nthat matter on the floor, along with the help of a lot of others.\n  In passing this legislation, our new majority did not run roughshod \nover the minority. Rather, we collaborated with our colleagues in the \nminority to draft legislation agreeable to both sides.\n  Our bipartisan work hasn't been limited to this Chamber. We have also \nworked closely with the White House to pass trade legislation critical \nto our country's economic future. In fact, just a short while ago, the \nPresident called me and thanked me. His top Chief of Staff Denis \nMcDonough called me yesterday and thanked me--something that, frankly, \nI was very grateful for.\n  In fact, yesterday's passage of trade promotion authority might be \nthe\n\n[[Page S4637]]\n\nstrongest evidence to date that the Senate is back to work on behalf of \nthe American people. This bipartisan piece of legislation is one of the \nPresident's highest trade priorities because it supports U.S. job \ngrowth, boosts American exports, enhances our ability to negotiate \ntrade agreements, and makes our goods and services more competitive \nglobally. TPA will give the United States viable pathways to enter into \ncritical trade agreements with our international partners to level the \nplaying field for American exporters, creating and sustaining more and \nbetter paying American jobs.\n  Beyond the content of our legislation, the Senate's return to regular \norder and an open amendment process is remarkable. At times, it has \nbeen difficult to make progress in restoring the Senate as an \ninstitution, and the consideration of complex legislation can be a slow \nand arduous process. Nonetheless, this body has been deliberate and \nthoughtful in our consideration of legislation. Often, these bills have \nbeen considered for several weeks and occupied many hours of valuable \nfloor time. These bills have required dozens of amendments to be \nconsidered before they were ultimately put before the Senate for a vote \non final passage. Though this process is difficult and often laborious, \nit is the way things should be done.\n  I have had friends on the other side of the floor come to me and say: \nThis is wonderful. We are able to have amendments again. We are able to \ndo the work of the Senate again. We feel good about it, and they feel \ngood about doing the bipartisan work that we have done.\n  The Presiding Officer did an awful lot of good bringing the Hoeven \nbill through, and we can name so many others. There are great people on \nthe other side who have cooperated. With regard to that, I think of \nSenator Wyden, who has worked very hard and very closely with me on a \nnumber of bills but especially the trade promotion authority bill, \nwhich is the key bill to enable this administration to enter into good \nagreements with foreign countries that are important to us. Without \nthat bill, we wouldn't have these agreements. We may still not have \nthem, unless they are done right, but at least we can say we have given \nthe administration the opportunity to do it right.\n  Now, in spite of our successes so far in this Congress, there are \nstill many who oppose and criticize our efforts to restore the Senate \nto its proper function. The minority leader might be foremost \namong these detractors. I wish to take just a moment to respond to some \nof his sharp criticisms. In recent remarks, the Democratic leader has \nwillfully ignored the significant achievements of the current Congress, \neven arguing the Republican-led Senate has done nothing to help the \nAmerican people. The minority leader's accusation is patently false. He \nlobs these criticisms to distract the American people from his failed \nleadership in the last Congress.\n\n  I happen to like the minority leader. He is my friend. I care for \nhim. But there is no excuse for that kind of language on the floor of \nthe Senate. I have to say he has cooperated and helped do some of these \nbills. He ought to be taking credit for it rather than lobbing jabs \nfrom across the aisle.\n  Contrary to the claims of the minority leader, the current Republican \nleadership has been remarkably successful at doing exactly what Leader \nMcConnell promised we would do: pass legislation that improves the \neconomy, makes it easier for Americans to get jobs, and helps restore \nAmericans' confidence in their country and government. Importantly, the \nmajority leader has kept his promise of restoring the proper role of \nthe Senate by enhancing deliberation on legislation through an open and \nrobust committee and floor amendment process.\n  To appreciate fully the success of the new Congress, we need only to \nreview the failures of the past. As we all remember too well, under the \ntight-fisted control of the Democratic leader, the Senate, in all of \n2014, was only allowed to take a total of 17 rollcall votes on \namendments--17 rollcall votes on amendments in an entire year. Some of \nthe Democratic Senators who were defeated had never brought up an \namendment on the floor of the Senate. They didn't have that privilege. \nThey didn't have that remarkable experience.\n  The Democratic leader shut down the amendment process by abusing \nprocedural mechanisms and dismantled the rights of the minority in this \nChamber. This dysfunction lies in stark contrast to the way Leader \nMcConnell is leading the Senate today. Under the new majority leader, \nwe have made progress that is tangible, even measurable. Just look at \nthe facts: In the 6 months of 2015, the Senate has taken over 130 \nrollcall votes on amendments.\n  In other words, the Senate has taken more than seven times as many \nrollcall votes on amendments in the first 6 months of this year than \nthe current majority leader allowed in all of last year. It is worth \nnoting that a majority of the rollcall votes taken this year have been \non amendments introduced by Democrats. A majority of the rollcall votes \ntaken this year have been on amendments by our friends on the other \nside. They haven't been blocked. This is powerful evidence that the \nRepublican-led Senate is committed to working in a manner respectful of \nthe minority's voice.\n  Additionally, we have considered and agreed to 183 amendments this \nyear. That means we have agreed to nearly four times as many amendments \nin the first 6 months of this year than we did in the first 6 months of \nthe last Congress. I am pleased the Senate has largely returned to \noperating under regular order with increased deliberation and an open \nand robust floor consideration process. The bottom line is that this \nincreased transparency and deliberation has greatly benefited the work \nof Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n  That said, I think we can all agree the Senate has a lot more work to \ndo. I am hopeful we can capitalize on our recent success by continuing \nto tackle difficult issues, such as sustaining the highway trust fund, \nworking toward comprehensive tax reform, and improving our Nation's \ncyber security. These are important bills and we have to work on them. \nAs we work together to find solutions to these problems, I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to practice the principle of \nmutual restraint.\n  Senator Mike Mansfield, the longtime Democratic Senate majority \nleader, and a wonderful man whom I knew, counseled that the remedy to \npartisan gridlock in the Senate ``lies not in the seeking of shortcuts, \nnot in the cracking of nonexistent whips, not in wheeling and dealing, \nbut in an honest facing of the situation and a resolution of it by the \nSenate itself, by accommodation, by respect for one another, [and] by \nmutual restraint.''\n  Now, both parties must make certain sacrifices in order for the \nSenate to function. The majority leadership must generally refrain from \nbringing divisive and partisan messaging bills before the Senate for \nconsideration and should seek to gather bipartisan support through a \nconsensus. Mutual restraint also requires in most cases the majority \nleadership to allow legislation to be thoroughly vetted by the \ncommittee of jurisdiction and to allow for an open amendment process, \nwhich provides an opportunity for all Senators to contribute to the \nChamber's work.\n  I remember how the ObamaCare bill was formulated. It was formulated \nnot in the committee of jurisdiction, where we had all those people \nwith all that experience; it was done with the White House, in a small \nroom with just a few Senators who decided this monumental bill--passed \nonly with Democratic support--that we are now all subject to. That bill \nhas been anything but a success. Now, I have to say, all Senators \nshould be able to contribute to the Chamber's work.\n  This duty is not incumbent upon the majority alone. The minority also \nhas to practice restraint, including resisting impulses to filibuster \nroutine unanimous consent requests and insisting on poison pill \namendments. The minority in the Senate has powerful rights that can be \nused to grind the work of the Senate to a halt, but the minority should \nnot abuse those rights. At times, it can be appropriate for the \nminority to utilize all of the procedural mechanisms at their disposal \nto legitimately and judiciously disagree with a serious policy being \nconsidered by the Senate. However, when the minority deliberately \nfrustrates the operation of the Senate for partisan gain, it is an\n\n[[Page S4638]]\n\noffense to the institution--and I say that with regard to both sides.\n  My friend the majority leader has been committed to conducting the \nSenate's consideration of legislation in a deliberate manner, with \nprudence and restraint. He has renewed and enhanced deliberation and \nopen consideration of serious policy proposals. We have not made a \npoint of pushing Republican messaging bills, but rather we have worked \nhard to find broad bipartisan consensus. Although it has not been easy \nby any means, I feel confident the American people are beginning to \nregain confidence in the legislative branch as it is being led today \nunder Republican leadership.\n  We still have a long way to go before we can restore the full \nconfidence and trust of the American people--at least that is my \nviewpoint--but we are really once again moving the country in the right \ndirection. This Senate is a dramatic improvement from the way business \nhas been conducted over the past several years. We are not focused on \nscoring cheap political points but are deliberating serious policy and \nlegislation aimed at meaningful reform.\n  The Senate, under Republican leadership, has passed bipartisan \nlegislation that will improve the lives of all Americans. We are doing \nthe right kind of work, and we are doing it the right way. We are not \nfocused on political gimmicks and pageantry; rather, we are interested \nin real, substantive policy aimed at strengthening the Nation, our \neconomy, and our national security. We have made significant progress, \nand we continue to work together to restore our reputation as the \nworld's greatest deliberative body.\n  In the Finance Committee alone, as of yesterday we have passed 36 \nbipartisan bills out of that committee, which wasn't really allowed to \nfunction during the last number of years. It was so bad that Senator \nCoburn left it. He said we are not getting anything done. Frankly, we \nweren't. A lot of that was because of the way the Senate was being led \nat that particular time.\n  I am pleased to say I think the Finance Committee is restoring itself \nas the greatest deliberative committee on Capitol Hill, certainly in \nthe Senate.\n  In that regard, it has been a privilege to work with Paul Ryan over \nin the House. In all of our meetings, there has never been any real \npush to be partisan. It is to get the job done, to do it the best way \nwe possibly can, to involve our brethren and sisters on the other side, \nand to make sure our side does what really ought to be done in our \nrespective bodies.\n  We are going to have tie-ups in the future, I know, but it was \ngetting so it was in every way. And I suspect there were sincere \nmotives in doing that, in trying to protect the then-majority's side \nbefore this year. I understand that. But it went way too far, and it \nwas not the way to run the Senate.\n  We all know Senator McConnell is a strong, tough, intelligent, \ncomplete Senator and certainly majority leader. That can irritate some \npeople who don't look at the real facts and don't look at what he \nreally stands for and what he is really trying to do. But I have found \nhim to be fair. I have found him to be fair and deliberate and somebody \nyou can work with as long as you are working in good faith.\n  I would like to see both of our leaders work in good faith so we can \ndo things for our country first and quit worrying so much about who is \ngoing to run the Senate for the next couple of years or who is going to \nwin or who is going to get the big headline. Let's worry about running \nthe country in the proper way. To do that, it takes both sides, not \njust one side, and it takes a deliberative process that elevates the \nSenate again to the greatest deliberative body in the world. We can do \nit.\n  I caution both leaders to do everything in their power to see that we \ndo work together as much as we can. When we fight, let's have real good \nfights, but let's do it over substantive things, not just deliberated \nprocedural matters.\n  But the fact is that we have done quite a bit in these first 6 \nmonths. The leader has done a great job in getting us there, and we \nhave had a lot of help from our friends on the other side. I want to \nkeep that system going so we can do even better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

BURWELL DECISION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this morning the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States came down with its decision in King v. Burwell. I think \nit will probably be a decision that is remembered for a long time, \ncertainly by Members of Congress. We were watching carefully, closely, \nwondering what the Supreme Court was going to say about the Affordable \nCare Act, otherwise known as ObamaCare. We passed it 5 years ago, and \nit was about the issue of health insurance--how many Americans who were \nuninsured would be insured under the Affordable Care Act and how much \nit would help health insurance cost.\n  Controversial, as the Senator from Utah just noted--it was passed on \na partisan roll call. There was an effort to write a bipartisan bill, \nand it failed. There was no sentiment shared by both sides of the aisle \nto create the Affordable Care Act or anything like it.\n  How important is this decision, King v. Burwell, a decision which \nbasically sustained the Affordable Care Act and said that the tax \ncredits--which are part of the act--given to families in lower income \nsituations were legal and constitutional? I think it is one of the most \nimportant decisions because I think health insurance is one of the most \nimportant things in our lives.\n  If you have ever been in the position as a father with a sick child, \na seriously ill child without health insurance, you will never forget \nit. I know. I have been there. As a law student, my wife and I got \nmarried and had a little baby. She had some challenges, and we had no \nhealth insurance. Every time we took her to the hospital, every time we \nsaw a doctor, I wondered if she was getting the best that she could get \nbecause we didn't have health insurance. It meant waiting in big \nwaiting rooms with a lot of other people without health insurance and \nhoping that whoever walked through that door, that doctor would be just \nwhat my daughter needed. I will never forget it. When it comes to a \ntime when people are debating about health insurance and how important \nit is, it sure is important to me. It was even when I didn't have it, \nas I realized how insecure and uncertain I was.\n  About 5 years ago, I was down in southern Illinois, Marion, IL, which \nis a great little town. I stayed there in deep southern Illinois at a \nlocal motel, and in the morning I would go up and go in. They had a \nlittle breakfast buffet there. There was a sweet lady named Judy. She \nwas always there; ``Senator, what can I do for you?'' and all that. She \ncouldn't have been nicer. I got to know Judy over the times we stayed \nthere, and we talked about her life.\n  Judy was 60 years old. She was working part time in this motel--kind \nof in the world of hospitality--and she took care of guests when they \nwent to the breakfast buffet in the morning. We talked about her life. \nShe had grown up in southern Illinois. She had worked all the way \nthrough her life, job after job after job. I knew she was a hard-\nworking lady and a good person.\n  One day she said to me: Senator, I have heard about this debate in \nWashington about the Affordable Care Act, and I am scared.\n  I said: Why?\n  She said: I don't think I can afford it, and they won't let me pick \nmy own doctor.\n  I said: Well, Judy, I don't want to get personal, but I need to ask \nyou a few questions. Do you have health insurance?\n  No. No, Senator. I have never had health insurance in my life. I have \nnever had a job that offered health insurance.\n  She was 60 years old.\n  I said: Now I am going to get real personal. Can you give me an idea \nhow much money you make? If you want to, can you tell me?\n  Sure.\n  She told me.\n  I said: Judy, when it is all over, you are going to be covered by \nMedicaid. You won't be paying for this. For the first time in your \nlife, you are going to have health insurance. You are going to be able \nto go to the hospital and not be a charity case.\n  She said: It won't cost me?\n  No. Your income is so low that you qualify for this tax credit and \nthis\n\n[[Page S4639]]\n\ntreatment under Medicaid. You don't have to pay out of pocket.\n  The next time I went back there after the law passed and we knew she \nhad Medicaid coverage, Judy didn't look the same. She was obviously \nsick.\n  I said: What is wrong?\n  She said: Well, I just got diagnosed with diabetes.\n  I said: Well, at least you have Medicaid.\n  She said: I sure do. And I have a doctor. I like him, and he is \nhelping me. And I have a hospital that I can go to if I need to.\n  There she was, for the first time in her life at the age of 60, with \ndiabetes, and with health insurance. From my point of view, that is \nwhat this decision and this debate is all about.\n  What we set out to do with the passage of the Affordable Care Act was \nto make sure health insurance was there for that young couple getting \nstarted with a baby who otherwise wouldn't have had health insurance or \nthat 60-year-old woman who was working a job that didn't provide health \ninsurance benefits who was facing diabetes.\n  Well, it has helped a lot of people. When we started the debate on \nthe Affordable Care Act, there were 50 million Americans--out of over \n320 million, 50 million--who had no health insurance. Because of this \nlaw, the Affordable Care Act, almost one-third of them--16 million--now \nhave health insurance. I think that is a good thing. Most Americans \nwould celebrate that we have reduced the rolls of the uninsured by one-\nthird. It means they have peace of mind having coverage.\n  Roy Romanowski, in Chicago--I sat next to Roy at a community health \nclinic in a neighborhood. I go to those clinics all the time because I \nthink they are one of the best places on Earth to meet some great \nmedical professionals who are doing a wonderful service for a lot of \npeople who live in a neighborhood and who wouldn't have a place to go.\n  Roy Romanowski, a big, barrel-chested Polish guy from Chicago, is a \nmusician. He plays a guitar. He never had a solid 40-hour-a-week job in \nhis life and never had health insurance. He has it now. The Affordable \nCare Act gave Roy health insurance coverage for the first time--health \ninsurance coverage he can afford.\n  That is what the decision in this court case was about today--whether \npeople like Roy and Judy would have health insurance. And it does \nsomething else: It moves us along the path we want to be on--and not \nonly that more and more people have health insurance. Here is good news \nfor everybody: The rate of growth in health care costs is going down. \nOh, it is not a dramatic plunge. We didn't expect it to be. But even as \nit starts to level off a little bit, it has a dramatic impact. It means \neven if you don't have your health insurance plan through the \nAffordable Care Act, if you have it through your employer, the health \ninsurance premiums your employer faces are less than they would have \nbeen. So it is starting to flatten out this growth and the cost of \nhealth care.\n  What about Medicare? Medicare is important for over 40 million \nAmericans. Here is the great news on Medicare--two things. No. 1, \nbecause the overall cost of health care is coming down just a little, \nin 5 years, the projected solvency of Medicare has been--they have \nadded 13 years to it, 13 more years of solvency for a program \ncritically important to seniors and disabled people. So Medicare has \nbenefited from it as well.\n  There is a second part. If you are under Medicare and you have \nprescription Part D, which covers your prescriptions under Medicare, we \nclosed the doughnut hole. The doughnut hole used to be that point in \nthe cost of your prescription drugs when Medicare no longer paid for it \nand you had to pay for it out of pocket. That was a crazy idea in the \nlaw, and it cost seniors thousands of dollars. And then, of course, \nafter they paid out of pocket, Medicare came in to cover the additional \nexpenses. We got rid of that craziness. We eliminated that doughnut \nhole. So for seniors wanting to take the medicines the doctor has \nprescribed so they can feel good, be strong, be independent, stay on \ntheir own, this Affordable Care Act helped them pay. In Illinois, it \nwas about $1,000 per Medicare recipient per year in prescription drug \ncosts taken care of by the Affordable Care Act.\n  Let me tell you a couple other things this law did and does. Do you \nhave any children in your family who are going to college? Are you \nworried about when they graduate from college, whether they have a job \nand health insurance? I was. My wife and I were worried about our \ndaughter.\n  I remember calling her.\n  Jennifer, you just got out of school. Do you have health insurance?\n  Dad, I don't need it. I am healthy as can be.\n  That is not what a father wants to hear.\n  The Affordable Care Act says that your son or daughter can stay under \nyour family plan until they reach the age of 26. I think that is a good \nthing. As a parent who had a college grad looking for a job, I had the \npeace of mind of knowing she was under the family health insurance \nplan.\n  So the people who want to repeal the Affordable Care Act--do they \nreally want to repeal that provision?\n  And here is another one that is important. How many of us can say \nwith certainty that in our homes, in our households, there isn't \nsomeone with a preexisting condition, someone who--perhaps a child--has \nhad diabetes, a spouse who has had good luck in beating breast cancer \nor prostate cancer? Someone there is a history of mental illness. In \nthe old days before the Affordable Care Act, what I just described to \nyou were grounds for denying health insurance coverage or charging \nthrough the roof. Well, that was changed by the Affordable Care Act. \nPreexisting conditions no longer disqualify you from health insurance \nin America.\n  The President said this morning, after the Supreme Court decision: We \nwill have to explain to our grandkids there was a time when you \ncouldn't get health insurance if you were sick.\n  Thank goodness that time has passed and the Affordable Care Act \nprotects people. Overall, this act in the last 5 years has made real \nprogress for America. For 16 million Americans, it has given many of \nthem health insurance for the first time in their lives, health \ninsurance they can afford and a tax credit to help them pay for it that \nwas protected today by this Supreme Court decision.\n  In all of the time since the Affordable Care Act has been the law, we \nhave heard from the other party that they want to repeal it. But in \nthat same period of time, we have never ever heard what they would \nreplace it with. They don't have a better idea. Here is what I hope we \nwill do. I hope we will put behind us this whole effort of let's file \nanother lawsuit, let's vote another time to abolish the Affordable Care \nAct. I hope instead that there will be a constructive dialogue between \nDemocrats and Republicans to make the Affordable Care Act better.\n  I voted for it and am proud of it. It is one of the most important \nvotes I ever cast in Congress. But it is not perfect. I tell my town \nmeetings in Illinois that the only perfect law was brought down the \nside of a mountain by Senator Moses on clay tablets. Ever since then, \nwe have done our best to write laws but know that we have to be ready \nto improve them and to react to changing circumstances.\n  We should do the same with the Affordable Care Act. I think there are \nthings we can do to make it stronger, and on a bipartisan basis we \nshould. Until this moment in time of this Supreme Court decision, it \nhas been politically impossible to have that conversation.\n  The Restaurant Association came to see me. They are worried. They \nsaid: Wait a minute. We have a lot of part-time employees and a lot of \nthem don't want health insurance. Their spouses have health insurance. \nWe are looking at the law. We want some clarity here about what our \nobligation will be under the Affordable Care Act.\n  They deserve that clarity. I will tell you as I stand here today, I \nam willing to sit down with any Republican Senator and work out changes \nand provisions in the law to make sure we treat these employees fairly \nand we give them coverage and do it in a fashion that is fair to their \nemployer as well as individual employees. These are things we can and \nshould do.\n  For the longest time, there were people who opposed Social Security--\ngoing way back in time 70 or 80 years when it\n\n[[Page S4640]]\n\nwas created. They said that it will never last; it will never stay. \nEventually, public sentiment changed and people realized Social \nSecurity was critically important for America.\n  The same thing was true for Medicare. There were those who said: \nSocialized medicine, you have to get rid of it. Now, 60 years later, 50 \nyears later, they understand it is part of America. For millions of \nAmericans, it is critically important. Medicaid, the same thing.\n  I hope today will be that turning point on the Affordable Care Act, \nwhere we decide on a bipartisan basis that this is part of our future, \nproviding health insurance for uninsured Americans, doing it in a fair \nway, and particularly for those in lower income situations.\n  This was a historic decision, King v. Burwell, at the Supreme Court--\n6 to 3. A decisive majority opinion said the Affordable Care Act is \nlegal and constitutional and should move forward. I hope that message \nmakes it across the street over to the Halls of Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4640-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY AFFAIRS V. INCLUSIVE \n                       COMMUNITIES PROJECT, INC.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this morning, the Supreme Court also \nannounced its decision in Texas Department of Housing and Community \nAffairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc.\n  In a major victory for the millions of Americans who rely on the \nprotections of the Fair Housing Act to challenge unfair, discriminatory \nhousing practices, the Court held that disparate impact claims are \npermissible under the law.\n  The Fair Housing Act was a landmark civil rights bill passed in 1968 \nto combat widespread housing discrimination. Under the disparate impact \ndoctrine, the law allows plaintiffs to challenge housing policies that \nhave a ``disproportionally adverse effect on minorities,'' without \nproving discriminatory intent.\n  Housing discrimination is rarely as overt today as it was in the \n1960s, and disparate impact claims thus play an important role in \npreventing housing segregation. Federal appeals courts across the \ncountry have long held that these types of claims are permissible and \nconstitutional. Today, the Supreme Court rightfully affirmed this \nprinciple.\n  As Justice Kennedy acknowledged in the opinion, the Fair Housing Act \nplays a ``continuing role in moving the Nation toward a more integrated \nsociety.''\n  This past week has reminded us that we have much to accomplish in \ncreating a more just and equal society. On issues ranging from voting \nrights to mass incarceration, there are fundamental disparities that we \nmust address.\n  Thankfully, the Court's ruling today ensures that the full \nprotections of the Fair Housing Act remain intact. We must continue to \nwork to prevent discrimination in housing and give all American \nfamilies access to safe, affordable homes in inclusive, prosperous \ncommunities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SLYE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and pay tribute \nto a very dear friend of mine who has sadly passed away. MAJ Ken Slye, \nretired from both the U.S. Army and the Office of the Secretary of \nDefense, died on June 24, 2015, at the Robley Rex VA Medical Center in \nLouisville. He was 81 years old.\n  Ken was a retired master Army aviator who did two combat tours in \nVietnam, flying both Chinook and Huey helicopters. After his retirement \nfrom the Army, Ken was very active in the local Louisville military \ncommunity as well as that of Fort Knox. He was a past chairman of the \nLouisville Armed Forces Committee; a four-times past president of the \nLouisville Chapter, Military Officers Association of America; a member \nof VFW 1170 Middletown; of the DAV; and of the American Legion G.I. Joe \nPost 244 in Jeffersontown.\n  Ken served on the Veteran Experience Board at the Robley Rex VA \nMedical Center, and in fact he and fellow veteran Carl Kaelin were \ninstrumental in getting the medical center named after Kentucky's own \nWorld War I-era vet, Robley Rex. Ken was the recipient of the 2015 \nLouisville Armed Forces Patriot Award just this past May.\n  Ken was also heavily involved with professional tennis as an \ninternational chair umpire, and he served in the chair in matches all \nover the United States as well as the United Kingdom, Germany, \nAustralia, Canada, Brazil, Japan, France, Argentina, Mexico, the \nNetherlands, and Jamaica. He began his officiating career in 1974 and \nwas a graduate of the first professional tennis officials' school, in \n1976 in Dallas. He chaired matches at the U.S. Open, Wimbledon, the \nFrench Open, and the Davis Cup.\n  Ken officiated in 16 matches with legendary player John McEnroe. Ken \nwas the only Kentuckian to chair the final of a Grand Slam Tennis \nTournament. He was the chair umpire for the classic 1980 U.S. Open \nMen's Singles Final between McEnroe and Bjorn Borg, watched on \ntelevision by 20 million fans and 22,000 in the stands at Flushing \nMeadow. He was the chair umpire at the 1987 Wimbledon semi-final match \nbetween Stefan Edberg and Ivan Lendl. Other tennis legends Ken \nencountered during his career were Arthur Ashe, Stan Smith, Ilie \nNastase, and Jimmy Connors.\n  Born in Boston and raised in Wellesley, MA, Ken moved to Louisville \nbecause it was the hometown of his wife, Linda. He sang bass with the \nLouisville Thoroughbred Chorus for 4 years and served as its manager \nfor 6 years. He served for 20 years with the Secretary of Defense's \nstaff on top of his heroic service with the Army.\n  Ken is survived by his wife, Linda, as well as his son Scott Slye and \ndaughter Susan Fabiano; his granddaughters Stacey Brandon and Audrey \nRibley; his six great-grandchildren, Ashlynn, Will, Addison, Cooper, \nScott, and Brystal; and Linda's son and daughter Jeff Furnish and Meg \nFurnish.\n  MAJ Ken Slye bravely served his country in uniform during a time of \nwar, and he served his fellow veterans when he returned home. He will \nbe greatly missed, not only by the military community throughout \nKentucky but also by his many friends who knew and loved him.\n  I am proud to count myself among that group of friends. I relied on \nKen's advice and friendship. I want to extend my deepest condolences to \nhis family in their time of loss. The Commonwealth of Kentucky joins \nthem in mourning this heroic man, patriot, and soldier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4640-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4640-S4641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING THOMAS BLAKE RATLIFF\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a very dear \nfriend of mine and a great Kentuckian who has sadly passed away. Thomas \nBlake Ratliff of Pikeville, a Navy veteran, died on April 20, 2015. He \nwas 88 years old.\n  Born on May 27, 1926, Tom attended elementary, junior high, and high \nschool at the Pikeville College Academy and graduated in 1944. Upon \ngraduation he joined the Navy and served in the Pacific theater during \nWorld War II until being honorably discharged in 1946.\n  After his naval service, Tom attended Pikeville College and the \nUniversity of Kentucky, where he received a bachelor of laws in 1951 \nand a juris doctorate in 1970. Tom and his wife Myrtle returned home to \nPikeville after Tom graduated law school, and he practiced law and also \nbecame involved in the coal business. Tom also had business interests \nin hotels, restaurants, the Reynold's Body Company and in properties in \nKentucky and Florida.\n  Tom was also active in civic affairs and public service. A passionate \nsupporter of the Republican Party, he served in various capacities for \nthe local, State, and national GOP. He was a great supporter of mine \nand I remember well his enthusiasm and dedication\n\n[[Page S4641]]\n\nover the years. He was elected as the Commonwealth attorney for the \n35th Judicial Circuit and served in that post from 1964 to 1970. He was \nalso the Republican candidate for Lieutenant Governor in 1967.\n  In addition to his work and positions in politics, Tom gave \ngenerously of his time to many worthy causes, including service as the \ndirector of the Pikeville Methodist Hospital and as a trustee of \nPikeville College. He was the president of the Pikeville Rotary Club \nand volunteered his time with the Coal Operators Association and the \nBoy Scouts.\n  Tom was a Christian who attended Pikeville United Methodist Church. \nHe also served on the church's administrative board. His hobbies \nincluded reading, traveling, boating, and being physically active. He \nloved to travel and had visited all the continents.\n  Tom is survived by his wife, Myrtle; the two were married on August \n21, 1949. He is also survived by his daughters Susan G. Tillotson and \nJan E. Sharpe; his sons Kevin N. Ratliff and Chris Ratliff; his \ngrandchildren Elizabeth J. Spraggs, Juliet Kamper, Jonathan K. Wright, \nThomas N. Ratliff, Daniel C. Ratliff, and Jordan B. Ratliff; his great-\ngrandchild, Tiara Wright; his sister, Charlene R. Easton; and his \nbrother, Roger E. J. Ratliff.\n  I want to extend my deepest condolences to Myrtle and to the family \nin this time of loss. The Commonwealth of Kentucky joins them in \nmourning this hero and public servant. Tom Ratliff bravely served his \ncountry in uniform during World War II, and served his fellow \nKentuckians in public office. He was a hero and a patriot who I was \nproud to know and to call a friend. He will be greatly missed, not only \nby his family but by his many friends who knew and loved him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4641-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RECOGNIZING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF MIRACLE FLIGHTS FOR KIDS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I recognize the 30th anniversary of \nMiracle Flights for Kids.\n  Since its founding in southern Nevada in 1985, Miracle Flights for \nKids has been providing airline tickets for sick children in low-income \nfamilies. These flights are truly miracles that allow children to \nreceive the specialized medical care they need and otherwise would not \nhave access to due to distance and travel costs. In the beginning, \nMiracle Flights for Kids was a small organization that served a handful \nof local children, but today the organization coordinates hundreds of \nflights a month, including a record 976 flights in April 2015. To date, \nMiracle Flights for Kids has coordinated more than 92,000 flights \nresulting in 50 million miles of travel. These flights have helped to \nsave and improve the quality of life for countless children.\n  Families from across the country and the world contact Miracle \nFlights for Kids for assistance, and the organization works to ensure \neligible children have access to the care they need, regardless of how \nfar away the treatment center is located. They have flown children \nrelatively short distances, such as flights from Nevada to California, \nand longer distances, including flights from Alaska to Colorado. They \nhave even flown children from as far away as Turkey to Maryland. \nMiracle Flights for Kids also works to ensure that children can travel \nback to their treatment center as many times as their doctor deems \nnecessary. For instance, they provided more than 40 flights from Ohio \nto Texas for one little girl so she could receive the medical attention \nshe required.\n  Having a sick child is a devastating, trying experience for any \nparent. The services provided by Miracle Flights for Kids give families \nsome peace-of-mind as they focus on getting their child healthy. I \ncommend Miracle Flights for Kids for 30 years of exceptional service to \nchildren and families in Nevada and throughout the world. Their work is \ntruly appreciated and admired, and I wish them continued success for \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4641-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING MARGARET A. FOCARINO AND JAMES D. SMITH\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to recognize two \ndistinguished public servants who are leaving their positions at the \nU.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO,--Margaret ``Peggy'' \nFocarino, Commissioner for Patents, and James D. Smith, Chief \nAdministrative Patent Judge. Both have played critical roles in \nbringing the USPTO into the 21st century by working tirelessly to \nimplement the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, the most comprehensive \nupdate of U.S. patent law since the 1950s. The patent system is one of \nthe cornerstones of our economy. It drives innovation, growth, and job \ncreation. This country has been fortunate to have dedicated leaders \nsuch as Ms. Focarino and Mr. Smith in key positions at this crucial \nAgency.\n  Peggy Focarino became Commissioner for Patents in 2012, where she has \nbeen instrumental in developing and implementing administrative changes \nmade by the Leahy-Smith act. Working collaboratively with all \nstakeholders in the patent community while implementing this law is a \nhallmark of her tenure as Commissioner for Patents. As someone who \nworked for nearly 6 years to pass comprehensive patent reform \nlegislation, I can attest to the fact that it is not easy to bring all \nof these stakeholders together and build consensus. The provisions she \nworked to implement include the transition to first-inventor-to-file \nand the USPTO's fee-setting authority, but her work encompassed a \nnumber of other aspects of the Leahy-Smith act as well.\n  Ms. Focarino's impressive tenure as Commissioner for Patents likely \ndid not come as a surprise to anyone who followed her rise within the \nUSPTO. She started at the Agency in 1977 as a patent examiner. In 1997, \nshe was promoted to the senior executive service. Throughout her almost \n40 years at the USPTO, she distinguished herself as a leader within the \nAgency, receiving the Department of Commerce Silver Medal for \nLeadership in 2010. She also received American University's School of \nPublic Affairs Roger W. Jones Award for Executive Leadership in 2010. \nWhile the USPTO will continue to do important work without her, there \nis little doubt that her leadership will be missed.\n  James Smith also played a key role in the implementation of the \nLeahy-Smith act. Mr. Smith became the Chief Administrative Patent Judge \nin 2011. During his tenure, Mr. Smith worked to implement the postgrant \nreview proceedings the law established. Thanks to Mr. Smith's \nleadership at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, these postgrant \nproceedings have been successful in providing low-cost alternatives to \nlitigation for reviewing the patentability of issued patents. His \nstrong and varied background in the private sector, including time \nspent working on intellectual property issues at large companies and \nlaw firms, served him well as he helped the USPTO implement these \nessential components of the Leahy-Smith act.\n  It is always difficult to see good public servants leave their roles. \nMs. Focarino and Mr. Smith can look back proudly at their record of \npublic service and point to meaningful accomplishments that have \nimproved the U.S. patent system. I wish them both the best in their new \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4641-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4641-S4642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 VOTING RIGHTS ADVANCEMENT ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I support the Voting Rights Advancement \nAct of 2015, an important step on the road to protecting the right to \nvote for all Americans. It responds to a recent Supreme Court ruling \nthat rolled back critical voting protections that had proven effective \nfor decades and that Congress had reauthorized several times.\n  This landmark legislation would reaffirm the importance of the vote \nas a pillar of our democracy and restore a powerful shield to combat \nvoting discrimination. I thank Senator Leahy for his leadership on this \nbill, and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of a bill that \nprotects access to the ballot box for all American citizens.\n  Mr. President, 50 years ago, President Lyndon Johnson signed into law \nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965, legislation that he called ``a triumph \nfor freedom as huge as any victory that has ever been won on any \nbattlefield.'' At the time he signed the bill into law, millions of \nAmericans were denied the right to vote based on the color of their \nskin.\n\n[[Page S4642]]\n\n  President Johnson called this ``a clear and simple wrong'' and \nacknowledged that the Voting Rights Act's ``only purpose is to right \nthat wrong.'' With the stroke of a pen, President Johnson enacted a \nbill that threw open the doors of democracy for all Americans and \npromised that the precious right to vote would be protected.\n  The United States has had a long and bumpy road to even achieving \nthat promise. In the decades before the Voting Rights Act, Blacks had \nbeen denied their right to vote and participate in the political \nprocess. They were harassed and intimidated from going to the polls. \nOrdinary Americans who marched for themselves or their fellow citizens \nto exercise the right to vote were beaten, arrested, jailed, or even \nmurdered.\n  On June 21, 1964, 51 years ago this week, three civil rights \nworkers--two white young men from New York City and one black \nMississippian--were killed in Mississippi by the Ku Klux Klan simply \nfor trying to help register African Americans to vote. Their sacrifice \ninspired countless others to fight to make our union more perfect. Even \nin my home State, in Cherry Hill, NJ, stands a monument that pays \ntribute to these three civil rights workers who died in the struggle \nfor equality.\n  Few things made African Americans feel less equal in America than \nbeing deprived of the basic right of citizenship--the right to vote. \nThey even suffered the indignity of having to count beans in a barrel, \ntake a literacy test, pay a poll tax, or recite from memory the \npreamble to the Constitution without a glitch just to cast a ballot. As \na result of disenfranchising tactics, no Black southerner served in \nCongress from 1901 to 1973. For decades, the promises of liberty and \njustice for all embedded in our national charter were simply words on \npaper.\n  But the Voting Rights Act changed America. By the end of 1966, 1 year \nafter it became law, only 4 out of the traditional 13 Southern States \nhad less than 50 percent of African Americans registered to vote. In \nMississippi alone, Black voter turnout increased from 6 percent in 1964 \nto 59 percent in 1969. Throughout the South, and indeed our entire \ncountry, Blacks and Latinos were elected into public office in \nsignificant numbers.\n  The Voting Rights Act has been the most powerful tool to defend \nminorities' voting rights. The law established new ground to curb voter \ndiscrimination by requiring Federal ``preclearance''--that is, Federal \nreview--of voting law changes in areas with histories of \ndiscrimination. And therein lies its power. There is no remedy for \ncitizens after an unfair election has occurred. Section 5 of the Voting \nRights Act was the only Federal remedy that could prevent unfair \nelections before they took place.\n  The lesson of history is clear--section 5 of the Voting Rights Act \nhas made America live up to its promises of liberty and justice by \nensuring that every citizen has an equal opportunity to participate in \nour democracy. That is why preserving the Voting Rights Act is so \nimportant. That is why Presidents Reagan, Ford, and Nixon had signed \nprior reauthorizations of the act. That is why in successive \nCongresses--both Republicans and Democrats--repeatedly reauthorized \nsection 5.\n  In 2006, Congress reauthorized the Voting Rights Act by an \noverwhelming bipartisan margin. The law was reauthorized 98 to 0 in the \nSenate and 390 to 33 in the House and President George W. Bush signed \nthe bill into law. It was a testament to the fact that men and women \nfrom across the aisle could come together to protect what is most \nimportant to our democracy, the right to vote. A right the Supreme \nCourt has called fundamental because it is preservative of all other \nrights.\n  Congress developed an expansive record during its 2006 \nreauthorization that justified the need for section 5 as a necessary \nand effective tool to protect minority voters. The House and Senate \nJudiciary Committees found ample evidence that, even after the passage \nof the Voting Rights Act of 1965, States and localities continued to \nengage in overt and subtle tactics that discriminated against minority \nvoters.\n  Two years ago, a narrowly split and deeply divided Supreme Court \ndisregarded extensive findings of Congress and gutted the Voting Rights \nAct. In a case known as Shelby County v. Holder, five Justices on the \nSupreme Court put the Voting Rights Act on life support by striking \ndown the formula by which Congress determines which States and \nlocalities are subject to preclearance.\n  That 2013 decision has nullified the ability of the Federal \nGovernment to use the preclearance requirement. Section 5 has protected \nconstitutional guarantees against discrimination in voting even when \ncivil rights laws tried for over 100 years to achieve the success of \nthe Voting Rights Act. The Court reached its decision despite Congress \nfinding an overwhelming record of contemporary voting discrimination. \nEven the Chief Justice wrote, ``voting discrimination still exists: no \none doubts that.''\n  Yet, the Shelby County decision rested on a flawed logic that the \nVoting Rights Act was a victim of its own success. Justice Ginsburg's \ndissent noted a ``catch-22'' in the majority's logic. She said:\n\n       If the statute was working, there would be less evidence of \n     discrimination, so opponents might argue that Congress should \n     not be allowed to renew the statute. In contrast, if the \n     statute was not working, there would be plenty of evidence of \n     discrimination, but scant reason to renew a failed regulatory \n     regime.\n\n  I agree with Justice Ginsburg that the Court's decision to strike \ndown section 5 ``when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop \ndiscriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a \nrainstorm because you're not getting wet.''\n  Even in the aftermath of Shelby County, States continued to enact \nlaws that make it harder for American citizens to cast their ballot. \nThe Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the Nation's foremost civil \nrights coalition, released a report last year entitled ``The Persistent \nChallenges of Voting Discrimination.'' That report documented 148 \nvoting rights violations in America since 2000. Because each voting \nrights violation often impacts thousands of voters, the report \nunderscored that the impact of racial discrimination in voting is much \nmore profound than the nearly 150 documented violations suggest.\n  New State laws erect barriers to voting, which restrict voter \nregistration drives, eliminate same-day voter registration, reduce the \nearly voting period, and require photo identification and proof of \ncitizenship to vote. So far, 32 States have passed laws requiring \nvoters to show some kind of identification at the polls, which often \nhave a disparate impact on minority and low-income voters.\n  The Voting Rights Advancement Act would help prevent voting practices \nthat are likely to be discriminatory before they cause harm. It would \ncreate a new nationwide coverage formula requiring States and \nlocalities to obtain preclearance for voting changes that have \nhistorically been found to be discriminatory. It would enhance the \nauthority of courts to order a preclearance remedy, require greater \ntransparency regarding voting changes, and clarify the Attorney \nGeneral's authority to send Federal observers to monitor elections \nacross the country.\n  In his ``I Have a Dream'' speech, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, \n``When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of \nthe Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they were signing a \npromissory note to which every American was to fall heir.'' The Voting \nRights Act has been one of our most important tools to fulfill that \npromise and protect voters against discrimination. Congress now has a \nhistoric opportunity to ensure that the critical provisions in that law \nare restored and strengthened.\n  Now is the time to recommit ourselves to the cause of justice. Now is \nthe time to safeguard our democratic values. Now is the time to protect \nthe progress so many Americans worked so hard to establish. I urge all \nSenators to support this bill that would combat voter discrimination \nand breathe life back into the Voting Rights Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4642-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4642-S4643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PASSENGER RAIL LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, the tragic Amtrak derailment last month \nshined a light on the critical need to have a strong, safe passenger \nrail system for the millions of passengers traveling on our rails. My \nheart goes out to\n\n[[Page S4643]]\n\nthe families and individuals impacted by the tragedy and I hope we \nnever see anything like it again.\n  Last week I joined my colleague, Senator Wicker in introducing the \nRailroad Reform, Enhancement, and Efficiency Act, comprehensive \npassenger rail legislation that boosts our infrastructure and \nimplements needed reforms. Most importantly, it improves safety on our \nNation's railways. This 4-year authorization is a step forward in \nproviding the stability Amtrak needs to be successful and serve the \nconsumers who rely on it.\n  Across every mode of transportation, America needs critical \ninvestment. Nowhere is the investment crisis more pronounced than in \nNew Jersey. The century-old tunnels that run under the Hudson River \nbetween New Jersey and New York are reaching a breaking point. We must \nact with urgency to find State and local partners to replace this \ncritical infrastructure. New Jersey is also home to the Portal Bridge, \nwhich is in need of replacement in order to prevent delays and closures \nthat slow our economy. It has been estimated that the loss of the \nNortheast Corridor could cost the country $100 million per day; a \ndevastating impact that we cannot afford. The costs for these projects \nare significant, which is why we must find new ways to help advance \nthem.\n  Our legislation is a game changer for large-scale rail projects. The \nbill helps unlock and leverage innovative financing opportunities by \nimproving the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing \nProgram, or RRIF. Our legislation will establish new creditworthiness \ncriteria focused on the merits of the project, increase repayment \nflexibility, help leverage private financing opportunities, and speed \nup the process of applying for and receiving a loan--all of which can \nhelp advance projects like the Gateway Project along the Northeast \nCorridor. As China and other countries invest tens of billions for rail \ninfrastructure, we must do more than maintain the status quo. Our \nbill's financing provisions enable us to take every possible advantage \nto improve our rail capacity and infrastructure.\n  Our legislation also includes strong safety provisions to protect \npassengers and workers. Positive train control, or PTC, was cited as a \ntechnology that could have prevented the tragic derailment last month \nand our legislation will advance deployment of PTC by authorizing \ngrants and prioritizing loan applications to support implementation. \nAdditionally, the legislation will improve safety by requiring action \non priorities like grade crossings and enforcing speed limits, as well \nas worker protections, among various other provisions.\n  It is important to note that a strong authorization of funding for \npassenger rail is only the start. Investing in the future of America's \nrail network will also require dedicated and multi-year streams of \nrevenue to support the funding authorized in this bill. I am committed \nto working with my colleagues on the Finance Committee to make that a \nreality.\n  The Railroad Reform, Enhancement, and Efficiency Act is important for \nour global competitiveness and a forward step in promoting investment \nin our infrastructure. I thank the committee leadership and Senator \nWicker for their support and work on this important legislation that \nwill improve the lives of New Jerseyans and individuals across the \ncountry I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4643-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    3RD ANNIVERSARY OF DACA PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I would like to commemorate the third-year \nanniversary of the creation of the Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrivals, DACA, program. On June 15, 2015, we celebrated this \nsuccessful, although not comprehensive, policy that has provided \ndeportation relief to more than 660,000 child immigrants nationally, \nincluding 14,900 in Colorado.\n  This life-changing program has allowed young people who were brought \nto the United States as children--DREAMers--to fully engage in their \ncommunities by continuing their education and having the opportunity to \nwork. They have been able to open bank accounts, obtain credit cards, \nand receive driver's licenses. Deferred action is giving these young \npeople relief and some degree of certainty to pursue opportunities that \nwould not have been available to them otherwise.\n  DACA has given DREAMers hope for their future. They include DREAMers \nlike Alex Alvarado-Renteria who has lived in Carbondale, CO for the \nlast 18 years and has known no other home outside of the United States. \nAlex's parents migrated from Mexico and worked as farmworkers in order \nto give their children an opportunity for a better life. Alex was \ngranted DACA and has since graduated from the Metropolitan State \nUniversity of Denver with a bachelor of arts in history and Chicana/o \nstudies. He now plans to become the first in his family to earn an \nadvanced degree by attending law school and opening up his own \nimmigration law practice one day.\n  We also have DREAMers like Lourdes Bustos from Denver, CO who has \nlived in the United States for the last 26 years and who was able to \nstay with her children upon receiving DACA. It was years before Lourdes \nrealized she was not documented and would not be able to work legally \nor get a driver's license. Granting her deferred action meant that she \nwould not be separated from her family. Lourdes has graduated from high \nschool and has opened her own painting business.\n  DACA has played a transformative role in increasing social and \neconomic integration for youth who have been raised and educated in our \ncountry. It has given DREAMers an opportunity to invest in their \nfutures. It has empowered DREAMers with a sense of community and \nbelonging.\n  This program has helped many of our young people, but only offers a \ntemporary solution to the unfair consequences of our broken immigration \nsystem. This anniversary should also serve as a stark reminder that \nevery day that Congress fails to enact immigration reform, it \njeopardizes our economy, our safety, and our communities. It is time to \nput politics aside and work to enact comprehensive immigration reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4643-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4643-S4644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL SAMUEL LOCKLEAR\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, after a lifetime of service to our Nation, \nADM Samuel J. Locklear III recently stepped down as Commander of United \nStates Pacific Command and retired from the U.S. Navy. On this \noccasion, I wish to honor Admiral Locklear's 43 years of distinguished \nuniformed service to our Nation.\n  Admiral Locklear graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1977. He \nhas led at every level from command-at-sea to theater command. Prior to \nassuming command of the United States Pacific Command, he commanded \nU.S. Naval Forces Europe and concurrently, U.S. Naval Forces Africa and \nNATO's Commander of the Allied Joint Force Command, where his \nleadership was instrumental in galvanizing an effective coalition of 18 \nNATO nations to support the complex Libya air campaign.\n  At Pacific Command, Admiral Locklear provided the strategic vision \nrequired to lead in a region vital to America's future peace and \nprosperity. He has presided over the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific with \nan even-keeled leadership approach that has focused our Nation in a \ntime of difficult security challenges and austere budgets. Pacific \nCommand is the oldest and largest of our geographic commands \nencompassing roughly half of the Earth's surface, extending from pole \nto pole and across the vastness of two great oceans. Admiral Locklear \nskillfully navigated the complexities and competing interests of this \nexpansive theater. He has worked to strengthen alliances, reinvigorate \nold ones, cultivate new partnerships, and maintain a robust forward \npresence to assure and defend our allies and partners.\n  Admiral Locklear's legacy of service will be as a driving force \nbehind a renewed commitment to protecting America's enduring interests \nin the Asia-Pacific region. When the Nation needed its very best in \nmilitary experience, leadership, and advice to confront the challenges \nand threats we face globally, Admiral Locklear answered the call.\n  I join many past and present members of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee in my gratitude to ADM Samuel Locklear for his outstanding\n\n[[Page S4644]]\n\nleadership and his unwavering commitment to the peace and stability of \nthe Asia-Pacific region. His impact will continue into the coming \ndecades and our Navy and our Nation will feel his absence. I wish him \nand his wife Pam ``fair winds and following seas.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4644-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT ROBERT ``STAN'' LOWE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I wish to honor and remember one \nof Wyoming's many World War II heroes, LT Robert ``Stan'' Lowe. On \nFriday, June 19, 2015, Wyoming and our Nation lost one its most revered \nveterans advocates. Stan lived to be 92 years old.\n  In 1943, Stan chose to serve his Nation rather than complete his \ncollege studies and join the U.S. Merchant Marines. The Merchant \nMarines' mission was one of the most dangerous and important missions \nduring World War II. The mission was critical to ensuring our \nservicemen had the resources they needed to ultimately defeat tyranny. \nWhile Lieutenant Lowe was keeping the sea lanes open and secure and he \nalso had more than one job. Stan was a staff officer handling payroll \nand personnel matters, ran the ship store, and carried out chaplain \nduties. He even served as a tour coordinator for port calls to keep the \nyoung mariners out of trouble. In addition to manning their battle \nstations, this was the life of a Merchant Marine.\n  When Lieutenant Lowe returned to the United States in 1946, he like \nmany of his fellow veterans returned to school. He went on to get a law \ndegree. Like your traditional Merchant Marine, Stan never wore just one \nhat. He was first a mariner and then an attorney. He served in the \nWyoming State House of Representatives and as the Carbon County \nAttorney. Throughout most of Stan's professional career he served as \ngeneral counsel to True Oil.\n  Stan was the first commissioner appointed to Wyoming Veterans \nCommission. He served under two Governors and chaired the commission. \nHe retired with the title of chairman emeritus. Stan never stopped \nserving our veterans or our community. Stan was a mentor and teacher to \nmany of Wyoming's veterans. In every veteran he came across, he \ninstilled the virtue that the oath servicemen and women take does not \nexpire when you take off the uniform. He strongly believed he had \nresponsibility to help his fellow veterans to honor and respect current \nservicemen and women and to serve his community.\n  Stan was always very involved in his community working with the \nCasper Rotary Club and the American Legion to name a few. He always \nworked behind the scenes for many causes especially for veterans. If it \nwas the veterans' museum, efforts to protect the benefits of the widows \nof veterans, WWII Honor Flights or veteran license plates, Stan \nprobably had his finger prints all over it. Stan also fought hard to \nget the Merchant Marines recognized with veteran status. He and \nMerchant Marines around the Nation finally got this much deserved \nrecognition in 1988.\n  For almost 30 years, on every Memorial Day, Stan would recite \nFlanders Field at the Oregon Trail Veterans Cemetery. It was always a \nhumbling experience. In his later years, despite the pain, Stan would \nrise from his chair like a maestro stepping up to a podium. With a \nquiet tone that could reach the back of the chapel, Stan would begin by \nreciting the poem. His voice would draw you into a moment in time \nreminding you of the silence of peace. Children and adults alike would \nhang on his every word and Stan's voice, like a lullaby, reminded us of \nsoldiers who were loved and paid the ultimate price for freedom. For \nthat moment, you felt warm and secure in their remembrance. As gently \nhe begun he would end and quietly sit. The only sound you could hear \nwas the breathing of the crowd.\n  Stan was preceded in death by his wife Anne ``Pat'' Kirtland Selden \nLowe, and is survived by his two children Robert J. Lowe and wife \nLanette and Meganne L. Acres and husband Craig, sister-in-law Ruth \nSelden Sturgill, brother-in-law George L. Selden, grandchildren Parker \nand Dalton Lowe, Hannah and Ben Acres, niece Lauren and husband Bill \nGasmick, nephew John Lefferdink and Lanette's father Jerry Kelly.\n  Stan epitomizes the service and sacrifice of our men and women in \nuniform and service to our communities. It also epitomizes the Rotary \nmotto ``Service Above Self.'' People like Stan Lowe do not come around \noften so we thank him for all he has done to make our Nation safe and \nWyoming a better State.\n  Stan, my friend, as they say in the Merchant Marines, ``fair winds \nand following seas.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4644-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 RECOGNIZING THE NASWA 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I wish to honor a long standing New \nHampshire institution, often called ``the ultimate NH Resort \nDestination.'' The NASWA Resort at Weirs Beach in Laconia, NH, also \nknown as, ``The Naz,'' is named for the natural spring water that was \nfound at the site of the original cabins.\n  This year, the NASWA will celebrate its 80th year of continuous \noperation in the Granite State. As the 6th annual NASWA Day approaches, \nit is a time to celebrate the thousands of people from New Hampshire \nand around the country who have visited this relaxing destination \noverlooking Paugus Bay on Lake Winnipesaukee.\n  Drawing guests from the Lakes Region to the White Mountains, the \nNASWA is a place for people to enjoy the beauty of the Granite State, \nfamily fun, summertime entertainment and recreation. People of all ages \ncan enjoy paddleboats, fine and casual dining, gather with friends, or \ntake a swim in the lake. Founded by Greek immigrants in 1935, the NASWA \nis still a family-run business, owned and operated by Hope Makris, who \ncontinues to live on the property, her daughters Cynthia and Karen, and \nthe rest of the family. To this day, you will find Hope in the kitchen, \nbaking all of the desserts, including Greek pastries.\n  The Makris family has made tremendous contributions to the community. \nEach year, the NASWA hosts the Peter Makris Memorial Run in honor of \nHope's late husband, which benefits the Laconia Fire Department's Life \nSaving Fund and Water Rescue Team. The Makris family is also committed \nto serving veterans. Hope's daughter Cynthia serves as the Lakes Region \nchairwoman of the Easter Seals Veterans Count program; and for the past \n14 years, the NASWA has hosted the Easter Seals Land and Lake Poker \nRun. The run further benefits the Easter Seals of New Hampshire and the \nVeterans Count program.\n  As a native Granite Stater and on behalf of the State of New \nHampshire, I congratulate the NASWA and the Makris family. After 80 \nyears, the NASWA continues to be a beloved New Hampshire destination, \nand I wish the Makris family the very best for many more decades to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4644-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4644-S4645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING RALPH J. ROBERTS\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish today to remember Ralph J. \nRoberts, a proud Pennsylvanian and a national business leader. Ralph \npassed away on June 18, 2015, at the age of 95, after a long life of \npersonal and professional success.\n  To many across our Nation, Ralph was best known as the founder of \nComcast, where he served for 46 years as the chief executive officer. \nNavigating complex technological developments in a competitive \nentertainment market, Ralph's entrepreneurial spirit helped lead \nComcast from a small, local startup in 1963 to the country's largest \ncable television company today. His professional achievements \ncomplemented his extensive philanthropic work; Ralph held positions on \nseveral charitable boards in Philadelphia, where he offered his \nbusiness acumen to support local economic and community development \nprojects.\n  One of the defining aspects of Ralph's career was undoubtedly his \nenduring partnership with his son Brian, as they built a strong \nbusiness team while maintaining their close father-son relationship. As \nthe New York Times wrote on June 19, 2015:\n\n       Mr. Roberts, typically dapper in his signature bow tie and \n     Brooks Brothers suits, became his son's mentor and sounding \n     board, and the two were admired as a potent business \n     partnership while never displaying the\n\n[[Page S4645]]\n\n     kind of strained and tempestuous relationship that can flare \n     when a son succeeds a successful father.\n       ``Since I was 12, all I wanted to do was work with my \n     dad,'' Brian Roberts said in an interview for this obituary. \n     ``I believe the reason we are still in this business when so \n     many others have long since departed was his will to succeed, \n     and to do it with certain core values and integrity. Maybe it \n     was losing both his parents before he was 21, living through \n     the Depression, but somehow he became an optimist. He was the \n     most optimistic man I ever knew. He never told me anything I \n     wanted to do at Comcast was a bad idea, and after more than \n     30 years, you'd think I've had a lot of bad ideas.''\n\n  Together, Brian and Ralph had many good ideas that brought television \nto tens of millions across America. We are all forever grateful for \nRalph Roberts' contributions to the American business world and to \ntelecommunications. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and our Nation \nbenefited from Ralph's hard work and vision. Our prayers are with his \nwife Suzanne, his children, and his grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4645-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              REMEMBERING COLONEL PAUL F. DUDLEY, RETIRED\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today we honor the life and service \nof Col. Paul F. Dudley, Retired, whose passing signifies a great loss \nto Nevada. I send my condolences and prayers to his wife Barbara and \nall of Mr. Dudley's family in this time of mourning, including his 6 \nchildren, 16 grandchildren, and 18 great-grandchildren. Mr. Dudley was \na man committed to his family, his country, his State, and his \ncommunity. He will be sorely missed.\n  Mr. Dudley was born on April 24, 1925, in Marengo, OH. After \ngraduating from high school, he enlisted in the Marines and served \nduring World War II. Following the war, Mr. Dudley attended Otterbein \nCollege and served his local community as an Ohio State Patrol trooper \nand detective. He later served in the Ohio Air National Guard, \nfollowing graduating first in his class from the Air Force in Colorado \nas a nuclear weapons maintenance officer and returning to active duty. \nThroughout his service with the Ohio Air National Guard, he commanded \nthe NATO Special Ammunition Storage Site in Ghedi, Italy. In 1975, he \nmoved his family to Las Vegas and served at Nellis Air Force Base to \ncommand the Aviation Depot Squadron. Mr. Dudley's service to this \ncountry has been invaluable.\n  From serving in World War II, to his Air Force assignments as a \nnuclear safety officer in Italy, to his duty as an inspector general at \nthe Tan Son Nhut Air Base in South Vietnam, his bravery was without \nlimit. Mr. Dudley received two Distinguished Flying Cross medals for \nhis extraordinary actions as a Marine radioman-gunner during World War \nII and also flew in 43 combat missions throughout the Pacific campaign.\n  As a World War II veteran, Mr. Dudley's commitment to his country, as \nwell as his dedication to his family and community, exemplified why the \nlegacy of all World War II veterans must be preserved for generations \nto come. These veterans truly are the ``greatest generation''--\nselflessly serving not for recognition, but because it was the right \nthing to do. As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I \nrecognize that Congress has a responsibility not only to honor these \nbrave individuals, but to ensure they are cared for when they return \nhome. I remain committed to upholding this promise for our veterans and \nservicemembers in Nevada and throughout the Nation.\n  I extend my deepest sympathies to Barbara and all of Mr. Dudley's \nfamily. We will always remember Mr. Dudley for his courageous \ncontributions to the United States of America. His service to his \ncountry and dedication to his family and community earn him a place \namong the outstanding men and women who have valiantly defended our \nNation.\n  Throughout his life, Mr. Dudley maintained a dedication to keeping \nthis great Nation safe, which I am honored to commend. His patriotism \nand drive will never be forgotten. Today, I join the Las Vegas \ncommunity and citizens of the Silver State to celebrate the life of an \nupstanding Nevadan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4645-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRATULATING FOOTHILL HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today, I wish to congratulate \nFoothill High School on its team of students selected as the Southwest \nregional winner and third place overall in the sixth annual Vans Custom \nCulture shoe designing contest. The contest was highly competitive with \n2,529 schools registered to participate. Five students, including April \nSiglos, Cayleigh Miner, Catherine Swift, Shelby Baker, and Aimee Perry, \nwere chosen to represent the high school at the award ceremony in New \nYork. Students Daniel Di'Antonio and Elizabeth Marshall were also \nimportant contributors to the team, participating in the design \nprocess. Competitors were required to design pairs of shoes for four \ncategories including art, music, action sports, and local flavor. The \nteam won a total of $4,000 for its achievement in being selected in the \ntop five competitors, a contribution that will help future Foothill \nstudents for years to come.\n  The contest has been utilized by Foothill High School art teacher \nSarah Plough as a classroom assignment in recent years, giving students \nthe opportunity to harness their creative side and apply their art \nskills to a three-dimensional object. Students in Ms. Plough's class \nwere also assigned to participate in local contests, bringing their \nartwork outside of Foothill High School's walls and into the local \ncommunity. Ms. Plough's drive to bring opportunity to her students is \nappreciated by the entire Foothill High School and Las Vegas \ncommunities.\n  The students are shining examples to their fellow Foothill Falcons, \nfocusing a great amount of time and effort to create phenomenal artwork \nfor the competition. They spent 5 weeks working on their designs and \neven devoted hours over spring break to their projects. They should be \nproud of their hard work and their great accomplishment.\n  I am excited to see local students bringing recognition to both \nNevada and to Foothill High School for their advancement in a national \ncompetition. Their accolade is well deserved. Today, I ask my \ncolleagues to join me and all Nevadans in congratulating Foothill High \nSchool for its success and its honorable representation of \nNevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4645-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO RAEGAN ARNOLDY\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nrestrict the insurance business exception to passive foreign investment \ncompany rules; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Offshore \nReinsurance Tax Fairness Act. This bill closes a tax loophole that is \nbeing used by some U.S.-based hedge funds that set up insurance \ncompanies in places like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands where they \naren't taxed and where their earnings are sheltered from U.S. taxes. \nOffshore businesses that reinsure risks and that invest in U.S. hedge \nfunds create the potential for tax avoidance of hundreds of millions of \ndollars.\n  Under these arrangements, a hedge fund or hedge fund investors make a \ncapital investment in an offshore reinsurance company. The offshore \nreinsurance company then reinvests that capital, as well as premiums it \nreceives, in the hedge fund. The owners of the reinsurer take the \nposition that they are not taxed on corporate earnings until either \nthose earnings are distributed, or the investors sell the corporation's \nstock at a gain reflecting those earnings.\n  However, the hedge fund ``reinsurers'' are taking advantage of an \nexception to the passive foreign investment company--or PFIC--rules of \nU.S. tax law. The PFIC rules are designed to prevent U.S. taxpayers \nfrom delaying U.S. tax on investment income by holding investments \nthrough offshore corporations. However, the PFIC rules provide an \nexception for income derived from the active conduct of an insurance \nbusiness. The exception applies to income derived from the active \nconduct of an insurance business by a corporation which is \npredominantly engaged in an insurance business and which would be \nsubject to tax under Subchapter L if it were a domestic corporation.\n  Current law does not prescribe how much insurance or reinsurance \nbusiness the company must do to be considered predominantly engaged in \nan insurance business. Our investigative efforts show that some \ncompanies that are not legitimate insurance companies are taking \nadvantage of this favorable tax treatment.\n  About a year ago I asked the Treasury Department and IRS to issue \nguidance to shut down this abuse. And in April, Treasury and IRS issued \nregulations that take a first step at addressing this issue. However, \nwhile the guidance offers clarity in this area, a legislative fix is \nrequired to fully close this loophole.\n  Therefore, today I am introducing the Offshore Reinsurance Tax \nFairness Act to shut down this abuse once and for all. My bill would \nprovide a bright-line test for determining whether a company is truly \nan insurance company for purposes of the exception to the PFIC rules.\n  Under the new rule, to be considered an insurance company, the \ncompany's insurance liabilities must exceed 25 percent of its assets. \nIf the company fails to qualify because it has 25 percent or less--but \nnot less than 10 percent--in insurance liability assets, the company \nmay still be predominantly engaged in the insurance business based on \nfacts and circumstances. A company with less than 10 percent of \ninsurance liability assets will not be considered an insurance company \nand, therefore, would be ineligible for the PFIC exception and subject \nto current taxation.\n  The Offshore Reinsurance Tax Fairness Act will disqualify most of the \nhedge fund reinsurance companies that are taking advantage of the \ncurrent law loophole, making them ineligible for the PFIC exception and \nstopping this abuse. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nenact this important reform.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na technical explanation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1687\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

RESTRICTION ON INSURANCE BUSINESS EXCEPTION TO \n                   PASSIVE FOREIGN INVESTMENT COMPANY RULES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1297(b)(2)(B) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(B) derived in the active conduct of an insurance \n     business by a qualifying insurance corporation (as defined in \n     subsection (f)),''.\n       (b) Qualifying Insurance Corporation Defined.--Section 1297 \n     of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at \n     the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(f) Qualifying Insurance Corporation.--For purposes of \n     subsection (b)(2)(B)--\n       ``(1) In general.--The term `qualifying insurance \n     corporation' means, with respect to any taxable year, a \n     foreign corporation--\n       ``(A) which would be subject to tax under subchapter L if \n     such corporation were a domestic corporation, and\n       ``(B) the applicable insurance liabilities of which \n     constitute more than 25 percent of its total assets, \n     determined on the basis of such liabilities and assets as \n     reported on the corporation's applicable financial statement \n     for the last year ending with or within the taxable year.\n       ``(2) Alternative facts and circumstances test for certain \n     corporations.--If a corporation fails to qualify as a \n     qualified insurance corporation under paragraph (1) solely \n     because the percentage determined under paragraph (1)(B) is \n     25 percent or less, a United States person that owns stock in \n     such corporation may elect to treat such stock as stock of a \n     qualifying insurance corporation if--\n       ``(A) the percentage so determined for the corporation is \n     at least 10 percent, and\n       ``(B) under regulations provided by the Secretary, based on \n     the applicable facts and circumstances--\n       ``(i) the corporation is predominantly engaged in an \n     insurance business, and\n       ``(ii) such failure is due solely to temporary \n     circumstances involving such insurance business.\n       ``(3) Applicable insurance liabilities.--For purposes of \n     this subsection--\n       ``(A) In general.--The term `applicable insurance \n     liabilities' means, with respect to any life or property and \n     casualty insurance business--\n       ``(i) loss and loss adjustment expenses, and\n       ``(ii) reserves (other than deficiency, contingency, or \n     unearned premium reserves) for life and health insurance \n     risks and life and health insurance claims with respect to \n     contracts providing coverage for mortality or morbidity \n     risks.\n       ``(B) Limitations on amount of liabilities.--Any amount \n     determined under clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A) shall \n     not exceed the lesser of such amount--\n       ``(i) as reported to the applicable insurance regulatory \n     body in the applicable financial statement described in \n     paragraph (4)(A) (or, if less, the amount required by \n     applicable law or regulation), or\n\n[[Page S4651]]\n\n       ``(ii) as determined under regulations prescribed by the \n     Secretary.\n       ``(4) Other definitions and rules.--For purposes of this \n     subsection--\n       ``(A) Applicable financial statement.--The term `applicable \n     financial statement' means a statement for financial \n     reporting purposes which--\n       ``(i) is made on the basis of generally accepted accounting \n     principles,\n       ``(ii) is made on the basis of international financial \n     reporting standards, but only if there is no statement that \n     meets the requirement of clause (i), or\n       ``(iii) except as otherwise provided by the Secretary in \n     regulations, is the annual statement which is required to be \n     filed with the applicable insurance regulatory body, but only \n     if there is no statement which meets the requirements of \n     clause (i) or (ii).\n       ``(B) Applicable insurance regulatory body.--The term \n     `applicable insurance regulatory body' means, with respect to \n     any insurance business, the entity established by law to \n     license, authorize, or regulate such business and to which \n     the statement described in subparagraph (A) is provided.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2015.\n\n  Technical Explanation of the Offshore Reinsurance Tax Fairness Act \n              Introduced by Senator Wyden on June 25, 2015\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     Passive foreign investment companies\n       A U.S. person who is a shareholder of a passive foreign \n     investment company (``PFIC'') is subject to U.S. tax in \n     respect to that person's share of the PFIC's income under one \n     of three alternative anti-deferral regimes. A PFIC generally \n     is defined as any foreign corporation if 75 percent or more \n     of its gross income for the taxable year consists of passive \n     income, or 50 percent or more of its assets consists of \n     assets that produce, or are held for the production of, \n     passive income. Alternative sets of income inclusion rules \n     apply to U.S. persons that are shareholders in a PFIC, \n     regardless of their percentage ownership in the company. One \n     set of rules applies to passive foreign investment companies \n     that are ``qualified electing funds,'' under which electing \n     U.S. shareholders currently include in gross income their \n     respective shares of the company's earnings, with a separate \n     election to defer payment of tax, subject to an interest \n     charge, on income not currently received. A second set of \n     rules applies to passive foreign investment companies that \n     are not qualified electing funds, under which U.S. \n     shareholders pay tax on certain income or gain realized \n     through the company, plus an interest charge that is \n     attributable to the value of deferral. A third set of rules \n     applies to PFIC stock that is marketable, under which \n     electing U.S. shareholders currently take into account as \n     income (or loss) the difference between the fair market value \n     of the stock as of the close of the taxable year and their \n     adjusted basis in such stock (subject to certain \n     limitations), often referred to as ``marking to market.''\n     Passive income\n       Passive income means any income which is of a kind that \n     would be foreign personal holding company income, including \n     dividends, interest, royalties, rents, and certain gains on \n     the sale or exchange of property, commodities, or foreign \n     currency.\n       However, among other exceptions, passive income does not \n     include any income derived in the active conduct of an \n     insurance business by a corporation that is predominantly \n     engaged in an insurance business and that would be subject to \n     tax under subchapter L if it were a domestic corporation.\n       In Notice 2003-34, the Internal Revenue Service identified \n     issues in applying the insurance exception under the PFIC \n     rules. One issue involves whether risks assumed under \n     contracts issued by a foreign company organized as an insurer \n     are truly insurance risks, and whether the risks are limited \n     under the terms of the contracts. In the Notice, the Service \n     also analyzed the status of the company as an insurance \n     company. The Service looked to Treasury Regulations issued in \n     1960 and last amended in 1972, as well as to the statutory \n     definition of an insurance company and to the case law. The \n     question to resolve in determining a company's status as an \n     insurance company is whether ``the character of all of the \n     business actually done by [the company] . . . indicate[s] \n     whether [the company] uses its capital and efforts primarily \n     in investing rather than primarily in the insurance \n     business.'' The Notice concluded that ``[t]he Service will \n     scrutinize these arrangements and will apply the PFIC rules \n     where it determines that [a company] is not an insurance \n     company for federal tax purposes.''\n       Proposed regulations on the insurance exception under the \n     PFIC rules published on April 24, 2015, provide that ``the \n     term insurance business means the business of issuing \n     insurance and annuity contracts and the reinsuring of risks \n     underwritten by insurance companies, together with those \n     investment activities and administrative services that are \n     required to support or are substantially related to insurance \n     and annuity contracts issued or reinsured by the foreign \n     corporation.'' The proposed regulations provide that an \n     investment activity is an activity producing foreign personal \n     holding company income, and that is ``required to support or \n     [is] substantially related to insurance and annuity contracts \n     issued or reinsured by the foreign corporation to the extent \n     that income from the activities is earned from assets held by \n     the foreign corporation to meet obligations under the \n     contracts.''\n       The preamble to the proposed regulations specifically \n     requests comments on the proposed regulations ``with regard \n     to how to determine the portion of a foreign insurance \n     company's assets that are held to meet obligations under \n     insurance contracts issued or reinsured by the company,'' for \n     example, if the assets ``do not exceed a specified percentage \n     of the corporation's total insurance liabilities for the \n     year.''\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       The establishment of offshore businesses that reinsure \n     risks and that invest in U.S. hedge funds has been \n     characterized as creating the potential for tax avoidance. In \n     these arrangements, a hedge fund or hedge fund investors make \n     a capital investment in an offshore reinsurance company. The \n     offshore reinsurance company then reinvests that capital (as \n     well as premiums it receives) as reserves in the hedge fund. \n     Because the capital may be held largely or completely in one \n     investment (the hedge fund), an insurance regulator may \n     require a higher level of reserves to compensate for the lack \n     of diversification. This can magnify the effect of holding a \n     high level of reserves relative to a low level of insurance \n     liabilities.\n       The owners of the offshore reinsurance company take the \n     position that the reinsurance company is not a PFIC, and that \n     investors in it are not taxed on its earnings until those \n     earnings are distributed or the investors sell the \n     reinsurance company stock at a gain reflecting those \n     earnings. U.S. PFIC rules designed to prevent tax deferral \n     through offshore corporations provide an exception for income \n     derived in the active conduct of an insurance business. What \n     it takes to qualify under this exception as an insurance \n     business, including how much insurance or reinsurance \n     business the company must do to qualify under the exception, \n     may not be completely clear.\n       The hedge fund reinsurance arrangement is said to provide \n     indefinite deferral of U.S. taxation of the hedge fund's \n     investment earnings, such as interest and dividends. At the \n     time the taxpayer chooses to liquidate the investment, \n     ordinary investment earnings are said to be converted to \n     capital gains, which are subject to a lower rate of tax. The \n     use of offshore reinsurance companies allows large-scale \n     investments that are said to be consistent with capital and \n     reserve requirements applicable to the insurance and \n     reinsurance business.\n       Media attention to hedge fund reinsurance has described the \n     practice as dating from an arrangement set up in 1999. In \n     recent years, the practice has grown, giving rise to a \n     serious income mismeasurement problem. The ``Offshore \n     Reinsurance Tax Fairness Act'' seeks to prevent this income \n     mismeasurement by modifying the definition of an insurance \n     company for purposes of the PFIC rules. The ``Offshore \n     Reinsurance Tax Fairness Act'' provides that objective \n     measures of a firm's real insurance risks compared to its \n     assets are used to determine whether a firm is an insurance \n     company, or is a disguise cloaking untaxed offshore income.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n     Applicable insurance liabilities as a percentage of total \n         assets\n       Under the provision, passive income for purposes of the \n     PFIC rules does not include income derived in the active \n     conduct of an insurance business by a corporation (1) that \n     would be subject to tax under subchapter L if it were a \n     domestic corporation; and (2) the applicable insurance \n     liabilities of which constitute more than 25 percent of its \n     total assets as reported on the company's applicable \n     financial statement for the last year ending with or within \n     the taxable year.\n       For the purpose of the provision's exception from passive \n     income, applicable insurance liabilities means, with respect \n     to any property and casualty or life insurance business (1) \n     loss and loss adjustment expenses, (2) reserves (other than \n     deficiency, contingency, or unearned premium reserves) for \n     life and health insurance risks and life and health insurance \n     claims with respect to contracts providing coverage for \n     mortality or morbidity risks. This includes loss reserves for \n     property and casualty, life, and health insurance contracts \n     and annuity contracts. Unearned premium reserves with respect \n     to any type of risk are not treated as applicable insurance \n     liabilities for purposes of the provision. For purposes of \n     the provision, the amount of any applicable insurance \n     liability may not exceed the lesser of such amount (1) as \n     reported to the applicable insurance regulatory body in the \n     applicable financial statement (or, if less, the amount \n     required by applicable law or regulation), or (2) as \n     determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.\n       An applicable financial statement is a statement for \n     financial reporting purposes that (1) is made on the basis of \n     generally accepted accounting principles, (2) is made on the \n     basis of international financial reporting standards, but \n     only if there is no statement made on the basis of generally \n     accepted accounting principles, or (3) except as otherwise \n     provided by the Secretary in regulations, is the annual \n     statement required to be filed with the applicable insurance \n     regulatory body, but only if there is no statement made on \n     either of the foregoing bases. Unless otherwise provided in \n     regulations, it is intended that generally accepted \n     accounting principles means U.S. GAAP.\n\n[[Page S4652]]\n\n       The applicable insurance regulatory body means, with \n     respect to any insurance business, the entity established by \n     law to license, authorize, or regulate such insurance \n     business and to which the applicable financial statement is \n     provided. For example, in the United States, the applicable \n     insurance regulatory body is the State insurance regulator to \n     which the corporation provides its annual statement.\n     Election to apply alternative test in certain circumstances\n       If a corporation fails to qualify solely because its \n     applicable insurance liabilities constitute 25 percent or \n     less of its total assets, a United States person who owns \n     stock of the corporation may elect in such manner as the \n     Secretary prescribes to treat the stock as stock of a \n     qualifying insurance corporation if (1) the corporation's \n     applicable insurance liabilities constitute at least 10 \n     percent of its total assets, and (2) based on the applicable \n     facts and circumstances, the corporation is predominantly \n     engaged in an insurance business, and its failure to qualify \n     under the 25 percent threshold is due solely to temporary \n     circumstances involving such insurance business.\n       Whether the corporation's applicable insurance liabilities \n     constitute at least 10 percent of its total assets is \n     determined in the same manner as whether the corporation's \n     applicable insurance liabilities constitute more than 25 \n     percent of its total assets.\n       In determining whether the corporation is predominantly \n     engaged in an insurance business, relevant facts and \n     circumstances under this election include: the number of \n     insurance contracts issued or taken on through reinsurance by \n     the firm; the amount of insurance liabilities (determined as \n     above) with respect to such contracts; the total assets of \n     the firm (determined as above); information with respect to \n     claims payment patterns for the current and prior years; the \n     nature of risks underwritten and the data available on \n     likelihood of the risk occurring (extremely low-risk but \n     extremely high cost risks are less indicative of being \n     engaged in an insurance business); the firm's loss exposure \n     as calculated for a regulator such as the SEC or for a rating \n     agency, or if those are not calculated, for internal pricing \n     purposes; the percentage of gross receipts constituting \n     premiums for the current and prior years; whether the firm \n     makes substantial expenditures during the taxable year with \n     respect to marketing or soliciting new insurance or \n     reinsurance business; and such other facts or circumstances \n     as the Secretary may prescribe.\n       Facts and circumstances that tend to show the firm may not \n     be predominantly engaged in an insurance business include a \n     small number of insured risks with low likelihood but large \n     potential costs; workers focused to a greater degree on \n     investment activities than underwriting activities; and low \n     loss exposure. The fact that a firm has been holding itself \n     out as an insurer for a long period is not determinative \n     either way.\n       Temporary circumstances include the fact that the company \n     is in runoff, that is, it is not taking on new insurance \n     business (and consequently has little or no premium income), \n     and is using its remaining assets to pay off claims with \n     respect to pre-existing insurance risks on its books. \n     Temporary circumstances may also include specific \n     requirements with respect to capital and surplus relating to \n     insurance liabilities imposed by a rating agency as a \n     condition of obtaining a rating necessary to write new \n     insurance business for the current year.\n       Temporary circumstances do not refer to starting up an \n     insurance business; the present-law PFIC rules include a \n     special start-up year rule under which a foreign corporation \n     that would be a PFIC under the income or assets test will not \n     be considered a PFIC in the first year in which it has gross \n     income if, among other requirements, the corporation is not a \n     PFIC in either of the two following years. This start-up year \n     exception to status as a PFIC applies broadly to all foreign \n     corporations including those in the insurance business.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision applies to taxable years beginning after \n     December 31, 2015.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Ms. Heitkamp):\n  S. 1697. A bill to provide an exception from certain group health \nplan requirements to allow small businesses to use pre-tax dollars to \nassist employees in the purchase of policies in the individual health \ninsurance market, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, over the past year and half or more, \nmany small business owners have discovered they could be subject to \npunitive penalties simply for helping their employees purchase health \ninsurance. This is the result of a little understood provision in the \nAffordable Care Act, ACA.\n  Farmers, ranchers, and small business owners frequently do not have \nthe resources to offer a traditional group health plan to their \nemployees. However, many still want to help their employees obtain \nhealth coverage. They have frequently done this by reimbursing their \nemployees on a pre-tax basis for the cost of health insurance the \nemployee purchases on the individual market.\n  However, as a result of so-called market reforms in the ACA, small \nbusiness owners who want to help their employees purchase insurance on \nthe individual market could be subject to a $100 a day per employee \npenalty.\n  This fails to meet the common sense test. These businesses have no \nobligation under the ACA to offer any form of insurance. However, they \nwould like to do what they can to help their employees obtain coverage. \nThis is a practice that should be commended, not penalized.\n  I have had a number of farmers, small business owners, and \naccountants reach out to me over the past year explaining how this \npenalty has the potential to be devastating. Just as examples, I want \nto read excerpts from a couple emails I have received from Iowans.\n  The first is from a constituent who is a dentist in Sioux City, IA:\n\n       Help! . . . I am a small business owner--7 employees. I \n     have been helping to subsidize my employee's health insurance \n     for 20 years. I just found out that the Market Reforms of the \n     ACA have made that illegal. . . . Now all of my employees \n     will have to pay taxes on the money I gave them for Health \n     Insurance. They all live paycheck to paycheck and won't be \n     able to come up with the taxes on this money. They also most \n     likely won't qualify for the exchanges and any government \n     subsidy. They are caught in the middle. I can't subsidize \n     their Health Insurance because I risk a $100/day/employee \n     penalty . . . Please hurry and do something to help the \n     millions of middle class small business employees who are \n     caught between a rock and a hard place.\n\n  This next one is from an accountant in Zwingle, IA:\n\n       I recently completed two classes for CPE credit for my CPA \n     license. These classes covered the Affordable Care Act and \n     the presenters were adamant that we contact our senators and \n     representatives on behalf of small businesses. I do have a \n     client that this affects that could potentially be put out of \n     business.\n       Businesses that have section 105 plans or that provide \n     additional salary to employees for the employees to purchase \n     health insurance privately or through the government \n     marketplace can be fined $100 per day per employee. That is \n     $36,500 per employee per year!\n       I'm trying to help my client to figure out how to stop the \n     payments to the employees and not be destroyed by the \n     potential fines. This could be absolutely devastating.\n\n  No doubt, there are countless other small business owners who have \nsimilarly been caught off guard. In fact, due to widespread confusion, \nthe IRS granted penalty relief earlier this year. However, this penalty \nrelief runs out at the end of this month. Legislation is necessary to \neliminate this unfair and potentially devastating penalty once and for \nall.\n  Toward this end, I have been working with Senator Heitkamp, along \nwith Representatives Charles Boustany and Mike Thompson in the House, \non bipartisan, bicameral legislation. Today, we are pleased to \nintroduce this legislation.\n  This common sense legislation will permit small businesses to \ncontinue offering a benefit to their employees that many have provided \nfor years--namely reimbursing their employees for the cost of health \ninsurance purchased on the individual market.\n  According to the National Federation of Independent Business, around \n18 percent of small businesses last year reimbursed employees or \nprovided other financial support to workers who bought individual \ninsurance plans. Many others responded that they would be interested in \nsuch an option. Our legislation ensures this option is, and continues \nto be, available by eliminating the potential for devastating \npenalties.\n  This legislation should be a no brainer for anyone who supports small \nbusiness. I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \njoin in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TILLIS (for himself, Mr. Carper, Mr. Burr, Mr. Kaine, and \n        Mr. Warner):\n  S. 1698. A bill to exclude payments from State eugenics compensation \nprograms from consideration in determining eligibility for, or the \namount of, Federal public benefits; read the first time.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I am introducing the Treatment of Certain \nPayments in Eugenics Compensation Act, which would exclude payments\n\n[[Page S4653]]\n\nfrom State eugenics compensation programs from consideration in \ndetermining eligibility for, or the amount of, Federal public benefits. \nMy colleagues, Senator Richard Burr, Senator Tom Carper, Senator Tim \nKaine, and Senator Mark Warner have agreed to cosponsor the bill. In \naddition, Congressman Patrick McHenry will introduce a companion bill \nin the House of Representatives.\n  A dark chapter in American history, eugenics and compulsory \nsterilization laws were implemented in the first decades of the 20th \ncentury by more than 30 States, leading to the forced sterilization of \nmore than 60,000 disabled citizens. Only California and Virginia \nsterilized more citizens than North Carolina under these laws, though \nNorth Carolina was considered as having the most aggressive State-run \nprogram.\n  In 2013, North Carolina became the first State in the country to \nenact legislation to compensate living victims of these forced-\nsterilization laws. Most of the victims of the State-run eugenics \nprogram were poor and disadvantaged individuals and many remain so to \nthis day. Therefore, concerns have been raised in both States that the \ncompensation provided to the victims could unintentionally render them \nineligible under Federal law to continue receiving Federal benefits \nthat are subject to income thresholds. The bill introduced today would \nspecifically exclude all payments from any State eugenics compensation \nprogram from being used in determining eligibility for, or the amount \nof, any public benefits from the Federal government.\n  The implementation of State-run eugenics and sterilization programs \nrepresent a dark and shameful chapter in our Nation's history. While \nNorth Carolina and Virginia have recently created State compensation \nprograms to help victims recover from horrible wrongs that have been \nperpetrated against them in the past, Federal laws can unintentionally \npunish victims who receive eugenics compensation by preventing them \nfrom receiving Federal benefits. This bipartisan legislation will \nensure that will not happen.\n  I wish to offer a special, much deserved thank you to my friend and \nformer colleague, North Carolina State representative Larry Womble, who \nhas provided extraordinary leadership in the decades-long fight for \njustice for the living victims of North Carolina's eugenics program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Merkley):\n  S. 1699. A bill to designate certain land administered by the Bureau \nof Land Management and the Forest Service in the State of Oregon as \nwilderness and national recreation areas and to make additional wild \nand scenic river designations in the State of Oregon, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Oregon Wildlands \nAct to designate hundreds of miles of Oregon Rivers as Wild and Scenic, \nto protect thousands of acres of beautiful Oregon lands as National \nRecreation Areas, and to expand Wilderness for some of Oregon's most \ntreasured areas.\n  Oregon is a unique State and Oregonians take pride in the many \nnatural treasures throughout our diverse landscape. From the Oregon \nCoast to the high desert of Eastern Oregon, our State boasts some of \nthe most beautiful scenery, varied ecosystems, and unmatched outdoor \nrecreation opportunities in the nation. Protecting these lands and \nrivers ensures that they will be treasured for generations to come. \nOregon's rivers and landscapes are also home to threatened and \nendangered species, old-growth trees, and delicate ecosystems that \ndeserve the highest protections.\n  Enjoying the outdoors is in Oregonians' DNA--across the State, \nopportunities to get outside and enjoy Oregon's treasures bring in \nvisitors from all over the world and make residents proud to call \nOregon home. Protecting the lands and waters that support recreation is \nalso an investment in our rural economies. In Oregon alone, the tourism \nindustry employed more than 100,000 Oregonians during 2014 and \ngenerated $10.3 billion for the State's economy. Nationwide, outdoor \nrecreation supports a $646 billion industry. Ensuring that visitors \nhave pristine rivers to fish and float on, wilderness areas to hike in, \nand recreation areas to explore is a guaranteed way to make certain \nthat visitors will return year after year.\n  All told, the bill designates approximately 118,000 acres of \nRecreation Areas, approximately 250 miles of Wild and Scenic Rivers, \nand over 86,600 acres of Wilderness. Each area offers significant \nopportunities for recreation and ecosystem protections.\n  The protections in this bill highlight some of Oregon's most \nenvironmentally significant areas, such as Devil's Staircase near the \nOregon Coast. Devil's Staircase is the epitome of Wilderness in \nOregon--it is rugged, pristine, and remote, with hikers following elk \nand deer trails to navigate the rugged terrain. My bill would protect \napproximately 30,540 acres as wilderness and 14.6 miles of Wasson Creek \nand Franklin Creek, which run through the Devil's Staircase area as \nWild and Scenic Rivers. Devil's Staircase is home to the most \nremarkable old-growth forest on Oregon's Coast Range, where giant \nDouglas-fir, cedar, and hemlock support threatened and endangered \nspecies habitat, such as marbled murrelets and Northern Spotted Owls.\n  My proposal would expand the Wild Rogue Wilderness by approximately \n56,100 acres and include an additional 125 miles to the incomparable \nWild and Scenic Rogue River. The Rogue is world-renowned as a premier \nrecreation destination for rafting and fishing, with its free flowing \nwaters starting at Oregon's Crater Lake National Park and emptying into \nthe Pacific Ocean. Along the way, the Rogue River flows through a \ndiverse landscape and its cold waters are the perfect habitat for \nsalmon--the river is home to runs of Coho, spring and fall Chinook, and \nwinter and summer Steelhead. By protecting the Rogue River and its \ntributaries we are protecting the fish and wildlife that depend on \nclean, healthy water. Additionally, the Wilderness expansion would \nprotect the habitat for bald eagles, osprey, spotted owls, bear, elk, \nand cougars.\n  In addition, my proposal designates approximately 35.2 miles of the \nElk River and 21.3 miles of the Molalla River as a new recreational, \nscenic, and wild rivers, and withdraws 19 miles of the Chetco River, \none of the most endangered rivers in the country, from mineral \ndevelopment. By protecting hundreds of miles of Wild and Scenic Rivers, \nas well as the lands that surround those rivers, my proposal ensures \nthat important wildlife habitat can thrive, that Oregon's treasured \nrecreation destinations remain scenic and pristine, and that Oregonians \ncontinue to have clean sources of drinking water.\n  I am pleased to be joined on this bill by my colleague from Oregon \nSenator Jeff Merkley who has worked closely with me over the years to \nprotect Oregon's natural treasures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4653-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4653-S4654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 214--COMMEMORATING THE 85TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n DAUGHTERS OF PENELOPE, A PREEMINENT INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S ASSOCIATION \n  AND AN AFFILIATE ORGANIZATION OF THE AMERICAN HELLENIC EDUCATIONAL \n                        PROGRESSIVE ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution on \nImmigrant Heritage Month, which is recognized every June. This \nresolution honors the accomplishments and contributions of immigrants, \npledges to celebrate our immigrant heritage, and joins the American \npeople in commemorating our immigrant roots.\n  Since our founding, the United States has been a nation of \nimmigrants. Immigrants from all over the world have sought to start \nanew in the United States. Whether they were seeking to practice their \nreligious and political beliefs without interference or obtain new \nprofessional or educational opportunities, the United States has been a \nrefuge for those seeking a better life.\n  We have benefited tremendously as a result. Immigrants have played a \nvital role in our Nation's history, shaping the economic, cultural, and \nsocial development of our society. Immigrants have helped build our \nnation's cities and railroads, developed some of our most cutting-edge \nbusinesses, and fueled inventions from the telegraph to the smartphone.\n  Individuals and families from Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and \nthe Americas have all contributed to our Nation's fabric, enhancing the \ndiversity and vibrancy of our communities and forming the melting pot \nfor which our country is known.\n  In addition, immigrants have defended our Nation since the \nRevolutionary War. As of this month, over 30,000 lawful permanent \nresidents are currently serving in the United States Armed Forces. I \nimagine many more immigrants would join as well if they were afforded \nthe opportunity. Between 2002 and 2015, more than 102,000 immigrants \nhave become U.S. citizens while serving in the U.S. Military in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, Germany, Japan, and elsewhere.\n  Our Nation's food supply also depends upon the work of immigrants. \nOver 70 percent of agricultural workers in the U.S. are foreign born. \nThese workers help feed American families and support U.S. farms and \nbusinesses. Without their help, we would struggle to harvest our \nNation's crops and feed our people.\n  Immigrants also have made impressive contributions in business and \ntechnology. Immigrants or children-of-immigrants have started more than \n25 percent of all new businesses in the U.S., including more than 40 \npercent of Fortune 500 companies. These businesses have created tens of \nmillions of American jobs, and they exceed over $4.5 trillion in \nrevenue annually. In Silicon Valley, over 44 percent of technology \nstartups had at least one immigrant founder between 2006 and 2012.\n  One of our country's greatest exports, our culture, has been enhanced \nby immigrants from all corners of the globe. From Broadway to \nHollywood, our country's unique contributions in the performing arts, \nart, music, literature, media, fashion, and cuisine have been shaped by \nimmigrants.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in observing Immigrant Heritage Month \nto recognize the contributions of immigrants to the United States, as \nwell as our nation's strong immigrant heritage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/25/senate-section/article/S4655-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2077.
