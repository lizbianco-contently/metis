Madam President, the terrorist attack in Orlando \ncontinues to horrify our country. The FBI and our intelligence \ncommunity will determine whether that terrorist was in direct contact \nwith ISIL or inspired by ISIL. Either way, this much we know already: \nISIL is a disgusting group who crucifies children, enslaves women, and \nthrows gay men to their deaths from rooftops. They are determined to \ncontinue exporting their signature brand of inhumanity to our country.\n  The principal way we can prevent ISIL-inspired or directed attacks is \nto defeat ISIL. The President has led a campaign intended to contain \nISIL which has been insufficient to prevent the attacks in Paris or \nBrussels or inspired attacks, such as in San Bernardino.\n  We need to do what we can to fight back now to prevent more \nheartbreak like we saw this weekend. That means, for instance, better \npreparing this administration and the next one, regardless of party, to \ndeal with threats like ISIL, and we can do so by passing the National \nDefense Authorization Act before us. It will provide our men and women \nin uniform with more of the tools they need to take on these threats. \nIt will strengthen our military posture. In short, it will enhance our \nability to take on the challenges currently facing us and better \nprepare us for those we will face in the future, all while supporting \nour soldiers with better benefits, improved health care, and the pay \nraises they have earned.\n  I thank the Senators from both sides who worked diligently to move \nthis bill forward. My gratitude extends most deeply to the chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee. Senator McCain has been unwavering in his \nsupport for our men and women in uniform. He also understands man's \ncapacity for inhumanity to man better than most of us, and that is why \nhe is so dedicated to taking on these threats. He knows that passage of \nthis bill will present a serious and necessary step toward a safer \ncountry that we all want because, look, we are a nation at war. We are \na nation under attack. We need to continue taking action to protect our \ncountry.\n  This bill will send a strong signal to the men and women in uniform, \nit will send a strong signal to our allies, and it will send a strong \nsignal to our adversaries. We need to pass it, and we need to pass it \ntoday.\n  We will have other opportunities this week to keep our country safe \nand to take on terrorism. We need to defeat, not contain, ISIL, and we \nneed the tools necessary to take down terrorists inspired by its brutal \nideology.\n  The appropriations bill we are about to consider offers important \nopportunities to continue this debate. We need to be able to better \naddress the threat of lone wolf terrorists. We need to be able to \nconnect the dots of terrorist communications in order to disrupt their\n\n[[Page S3834]]\n\nplans. Republicans have offered ideas to take action in areas like \nthese.\n  The underlying bill, which passed unanimously out of committee, will \nadvance a lot of important priorities, such as funding for agencies--\nlike the FBI--to fight terrorism and funding designed to help defend \nagainst cyber security threats.\n  Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Mikulski worked diligently to \nadvance this bill out of committee and bring it to the floor. Members \nshould work with these bill managers if they have ideas they think will \nmake the bill stronger. I mentioned some of them already.\n  We have made important progress on appropriations bills so far this \nyear. We can continue that progress this week and take further steps to \nkeep our country safe from terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/14/senate-section/article/S3833-6"}, {"day": "14", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, throughout history, in times of crisis and \ntragedy, the American people look to leaders for one thing: leadership. \nAmericans don't want to hear excuses. We don't want to hear self-\ncongratulations, nor do we want to hear scapegoating. It is a very \nsimple concept: We want our leaders to lead.\n  In the aftermath of Sunday's shooting at the Pulse nightclub in \nOrlando, FL, a place of celebration for the LGBT community, Donald \nTrump proved that he is as terrible a leader as he is a businessman. \nTrump proved he is not the person to lead our Nation through difficult \ntimes or, in fact, anytime. Trump failed the most important of tests \nfor a Presidential candidate: how to respond in a crisis. When our \ncitizens are under attack, how do you respond? Donald Trump failed that \ntest. Trump proved he is not the person to lead our Nation through a \ncrisis. He is not Commander in Chief material--underlined and \nunderscored.\n  It doesn't matter what the problem has been, Trump has failed. Trump \nisn't the person we want to have his finger on the nuclear button \nbecause he is clearly incapable of that responsibility. That is not \njust me saying it; even the junior Senator from Florida has questioned \nwhether Trump can be trusted with such an enormous obligation. But the \nfact that Donald Trump can't be trusted with the nuclear codes hasn't \nstopped Senator Rubio or many other Republicans from endorsing Trump \nfor the highest office in the land. There is absolutely no question--\nnone--that Donald Trump is not capable enough or experienced enough to \nhave this high-level responsibility. We expect more from a Commander in \nChief.\n  Here is how Trump responded to Sunday's massacre--classic Trump. \nWithin hours of the shooting, Trump first congratulated himself and \nthen began to immediately denigrate Muslim Americans. Trump then \nsuggested that our President and one of Secretary Clinton's aides may \nbe in league with Islamic terrorists. Let me repeat that. Donald Trump \nsuggested that President Obama and one of Secretary Clinton's aides may \nbe in league with Islamic terrorists. Is that outrageous? Of course it \nis.\n  It is outrageous for Donald Trump to suggest that the President of \nthe United States, our Commander in Chief, would support terrorists and \nthe murder of innocent Americans, but yesterday, 1 day after the mass \nshooting--it is the worst in modern American history--Trump, the \nstandard bearer for the Republican Party, went even further. Trump \ndelivered one of the most un-American speeches ever from a major party \nnominee--ever. Trump was hateful and vicious. He was Donald Trump. He \nwas everything that Republicans knew him to be when they made him the \nparty's nominee. Donald Trump used his remarks to foment hatred against \nmillions of innocent Americans based solely on what? Their religion. He \ndenigrated Muslim Americans--all 8 million of them. The Republican \nnominee suggested that all Muslim Americans were complicit in the \nOrlando shooting, saying that they, Muslim Americans, ``know what's \ngoing on.'' Trump also renewed his call for a ban on all Muslims coming \ninto the United States. The Trump speech was, as one news outlet called \nit, ``a dangerous mix of ignorance and arrogance.''\n  If you are the parent of a Muslim American, how do you explain his \nspeech to your child? If you are not a Muslim parent, how do you \nexplain Trump's speech to your child? You can't. How do you look your \nson or daughter in the eye and explain that a man running for President \nis telling your classmates to be suspicious of you and to doubt your \nloyalty based purely on your religion? You can't explain it. I can't \nexplain it. It is not possible to explain because this level of hate is \nnot comprehensible. It is incomprehensible that any Presidential \nnominee would foster and promote systemic bigotry, as Trump often does. \nIt is reprehensible and un-American for the nominee of any major party \nor any party to declare millions of Americans guilty until proven \ninnocent purely by virtue of their religion.\n  These are frightening times, and I understand that, and Trump's fear \nand paranoia are making us feel less safe. Trump is fanning the flames \nof violence and menace. There have already been reports of threats and \nobscenities being yelled at Muslims in Florida, Chicago, Seattle, and \nall across the country. Mosques all around the country have been \nthreatened. Donald Trump's rhetoric has been encouraging this scary \nbehavior.\n  What we have seen from Trump in the 2 days since the Orlando shooting \nis rank and reckless, but no one should be surprised--this is vintage \nDonald Trump.\n  Contrast Donald Trump's actions with the response from our Nation's \nMuslim communities. Muslim leaders all over America were some of the \nfirst to condemn this attack and rally in support of the LGBT \ncommunity, and the Muslim community has taken part in the blood drive \nto help victims of the attack, as they always step forward.\n  But while Americans within the Muslim and LGBT communities are trying \nto unite Americans in the aftermath of Sunday's shooting, Donald Trump \nis doing just the opposite. He is doing what he is so good at doing--\ndividing. Then, in the wake of this awful massacre, Trump tried to cast \nhimself as a friend of the LGBT community. How about that? But it \ndidn't take minutes for a spokesman from the Human Rights Campaign, the \nNation's largest gay rights group, to state that Trump is ``no friend'' \nof the community. What does this say about the Republican Party, that \nthey are endorsing this vile man? It doesn't say much. What does it say \nabout Republican Senators who are backing Trump for President? Not \nmuch. What does it say about the Senate Republican leadership, about \nthe Senate Republican leader, who is supporting Trump? Not much. Every \ntime the senior Senator from Kentucky reaffirms his commitment to \nsupport Trump he is validating Trump's behavior. He is giving credence \nto Donald Trump's rabid anti-everything speech--his un-American stance \nagainst Muslims, women, Latinos, Blacks, people with disabilities, \nimmigrants, veterans, and others.\n  If the Senators I have mentioned accept this kind of rhetoric as part \nof our political dialogue, they are all guilty of normalizing hatred. \nSenate Republicans are doing just that. When the leader of a major \nparty is promoting unhinged conspiracy theories and calling for hatred \nagainst his fellow Americans based solely on their religion, we are in \ndangerous and uncharted waters. We must make clear that Donald Trump \ndoes not speak for us. I am trying to do that. We must stand arm in arm \nwith our Muslim allies around the world who have been victims of \nterrorism, who say to the radicals: not in my name, not in my name. \nRemember, Muslims around the world are helping us defeat the \nterrorists. Who has suffered so much because of this crazy brand of \nhatred? Who has suffered more than anyone else? Muslims. We don't know \nhow many are dead in Iraq following the invasion--half a million? We \nknow there are at least 300,000 in Syria--Muslims. We must stand arm in \narm with our Muslim allies in the world who are victims of this \nterrorism.\n  Any Republican who cherishes the American values of religious freedom\n\n[[Page S3835]]\n\nand tolerance should immediately do the same and say: not in my name. \nRepublican Senators should say: not in my name. Republicans must do \nwhat they haven't had the courage to do--stand up to Trump and say: No \nmore, stop it. He is not a leader. He is unfit to be our President and \nunfit to stand for the values on which this great country was founded.\n  As for the Republican leader in the Senate, Senator McConnell should \nbe the first to condemn Trump's hateful rhetoric and reject his \nPresidential candidacy. Let's hope the senior Senator from Kentucky can \nbring himself to do just that and do it soon.\n  Madam President, what is the business of the day?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/14/senate-section/article/S3834-2"}, {"day": "14", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3835-S3841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I want to thank the leaders of our Armed \nServices Committee for working out what had been a difficult situation \ngoing forward with regard to assured access to space over a 6-year \nperiod starting in fiscal year 2017 and going through fiscal year 2022. \nWe have been able to work this out, and that is the subject of the \namendment I have just called up.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, does that complete the work on the \namendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is the pending \nbusiness.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I just want to say to the Senator from \nFlorida that I thank him for his intermediary work and his effort to \nreach this compromise. He brings unique credentials to this issue, \ngiven his experience up in space. Although some have argued that he has \nnever returned, I don't agree with that assessment. But seriously, I \nthank the Senator from Florida for his intermediary work, without whom \nthis compromise would not have been achieved.\n  I know the Senator from Florida shares my commitment to freeing this \nNation from dependency on the use of Russian rocket engines which then \nprovide an economic boost--in some cases billions of dollars--to \nVladimir Putin and his cronies. So I just want to make a special note \nof appreciation to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. If the Senator will yield, I just wish to thank him for \nhis comments. Indeed, some folks wish that I were still in orbit, and I \nunderstand that.\n  I want the Senator to know that I have great affection and great \nrespect for the chairman of our committee and for him and for the \nSenator from Alabama to be reasonable in finding an accommodation about \nthis so that this country would have assured access to space. \nCertainly, the Senator from Illinois, as the ranking member of that \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee, likewise, has also been in the \nmix. I am very grateful that this issue is behind us and we can move \non.\n  I might note that there is one technical change we will have to make \nin the conference committee. It is technical in nature, but it is \nnecessary to get the language right.\n  I thank the chairman of our committee.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NELSON. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could ask for the floor for 2 minutes, I thank the \nSenator from Florida for his leadership on this issue. It has been a \ncontentious, hotly debated, and in some ways divisive issue between \nappropriations and authorization committees in the Senate. When Senator \nNelson told me he was willing to step up and try to be that bridge over \ntroubled waters, I welcomed his entry into that conversation.\n  I thank him, Senator Gardner, Senator Bennet, Senator Cochran, \nSenator Shelby, Senator McCain, and all who have engaged in this. We \nhave come to the right place, where we are going to be promoting \ncompetition, which is good for taxpayers, and we are also going to do \nit in a way that protects our national security interests.\n  I thank the Senator from Florida for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, the vote is scheduled for 11 o'clock \nthis morning, and we will be voting on the Defense authorization bill. \nUnfortunately, we have a situation on the objections of a Senator or \nSenators that their amendment is not allowed because of the objections \nof another Senator. In other words, we now have a situation where there \nare Senators in the Senate for whom it is either their way or the \nhighway, and if they are not having an amendment that is agreed to, \nthen they will object to other Senators' amendments no matter whether \nthose amendments have any validity or any support.\n  There are a number of them, but there is one that particularly \nbothers me, which will probably cost the lives of some brave men--\nmostly men but maybe some women--who assisted us as interpreters in \nAfghanistan. They are on the list. The Senator from South Carolina \npointed out the night letters that go to the interpreters that they are \ngoing to be killed--they and their families--for cooperating with\n\n[[Page S3836]]\n\nour military and our civilians who are over there, whose work does save \nlives.\n  The Senator from South Carolina has been there many, many, many times \nand has worked with these interpreters. So I will let him speak on this \nissue. But really, by not allowing this amendment--where the vote would \nprobably be 99 to 1 because we reached an agreement with the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee and also with Senator Sessions--we are \nunable. We are unable to provide for the ability of these interpreters \nto come to the United States because of an unrelated amendment.\n  I say to my colleagues, that is not the way the Senate should \noperate. Each amendment should be judged on its own merits or demerits \nand debated and voted on. So this practice--and we are about to see it \non a managers' package now from the other side because their amendment \nis being objected to--is that we don't move forward with legislation \nthat literally is going to cause the loss of innocent people's lives, \nwhose only crime is that they cooperated and assisted the United States \nof America and our military in carrying out their duties in \nAfghanistan. That to me--that to me--is a shameful chapter. It is a \nshameful comment on the United States of America and honoring our \ncommitments to the brave people who helped us and literally saved \nAmerican lives.\n  I ask my colleague from South Carolina, who actually has dealt with \nthese people on many, many occasions, what his view is on this \nparticular issue.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  I want to put this issue and what we are trying to do in the context \nof what has happened in the last couple of days and what I think is \ngoing to happen in the future.\n  No. 1, there is strong bipartisan support to increase the number of \nvisas available to Afghans who have actively helped us in the war \nagainst the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. The reason this is so \nimportant is that it is impossible for America to defend herself \nwithout partners.\n  To those who suggest you can win the war against radical Islam \nwithout partners, you have no idea what you are talking about. To those \nwho suggest we can't let people come to our country after they risk \ntheir lives protecting our soldiers and civilians in Afghanistan and \nwho are protecting us, then you don't understand the war at all. This \nis radical Islam against the world, not just the Islamic faith. The \nworld should be at war with radical Islam.\n  As to what happened in Florida, there is no doubt in my mind that \nthese young people were killed by a radical Islamic sympathizer because \nthey were gay. In a radical Islam world, gay people are sentenced to \ndeath just simply for being gay. They are thrown off the roofs of homes \nby ISIL inside of Syria and Iraq. So don't make any mistake about it, \nthe reason these people were killed is because radical Islam judges \nthem to be unworthy of life.\n  Please make no mistake about it, radical Islamists would kill \neverybody in this Chamber because we will not bend to their will in \nterms of religion. Please make no mistake about it, most people in the \nfaith are not buying what these nut jobs are selling.\n  I have been to Iraq and Afghanistan 37 times, and I can tell you \nthousands have died fighting radical Islam in Iraq, in Syria, and in \nAfghanistan because they don't want to live under the thumb of \nreligious Nazis. So the thousands who have helped us as interpreters \nand who have gone outside the wire with us to make us a more effective \nfighting force, they have literally risked their lives and their \nfamilies' lives, and if we don't give them an out, an exit, they are \ngoing to get killed, and it is going to be hard to have anybody help us \nin the future.\n  I have told Senator Lee, whom I have a strong disagreement with about \nhis approach to the war--basically saying an American citizen has to be \ntreated as a common criminal, not an enemy combatant, for collaborating \nwith the enemy--we have our differences, but I have removed my \nobjection to his amendment with the understanding that I get a vote on \nmy amendment--the Heitkamp amendment--about the Ex-Im Bank, where \nthousands of jobs are being lost. I want to put on the record that I am \nready to let Senator Reed move forward if we can get a vote on Ex-Im \nBank, where thousands of jobs are at stake.\n  But we are not voting on any of this. The managers' package is not \nbeing voted on. So this is a low point right now. There is very serious \nbusiness that is being conducted in the Senate that can't move forward \nbecause individuals have decided: If I can't have everything I want, \nnobody is going to get anything.\n  The bottom line is, the managers' package should move forward. There \nare a lot of good things in that package. There is a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution in that package, coauthored by Senator Jack Reed and \nme, urging President Obama to keep the 9,800 American troops in \nAfghanistan until conditions warrant their withdrawal; that if he \ndecides to keep the force in place, we support him; if we go to 5,500, \nAfghanistan is going to fall apart. That is a really big statement in a \nbipartisan fashion.\n  As to what happened in Orlando and why it is so important, I have \nbeen trying to fight a war, not a crime. For years now, I have been \nsuggesting that the difference between a war and a crime is important. \nThe FBI closed the file on this man because they didn't have enough \nevidence to charge him with a crime. My goal is to prevent terrorist \nattacks, not respond to them.\n  Here is the world I would like to construct; that if by your \nactions--not by being a Muslim or being this or being that--if by the \nway you behave and the way you act and the way you talk and the way you \nengage, you should be treated differently. If you are expressing \nsympathy to ISIL and other radical Islamic groups, if you threaten your \ncoworkers, telling them that your family is a member of Al Qaeda, if \nyou are associated with a known terrorist and you attend a mosque that \nis trying to radicalize people, the FBI should never close the file \nuntil they are sure you are not a threat, in terms of attacking our \nhomeland. That is the difference between fighting a war and fighting a \ncrime. I am trying to prevent the next attack, not respond to it.\n  This is not a gun control issue, folks. If gun control could protect \nthe country from attacks by radical Islamists, there would be no Paris. \nThe French have the strongest gun laws on the planet and over 100 \nFrench citizens died at the hands of Islamists using weapons: bombs, \nplanes, guns. It is not the instrumentality, it is the attitude. So \nthis is not a gun control problem. We are at war and we are treating it \nlike a crime.\n  On the Republican side, this is not about banning all Muslims. This \nman was an American citizen born in Queens. This idea of shutting \nAmerica off to everybody in the Muslim faith makes it harder to win the \nwar, not easier. We need partners in the faith to destroy radical \nIslam. It is through that partnership that we will make America safe. \nSo when people call for gun control, you don't understand what is going \non here. This is not a gun control issue. If it were, there would be no \nattacks in Europe. This is a radical Islamic effort--sometimes \nindividually, sometimes collectively--to break our will, destroy our \nway of life, and we are not dealing with it sufficiently. We should \nhave an approach to this problem as though we are at war. We should \nfollow people who are sympathetic to the enemy, monitor their behavior \nto prevent what happened in Florida, gather intelligence. We should \nnever close a file against a suspected sympathizer to ISIL because we \ncan't prove a crime. We should keep the file open as long as they are a \nthreat.\n  I appreciate all Senator McCain has done to strengthen the military. \nTo those who voted against increasing military spending by $18 billion \nat a time that the military is being gutted, you made a huge mistake. \nIf you want to deal with radical Islam, destroy it over there before it \ncontinues to come here, and to do that we need a stronger military. Our \nNavy and Army are going to be the size of 1940 and 1950, respectively. \nWe are cutting the Marine Corps. We are cutting our ability to defend \nourselves, and this $18 billion amendment would restore money to help \nthe military more effectively deal with radical Islam over there so we \ndon't have to fight it here.\n  To those who look at this as a gun control issue, you are missing the\n\n[[Page S3837]]\n\npoint. To those who think we should not restore spending, you are not \nlistening to our commanders. Our commanders are begging for more money \nto more effectively support the force in a struggle we can't afford to \nlose. To those who think we should declare war on the Islamic faith \nitself, you have no idea how dangerous that model is. To those who want \nto close a file because we can't prove a crime when we know the person \nwe are looking at has weird, strange beliefs and is actually acting on \nthese beliefs, then you are making a huge mistake.\n  Until America gets our attitude adjusted, until we change our \npolicies, until we restore our ability to defend ourselves, this is \ngoing to continue.\n  The President continues to marginalize this, downplaying the threats. \nThis was directed. I don't have any idea that al-Baghdadi called this \nguy up and said: Go to a night club and shoot on this day, but I know \nal-Baghdadi has called on everybody sympathetic to his cause to attack \nduring the holy month of Ramadan; attack in place, don't come to Syria. \nSo that is a direction.\n  It was clear to me, this man had been interviewed on three separate \noccasions by the FBI, that he was expressing sympathy and allegiance to \nradical Islam, and that he was associated with a man who went from \nFlorida to Syria, back to Florida, back to Syria, who became a suicide \nbomber for al-Nusra. There is no way in hell this file should have ever \nbeen closed because of political correctness. It should have stayed \nopen until we were sure he was not a threat to us. The goal is to \nprevent these things, not react to them.\n  I want to tell you right now that the things we are not talking about \nin this bill and we can't vote on in this bill are making us less safe. \nNot allowing these Afghan interpreters--who have risked their lives to \nprotect us by helping us over there--to come to America in larger \nnumbers is going to make it harder to have partners. By insisting that \nthese budget cuts stay in place and not increasing military spending at \na time of desperate need is a huge mistake. To my friends on the left \nand the Libertarians who want to turn the war into crime, it is the \nbiggest mistake of all.\n  So this is very sad that the U.S. Senate seems to not be able to \nadjust to the reality that exists and that we all have our petty \ngrievances and we can't move forward as one to strengthen the military, \nto give our intelligence community the tools they need to protect us, \nand to have a game plan to win a war we can't afford to lose. In my \nopinion, we are not having votes that are very important, for no good \nreason, and this will come back to haunt us.\n  Last week--and I will end with this--Senator McCain and I were \ntalking about the threats we face. I have been trying the best I can to \narticulate the difference between fighting a crime and fighting a war. \nI know what the enemy wants. They want to destroy our way of life and \neverything we hold near and dear. They want to kill anything that is \ndifferent. They want everything that America refuses to give them. We \nare never going to give them what they want, which is the ability to be \nyourself, the ability to worship God the way you choose, if at all, the \nability to be different, the ability to speak your mind and to elect \nyour leaders. That is what they want. We can't afford to give it to \nthem, and we don't have the right attitude or the policies to end a \nwar. It will end one day. People are not buying what radical Islam is \nselling within the faith. But the longer it goes on, the more \nendangered we are, and our policies are not working. I am trying my \nbest to change them in a responsible way, consistent with our \nConstitution, consistent with our values.\n  I find myself on the floor of the Senate 48 hours after the largest \nattack since 9/11 unable to move forward on things that matter.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, section 578 of this year's National \nDefense Authorization Act, NDAA, is an inappropriate place from which \nto impose mandates on nearly 20,000 public elementary and secondary \nschools in 1,225 public school districts across the country.\n  Legislative language is included in the NDAA this year that dictates \ndisruptive policies on public schools that would create a complicated \nand confusing system where one school system follows established \nbackground checks under State or local law, while a neighboring county \nmust now comply with a new unfunded Federal mandate. This language \nshould not be included in the final version of this bill.\n  The U.S. Senate takes seriously the goal of ensuring the safety of \nthe more than 50 million children in our 100,000 public schools, \nincluding federally connected children. These issues have been and \nshould be discussed, debated, and legislated within the appropriate \ncommittees of jurisdiction. Measures related to education are within \nthe jurisdiction of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee under Rule XXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, as well \nas within the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Education and the \nWorkforce under Rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives for \nthe 114th Congress.\n  So while it may be appropriate for the Armed Services Committee to \ndictate background check policies for the 172 schools operated by the \nDepartment of Defense, it is not appropriate to use the authorization \nbill for the Department of Defense to impose mandates on nearly 20,000 \npublic elementary and secondary schools in 1,225 public school \ndistricts across the country.\n  These 20,000 public schools, out of 100,000 total, are being singled \nout because they receive ``Impact Aid'' funds from the Federal \nGovernment under title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct, ESEA, of 1965. The purpose of the program is to ``fulfill the \nFederal responsibility to assist with the provision of educational \nservices to federally connected children in a manner that promotes \ncontrol by local educational agencies with little or no Federal or \nState involvement.''\n  According to the Government Accountability Office, 46 States already \nrequire background checks of some kind for all public school employees, \nand 42 States have established professional standards or codes of \nconduct for school personnel. Section 578 of the NDAA would create \nconfusion for all those States and localities, as they are forced to \nnavigate two sets of potentially conflicting background checks \npolicies.\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, today I wish to speak about the fiscal \nyear 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA. I want to thank \nSenator McCain and Senator Reed for all their work on this Defense \nbill. This year's floor process has been challenging to say the least, \nbut with their leadership and that of their staff directors, Chris \nBrose and Liz King, I am confident we can find a meaningful path \nforward.\n  I supported this bill out of committee in hopes of having a vigorous \ndebate on some of the proposals I had expressed concern over regarding \nDefense reform. It was my belief that the public release of this bill \nwould invite greater scrutiny by officials in the Department of Defense \nto inform floor debate. In anticipation of their concern, I again \nsubmitted an amendment that I had offered in committee to initiate a \ncommission on Defense reform to assist Congress in considering future \nlegislation. I have been surprised at the absence of comments about \nmany of the reform proposals. This has contributed to a sense that the \nconcepts were welcome and being embraced by the Department. It wasn't \nuntil the administration's response was released, in the midst of the \nbill being on the Senate floor, that concern was finally noted.\n  Despite my belief that some of our proposals lack sufficient analysis \nand have gone too far, I do share the chairman's concern over whether \nthe Department has the ability to adapt and remain successful in \ntoday's security environment. I am also concerned that the Department \nmay in fact be mired in duplicative process and complicated \norganizational designs. Many of the witnesses in front of the Armed \nServices Committee testified to these facts, but several went on to \nrecommend caution.\n  On November 10, 2015 in front of a hearing by this committee, Jim \nThomas from the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Analysis said, ``all \nof these ideas would require detailed analysis to fully understand \ntheir strengths and avoid outcomes that might inadvertently leave us \nworse off.'' At that same hearing, we heard from James Locher, a former \nstaff member of the Senate Armed Services Committee during the \nGoldwater-Nichols reform, who stated\n\n[[Page S3838]]\n\n``pinpointing problems was the committee's sole focus for eighteen \nmonths. As part of this thorough process, the committee staff produced \na 645-page staff study with detailed analyses of each problem area. . . \n. a hasty reform without a deep appreciation for the origins of the \nbehaviors that currently limit Pentagon effectiveness would be a \nmistake.'' Additional comments by witnesses like the Honorable David \nWalker, ``there needs to be a fundamental review and reassessment of \nthe current organizational structure and personnel practices,'' or \nformer Under Secretary of Defense Michele Flournoy, ``it is imperative \nthat we think through the second and third order effects of any changes \nproposed. . . . great care should be taken to hear the full range of \nviews and consider the unintended consequences,'' should have provided \nthe necessary direction and caution to this committee to pursue a \ndeliberative, well-researched, and open approach.\n  Many of the reform provisions were drafted by the committee's very \nskilled professional staff. While I have the full confidence that they \ncrafted proposals to address various challenges in the Department, it \nis ultimately the responsibility of the members to fully understand \nthem. Despite the numerous hearings and countless witnesses, the only \ntheme that emerged was that reform was needed interspersed with a few \nconceptual suggestions. To date, no study has proposed the legislation \ncontained within this bill. No officials offered their views for \nconsideration until the bill was on the Senate floor.\n  In the absence of a debate on the merits of an independent study, \ninvestigative work, or official Department views, I suspect many of my \ncolleagues do not have confidence that the proposals address the \nDepartment's challenges. Should we require the chairman of the Joint \nChiefs to consult with and seek the advice of others? Should the \nheadquarters be reduced in addition to previous reductions? Is an \nadditional 15 percent of staff adequate in a time of war or crisis? \nWill the new Under Secretary for Research and Engineering make the \nDepartment's acquisition process run more efficiently? Last year we \nremoved a pay increase for general officers; this year, we reduced \ntheir number by 25 percent. The combination of these two provisions \nmakes me wonder whether we are doing all we can to cultivate the next \nEisenhower, Halsey, Abrams, or Dunford.\n  We made significant reforms in previous years empowering acquisition \nprofessionals to have flexibility and offer service chiefs greater \nownership of their acquisition programs. We have also charged the \nDepartment with necessary authorities to ``hire top talent'' in an \nattempt to drive innovation. Many of us in the Senate have demanded a \nmore comprehensive military strategy in countering the myriad of \nthreats around the globe. In addition, this bill encourages numerous \noutreach and coordination programs with our allies and partners. These \nrequests are not hollow or zero-sum. People are required to assist our \nservice chiefs with acquisition programs. People develop more \ncomprehensive doctrines and offset strategies. Hiring and retaining \ntop-talent means just that.\n  What impact will the reorganization of the Department and significant \nchanges in personnel policies have on our operations in the midst of a \ntwo-front cold war and expanding conflict in the Middle East? Do we \nchallenge the advice our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is providing? How \ndo we get ``top talent'' if each spring we reorganize and cut our \nDepartment of Defense workforce? How will a reduction in general and \nflag officers impact current and future senior officers? What are the \nsecondary effects to changes in combatant command responsibilities? How \nwill our allies and adversaries interpret the reduction or \ndisappearance of general officers in overseas billets? I submit that \nmost of my colleagues do not know the answers to these questions, but I \nwould encourage them to consider them prior to taking similar drastic \naction in the future.\n  I share the chairman's desire to improve the organization and \ncapability of the Department of Defense. I know he has reached a \ncomfort level with the reform proposals contained within, that in time \nI may better understand their impacts. However, I am mindful of the \ncautions relayed by many of our witnesses. We should take our \nindependent oversight responsibility very seriously. I remain committed \nto working with my colleagues in a bipartisan fashion and seek a more \nmeasured and informed approach to any legislation that has the \npotential to negatively impact the very Department we seek to improve. \nIt is in this spirit that I offered my amendment on establishing a \ncommission to study Defense reform.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, if we can get consent, and individual \nSenators will relinquish their objections, the Senate is ready to vote \non the Shaheen amendment on special immigrant visas for Afghan \ninterpreters, which will save lives, the Moran amendment on Guantanamo, \nthe Gillibrand amendment on the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the \nMurray amendment on cryopreservation of eggs and sperm, the Corker \namendment to authorize the activities of the State Department. We are \nready to debate and vote on all of those.\n  So I hope that if there is objection, the Senators involved will \nrelinquish their objections so we can move forward with those \namendments and have final passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it be \nin order to offer amendment No. 4310, notwithstanding rule XXII, and \nthe Senate vote in relation to the amendment; and that the amendment be \nsubject to a 60-affirmative-vote threshold, with no second-degree \namendments in order prior to the vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, with the greatest reluctance, I object \non behalf of one Member on this side. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, could I also say, as I object--reserving \nthe right to object--the Gillibrand amendment, I do not support, but \nthe Gillibrand amendment deserves debate and a vote in this body. It is \na serious issue of the utmost seriousness in the military. The Chair \ncertainly understands that. It has to do with sexual assaults in the \nmilitary, and it deserves the attention of the entire U.S. Senate--\ndebate and vote. Unfortunately, there is objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I rise to speak about the \namendment.\n  Under our current military justice system, when a servicemember is \naccused of sexual assault, the decision to prosecute isn't actually \nmade by a trained prosecutor or a lawyer of any kind. In fact, it is \nmade by a colonel or a brigadier general or another high-ranking \nmilitary officer.\n  Our commanders are the best in the world when it comes to tactics and \nstrategy, but most of them have little to no experience in legal or \ncriminal matters. And why should they have that experience? Our \ncommanders are not prosecutors. They are not lawyers. They are \nwarfighters, and their job is to keep our country safe, not make legal \njudgments about whether to prosecute a rape.\n  The current military justice system has failed our sexual assault \nsurvivors for too long.\n  This amendment very simply takes the decision about whether to \nprosecute these crimes and gives it to trained, experienced, \nindependent military prosecutors.\n  We have all the evidence we need that this problem has not gotten \nbetter in the last year. We have more data. We have looked at more case \nfiles. We have heard from more survivors. It is clear little has \nchanged, despite the Department's persistent claims that things are \ngetting better, that they are making progress.\n  When the Department of Defense estimates that there are 20,000 \nservicemembers who are sexually assaulted in a year, that is not \nprogress. When 8 out of every 10 military sexual assault survivors \ndon't report the crime, that is not progress. When 62 percent of \nsurvivors are being retaliated against, that is not progress. When more \nthan half of those retaliation cases--58 percent of them--are \nperpetrated by someone in the chain of command, that is\n\n[[Page S3839]]\n\nnot progress. When the percentage of survivors willing to report openly \nhas declined for the past 5 years, that is not progress. When it was \nconfirmed by the Associated Press that the Pentagon blatantly misled \nthe Senate in order to skew our debate, that is perhaps the ultimate \nsign that there has been no progress.\n\n  Our military justice system is broken. It is failing our members. And \nno matter how many marginal reforms we make, as long as commanders with \nno legal experience are continuing to make important legal decisions on \nwhether to prosecute violent sex crimes, we are not going to solve the \nproblem. Once and for all, let's take the decision to prosecute these \ncrimes and give it to trained, independent military prosecutors. Let's \ngive our military servicemembers a justice system that is worthy of \ntheir service.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, we have cleared the following amendments \nto go by voice vote on this side. I understand there are objections on \nthe other side to this list. I want the record to reflect what is on \nthe table from this side. I dislike getting into this back-and-forth \nbecause it really serves no purpose, but I ask unanimous consent that \nthe managers' package as portrayed here be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the printing?\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       4604, Shaheen; 4141, Corker; 4070, Moran; 4444, Murray; \n     4090, Burr; 4123, Blumenthal, as modified; 4362, Brown; 4142, \n     Nelson; 4216, Booker; 4392, Cantwell; 4421, Warner; 4461, \n     Manchin; 4426, Boxer; 4596, Wyden; 4297, Donnelly; 4321, \n     Schatz; 4416, Kaine; 4389, Udall; 4431, Schumer; 4527, Casey; \n     4210, Tester; 4591, Reed; 4678, Reid; 4675, Bennet; 4564, \n     Carper; 4232, Heller; 4376, McCain; 4094, Inhofe; 4195, \n     Rubio; 4243, Portman.\n       4263, Gardner; 4316, Rounds; 4449, Barrasso; 4136, Hoeven; \n     4265, Cochran; 4478, Hoeven; 4096, McCain; 4418, Perdue; \n     4424, Moran; 4500, Johnson; 4399, Daines; 4622, Flake; 4400, \n     McCain; 4377, Hatch; 4155, Boozman; 4242, Peters; 4348, \n     Baldwin; 4372, Nelson; 4427, Boxer; 4428, Boxer; 4443, \n     Murray; 4453, Heinrich; 4471, Peters; 4528, McCaskill; 4577, \n     Schatz.\n       4583, Warner; 4584, Tester; 4589, Heinrich; 4602, Udall; \n     4630, Brown; 4631, Peters; 4635, Brown; 4642, Booker; 4073, \n     Paul; 4128, McCain; 4214, Kirk; 4419, Wicker; 4465, Johnson; \n     4552, Perdue; 4555, Lankford; 4587, Collins; 4601, Rubio; \n     4617, Portman; 4619, Inhofe; 4620, Ernst; 4638, Kirk; 4666, \n     Murkowski.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                        Mass Shooting in Orlando\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I want to start by offering my \ncondolences to the families and loved ones of the victims of Sunday's \nheinous attack in the city of Orlando and to everyone who was affected \nby this terrible tragedy and act of terror.\n  While our hearts are with the families and the communities right now, \nin the coming days we should have a robust debate about how we can all \ncome together to do everything possible to prevent tragedies like that \nfrom happening again.\n  Madam President, I want to turn to the bill we are considering today, \nthe National Defense Authorization Act, which has been described as one \nthat will modernize the military health system and give the men and \nwomen of our military better quality care, better access, and a better \nexperience. It has been described as upholding commitments to our \nservicemembers. I wish I could stand here and say that I agree with \nthat 100 percent, but there is a glaring problem in this bill. It is a \nproblem that really cuts against the idea that our country should be \nthere for the men and women of our military, who risk so much on our \nbehalf, no matter what.\n  Go to page 1,455 of this massive bill. Buried in a funding chart, \nthere is one line that would zero out a new program intended to help \nmen and women in our military who suffer catastrophic injuries while \nfighting on our behalf. I don't know how this line got in there. I \ndon't know who thought it was a good idea. I don't know why, but I do \nknow what this is: It is absolutely wrong, and we ought to fix it. That \nis why I have come to the Senate floor repeatedly over the past week to \nurge my colleagues to correct this shameful change, and with the clock \nrunning down on this bill, now is the time to act.\n  Let me give this some context. Six months ago the Pentagon announced \na pilot program to offer our servicemembers who are getting ready to \ndeploy an opportunity at cryopreservation; in other words, freezing \ntheir eggs or sperm. It gave deploying servicemembers not just the \nability to have reproductive options in the event they are grievously \ninjured but some deserved peace of mind. It meant they don't have to \nworry about choosing between defending their country or a chance at \nhaving a family someday. This new program was met with widespread \npraise and relief. It reflected a basic level of respect for \nservicemembers who are willing to risk suffering catastrophic injuries \non our behalf.\n  I was hoping this new program was a step we could build on, a move in \nthe right direction, an important part of our larger work to help our \nwarriors who have sustained grievous injuries achieve their dream of \nstarting a family. That is why I was so disturbed when I learned this \nbill would move us in the other way.\n  Despite what some of my colleagues have been saying, my amendment \nvery deliberately states that it will not divert money from any other \nimportant health programs.\n  I am here again today to ask unanimous consent to have a vote on my \namendment that would restore this pilot program. It is hard to imagine \nany of my colleagues standing up to say that men and women who are \nwilling to make the ultimate sacrifice for their country and for all of \nus should be denied a shot at their dream of a family. I am hopeful we \ncan have a vote on this, and I encourage my colleagues to support it \nand step away from what would be a truly shameful mistake.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to offer \namendment No. 4490, relating to fertility treatments, and that the \nSenate vote in relation to the amendment, with no second-degree \namendments in order prior to the vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, with reluctance--and I apologize to the \nSenator from Washington. This is another amendment that deserves debate \nand a vote.\n  Another amendment that has not been brought up that deserves debate \nand a vote is the issue of women being registered for Selective \nService. I want to make it very clear that I have wanted and this body \nwanted a vote on whether women should be registered for Selective \nService, and it was not allowed--not by this individual but only one.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Indiana be recognized, \nin addition to my time, for 3 minutes----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the pending \nrequest?\n  Mr. McCAIN. And that the 3 minutes be taken out of Senator Reed's \ntime, to the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Is there objection to my request?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the pending \nrequest?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Is there objection to the request from the Senator from Arizona?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4670, as Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to modify the \nNelson amendment No. 4670 with the changes at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 1, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 829B. COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT AND PHASE OUT OF ROCKET \n                   ENGINES FROM THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IN THE \n                   EVOLVED EXPENDABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE PROGRAM FOR \n                   SPACE LAUNCH OF NATIONAL SECURITY SATELLITES.\n\n       (a) Ineffectiveness of Superseded Requirements.--Sections \n     1036 and 1037 shall have no force or effect, and the \n     amendments proposed to be made by section 1037 shall not be \n     made.\n       (b) In General.--Any competition for a contract for the \n     provision of launch services\n\n[[Page S3840]]\n\n     for the evolved expendable launch vehicle program shall be \n     open for award to all certified providers of evolved \n     expendable launch vehicle-class systems.\n       (c) Award of Contracts.--In awarding a contract under \n     subsection (b), the Secretary of Defense--\n       (1) subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), and notwithstanding \n     any other provision of law, may, during the period beginning \n     on the date of the enactment of this Act and ending on \n     December 31, 2022, award the contract to a provider of launch \n     services that intends to use any certified launch vehicle in \n     its inventory without regard to the country of origin of the \n     rocket engine that will be used on that launch vehicle; and\n       (2) may award contracts utilizing an engine designed or \n     manufactured in the Russian Federation for only phase 1(a) \n     and phase 2 evolved expendable launch vehicle procurements.\n       (3) Limitation.--The total number of rocket engines \n     designed or manufactured in the Russian Federation and used \n     on launch vehicles for the evolved expendable launch vehicle \n     program shall not exceed 18.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I will try to be very brief. I know time \nis constricted.\n  When I first came to the Senate, we had Members on both sides who had \nprincipled positions on any number of issues, but we rarely, if ever, \nbecause of our principled stand, denied the opportunity for debate and \nvote. The Senate is here for the purpose of debating and voting. \nSometimes we win, and sometimes we lose. The consequences are recorded, \nand the bill goes forward--as this one would--to be combined with the \nHouse, to go to conference, and finally issue a resolution.\n  We are not talking about just any piece of legislation here; we are \ntalking about the national security and national defense for our \nNation. There are important issues that need to be debated and need to \nbe voted on. Yet we are denied that opportunity. Someone on our side \nwas denied that opportunity. The other side has every right to say: \nWell, if you are going to play that game, we are going to play that \ngame. That is not how the Senate should operate.\n  The Senator from New York and the Senator from Washington on the \nDemocratic side have principled amendments. I don't support the \namendment from the Senator from New York, but it ought to be debated \nand it ought to be voted on and it ought to be worked through. That is \nwhy we are sent here. No wonder the public across the Nation is so \nfrustrated with us--because we are in total stalemate.\n  Senator McCain and Senator Reed have made every possible effort to \nmove this process forward. Yet here we are. As we know, under the \nprocedures, one person has the right to stop anything from going \nforward if they use those procedures, and that has happened. It is very \nunfortunate.\n  In comparison to my time here earlier when we functioned as the U.S. \nSenate, we are in total dysfunction because people are not willing to \ngo forward and debate and accept the fact that they win or they lose \nbut the process goes forward.\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona and colleague from Rhode Island for \nthe opportunity to speak, and I yield back.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to use 1 minute \nof debate time from the Democratic side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to say that my friend from Indiana, who has \nbeen a Member of this body for many years and has served in a variety \nof functions for this Nation, is exactly right. We are now in a \nsituation where, because someone doesn't get a vote on their amendment, \neverybody else's amendment is not agreed to. That is not the way the \nSenate was intended to function. That is not the way the Senate should \nfunction.\n  We just heard of two amendments that I strongly object to--both of \nthem--but I want debate and votes on them. Unfortunately, we now have a \nsituation, frankly, on both sides where unless people get their \namendment, nobody gets their amendment.\n  We are now, among other things, putting the lives of the interpreters \nwho have served this Nation and saved American lives in danger by \nrefusing to take up the Shaheen amendment, which allows some of these \npeople to come to the United States of America. When some of them start \ndying, my friends--and they will, because they get the night letters \nthat they are going to be assassinated, they and their families--I hope \nthey understand what is at stake here, and I certainly wouldn't want \nthat on my conscience.\n  In addition to my friend Lindsey Graham's comments about Paris--and \nwe will have plenty of time to talk about it--my favorite quote of all \nthat epitomizes the failure of this President is from January 2014: \n``The analogy we use around here sometimes, and I think it is accurate, \nis if a JV team puts on Lakers uniforms, that doesn't make them Kobe \nBryant.'' My friends, that statement will live in infamy. That will go \ndown with ``peace in our time.'' ``If a JV team puts on Lakers \nuniforms, that doesn't make them Kobe Bryant.'' ISIS is the same as a \nJV team putting on a Lakers uniform. There has been nothing that I know \nof more revealing of the attitude and policies of this administration, \nwhich is directly responsible, in my view, for the ultimate conclusion \nof what happened in Orlando.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I am once again on the Senate floor in a \nseries of conversations we have had with my colleagues about the \nimportance of my amendment I would like pending to this national \ndefense authorization bill.\n  I am discouraged and disappointed that over the weekend no resolution \non a variety of issues has been reached, and therefore there would be \nobjection once again if I offered this amendment.\n  What I am attempting to do and what we have talked about so many \ntimes here on the floor and in the hallways of Congress is that Kansans \ngenerally are opposed to the closing of Guantanamo Bay as a detention \nfacility and particularly opposed to bringing these detainees to the \nUnited States and especially opposed to bringing the detainees to Fort \nLeavenworth, KS. Unfortunately, this bill includes an amendment offered \nin committee that allows for the design and planning and construction \nof a facility, and my amendment is the simple removal of those \nprovisions from this legislation.\n  It is clear to me that throughout the entire time of the \nadministration of this President, this administration has been unable \nto provide any cohesive, comprehensive, legally justifiable closure and \nrelocation plan. Yet this plan authorizes the planning and design.\n  So I rise to once again express my dissatisfaction and anger with the \nSenate for its inability to do its job. Whether or not my amendment \nwould prevail at the moment is not the issue; it is whether or not \nthere can even be a vote on what I consider to be a very important \nissue to Kansas and to the country.\n  I appreciate the efforts by the chairman of the committee, who has \nassured me that he supports this amendment, and through no fault of his \nown, we are unable to take a vote to demonstrate that support in the \nSenate.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I say to the Senator from Kansas, we had \nan agreement to have this taken by voice vote, just as we had an \nagreement to take up the Shaheen amendment as well, with overwhelming \nsupport in the Senate to save the lives of these interpreters. \nUnfortunately, one or two individual Senators blocked any progress on \nthat.\n  I want to assure the Senator from Kansas that we will do what is \nnecessary to ensure that this amendment is enacted into law.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I wish to underscore what the chairman has \nsaid. We worked very closely with Senator Moran, Senator Shaheen, and \nmany others, including Senator Gillibrand and Senator Murray, to come \nup with a package.\n  As the chairman announced previously, if this package had moved, it\n\n[[Page S3841]]\n\nwould have also unlocked numerous other amendments that we had cleared \non both sides. But, unfortunately, because of the objection of an \nindividual whom the chairman has cited, we are now coming to final \npassage.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, all \npostcloture time on S. 2943 has expired.\n\n\n                Vote on Amendment No. 4670, as Modified\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 4670, as modified, offered by the Senator from Florida, \nMr. Nelson.\n  Is there any further debate on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Nelson amendment No. 4670, as \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 4670), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Vote on Amendment No. 4607, as Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4607, as amended, offered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  Is there any further debate?\n  The amendment (No. 4607), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I want to thank the 85 members who voted \nfor the bill, and I would like to criticize the 13 who voted against \nit.\n  I think this is a good bill. I want to thank Senator Reed for his \ncooperation and the effort that has been made in our committee on a \nbipartisan basis. If it were not for his cooperation and assistance and \npartnership--equal partnership--we would not have been able to have a \nbill of these significant numbers.\n  I want to thank the Members for their votes. But I would also like to \npoint out that, as happy as I am about the size of the vote, we left \nout some very important amendments. Particularly, we left out one that \nhas to do with interpreters who are being slaughtered as we speak \nbecause they are the No. 1 targets for the Taliban and for ISIS.\n  As I take pleasure in the size of the vote, I would also urge my \ncolleagues that when we take up a bill of this significance, not every \nSenator can have his or her way. Not every Senator can have their \namendment, particularly when it is not agreed to on the other side. So \nI have to say, I blame a few Senators who believe it is their way or \nthe highway. I hope that when we move forward with other legislation, \nwe can have amendments, debate, and vote. That is what the Senate is \nsupposed to be about.\n  Finally, I again thank Senator Reed and his staff for all of their \ncooperation and assistance. We intend to go to conference and get a \nbill to the President's desk.\n  I would point out to my colleagues that this legislation is probably \nthe biggest reform enacted by the Senate Armed Services Committee and \nthe Senate since Goldwater-Nichols some 30 years ago. There are \nfundamental reforms in the military and how they do business, and that \nis very badly needed.\n  We had a hearing a couple of weeks ago about an F-35. The first time \nthe F-35 began production was 15 years ago. I change one of these every \n18 months. Our acquisition system is broken; it needs to be fixed. \nThere are billions and billions of dollars of cost overruns that we \nneed to fix if we are going to have the confidence of the American \npeople in their tax dollars being spent wisely.\n  Again, I thank my friend and colleague from Rhode Island.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me commend and thank the chairman on his \nleadership. He began this process with great deliberation months ago by \nbringing together experts on defense organization--experts on military \nand strategic policy. Through a series of many hearings, we were able \nto craft significant legislation reforming the operations of the \nDepartment of Defense. We will now go to conference and begin to work \nto improve that legislation. I think improvements can be made with \nrespect to the changes in the context of Goldwater-Nichols \nreorganization. But I think the chairman's leadership was absolutely \nessential and incredibly productive in this process.\n  We have had debate on a number of issues on the floor. I think we are \nnow\n\n[[Page S3842]]\n\nat the point where we should be, not only continuing our efforts to get \nthis bill passed but, once again, underscoring the need to eliminate \nsequestration, which is looming on the horizon. When we don't have the \nrelief afforded by last year's temporary agreement, we will be dealing \nwith numbers that will not allow our military to perform their basic \nmission of protecting the United States. Therefore, we have to start \nworking on this issue of sequestration. As I suggested, it applies not \nonly to the Department of Defense but to other agencies of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Through the very careful leadership of the chairman, we were able to \ncome up with a working and I think workable compromise with respect to \nRussian engines without surrendering the basic principle that the \nchairman had enunciated that we should not be relying on Russian \nengines to send our technology into space.\n  As the chairman also indicated, there are several issues that we \ncould not reach consensus on and which deserve not only a vote but in \nmany cases deserve passage.\n  Senator Shaheen has worked tirelessly. I have never seen a colleague \nwork so intensely, so thoughtfully, so professionally, literally going \nfrom office to office asking for support for the Afghan interpreters--\nindividuals who have already been targeted in many cases because of \ntheir help to the United States. If we don't have this legislation \npassed, then not only will we send a terrible message to these \nindividuals who have served with us and sacrificed along with us, but \nalso to succeeding generations who will not come to our aid because \nthey are afraid of the consequences. So not only looking back at \njustice and equity for people who helped us but looking forward to \nbeing able to operate in not just Afghanistan but other areas of the \nworld, I think it was necessary to not only bring up the Shaheen \namendment but to pass it.\n  As the chairman pointed out, Senator Gillibrand has a very important \namendment with respect to sexual assault in the military. She has done \nremarkable work with respect to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. \nShe has worked very closely with many colleagues.\n  I must also thank Senator Claire McCaskill for her extraordinary \nefforts. There are many provisions in this bill that Senator Gillibrand \nhas included, but there is one very important to her about the role of \nthe commander. That issue deserves a debate. Like the chairman, I do \nnot agree with the conclusion, but I certainly believe that she should \nhave had a vote.\n  Senator Murray also came here with a very important amendment, \ncryopreservation for soldiers. As they go overseas and they do want to \nhave a family, there is the risk in battle which could prevent that, \nand this is a procedure which would allow them not only to serve their \ncountry but in the event of them being wounded, they could still have a \nfamily. Again, many people have different views on this particular \namendment, but I believe a vote would have been in order.\n  These are three issues, but these issues cannot undercut the \nincredible reforms that the chairman inspired with the bill and the \nthoughtful debate and ultimately the conclusion--strong bipartisan \nsupport for this initiative.\n  I want to thank the staff because we could not have done this without \nthem. I want to particularly thank Chris Brose and all of his \ncolleagues on the Republican side. They did a remarkable job.\n  I want to individually thank my staff: Jody Bennett, Carolyn Chuhta, \nJon Clark, Jonathan Epstein, Jon Green, Creighton Greene, Ozge Guzelsu, \nMike Kuiken, Gary Leeling, Kirk McConnell, Maggie McNamara, Mike \nNoblet, John Quirk, Arun Seraphin, and my staff director, Elizabeth \nKing.\n  Let me thank the floor staff too. Without Gary and Laura and others \non the floor, we would not have gotten to a conclusion.\n  With that Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Rhode Island and \nlook forward to the conference and, for the 54th straight year, \ncompleting a bill where the Congress of the United States sends to the \nPresident and the President signs into law the National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  I don't know of a greater responsibility that we have, and, despite \nour differences and issues, I think that was why the vote was as \noverwhelming as it was today. Unfortunately, the two Senators from \nIdaho were uninformed on the importance of this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/14/senate-section/article/S3841-3"}, {"day": "14", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3842-S3843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COMMERCE-JUSTICE-SCIENCE APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak very briefly to \nhighlight my opposition to the cloture motion on the appropriations \nbill for the Department of Commerce, Department of Justice, and the \nScience agencies and to discuss an issue of critical importance to my \nhome State of Georgia and what I think is a direct abuse of what the \nFounders intended for Senate debate.\n  For over 20 years, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and the Army Corps of \nEngineers have been engaged in various lawsuits over water rights among \nthose three States. Georgia has two reservoirs in question--Lake Lanier \nand Lake Allatoona--that are operated by the Corps, that provide \ndrinking water for Metro Atlanta, and that provide water downstream for \nthe Chattahoochee, Flint, Coosa, and Tallapoosa Rivers. These river \nbasins also provide water to South Georgia and parts of Alabama and \nFlorida.\n  Currently, litigation is pending in the U.S. Supreme Court, the \nFederal DC district court, and the U.S. District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of Georgia. Negotiations are also ongoing between the State \ngovernments on this very topic, and I believe they are closer to a \nsolution right now than we have ever been.\n  Clearly, this is an issue that should be left to the States to settle \nthrough negotiation and, if needed, litigation. But now another attempt \nis being made by some in the Senate to surreptitiously influence the \ncourts through language included in the report that accompanies this \nCJS bill.\n  We will vote on that bill sometime this afternoon. I strongly oppose \nthis bill. This is the business of the States and should not be \nresolved or influenced in this manner. Let me be clear. It is not this \nbody's place to try and tip the scales in any way on this matter.\n  Furthermore, we have already had this fight. This same language was \ninserted last year during debate over the omnibus spending bill. Then \nit was removed after further examination and explanation was given to \nleaders in both Chambers over its purpose. Let me reiterate that. When \nthe leaders of this body and the leader in the House saw what was \nreally happening in this language, they both independently removed the \nlanguage. It was removed then, and nothing has changed to merit having \nthis debate again in this Senate this year.\n  Multiple lawsuits and negotiations between the States are ongoing. \nThere is nothing unusual about that. Any attempt to create a role for \nCongress during the appropriations process on this issue would set a \ndangerous precedent and should alarm every Senator who cares about the \nrights and integrity of the States. Injecting Congress into this would \ngive an unjust advantage to other States involved, stripping away any \nincentive for them to negotiate in good faith with our State of \nGeorgia.\n  Furthermore, this congressional involvement would establish a \ndangerous precedent for any State involved in water resource \nnegotiations. The negotiations on water rights in the West make these \npale in comparison. That is not a role our Founders intended for \nCongress to play, and inserting the Federal Government into another \nissue where it doesn't belong would be emblematic of why folks back \nhome are so fed up with the dysfunction in Washington.\n  For these reasons and others, as I will discuss throughout this week \nas\n\n[[Page S3843]]\n\nwe debate this bill, I will definitely vote no on advancing to the CJS \nappropriations bill.\n  I yield back and note the whip is in the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In \npassing the Defense authorization bill, a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation, we authorized funding for training and for the ever-\nevolving threats our troops are meeting around the world. It will also \ngive our men and women in uniform the most up-to-date equipment, \nincluding newer and more capable aircraft and vehicles.\n  Fortunately, the bill also authorized needed improvements at military \nfacilities, such as construction projects in my State at Fort Hood, \nJoint Base San Antonio, the Red River Army Depot, and Ellington Field, \nand provided a much needed and well-deserved pay raise for our troops. \nI am glad we were able to get through this process, get this bill done, \nmaking sure our military is ready to face any potential threat around \nthe world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/14/senate-section/article/S3843-1"}, {"day": "14", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3843-S3844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MASS SHOOTING IN ORLANDO\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know the country is in shock and still \ntrying to evaluate the terrorist attack in Orlando as we continue to \nlearn from the FBI's investigation. The attack killed almost 50 people \nand of course left dozens injured.\n  According to the latest reports, one of the victims was Frank \nEscalante from Weslaco, TX. My heart goes out to Frank, his family and \nfriends, and all those others who lost loved ones early Sunday morning \nand to those living with the wounds they sustained in that terrible \nattack. With this act of violence and hatred, Orlando sadly joins a \ngrowing list of American cities and cities around the world changed \nforever by radical Islamic extremism.\n  The jihadist, like those in San Bernardino before him, declared his \nallegiance to the Islamic State, and like the two Boston Marathon \nbombers, he was previously investigated by the FBI for connections to \nterrorists or known terrorist groups that carried out attacks similar \nto the gruesome attacks in Paris last November. Like those terrorists, \nthe terrorist in Orlando targeted hundreds of unarmed civilians, and \nISIS has used the Internet to urge lone wolves to imitate these types \nof attacks. In other words, not only are we concerned about people in \nthe Middle East who have pledged allegiance to ISIS coming to the \nUnited States, we are concerned about Americans who are traveling from \nthe United States, going there and training, and then coming back home. \nBut the worst, and perhaps the most difficult of all to deal with, are \nAmerican citizens, such as this shooter, who are radicalized in place, \nand of course this is the biggest challenge for the FBI. We must now \ncome together and not only mourn and grieve those lives lost, but we \nneed to also try and make a difference. It is time to act.\n  The Orlando attack was not just a random act of violence. It was a \ncalculated act of terror. By aiming his gun at innocent civilians, this \njihadist opened fire on our freedoms, our way of life, and the bedrock \nprinciples that make us a diverse and vibrant democracy. We have to \ntake these threats seriously and do everything we can to counter the \nideology that provides a threat to our security, both within and \nwithout our borders.\n  We also need an honest conversation about how to move forward on \nlegislation that might have the effect of preventing attacks like this \nin the future. Some of those conversations are already happening, and I \nhope we will not stop until we make some progress. One place we can \nstart is with a measure I introduced last year that would prevent known \nor suspected terrorists from purchasing firearms in the first place. It \nwould not just block someone from buying a gun because of mere \nsuspicion but would set up a process to actually detain--if based on \nevidence they are deemed to be a threat to society--and prevent them \nfrom not only purchasing a firearm but put them behind bars where they \ncan't be a danger to other people. If potential terrorists are \ndangerous enough not to be allowed to own a gun, then I think they are \ndangerous enough to be taken off the streets. We shouldn't forget that \na person who feels compelled to commit a terrorist act will not be \nstopped by just being unable to legally purchase a firearm. The 9/11 \nattackers used box cutters and airplanes. The Boston Marathon bombers \nused homemade explosives, and the terrorists in Paris and Brussels used \nillegal firearms and suicide vests.\n  In the case of the Orlando attacker, it does not appear he was on a \nwatch list at the time he purchased the weapons he used to carry out \nthis horrific attack. In fact, the FBI had twice cleared him of being \nan active terror threat. We need to be clear-eyed about this if we are \nactually serious about stopping events like this in the future.\n  I believe we do need to go further and do more to arm our law \nenforcement officers with the tools they need in order to counter \nterrorists and defend communities. FBI Director James Comey has \noutlined--with great clarity and specificity--how great a threat we \nface from extremists within our borders, and he made the point that the \nFBI has opened investigations in all of their FBI field offices around \nthe country; that is, investigations of people being radicalized in \nplace and doing the terrible deed that the shooter in Orlando did early \nSunday morning.\n  If the FBI Director says this is an urgent need, we ought to act. Too \noften the FBI and other local law enforcement officers have to operate \nwith one hand tied behind their back because they can't access key \npieces of information like encrypted data. We saw that in an attempted \nterrorist attack in Garland, TX, last year, on the day of the ISIS-\ninspired attack just northeast of Dallas. Before the two jihadists--\nunfortunately traveling from Phoenix--arrived in Garland, they \nexchanged more than 100 different messages with terrorists overseas. \nUnfortunately, the FBI still doesn't have access to those \ncommunications because they are encrypted. That means law enforcement \ncould still be missing critical information that could uncover future \nplots or identify more terrorists, both abroad and here at home.\n  The Garland case is not unique. The FBI is routinely hamstrung by \noutdated policies that make their job of protecting the homeland more \ndifficult. We saw another example of that in San Bernardino, CA. We \nhave to address this major policy gap. I hope the Senate has an \nopportunity to consider an amendment I filed to a bill that would \nupdate the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. It would help FBI \nagents get access to critical information faster to prevent terrorist \nattacks. The FBI Director has made it clear that this is his top \nlegislative priority, and it is also supported by President Obama and \nhis administration.\n  I believe it is our duty, now more than ever, to do something about \nit and make sure the FBI has critical counterterrorism tools to be able \nto identify potential threats before they commit horrific acts of \nviolence like we saw in Orlando. It is clear the threats are on our \ndoorsteps, and we should be willing to give those on the front lines of \nthe counterterrorism fight faster access to critical information so \nthey can identify terrorists and thwart those attacks. I am not talking \nabout content of communications--at least initially. We know under the \nFourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution that law enforcement has to \ndemonstrate probable cause to get access to content of online \ncommunication, but there is a whole host of information that identifies \nemail addresses, Internet Protocol addresses, and the like, that could \nhelp the FBI connect the dots. If we are expecting the FBI to connect \nthe dots in terrorist attacks and prevent other tragedies such as that \nin Orlando, then we ought to give them access to all the dots.\n  I hope this week, as we debate what the appropriate response is to \ndealing with these acts of mass terror, we look at the legislation I \nintroduced last December that would notify the FBI in the event someone \non a watch list attempts to purchase a firearm and then give the FBI a \nchance, if the evidence warrants it, to detain that individual and deny \nthem access to the firearm. Moreover, I hope we will also provide\n\n[[Page S3844]]\n\nthe FBI with additional tools in order to identify those radicalized \nAmericans in place who pose a potential threat here on the homeland.\n  Finally, we must do more to counter the venomous ideology pedaled by \nISIS by hitting them in their safe havens abroad. I am still amazed \nwhen the President refers to ISIS as the JV team. Yet ISIS seems to be \nthe best game going for terrorists in the Middle East. Indeed, I \nrecently traveled with members of the Homeland Security Committee in \nthe House to Tunisia. There have been as many as 100 Tunisians who have \ntraveled to Libya and trained with other foreign fighters and then hope \nto make the short jump into Europe via Italy and then potentially \ncommit terrorist attacks there or even travel to the United States. \nMany of those countries are visa waiver countries--38 different \ncountries are visa waiver countries. If you make it into Europe through \na visa waiver country, you can travel to the United States without a \nvisa. That is a potential threat to the United States.\n  We need to deal with ISIS seriously, which means we need a strategy \nto crush ISIS and prevent them from not only killing innocent civilians \nin the Middle East, as we saw when some 400,000 Syrians died in Syria--\nSyria started out as a civil war, but now it appears to be attracting \nterrorists from all across the region. We need to deal with the threat \nof ISIS as a serious national security matter and not just as a law \nenforcement exercise, where we act after the fact to investigate it and \nthen perhaps prosecute people and put them behind bars. There is \nnothing we can do to punish a potential terrorist for taking the lives \nof 49 people in Orlando, especially when they kill themselves in the \nattack. We ought to be about preventing those attacks and not just \nprosecuting the culpable once the attack is over.\n  Earlier today we passed the national defense authorization bill and \ngave our military men and women in uniform the resources they need in \norder to combat this evil outside our borders, but what we need most of \nall in this fight against radical Islamic ideology is leadership from \nthe White House, a strategy, which we are still waiting for, and a \ncommitment to root out and destroy ISIS and its affiliates.\n  I get the sense that the President and his national security team \nfeel like this is something they can contain, but this is not something \nthey can contain. Maybe they can hope to contain the people fighting in \nthe Middle East, but of course we know what has happened there. Maybe \nthey can hope to catch people traveling from the Middle East to the \nUnited States, but it is not 100 percent secure. We know for sure that \nthe preeminent threat here in the homeland is people being radicalized \nin place through social media and obviously being instructed to kill \nAmericans where they live. This group is growing in strength across \nNorth Africa, as I mentioned in places like Libya, which is now a \nfailed state because of the flawed strategy that the administration had \nafter they took out Muammar Qadhafi. It seems as though we learned \nnothing from Iraq or any of our other experiences in the region.\n  Now is the time for coming together to face this enemy that seeks to \nupend our very way of life. This is not the time to downplay the evil \nthat perpetuates this violence, and it is also not the time for show \nvotes on things like gun control.\n  This individual in Orlando, who murdered 49 people and injured so \nmany more, had a firearms license since 2011. He was a licensed \nsecurity guard. He was not on a watch list at the time he committed \nthis horrific act. So passing some legislation dealing with people on \nwatch lists, such as the Senator from California offered last December, \nwould have done nothing to prevent this attack.\n\n  We ought to be about finding a way to come together on a bipartisan \nbasis to make sure this sort of travesty is not repeated over and over \nand over again. The only way we are going to do it is to get serious \nabout giving the FBI the tools they need in order to fight and crush \nISIS and its dangerous ideology where it resides in the Middle East. We \nought to take that opportunity this week. We need to focus on the \nthreat and how to better protect our country.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in other ways, exploring \nother ideas they may have to prevent tragedies like Orlando, San \nBernardino, and Boston from happening in the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        Mass Shooting in Orlando\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise to address the tragic events in \nOrlando, FL. In the early hours of Sunday, a gunman walked into Pulse, \na popular, crowded LGBT nightclub, on Latin night and opened fire, \ntaking the lives of 49 people and wounding 53 more in an act of terror \nthat has been called the worst mass shooting in American history. It \nwas also the deadliest attack on the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and \ntransgender community that our Nation has ever known.\n  State and Federal authorities are continuing their investigation into \nthe assailant and what his motives were that night. I believe 44 of the \nsurnames of those who died were Latino. According to the FBI, the \nshooter had previously been investigated for potential ties to \nterrorist organizations, and during the attack, the shooter called \nauthorities and pledged his allegiance to ISIL.\n  We must do everything in our power to eradicate this evil, combat \nrecruitment and radicalization, and we must make sure our efforts and \nour rhetoric do not scapegoat an entire community based on the actions \nof a single sick individual.\n  The investigation is ongoing, and many details are still emerging, \nbut we know this: The 49 men and women who lost their lives on Sunday \nnight were murdered by a man with hate in his heart--perhaps even hate \ndirected within--and an assault weapon in his hand.\n  Following each and every tragic shooting, one thought haunts me, and \nthat is that we in Congress are failing the American people. We have \nfailed to answer their repeated calls to address gun violence in this \ncountry. We have failed to take steps necessary to make our communities \nsafer, and as a result we are complicit in creating the circumstances \nthat give rise to these events. We can't pretend this part isn't on us.\n  Our State of Minnesota has a proud tradition of responsible gun \nownership. Generations of Minnesotans have learned to hunt from their \nparents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, friends and neighbors, but \nwhen I speak to constituents on this issue, the message is clear: \nMinnesotans want Congress to take commonsense steps to reduce gun \nviolence and ensure their family's safety. There is a balance to be \nstruck here, and I strongly believe that we are capable of striking \nthat balance.\n\n  The Second Amendment doesn't protect the rights of everyone to carry \nwhatever weapon he likes in any place he wishes for whatever purpose he \nwants. The Second Amendment does not entitle criminals, potential \nterrorists, or people with serious mental illness to carry guns. It \ndoes not entitle Americans to own guns designed to slaughter scores of \npeople in seconds.\n  We can't turn back time. We can't bring back the lives we have lost. \nBut, for God's sake, what is it going to take? How many tragedies like \nthis does this Nation have to endure before we find the moral \nconviction to do something about gun violence?\n  It is important for us to acknowledge not just how this atrocity was \ncommitted but who the gunman targeted, and where. In his remarks on \nSunday, President Obama rightly drew the Nation's attention to the site \nof this most recent tragedy--to Pulse, a gay nightclub that Barbara \nPoma opened to honor the memory of her brother John, whom she lost to \nAIDS years earlier. Barbara explained that her family was strict and \nhad a strong sense of tradition. Being gay was frowned upon. Coming out \ncould not have been easy for John, but when he did, his family welcomed \nhim with acceptance and love. Pulse was named for John's heartbeat, and \nit was a place, according to his sister, where he was ``kept alive in \nthe eyes of his friends and his family.''\n  In describing the shooting, President Obama explained that ``the \nplace where they were attacked is more than a nightclub--it is a place \nof solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise \nawareness, to speak their minds, and to advocate for their civil \nrights.'' But it is also important to note that, like so many of the \nbars and nightclubs serving the LGBT community, Pulse was a place where \npeople have come together to feel safe. Like the historic Stonewall Inn \nin New York City, the birthplace of the gay rights movement, and Bar \n19, a pub in Loring Park that has served Minneapolis's gay community \nsince 1952, Pulse was a sanctuary.\n  Not everyone is welcomed by their family and their friends with \nacceptance and love. Even today, not everyone is able to walk down the \nstreet holding the hand of their loved one without fear. For those in \nsearch of solidarity in their communities, and for those in search of \nsafety, Pulse provided refuge. Regrettably, even today, that refuge is \nsorely needed. Despite long overdue victories, leaders in the LGBT \nmovement have perceived an increase in violence directed against their \ncommunity. LGBT Americans continue to face threats, intimidation, and \nviolence--on the street, in the workplace, and at school. By and large, \nthey remain vulnerable to discrimination.\n  As Americans come together in the days and weeks ahead, as we seek \ncomfort and community at pride celebrations and candlelight vigils, it \nis incumbent upon all of us, but most especially policymakers, to do \neverything in our power to change the culture of hate and to pursue a \nmore equal union. It is simply unacceptable that in 28 States, \nincluding Florida, there are no protections to prevent a survivor of \nthe Orlando attack from being fired just because he is gay. In 28 \nStates, including Florida, there are no protections to prohibit a \nhomeless shelter from turning away a survivor of the Orlando attack \nbecause she is a lesbian. In 29 States, including Florida, there are no \nprotections to prevent a business from refusing service to a survivor \nof the Orlando attack because she is transgender. That isn't right. \nThis is not who we are as a country, and it must change.\n  Congress must take up and pass the Student Non-Discrimination Act to \nprotect our children--our children--in our schools. And Congress must \ntake up and pass the Equality Act to make clear that discrimination and \nhate have no place in our workplaces and in our homes.\n  I was around 10 years old at the height of the civil rights movement. \nMy family used to eat dinner watching TV on plates on tray tables, and \nwe would watch the news. And I remember seeing footage of police in the \nSouth siccing dogs on Black civil rights demonstrators, going after \nthem with firehoses and billy clubs. I never will forget my dad \npointing at our television screen and saying to me and my brother, ``No \nJew can be for that.'' No Jew can be for that. It was obvious to him, \nas it should be to all of us, that when some members of our communities \nface injustice, we all do.\n  In the face of that pervasive discrimination, that stain on our \nvalues and our history, our Nation recognized then, as it should \nrecognize now, that\n\n[[Page S3846]]\n\nsome problems demand a national solution. We must take action to make \nour communities safe--all of our communities safe. We must engage in \nthese difficult conversations about persistent inequality and about gun \nviolence. And we must dedicate ourselves to securing real change.\n  I implore my colleagues: Let us make our laws our sanctuaries. Let us \nhonor the memory of those lost on Sunday and the lives of those who \nsurvived by recognizing our obligation to take action. No Member of \nCongress can be for this.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I rise today to remember the victims of \nthe terrorist attack in Orlando, FL. Forty-nine people were killed and \neven more were wounded when a self-proclaimed ISIS sympathizer attacked \nPulse nightclub in the early hours of Sunday morning. I can't imagine \nthe trauma experienced by those who were present in the club or the \nsuffering of the families now mourning a beloved son or daughter.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with the victims, with the families of \nthe deceased, and with all those currently sitting at the hospital beds \nof the injured. My thoughts and prayers are also with the people of \nOrlando, whose sense of security has been shattered by this deadly \nattack.\n  Every deadly ideology of the last century has been characterized by a \nfundamental disregard for the sacredness of human life. The form of \nradical Islam espoused by ISIS and its adherents is no different. Like \nevery radical ideology before it, it regards individual human beings as \nexpendable commodities in its pursuit of a Utopia. More than that, it \nsees certain individuals as not only expendable but dangerous, and it \nseeks to exterminate them accordingly. The blood-soaked villages of \nISIS-controlled Iraq and Syria bear terrible witness to the slaughter \nof Christians, Yazidis, moderate Muslims, and anyone else ISIS felt was \nstanding in its way.\n  As a nation, we have to stand against the threat of terrorism. We \nhave to ensure that our military is equipped to destroy terrorist \norganizations abroad and that our law enforcement personnel are \nequipped to confront terrorist threats here at home. We need to control \nour borders and modernize our immigration system so that we know who is \ncoming and who is going from our Nation. We need to invest in our \nintelligence agencies and hold them accountable as they work to keep \nour homeland safe. We have to support our allies who are taking the \nfight to the terrorists. And most of all, we have to show the utter \nbankruptcy of an ideology that regards human beings as expendable.\n  America has a proud history of standing up for the dignity and \nfreedom of the human person against tyrants of all stripes. We stood \nagainst the deadly ideologies of the 20th century, and we will stand \nagainst the deadly ideologies of the 21st century.\n  On Sunday morning we saw the darkest side of humanity, but, as so \noften happens, when we see the worst in human beings, we also see the \nbest--the DJ who helped a patron escape from the club; the man who \nstuffed his bandana into a bullet hole on a stranger's back to stop the \nbleeding; the man who pulled a wounded stranger to safety behind a car \nand then kept him conscious on the way to the hospital; the long lines \nof Orlando residents who came forward to donate blood; and, of course, \nthe police officers who walked into that club and who wake up every day \nready to lay down their lives for the rest of us. Against that spirit, \nterrorism will never prevail.\n  Our whole Nation grieves with the citizens of Orlando. May God bless \nand comfort the families of all those who died, and may He heal all \nthose whose hearts are broken.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/14/senate-section/article/S3845-1"}, {"day": "14", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3846-S3849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF GEORGE V. VOINOVICH\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I am joined by my colleague and friend, \nSenator Rob Portman of Ohio--the other Senator from Ohio--to discuss \nthe passing of a dear friend of his and of mine. I will make a few \nshort remarks.\n  I believe Senator Portman, who will be speaking at his memorial \nservice later in the week in Cleveland will be offering a resolution \nand some comments to the resolution.\n  This past weekend we were awakened on Sunday to learn that the State \nof Ohio and the city of Cleveland had lost one of its champions, George \nVoinovich.\n  As mayor of my beloved city--the city I call home--Cleveland, as a \ntwo-term Governor of Ohio, and as my colleague for my first 4 years in \nthe Senate before Senator Portman succeeded him, George dedicated his \nlife to public service.\n  A man of strong conviction, he was always willing to listen to the \nother side of an argument and to put what he believed was best for our \nState and for our country ahead of partisan politics. Of course, we \ndidn't always agree, but we worked together in the Senate to make \nprogress for Ohio on everything from judicial nominees to supporting \nour manufacturing industry to cleaning up our great lake, Lake Erie.\n  When I came to the Senate in 2007, we assembled a commission of \ndistinguished Ohio lawyers of both parties to find the candidates--\nagain, of both parties--to recommend as nominees for the Federal \njudiciary. I thank Senator Portman. Actually, this began with Senator \nDeWine and Senator Voinovich, and it has now continued from their \nservice with Senator Portman and me doing the same thing.\n  George had a lifelong love affair with what he called the ``jewel of \nthe Great Lakes,'' Lake Erie. His fight to clean up and protect our \nlake began when he joined the Ohio Legislature almost exactly 50 years \nago. At that time, people wrote off Lake Erie as a polluted, dying \nlake. Over the past century, people have had a habit of trying to write \noff Ohio. Like all of our State's champions, George wouldn't accept \nthat.\n  As my colleagues know, there is an enormous painting on the stairway \noutside the Senate Chamber depicting the American victory in the Battle \nof Lake Erie. George fought what he referred to as the ``second battle \nof Lake Erie,'' pushing for the first Great Lakes Water Quality \nAgreement, cochairing the Senate's Great Lakes Task Force, working with \nme to introduce the Clean Water Affordability Act, which I continued to \nwork on since his retirement in December of 2010.\n  That tenacity paid off. Our lake has made an incredible comeback. We \nstill have work to do every summer. We have to deal with the return of \ntoxic algal blooms. Senator Portman and I have worked on that issue in \nthe western basin of Lake Erie near Toledo.\n  But because of the work and investment by people such as George, he \nwas able to catch yellow perch not far from his own backyard in \nCollinwood, a section on the lake on the east side of Cleveland.\n  It will be up to all of us who love Lake Erie and understand how \nvital it is to our State to continue that work for our Great Lake.\n  George was the son of Serbian and Slovenian immigrants, and he \nunderstood the importance of investing in our Nation and investing in \npublic works that create jobs and power our communities and our \neconomy. In retirement, George Voinovich continued to push for ways to \nfinance our Nation's infrastructure. Just this year he reached out to \nhis friend, Senator Carper of Delaware, and to me about the need for \ndedicated public works funding.\n  He was willing to reach across the aisle to work with us on projects \nsuch\n\n[[Page S3847]]\n\nas the Brent Spence Bridge, which we still need to rebuild, and loan \nguarantees and tax incentives for Ohio's manufacturers and small \nbusinesses.\n  He was a deeply religious man. He was guided by his faith through \nnearly half a century in public service. That faith sustained him \nthrough the worst tragedy that any parent can imagine, when his 9-year-\nold daughter Molly was killed during George Voinovich's first campaign \nfor mayor of Cleveland. He said of that experience later:\n\n       When one loses a child, things come into focus, what is \n     important, what is unimportant. You see more. You feel more. \n     You experience more. We all take so much for granted.\n\n  I hope we will take George's passing as an opportunity to reflect on \nwhat we take for granted and what is important to us as a country. On \nbehalf of everyone in this body, I send my deepest condolences to Janet \nVoinovich, to their children, and to everyone touched by George's life \nand, frankly, her life of public service.\n  His legacy will live on through the lasting contributions he made to \nhis beloved Cleveland, to Ohio, and to our great country.\n  I yield to my friend from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I thought those remarks beautifully \ndescribed a great public servant, George Voinovich. I wish to add a \nlittle to it, and then at the end of my remarks, I am actually going to \noffer a resolution for the entire Senate to vote on as a tribute to the \nlife of George Voinovich. We have put together a resolution which talks \nabout a lot of his accomplishments. As my colleague has said very well, \nit gives us an inspiration for the future. From his life, hopefully, we \ncan learn about how to better do our jobs on the floor of the Senate.\n  He was an amazing public servant. As some know, he was not just mayor \nof Cleveland during a critical time but also Governor of Ohio and, of \ncourse, a Senator here for two terms. I believe he represented the very \nbest of public service. By that I mean whether it was his efforts to \ntackle the debt, to give children more choice and parents more choice \nin their schools, or to modernize infrastructure, he never made it \nabout him. It was always about others, and specifically, it was about \nhis constituents.\n  He was a very proud grandson of immigrants, Serbian and Slovenian. He \nwas also the son of a great neighborhood in Cleveland called \nCollinwood, where I was over the weekend visiting with Janet Voinovich. \nHe was raised with the values of that neighborhood--honesty, integrity, \nand hard work. He said that his father used to tell him that in America \nwe have more of the world's bounty than any other country on Earth \nbecause of our freedom, because ``we get more out of our people through \nthe free enterprise system and our education system.'' He never forgot \nthose early lessons. Wherever he went, whatever title he had, he was \nalways that same earnest, plainspoken kid from Collinwood.\n  As a boy, he was diagnosed with a bone marrow disorder, which kept \nhim from enjoying many of childhood's joys, such as sports. He didn't \nlet it get him down. In fact, he brought all his energies into his \nstudies--one reason he was such a good student, I think--and he got \naround Cleveland on his red bike, which he called Bessie, which was his \npride. Later in life, by the way, I had the opportunity to be in \nparades with George Voinovich. I would be marching along, and there he \nwas on his bicycle. I don't know if it was named Bessie, but I know \nJanet Voinovich was at his side, riding that bicycle in parades, and \nthen as Governor Voinovich and then Senator Voinovich. He loved those \nbicycles and was always riding with a smile on his face.\n  That difficult health care struggle he had early in his life shaped \nhis character and gave him a heart for all those who were suffering or \nwho were just different. As with so many of his decisions, he would go \nto the Lord for inspiration. He would start with a humble prayer, and \nhe did this at Collinwood High School. He said he prayed for guidance, \nasking God what he should do with his life. And he got an answer. He \nfelt he had a calling, and that was to get involved in student \ngovernment, and so he ran. He was elected as class president as a \nsenior. He went on to serve as student body president at Ohio \nUniversity, when he was in undergraduate school, and he was president \nof his class and president of the Young Republicans club while in law \nschool at Ohio State University. So if people wonder how he got into \npolitics, it all started in high school and through college and law \nschool. That was the track he chose for himself.\n  For over half a century, he served his neighbors in so many different \nroles--local, State, and Federal. He was a county commissioner in \nCuyahoga County. He was county auditor. He was mayor, as we have talked \nabout. He was a State representative. He was an assistant attorney \ngeneral. He was Lieutenant Governor. He was Governor for two terms, and \nhe was a U.S. Senator for two terms. This is a guy who devoted his life \nto public service.\n  In 1959, as a young man, he volunteered for the mayoral campaign of \nTom Ireland. We don't remember much about Tom Ireland, because Tom \nIreland lost. But in that election, George Voinovich met a young \nwoman--a beautiful and intelligent fellow volunteer named Janet Allan. \nJanet and George were married for more than 50 years. Having just been \nwith her over the weekend, I can tell you she is an extraordinary \nwoman. Their relationship--their partnership--is a real model and \nexample for all of us, and certainly it has been over the years for \nJane and for me. George used to say about Janet that she was ``God's \ngreatest blessing on me,'' and that was clear to anyone who knew them. \nTogether they had four wonderful children: George, Betsy, Peter, and \nMolly.\n  He was Lieutenant Governor in 1978 when his true calling came. I say \n``true calling'' because this was a time of urgency in his hometown of \nCleveland. It was in trouble. That same year, Cleveland had become the \nfirst American city since the Great Depression to default on its debt, \nwhich, by some measures, totaled more than $100 million. That was a lot \nof money back then. People were worried. Some people were leaving the \ncity altogether.\n  From his neighbors and from his conscience, George Voinovich heard \nthe call to come back home. Shortly after he won that Republican \nnomination for mayor, tragedy struck the Voinovich family. George's \nyoungest daughter, Molly, was hit by a car. She was walking home from \nschool when she was 9 years old. It is a tragedy no parent should ever \nhave to endure, but George and Janet endured it, and, turning to their \nfaith, they persevered. They went on to win that election.\n  George says that through that trial, his faith deepened even further \nand his compassion for others grew even stronger. Sherrod Brown just \ntalked about the fact that he said that ``things come into focus when \nyou lose a child.'' I think that is what my colleague said, and that is \nhow George felt. It deepened his faith and brought things into focus.\n  He did win that mayoral election, and he turned Cleveland into ``The \nComeback City.'' It is not an exaggeration, I don't think, to say that \nhe personally saved the city from default in the sense that he had \nincredible energy, infectious optimism that it could happen, sheer \nforce of will, and a great work ethic, and he brought people together.\n  Having talked to some of the city fathers at that time, some of whom \nare still with us, it was George Voinovich's bringing a team together \nthat saved the city of Cleveland. He lifted people's hopes.\n  A decade later it was the entire State of Ohio that needed to be \nturned around. After winning reelection in Cleveland as mayor with two \nlandslide votes, he was elected Governor in another landslide. Ohio was \nfacing a massive debt, just like Cleveland had been, and George came to \nthe rescue again, saying he would get the State government ``working \nharder and smarter, doing more with less.'' Anybody who knew George \nVoinovich knew that was his favorite motto--doing more with less; \nworking harder and smarter; and with God, all things are possible.\n  He did do more with less. He cut taxes by $24 billion to get the \neconomy moving, but he also trimmed government spending by $720 million \nin just 2 years. With his experience as mayor, he wasn't afraid to \ndelve into the details of the budget. He rolled up his sleeves, and he \ngot involved.\n\n[[Page S3848]]\n\n  The only thing he knew better than his budget, by the way, was his \nconstituents. He helped hundreds of thousands of people who were stuck \non welfare to find jobs, as unemployment in Ohio fell to 25-year lows. \nHe also modernized our roads and bridges. He was a big infrastructure \nguy. After a landslide reelection, he left the Buckeye State with \nnearly $1 billion in a rainy-day fund.\n  By the way, when he was mayor, he served as president of the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, and when he was Governor he served as president \nof the National Governors Association--the only person in America to \nhave done that. That is pretty amazing. He rose to the top.\n\n  He loved to fish. Wildlife fishing in Lake Erie was his favorite \nthing. He got me started on that, which I do now every year. He loved \nhis lake. If you go to his home and stay, as I did over the weekend, \nyou know it is a couple of houses from the lake. You can see how proud \nhe was of that lake by the way in which he supported efforts to make it \nclean and make it safe. He was also a strong supporter of our coal \nminers in eastern Ohio. He became the first government executive in the \nworld to recognize the independence of his ancestral homeland of \nSlovenia, something that meant a lot to George. His last speech was on \nFriday night of last week, and it was on the 25th anniversary of \nSlovenia's independence day.\n  George was reelected as Governor in 1994 with 72 percent of the vote. \nAt the time, it was the biggest landslide of any Governor in Ohio \nhistory. After he had reached his term limit as Governor, he was \nelected by another large margin to this Chamber, the Senate. He was \nreelected in 2004 with more votes than any Senate candidate had ever \nreceived in the State of Ohio.\n  In the Senate, he focused on expanding NATO to include Slovenia. He \nauthored a Federal law that helps to monitor and fight anti-Semitism \nall around the world. He passed bipartisan legislation to help protect \nAmerican intellectual property. But if you want to see his biggest \nimpact, go to Ohio. You will see it everywhere--whether it is the \nInnerbelt Bridge, named after him; whether it is the Voinovich \nBicentennial Park in Cleveland; whether it is the Voinovich School of \nLeadership and Public Affairs at his beloved Ohio University in Athens, \nOH; whether it is the Voinovich Atrium at the Rock and Roll Hall of \nFame, which, by the way, some say would not be in Cleveland but for \nGeorge Voinovich's leadership. I just talked last week to the director \nof the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, who happened to be here for a visit, \nand, coincidently, we talked about George Voinovich's role in being \nsure that the financing was put together to have that Rock and Roll \nHall of Fame be in Cleveland, OH.\n  These are all testaments to the love and respect the people of Ohio \nhad and continue to have for him. Above all, talk to those who knew \nhim. He made an impact on all of us. For me, he was a friend, and he \nwas a great mentor over the years. He helped me in my career. He was \nsomeone who gave me a lot of inspiration to get into public service in \nthe first place.\n  In our conversations, by the way, for all of his political successes \nand accomplishments and all we had to talk about that had to do with \npolicy or political issues, he mostly wanted to talk about family. That \nwas where he always started. That was where he was in his heart. He \nwould say: ``How is the family?'' That is how he would start the \nconversation. Janet was his soulmate, his partner in everything, and he \nloved those kids and grandkids so much. They were the anchor for \neverything--family and faith. That is one reason he was so successful, \nin my view. He had grit, he had that work ethic, and he certainly had \nnatural talent, but he also had that foundation. That moral foundation \nof his family and his faith gave him the confidence and the ability to \ndo so many other great things for so many other people.\n  When he announced his retirement, he said: ``I have a philosophy: \nIt's God, family, country, and community.'' Those are pretty good \npriorities. George put himself last. It was never about him. It was \nabout others. He was the public servant. He put the servant part first.\n  He had the heart of a servant because he was a humble man. As some \nknow back home, he was proud of the fact that he drove a Taurus and \nshined his own shoes. He was a penny-pincher. He loved to buy his \nclothes on sale. He was a good fiscal conservative. He and Janet lived \nin the same house they bought in Cleveland in 1972. No matter where he \nwas or what his title was, he was, in many respects, still that same \nkid from Collinwood--George from Collinwood.\n  He was a man of deep faith. He was a devout Catholic, and as busy as \nhe was, he went to mass several times a week. He also took comfort in \npraying the Rosary. The legendary quarterback Bernie Kosar tells the \nstory that George Voinovich prayed the Rosary at Municipal Stadium with \nBernie's mom during the Browns' 1986 double-overtime comeback playoff \nvictory over the New York Jets. Everybody gives Bernie Kosar all the \ncredit for that, but it really was George Voinovich and a Higher Power \nthat intervened.\n  After retirement, he did not slow down. As I said, just this past \nFriday he was at Cleveland City Hall for the 25th anniversary of \nSlovenia's independence. He was also at the Republican headquarters in \ndowntown Cleveland last Thursday to open what we call the ``Voinovich \nLobby'' of that new headquarters. He was also planning to serve as a \ndelegate in next month's Republican National Convention. We were so \nlooking forward to paying tribute to him in many ways at that \nconvention. We still will, but, oh, I wish he were going to be there to \nbe part of it.\n  It has been a great honor to succeed him as U.S. Senator. When he \ndecided to retire, he called me here to Washington. I will never forget \nthe dinner we had together where he said: I am not telling anybody this \nyet, but I am planning to not run again for reelection.\n  I had just helped him with an event in Ohio, and I was strongly \nsupporting him for reelection. But he said he had had it; that it was \ntime for him to go back home. He encouraged me to run. He endorsed me \nthe day I got in. I don't believe I would be here but for the fact that \nhe called me to Washington that day and encouraged me and told me that \nknowing public service was in my heart too, that this was the time to \nstep forward and to help our country. I owe him for so much but most \nimportantly for his model and for the example that he set.\n  He was certainly an independent voice, including on this floor. \nSenators on both sides of the aisle will tell you he was an attentive \nand thoughtful listener. He treated people with respect and dignity. I \nhave talked to some of the staff here this week about George \nVoinovich--some who have been here a while and remember him--and all \nhave the same to say. They cherished his friendship. They felt like he \ncared about them. He had good friends--Senator Shaheen and Senator \nCardin on the other side of the aisle. He had good friends on this side \nof the aisle. He used to refer to Danny Akaka as being ``like a brother \nto me.'' Senator Akaka was a Member from Hawaii on the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  His selfless example of public service, his ability to enact change \non a bipartisan basis does provide a lesson for us right now, and \nreally for all time. I think we can best honor him by carrying on that \ntradition, by figuring out how to solve problems, and that involves \nreaching across the aisle and getting things done. He was a man who \nbelieved we could make a difference here in this place.\n  I see Majority Leader McConnell has now joined us on the floor, and \nhe will tell you that George Voinovich always had the belief that \nthings could be better. He was ultimately an optimist, and his ability \nto figure out how to get to a solution was something all of us can \nlearn from. In Ohio, he was a public servant without equal.\n  Tonight, I would like to offer a resolution honoring his memory. I \nurge all my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of S. Res. 493, which was submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The clerk will report the \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 493) relative to the death of George \n     V. Voinovich, former United States Senator for the State of \n     Ohio.\n\n\n[[Page S3849]]\n\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 493) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before the Senator from Ohio leaves the \nfloor, I had an opportunity to listen to his tribute to our former \ncolleague, Senator Voinovich, and he was indeed a stunningly successful \npublic servant. I mean, just thinking about any Republican getting \nelected mayor of Cleveland, it is hard to imagine such a thing, and \nthen to be so extraordinarily successful at every step in his career.\n  I was privileged to get to know him when he came to the Senate. My \ncolleague from Ohio knew him a lot longer than I did, but I wanted, on \nbehalf of all of us who served with George, to thank the Senator for \nthat extraordinary tribute to his outstanding life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/14/senate-section/article/S3846-1"}, {"day": "14", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, 2 and a half years ago, I chaired a \nhearing of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in which the chief \nexecutives of the two top rocket makers, the United Launch Alliance and \nSpaceX, testified on the need for competition in launching government \nsatellites.\n  Not long after that hearing, Russia began its aggression against \nUkraine. These two issues--the threat against Ukraine and the launch of \nU.S. satellites--intersected because one company is reliant on rocket \nengines made in Russia.\n  Defense appropriations bills since then have included nearly half a \nbillion dollars to build a new, American-made engine to end this \nreliance on Russian engines as quickly as a replacement can be built \nand tested.\n  Defense authorization bills have taken a different approach, by \nputting strict limits on the number of Russian engines that can be \npurchased before the new, American-made rocket will be ready.\n  Our top national security leaders, including the Secretary of \nDefense, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Secretary of \nthe Air Force, have warned that laws that halt access to Russian \nengines will endanger our ability to launch important defense and \nintelligence satellites.\n  To cut-off access to Russian engines would force the Defense \nDepartment to buy rockets that are not cost-competitive with SpaceX \nbecause SpaceX's rockets cannot launch our largest satellites. The cost \nto the American taxpayer would be more than $1.5 billion, and it would \nbe a risk to our national security.\n  As vice chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I \nbelieve these costs and risks are too high. Many of my colleagues agree \nwith this view. The chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator \nMcCain, has a different view. He argued forcefully that we should pass \nstrong laws restricting the use of these engines. We crossed swords \nmany times on the floor of the Senate on this issue. Even though we \nstill do not see eye-to-eye on this issue, the product of this debate \nis better because of it.\n  The Nelson-Gardner amendment provides the Department of Defense with \nsufficient time to develop and test a replacement for the Russian \nrocket engine. The amendment limits the use of Russian engines for \ncompetitive launches to a maximum of 18, allows for a responsible \ntransition to an American-made engine, and, consistent with existing \nlaw, does not impact the use of Russian engines purchased to support \nthe EELV block buy.\n  These provisions increase the pressure on DOD and the United Launch \nAlliance to keep its new rocket R program on-track and push them to \nuse only those Russian engines that are needed to support our national \nsecurity.\n  This amendment protects the American taxpayer by avoiding billions in \nadditional spending on sole-source contracts for more expensive \nrockets. It protects our national security by guaranteeing that there \nwill not be a gap in our ability to launch satellites. And it protects \nour national interests by increasing the pressure to have an American-\nmade replacement engine ready as soon as possible.\n  I would like to thank the Senators who worked tirelessly to see that \nthis amendment was adopted with a strong vote in the U.S. Senate: \nSenators Nelson, Gardner, Bennet, Shelby, Cochran, Donnelly, Sessions, \nand Inhofe deserve great credit for their efforts.\n  I am proud to have worked with them on this issue, and I am pleased \nthat we were able to find a responsible solution that protects our \nnational security and the American taxpayer.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate approved a Defense \nauthorization bill of tremendous scope and containing a number of \nharmful provisions. I was against the decision by the majority leader \nto end debate on this bill after a period of consideration that \nresulted in consideration of only a handful of the over 600 amendments \nfiled. Now, I am disappointed by its passage in the Senate. A bill this \nbig deserves substantial, open, public debate.\n  With less than 2 weeks of debate on legislation that authorizes \nnearly $600 billion, I continue to believe that the Senate was unable \nto properly consider the bill. Not only was more time needed to explore \nand debate this lengthy bill, during the brief period of consideration \nit was given, many on both sides of the aisle, myself included, \ndetermined that the Defense authorization contains an assortment of \nharmful language.\n  This is unfortunate, because the Defense authorization also contains \nprovisions that I support. It authorizes spending to promote our \nnational interests, provides vital resources to our military personnel, \nand reaffirms our commitment to partners abroad. It also furthers our \nmilitary readiness through investment in next-generation technology. It \nis this kind of reasonable content that should be the universal rule \nfor a defense authorization. Regrettably, that is only a portion of \nthis bill.\n  This year's Defense authorization will once again prevent the \nPresident from closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. The \nbill would extend the unnecessary prohibition on constructing \nfacilities within the United States to house Guantanamo detainees, \ncontinue the counterproductive ban on transferring detainees to the \nUnited States for detention and trial, and maintain the onerous \ncertification requirements to transfer detainees to foreign countries. \nRegrettably, the bill also adds several new restrictions, including a \nprovision to bar detainee transfers to any country subject to a travel \nwarning by the State Department. This sweeping prohibition is \nunnecessary and would even include some of America's allies. While this \nyear's bill does contain some modest improvements to current law, the \nDefense authorization once again fails to provide the Obama \nadministration with the flexibility it needs to finally close the \ndetention facility at Guantanamo. With the costs of more than $4 \nmillion per year per detainee to keep the detention facility at \nGuantanamo open, I agree with our retired military leaders who tell us \nthat it is in our national security interest to close the detention \nfacility. Doing so is the morally and fiscally responsible thing to do, \nand I strongly oppose the needless barriers to closing Guantanamo \ncontained in this bill.\n  Also unfortunately, the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, our \nNation's premier transparency law, is directly\n\n[[Page S3850]]\n\nundermined by the Defense authorization. Just yesterday, the House of \nRepresentatives passed the Senate's FOIA Improvement Act, reaffirming \nour commitment to the principle that a government of, by, and for the \npeople cannot be one that is hidden from them. However, just as we are \nabout to bring more sunshine into the halls of power on FOIA's 50th \nanniversary, this Defense authorization bill threatens to cast a long \nand dangerous shadow over our efforts.\n  Without ever consulting the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has \nexclusive jurisdiction over FOIA, the Armed Services Committee included \nprovisions in this bill that cut at the heart of FOIA. One particularly \negregious provision would allow the Department of Defense to withhold \nfrom the public anything ``related to'' military ``tactics, techniques, \nor procedures.'' The terms ``tactic,'' ``technique,'' and ``procedure'' \nare either defined very broadly or not at all. The provision further \nstates that this information can only be withheld if its disclosure \nwould ``risk impairment'' to the Department of Defense's ``effective \noperation'' by ``providing an advantage to an adversary or potential \nadversary.'' But it is entirely unclear what if any limitation this \nlanguage would impose, given that none of the operative terms--\nimpairment, effective operation, advantage, or adversary--are anywhere \ndefined. While the Department of Defense might call those ``terms of \nart,'' it is law and not art that the Congress passes.\n  Given the breadth of this language, this provision amounts to what \ncould be a wholesale carveout for the Department of Defense from our \nNation's transparency and accountability regime. If enacted, this bill \nwould empower the Pentagon to withhold a wealth of information from the \nAmerican public. For example, the Pentagon could withhold the legal \njustifications for drone strikes against U.S. citizens, preventing the \nAmerican people from knowing the legal basis upon which their \ngovernment can employ lethal force against them. It could withhold from \ndisclosure documents memorializing civilian killings by U.S. forces, \ndepriving the American people of knowledge about the human cost of wars \nfought in their name. And if enacted, the Pentagon could withhold \ninformation about sexual assaults in the military, masking the true \nextent of sexual violence against servicemembers who risk their lives \ndefending our country.\n  In short, this bill could effectively drape a shroud of secrecy over \nall five corners of the Pentagon. It would unravel decades of work we \nhave done to make our government more transparent to the American \npeople and threaten the progress we have just made with the FOIA \nImprovement Act. This unprecedented disappearing act from our Nation's \npremier transparency law should have never been considered without a \nfull consultation of the Senate Judiciary Committee. On the eve of \nFOIA's 50th anniversary, I urge all Senators to stand on the side of \nsunshine, not shadows, and oppose these provisions within the Defense \nauthorization.\n  My concerns are not limited to Guantanamo Bay and FOIA. The bill also \nincludes massive changes to our military's procurement and management \nsystems, rolling back reforms that have been in place since Goldwater-\nNichols and putting at risk Federal employees and businesses that sell \nto the Department. These specific sections include the elimination of \nthe office that coordinates major acquisitions, separating development \nof new technology and plans for its long-term sustainment. The changes \nhave been promoted under the guise of saving money and reducing bloated \ncommand structures, when they in fact only confuse an already complex \nprocess and will likely result in needless future waste.\n  I also remain deeply concerned about the impact of the caps on \ngeneral officers to the National Guard. While I was grateful to see \nthat adjutants general and assistant adjutants were exempted, there are \nother joint general officers within the Guard, and I am worried hard \ncaps on the number of general officers will mean that the best man or \nwoman for the job becomes less important than whether the Army or the \nAir Force has space under its respective cap. I am likewise concerned \nthat decoupling the statutory requirement that the Vice Chief of the \nNational Guard Bureau be a lieutenant general--a decoupling that did \nnot occur for the vice of any other member of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff--will force the Army or Air Force to give up a three-star \nposition to someone who statutorily does not report to their service \nsecretary. I am also concerned that by removing the statutory \nrequirement that the commander or deputy commander of U.S. Northern \nCommand be a member of the National Guard, we run the risk of entering \na major national disaster without a leader of the principal Federal \nresponse force having any experience with how the States deal with \ndisasters individually and together.\n  The bill includes a provision, section 1204, which would prohibit \njoint or multilateral exercises and conferences between the Department \nof Defense and the Government of Cuba, even though the Department and \nthe Cubans have worked together on issues related to the security of \nGuantanamo for many years. Senator Flake and I, along with Senators \nCardin and Durbin, proposed some exceptions to this provision in order \nto permit the Department to continue to engage with the Cubans on \nGuantanamo and to cooperate on other security matters, including search \nand rescue and counternarcotics. Unfortunately, Senator Cruz, the \nauthor of section 1204, was unwilling to compromise, and we were not \nable to obtain a vote on our amendment.\n  Perhaps the most predictable flaw of this bill is that it continues \nthe reliance on overseas contingency operations funds to operate the \nDepartment. The original intention of this fund has been routinely \nignored, and it continues be used as a free-for-all spending pool. \nBorrowing to sustain our national defense objectives only increases the \nalready significant burden placed on the working families who are most \nimpacted by this irresponsible practice. We must put in place \nmechanisms to begin responsibly ridding ourselves of the growing debt, \nrather than continuing to employ irresponsible practices that only take \nus farther away from anything resembling a solution.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act provides the Senate with a \nyearly opportunity to responsibly address our security priorities and \nto take care of our men and women in uniform, while bolstering our \noverall military capabilities. However, this year's bill proposes too \nmany damaging provisions far beyond the scope of the Department of \nDefense. Despite the agreeable content found within the bill, the \ndamage that will be caused by many of these measures far outweighs the \nbenefits of approving this authorization. For that reason, I cannot \ngive it my support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/14/senate-section/article/S3849-2"}, {"day": "14", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3850-S3851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION\n\n  Mr. CORKER.

Mr. President, 100 years ago, President Woodrow Wilson \nissued a proclamation which established June 14 as Flag Day, the day \nduring which we commemorate the 1777 adoption of our great Nation's \nflag. In 1949, an act of Congress established National Flag Day. Today \nI wish to recognize and celebrate Flag Day and remember all those who \nhave fought in defense of our flag and everything it symbolizes.\n  The Flag Act of 1777 established that the first flag of the United \nStates would have 13 red and white stripes, as well as 13 white stars \nin a blue field in order to recognize the Thirteen Original Colonies. \nSince then, our flag has grown to include 50 stars which represent all \n50 States in our Union today. The final star, representing the State of \nHawaii, was added in 1960. Since then, our flag has flown proudly \nthroughout the United States and in embassies around the world, \ncelebrating our Nation's history of freedom and liberty. The evolution \nof our flag is representative of our evolution as a nation and how far \nwe have come over the past 239 years.\n  In Maryland, Flag Day is also a day to remember the important \ncontributions made by our State to our Nation's development in the \nearly days of the Union.\n  In the midst of the War of 1812, General Samuel Smith asked Baltimore \nresident Mary Pickersgill to make a flag ``so large that the British \nwill have no difficulty seeing it from a distance.'' That flag, 30 feet \ntall and 42 feet wide, was raised and flown over Fort McHenry during \nthe famous Battle of Baltimore in 1814. Mary Pickersgill's flag also \nbecame the inspiration for the poem written by Francis Scott Key, which \nwould eventually become our country's national anthem.\n  That night, our flag stood as a symbol of the strength of our union \nand the bravery and resilience of those willing to fight for it. Today \nit continues to serve as a reminder of the courage and commitment of \nthose willing to give all in defense of the freedoms granted to every \nAmerican. On this day, we remember not only the history and growth of \nthis Nation, but also the men and women who gave that ultimate \nsacrifice in order to uphold the liberties for which our flag stands.\n  For over two centuries, our flag has meant hope, freedom, and liberty \nto all those who enter this country, and it will continue to uphold \nthis meaning for many years to come. Since 1777, the flag has been a \nreminder to every American of the work and sacrifices made to keep our \nNation great. This Flag Day, it is important to remember everything our \nflag symbolizes. We must reflect on the history of our Nation and the \ngrowth of its unity--from our geographic expansion over time to the \nevolution of our population and the definition of what it means to be \nan American. We must also commemorate the lives of those who have \nserved our Nation and its people in pursuit of the values for which the \nflag--and we--proudly stand.\n  Our banner waves in the name of the freedom of every American, and we \njoin together on this day in order to commemorate every contribution \nwhich has kept that freedom alive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/14/senate-section/article/S3851-1"}, {"day": "14", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3851-S3852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL JAMES F. JACKSON\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I recognize Lt. Gen. James \nF. Jackson upon his retirement from the U.S. Air Force after 38 years \nof military service to our great nation. General Jackson's \ndistinguished military career culminated as Chief of Air Force Reserve \nand Commander, Air Force Reserve Command.\n  General Jackson is a 1978 graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy. He \ncompleted 14 years on Active Duty, including flying tours in Europe and \nthe Pacific before joining the Air Force Reserve in 1992. General \nJackson has held numerous wing leadership and command positions, as \nwell as staff assignments at Eighth Air Force and Headquarters U.S. \nStrategic Command, Headquarters Pacific Air Forces, Headquarters U.S. \nPacific Command, and Headquarters U.S. Air Force. A career instructor \npilot and evaluator, the general is a command pilot with more than \n3,600 hours in the F-4 Phantom II, F-16 Fighting Falcon and KC-135R \nStratotanker.\n  In his role as Chief of Air Force Reserve, Headquarters U.S. Air \nForce, in Washington, DC, General Jackson served as principal adviser \non Reserve matters to the Secretary of the Air Force and Chief of Staff \nof the Air Force. As Commander of the Air Force Reserve Command at \nRobins Air Force Base, General Jackson was responsible for \napproximately 70,000 citizen airmen and all Air Force Reserve units \nworldwide, including 36 wings, 10 standalone groups, and a myriad of \nmission support units located at 54 joint and Active component bases \nand nine Reserve bases and stations.\n  As the Air Force Reserve's chief advocate within the Pentagon and on \nCapitol Hill, General Jackson defended an annual President's budget \nrequest amount for the Air Force Reserve of more than $5 billion, which \nenabled the component to remain ready to support combatant commander \ntaskings as an integral component of the Air Force team. General \nJackson's articulate\n\n[[Page S3852]]\n\nguidance ensured total force solutions were integrated into corporate \nAir Force deliberations on key issues including Air Force core mission \nforce mixes, readiness requirements, and personnel policies.\n  General Jackson championed the modernization needs of the component's \naging inventory of aircraft and equipment that yielded an additional \n$400 million in congressional support for Air Force Reserve \nmodernization requirements via the National Guard and Reserve equipment \naccount. This additional support ensured the mission effectiveness and \nsurvivability of citizen airmen and preserved the Air Force Reserve as \nan interoperable, flexible, and combat-ready force. As a result, \nReservists were reliably called upon during his tenure to conduct \ncombat and humanitarian operations abroad, in addition to supporting \nour homeland with unique capabilities such as aerial spray and \nhurricane hunting.\n  During General Jackson's tenure, Air Force Reservists have mobilized \nin support of 54 named operations and exercises and have conducted \ntotal force, joint, and coalition operations at more than 100 locations \nworldwide. General Jackson's visionary leadership and ceaseless efforts \nhave established the Air Force Reserve as a combat-ready force and an \nessential provider of operational capability, strategic depth, and \nsurge capacity. Ultimately, General Jackson successfully postured \nAmerica's citizen airmen to stand as a hedge against risk, while \nremaining fully ready to support ongoing operations and to respond to \nemerging threats with agility and innovation.\n  Congratulations to General Jackson on the notable conclusion of an \noutstanding military career. On behalf of the people of the great State \nof Georgia and a grateful Nation, I offer my sincere thanks to General \nJackson and his wife, Barbara. I wish them both the very best as they \nembark on this new chapter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/14/senate-section/article/S3851-2"}, {"day": "14", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO COLONEL PAUL W. ``PK'' KIRBY\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, on the occasion of his retirement \nfrom the U.S. Air Force, I recognize Col. Paul W. ``PK'' Kirby for his \nmore than 41 years of dedicated service to our country. In his most \nrecent assignment, he serves as the Vice Commander, Air Force Reserve \nCommand Recruiting Service and Deputy Director of Recruiting, Air Force \nReserve Command, Robins Air Force Base, GA. In this role, he exercises \ncommand and oversight of over 450 military and civilian personnel \nworldwide at over 45 main operating locations and serves as the \nprinciple adviser to the both the commander of recruiting and AFRC \ncommander on all matters relating to recruiting.\n  Colonel Kirby enlisted in the Air Force in May 1973 and served 13 \nyears prior to receiving his commission through the Deserving Airman \nCommissioning Program. Prior to entering recruiting services, Colonel \nKirby served as a key member of the personnel community and served as \nCommander of the 302nd Combat Support Squadron for 36 years on active \nduty, as a civilian and within the Air Force Reserve Command as a \nTraditional Reservist and Air Reserve Technician. During this time, he \ndeveloped and implemented key policies and procedures for Reserve \nOfficer Personnel Management Act, Officer Development, Innovative \nReadiness Training Program, and Centralized Training, thereby enhancing \noverall combat readiness for the command.\n  As Vice Commander of Air Force Reserve Recruiting, Colonel Kirby has \ndeveloped and executed numerous initiatives resulting in the Air Force \nReserve Command, AFRC, exceeding its annual recruiting goal for 8 \nconsecutive years. As the second largest Air Force Major Command, AFRC \nhas been manned at greater than 99 percent for the past 8 consecutive \nyears, reversing a decade-long trend of failing to meet congressionally \nmandated end-strength levels. He is directly responsible for accessing \nmore than 58,000 airmen helping to transform the Air Force Reserve \nrecruiters into the most productive within the Department of Defense.\n  Paul could not have been such a tremendous leader without the love \nand unfailing support of his lovely wife of 39 years, Wanda, and their \nthree children, Jeremy, Rebekah, and Christopher.\n  I join my colleagues in expressing our sincere appreciation to Col. \nPaul W. Kirby for his outstanding service to both the U.S. Air Force \nand our great Nation. We wish him the best as he transitions into \nretirement. Colonel Kirby is a true professional and a credit to \nhimself and the U.S. Air Force Reserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/14/senate-section/article/S3852-1"}, {"day": "14", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO CARRIE WALIA\n\n Mr. KING. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \noutstanding devotion of Carrie Walia, who has worked to preserve \nMaine's rich outdoor heritage throughout her career. Carrie is stepping \ndown from her position as executive director of Loon Echo Land Trust, \nand we recognize her service and thank her for her contribution to the \ngreat State of Maine.\n  In her role as executive director of Loon Echo Land Trust, LELT, Ms. \nWalia has invested deeply in the environmental sustainability of \nMaine's communities, specifically the Sebago Lakes region. That region \nhas long been a renowned outdoor recreation area, attracting outdoor \nenthusiasts of all kinds. From boating to ice fishing, locals and \nvisitors alike enjoy the natural beauty and tremendous resources it has \nto offer. Under Ms. Walia's leadership, LELT has been successful in \npreserving the region's beauty and ensuring its sustainability for \nyears to come.\n  Ms. Walia joined LELT in 2004, while also working for the USDA-\nNatural Resources Conservation Service. Since becoming the executive \ndirector of LELT in 2008, she has spearheaded many conservation efforts \nwith tremendous success. Her accomplishments include doubling LELT's \nconservation lands from 3,300 to 6,600 acres and securing over $5.5 \nmillion in grants for high priority land acquisitions. She leaves LELT \npoised for continued success working on behalf of Maine communities.\n  I would like to join LELT and the people of Maine in recognizing and \nthanking Ms. Walia for her work and dedication to our great State. Her \ngroundbreaking work with LELT has helped to preserve Maine's valuable \nnatural resources and contribute to Maine's status as a leader in \nnature conservation and environmental stewardship. The State of Maine \nowes Ms. Walia immensely for all her hard work, and I wish her all the \nbest in her retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/14/senate-section/article/S3852-2"}, {"day": "14", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3852-S3854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               2016 MILITARY ACADEMY APPOINTEES FROM UTAH\n\n Mr. LEE. Mr. President, one of the great privileges of \nrepresenting my fellow Utahns in the U.S. Senate is the annual \nopportunity to meet the exceptional young men and women from the great \nState of Utah who have answered the call of service by applying to the \nU.S. Air Force Academy, the U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Naval \nAcademy, and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.\n  Under title 10 of the U.S. Code, each year Members of Congress are \nauthorized to nominate a number of young men and women from their \ndistrict or State to attend the country's service academies.

To be admitted, each applicant must meet on his or her own \nmerits the academies' rigorous standards.\n  Well, I have studied the applications of these 14 men and women, and \nI can say, without hesitation or exaggeration, that you would be hard \npressed to find a more accomplished, talented, patriotic group of \nAmerican citizens anywhere. And so I was not surprised to learn that \nall 14 applicants have been accepted and will soon be joining the ranks \nof our Nation's military academies in the summer of 2016.\n  Each of these 14 students is of sound mind and body. This will serve \nthem well in Colorado Springs, West Point, Annapolis, and Kings Point. \nBut to succeed, they will need more than this.\n  The journey on which these young men and women will soon embark \nrequires more than mental and physical aptitude. It demands strong \nmoral character--leadership, courage, honesty, prudence, and self-\ndiscipline--and\n\n[[Page S3853]]\n\nabove all, it calls for a steadfast commitment to service and a love of \ncountry.\n  Today I would like to recognize and congratulate each of these \nimpressive students, all of whom embody, in their own unique way, the \nstandards of excellence on which America's service academies are built.\n  Joseph Stryker Cooke will be attending the U.S. Naval Academy.

I am also pleased to transmit my \nwritten approval, authorization, and determination concerning the \nAgreement, and an unclassified Nuclear Proliferation Assessment \nStatement (NPAS) concerning the proposed Agreement. (In accordance with \nsection 123 of the Act, as amended by Title XII of the Foreign Affairs \nReform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-277), a classified \nannex to the NPAS, prepared by the Secretary of State, in consultation \nwith the Director of National Intelligence, summarizing relevant \nclassified information, will be submitted to the Congress separately.) \nThe joint memorandum submitted to me by the Secretaries of State and \nEnergy and a letter from the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission stating the views of the Commission are also enclosed. An \naddendum to the NPAS containing a comprehensive analysis of Norway's \nexport control system with respect to nuclear-related matters, \nincluding interactions with other countries of proliferation concern \nand the actual or suspected nuclear, dual-use, or missile-related \ntransfers to such countries, pursuant to section 102A(w) of the \nNational Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3024(w)), is being submitted \nseparately by the Director of National Intelligence.\n  The proposed Agreement has been negotiated in accordance with the Act \nand other applicable law. In my judgment, it meets all applicable \nstatutory requirements and will advance the nonproliferation and other \nforeign policy interests of the United States.\n  The proposed Agreement contains all the provisions required by \nsection 123 a. of the Act, and provides a comprehensive framework for \npeaceful nuclear cooperation with Norway based on a mutual commitment \nto nuclear nonproliferation. It would permit the transfer of \nunclassified information, material, equipment (including reactors), and \ncomponents for nuclear research and nuclear power production. Norway \nhas no nuclear power program, and no current plans for establishing \none, but the proposed Agreement would facilitate cooperation on such a \nprogram if Norway's plans change in the future. Norway does have an \nactive nuclear research program and the focus of cooperation under the \nproposed Agreement, as under the previous agreement, is expected to be \nin the area of nuclear research. The proposed Agreement would not \npermit transfers of Restricted Data, sensitive nuclear technology, \nsensitive nuclear facilities or major critical components of such \nfacilities.\n  The proposed Agreement would provide advance, long-term \n(programmatic) consent to Norway for the retransfer for storage or \nreprocessing of irradiated nuclear material (spent fuel) subject to the \nAgreement to France, the United Kingdom, or other countries or \ndestinations as may be agreed upon in writing. The United States has \ngiven similar advance consent to various other partners, including to \nNorway under the previous U.S.-Norway Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation \nAgreement that was in force from 1984 to 2014. The proposed Agreement \nwould give the United States the option to revoke the advance consent \nif it considers that it cannot be continued without a significant \nincrease of the risk of proliferation or without jeopardizing national \nsecurity.\n  The proposed Agreement will have a term of 30 years from the date of \nits entry into force, unless terminated by either party on 1 year's \nadvance written notice. In the event of termination or expiration of \nthe proposed Agreement, key nonproliferation conditions and controls \nwill continue in effect as long as any material, equipment, or \ncomponent subject to the proposed Agreement remains in the territory of \nthe party concerned or under its jurisdiction or control anywhere, or \nuntil such time as the parties agree that such items are no longer \nusable for any nuclear activity relevant from the point of view of \nsafeguards.\n  Norway is a non-nuclear-weapon State party to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Norway has concluded a \nsafeguards agreement and additional protocol with the International \nAtomic Energy Agency. Norway is a party to the Convention on the \nPhysical Protection of Nuclear Material, which establishes \ninternational standards of physical protection for the use, storage, \nand transport of nuclear material. It is also a member of the Nuclear \nSuppliers Group, whose non-legally binding guidelines set forth \nstandards for the responsible export of nuclear commodities for \npeaceful use. A more detailed discussion of Norway's domestic civil \nnuclear activities and its nuclear nonproliferation policies and \npractices is provided in the NPAS and the NPAS classified annex \nsubmitted to the Congress separately.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested \ndepartments and agencies in reviewing the proposed Agreement and have \ndetermined that its performance will promote, and will not constitute \nan unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, \nI have approved the proposed Agreement and authorized its execution and \nurge that the Congress give it favorable consideration.\n  This transmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both \nsections 123 b. and 123 d. of the Act. My Administration is prepared to \nbegin immediately consultations with the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee as provided in \nsection 123 b. Upon completion of the 30 days of continuous session \nreview provided for in section 123 b., the 60 days of continuous \nsession review provided for in section 123 d. shall commence.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, June 14, 2016.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/14/senate-section/article/S3854-2"}, {"day": "14", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3854-S3855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  At 10:05 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 1762.

A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to \n     enact the resilient Federal Forests Act; to the Committee on \n     Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Memorial 1011\n\n       Whereas, national forest lands are the largest single \n     source of water in the United States and, in some regions of \n     the west, contribute nearly 50% of the overall water supply: \n     and\n       Whereas, the unhealthy state of these forests has resulted \n     in catastrophic wildfires that are threatening the \n     reliability, volume and quality of water for tens of millions \n     of Americans; and\n       Whereas, severe drought and record-breaking wildfire \n     seasons have highlighted the need for the implementation of a \n     process that would require and provide for the United States \n     Forest Service to accelerate restoration work in our national \n     forests, which would protect critical headwaters and make \n     forest lands more resilient against prolonged dry conditions, \n     insect infestation and fire; and\n       Whereas, failure to take quick action will result in a \n     continued increase in the frequency and intensity of \n     destructive wildfires, impacting the nation's water resources \n     for decades at considerable cost to stakeholders and United \n     States taxpayers; and\n       Whereas, the customs, cultures and economic well-being of \n     our local communities, as well as important historic and \n     cultural aspects of our local heritage, are being ignored, \n     which adversely affects the lives and jobs of the people of \n     the United States and devastates local and state economies; \n     and\n       Whereas, on June 4, 2015, Representative Bruce Westerman \n     introduced H.R. 2647, the Resilient Federal Forests Act.

Within the recently released Prescott and Apache-\n     Sitgreaves National Forest recommended wildernesses, the \n     United States Forest Service indicates that these areas are \n     simply preliminary administrative recommendations and that \n     further NEPA analyses are necessary. However, in transmittal \n     letters, the United States Forest Service states that ``the \n     Final Environmental Impact Statement for the . . . Forest's \n     Revised Resource Management Plan contains the NEPA analysis \n     necessary to support a legislative proposal.'' This is an \n     egregious lack of transparency.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays:\n       1. That the Congress of the United States act to prohibit \n     federal agencies from recommending and identifying Arizona's \n     public lands as wilderness areas without express \n     congressional consent.\n       2.

L. No. 109-58,\n\n[[Page S3856]]\n\n     as amended by the federal Energy Independence and Security \n     Act of 2007, Pub. L. No. 110-140, the United States has \n     demonstrated its commitment to the long-term policy of \n     increasing the domestic production of clean renewable fuels \n     according to a renewable fuel standard, referred to as the \n     ``RFS''; and\n       Whereas, the RFS is one of the single most successful \n     energy policies in our nation's history; and\n       Whereas, the RFS is a federal policy that requires a \n     minimum percentage of motor fuel sold in our nation to \n     contain renewable fuels; and\n       Whereas, under the RFS, renewable fuels have access to a \n     retail market in the face of a vertically integrated \n     petroleum market; and\n       Whereas, the RFS represents a congressional promise to \n     American biofuels producers, farmers, communities, and \n     investors that the blend levels of the RFS will increase each \n     year; and\n       Whereas, this congressional policy supporting the RFS will \n     continue to build the long-term capacity of the renewable \n     fuels industry and will encourage the development of new \n     types of clean fuels; and\n       Whereas, the RFS helps support over 73,000 jobs in \n     agriculture, biofuels production, and associated businesses \n     in Iowa; and\n       Whereas, the renewable fuels industry in Iowa helps pay $5 \n     billion in wages annually to this state's employment force; \n     and\n       Whereas, renewable fuels create additional markets for Iowa \n     farmers with more than 47 percent of Iowa's corn supply \n     supporting ethanol production: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That the Iowa Senate calls upon the \n     Congress of the United States, the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency, the President of the United \n     States, and this country's future President of the United \n     States and administration, to continue to support the RFS in \n     order to encourage American energy production and to \n     strengthen rural communities; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the Administrator of the \n     United States Environmental Protection Agency, the President \n     and Secretary of the United States Senate, the Speaker and \n     Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, and to \n     the members of Iowa's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-177. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States \n     Congress to designate the Louisiana Highway 8/Louisiana \n     Highway 28 corridor in Louisiana as Future Interstate 14; to \n     the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 90\n\n       Whereas, Interstate 14 (I-14), also known as the ``14th \n     Amendment Highway'', the Gulf-Coast Strategic Highway, and \n     the Central Texas Corridor is a proposed interstate highway \n     from Texas to Georgia; the original conceptual western \n     terminus of the highway was from Natchez, Mississippi, and \n     later from I-49 near Alexandria, Louisiana, extending east \n     through the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, \n     ending at Augusta, Georgia or North Augusta, South Carolina; \n     and\n       Whereas, advocates of the Gulf-Coast Strategic Highway \n     proposed extending I-14 to the I-10 near Fort Stockton and \n     the junction of US 277 and I-10 near Sonora, Texas; and\n       Whereas, the proposal for the 14th Amendment Highway has \n     its origins in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible Transportation \n     Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU); and\n       Whereas, the study and planning of I-14 has continued \n     because of support and interest from both the Congress and \n     the associated state highway departments; and,\n       Whereas, the I-14 corridor provides a national strategic \n     link to numerous major military bases and major Gulf Coast \n     and Atlantic ports used for overseas deployments in six \n     states from Texas to South Carolina; and\n       Whereas, the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) \n     Act, signed by President Obama on December 14, 2015, \n     officially assigned the Future I-14 designation to the US 190 \n     Central Texas Corridor; and\n       Whereas, congressional advocacy for the legislation spiked \n     following the post-logistics controversies; the act included \n     the 14th Amendment Highway and the 3rd Infantry Division \n     Highway; the legislation did not provide funding for either \n     highway; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) \n     currently has no funding identified beyond the Phase II \n     studies to support long-range planning, environmental review \n     or construction which must be initiated at the state or \n     regional level with any further direction from the Congress; \n     and\n       Whereas, the 14th Amendment Highway and the Gulf-Coast \n     Strategic Highway concepts continued through active studies \n     to the present as local and state interest began to surface \n     and support in the Congress, FHWA and, most importantly, in \n     the associated state highway departments, all the key \n     ingredients necessary to successfully justify funding any \n     proposed federal-aid highway project; and\n       Whereas, the FHWA issued its report on the 14th Amendment \n     Highway to the Congress in 2011 and made recommendation for \n     further environmental and feasibility sub-studies; however, \n     little action to fund these studies advanced in Congress \n     after 2011; and\n       Whereas, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) \n     also conducted the US 190/IH-10 Feasibility Study in 2011, \n     which concluded that it was justified to upgrade US 190 to a \n     divided four-lane arterial highway based on current traffic \n     projections to 2040, but that upgrading US 190 to a full \n     freeway through Texas was only justified if the 14th \n     Amendment Highway is actually constructed from Louisiana to \n     Georgia; and\n       Whereas, the Louisiana Department of Transportation and \n     Development (DOTD) has not endorsed designation of ``Future \n     I-14'' in Louisiana as proponents of the Gulf-Coast Strategic \n     Highway presented the LA 8/LA 28 corridor as a conventional \n     four lane highway; and DOTD is pursuing its development of \n     the LA 8/LA 28 corridor, having completed LA 28 between \n     Alexandria and Fort Polk, and having included the relocation \n     of LA 28 south of Alexandria in Priority A of the Statewide \n     Transportation Plan and the section from Archie to Vidalia in \n     Priority B of the Statewide Transportation Plan; and\n       Whereas, the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     recognizes that the designation of the LA 8/LA 28 corridor in \n     Louisiana as Future I-14 is vital as a national strategic \n     link to numerous major military bases and major Gulf Coast \n     and Atlantic ports used for overseas deployments in six \n     states from Texas to South Carolina: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to designate the Louisiana \n     Highway 8/Louisiana Highway 28 corridor in Louisiana as \n     Future Interstate 14; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-178. A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to \n     enact the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Memorial 1008\n\n       Whereas, on April 13, 2015, Representative Bill Shuster \n     introduced H.R. 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection \n     Act; and\n       Whereas, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act protects \n     landowners from intrusive government regulation and ensures \n     the protection of personal property; and\n       Whereas, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act came in \n     response to efforts by the Obama Administration, the United \n     States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the United \n     States Army Corps of Engineers to implement the Clean Water \n     Rule, which vastly expands the federal government's ability \n     to regulate waterways; and\n       Whereas, the final rule became effective on August 28, \n     2015; and\n       Whereas, the final rule is far too broad, allowing the \n     federal government to regulate everything from puddles of \n     rainwater to agricultural irrigation systems; and\n       Whereas, the final rule allows waters that have \n     traditionally been off limits to federal regulation to be \n     subject to the rulemaking process of the EPA and the Clean \n     Water Act; and\n       Whereas, the customs, cultures and economic well-being of \n     our local communities, as well as important historic and \n     cultural aspects of our local heritage, are being ignored, \n     which adversely affects the lives and jobs of the people of \n     the United States and devastates local and state economies; \n     and\n       Whereas, the State of Arizona is one of 27 states that have \n     brought legal challenges against the Clean Water Rule and \n     successfully obtained a nationwide stay barring the rule's \n     enforcement; and\n       Whereas, if passed by Congress, the Regulatory Integrity \n     Protection Act would require the EPA and the United States \n     Army Corps of Engineers to develop a new rule that takes into \n     consideration all public comments received on the matter as \n     well as input received from state and local governments.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays:\n       1. That the Congress of the United States enact the \n     Regulatory Integrity Protection Act.\n       2.

A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Arizona urging the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency to reinstate the previous \n     ozone concentration standard of 75 parts per billion; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Memorial 1007\n\n       Whereas, on October 1, 2015, the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reduced the national \n     ambient air quality standards for ground-level ozone from 75 \n     parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb: and\n       Whereas, the State of Arizona will have great difficulty in \n     implementing this new ozone concentration standard due to \n     factors that are outside of this state's control, including \n     its proximity to California, extreme heat and intense summer \n     sunshine; and\n       Whereas, before the implementation of the new ozone \n     concentration standard, the EPA reported that 358 counties in \n     the nation would violate a standard of 70 ppb based on \n     monitoring data from 2011 through 2013; and\n       Whereas, nonattainment area designations will limit \n     economic and job growth by restricting new and expanded \n     industrial and\n\n[[Page S3857]]\n\n     manufacturing facilities, imposing emission ``offset'' \n     requirements on new and modified major sources of nitrogen \n     oxides and volatile organic compounds emissions, constraining \n     oil and gas extraction and raising electricity prices for \n     industries and consumers; and\n       Whereas, low-income and fixed-income citizens will bear the \n     brunt of higher energy costs and utility bills; and\n       Whereas, air quality continues to improve, and nitrogen \n     oxide emissions are already down to 60% nationwide since \n     1980, which, after adjusting for economic growth, implies a \n     90% reduction in emission rates from the relatively \n     uncontrolled 1990 rates for nitrogen oxide-emitting sources; \n     and\n       Whereas, average ozone concentrations have decreased \n     significantly in both urban and rural areas over the past two \n     decades in response to state and federal emission control \n     programs; and\n       Whereas, instead of giving states enough time to meet the \n     previous ozone concentration standard of 75 ppb through \n     ongoing emission reduction programs, the EPA moved the \n     goalpost by imposing a lower standard; and\n       Whereas, reinstating the previous ozone concentration \n     standard of 75 ppb would provide for continued air quality \n     improvement throughout the nation as emission reduction \n     programs under EPA regulations are implemented.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays:\n       1. That the United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     reinstate the previous ozone concentration standard of 75 \n     ppb.\n       2.

Currently, Southern Arizona is facing a potential \n     economic downfall due to the\n\n[[Page S3859]]\n\n     initial decision made by the United States Postal Service \n     (USPS) Board of Governors to close Cherrybell; and\n       Whereas, more than 1.8 million people and 23,197 businesses \n     use the Cherrybell postal services. According to USPS \n     officials, over 3 million pieces of mail go through \n     Cherrybell each day as it is the 15th largest facility \n     serving the 33rd largest population area in our nation. The \n     processing and sorting operations at Cherrybell that are \n     proposed to be moved to Phoenix affect approximately 280 jobs \n     in Southern Arizona; and\n       Whereas, Southern Arizona, which includes both the Tohono \n     O'odham nation and Pasqua Yaqui tribal lands, encompasses the \n     California and Arizona border at Yuma south to Nogales, \n     across to Douglas and Bisbee in Cochise County and the \n     military installations located at Fort Huachuca and Davis \n     Monthan, depends on the Cherrybell Post office; and\n       Whereas, Southern Arizona is home to many military veterans \n     who depend on the USPS both for timely delivery of medical \n     prescriptions and for employment, as the USPS employs more \n     veterans than any entity other than the United States \n     Department of Defense; and\n       Whereas, in an extensive community survey conducted in \n     2015, 84% of individuals and 86% of businesses reported a \n     noticeable delay in mail delivery due to the partial closure \n     of Cherrybell; and\n       Whereas, Tucson City Council Member Richard Fimbres went on \n     record opposing the closure of Cherrybell and requested that \n     the Council work directly with Tucson's congressional \n     delegation and community members to frame a campaign to \n     protect the vital jobs at Cherrybell; and\n       Whereas, Pima County Recorder F. Ann Rodriguez objects to \n     the closure of Cherrybell and firmly believes that, due to \n     the higher number of voters each year on the permanent early \n     voting list, this change will clearly impact the activities \n     of the state and county elections officials in Arizona and \n     will cause a detrimental impact to voters. The information \n     provided to the public by the USPS is based entirely on \n     economic considerations with no apparent regard for the \n     impact of the change on the fundamental right of all citizens \n     to vote and, in particular, the significant additional \n     detrimental impact to Native American voters in the region; \n     and\n       Whereas, the people of Arizona applaud the efforts of \n     United States Representative Martha McSally and the other \n     members of the Arizona Congressional Delegation, including \n     Representatives Trent Franks, Ann Kirkpatrick, Matt Salmon, \n     Paul Gosar, Ruben Gallego, Kyrsten Sinema and Raul Grijalva, \n     who have asked for more detailed and complete information \n     regarding the proposal Cherrybell closure; and\n       Whereas, thousands of people have written letters and \n     signed online petitions urging the USPS Board of Governors \n     not to close Cherrybell.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the Senate of the State of \n     Arizona, the House of Representatives concurring, prays:\n       1. That the Congress of the United States protest the \n     proposed closing of the Tucson Postal Processing and \n     Distribution Center and take any action necessary to fully \n     restore operations of this vital postal facility.\n       2.

A bill to provide for certain causes of action relating to \ndelays of generic drugs and biosimilar biological products; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in recent months, the high cost of \npharmaceutical products has been front and center in national news, \nsometimes with astonishing examples like the unconscionable price-hike \nby Turing Pharmaceuticals of their drug for patients with HIV from \n$13.50 to $750 per pill overnight.\n  Pharmaceutical companies should be compensated for their important \nwork developing life-saving treatments, but when companies engage in \npredatory practices at the expense of consumers, we must act. That is \nwhy today, I am introducing the Creating and Restoring Equal Access to \nEquivalent Samples, CREATES, Act, bipartisan legislation to end \ninappropriate delay tactics that are used by some brand-name drug \nmanufacturers to block competition from more affordable generic drugs.\n  The first delay tactic addressed by the CREATES Act involves the \nwithholding of drug samples that generic manufacturers need to gain \nregulatory approval. Federal law requires generic competitors to prove \nthat their low-cost alternative is equally safe and effective as the \nbrand-name drug with which they wish to compete. Unfortunately, some \nbrand-name companies are preventing generic manufacturers from \nobtaining the samples they need to make the necessary comparison. This \nsimple delay tactic uses regulatory safeguards as a weapon to block \ncompetition. The FDA has reported receiving more than 100 inquiries \nfrom generic product developers who were unable to access samples of a \nbrand-name drug to compare their generic product.\n  The second delay tactic addressed by the CREATES Act involves the \ndevelopment of shared safety protocols. For some high-risk drugs, \nfederal law requires a generic drug manufacturer to join the brand-name \ndrug manufacturer in a single, shared safety protocol for distribution \nof the drug. Despite this requirement, some brand-name companies are \nrefusing to negotiate a shared safety protocol with potential generic \ncompetitors, again undermining those competitors' ability to gain FDA \napproval for their generic version of the drug.\n  These exclusionary practices thwart competition and deny consumers \nthe benefit of lower drug prices. They also undermine the careful \nbalance created in the Hatch-Waxman Act and the more recent Biologics \nPrice Competition and Innovation Act, which are designed to reward and \nincentivize innovation while ensuring that consumers ultimately benefit \nfrom the entry, after an appropriate time, of generic or biosimilar \nversions of a drug. Innovative companies can and should gain the \nbenefit of their inventions. But when companies artificially extend the \nperiod of those benefits by using dilatory tactics to delay generic \nentry, the\n\n[[Page S3863]]\n\nthoughtful balance of the Hatch-Waxman Act and BPCIA are plainly \nundermined.\n  I share the concerns of Vermonters and Americans across the country \nthat many pharmaceutical products are simply too expensive for \nconsumers. Nearly \\3/4\\ of the public view prescription drug costs as \nunreasonable, and one in four patients say they have not filled a \nprescription because of cost. Parents should not be forced to choose \nbetween putting food on the table and getting their children and \nthemselves the medicine they need. When drug prices are artificially \ninflated, patients suffer, illnesses become protracted, and families, \ngovernment programs, and other payers in the healthcare system \nultimately bear the cost. That is why this legislation is supported by \nconsumer groups, physicians, insurance companies, pharmacists and \nhospitals who all see firsthand the impact of unreasonably high costs \nof some prescription drugs.\n  Earlier this month, Vermont set an example for the Nation when it \npassed into law drug transparency legislation that will require \npharmaceutical companies to justify large increases in their drug \nprices. Here in Washington, the Senate Aging Committee and other \nCommittees have been doing important work to analyze the root causes of \nhigh drug pricing and find practical solutions. Solving this issue will \nrequire nuanced, thoughtful work on all sides to ensure that consumers \nare protected and that pharmaceutical companies that act in good faith \ncan continue to innovate for patients.\n  With the CREATES Act, the bipartisan leaders of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and its Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and \nConsumer Rights are using our roles to address anticompetitive behavior \nthat blocks competition and delays the creation of affordable generic \ndrugs. I thank Senators Grassley, Klobuchar and Lee for joining me in \nthis effort, and for agreeing to hold a hearing on this bill as soon as \nnext week.\n  Drug affordability is a bipartisan issue that impacts each and every \none of us. I hope other Senators will join us in supporting this \nbipartisan legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/14/senate-section/article/S3862-1"}, {"day": "14", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 493--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF GEORGE V.

Mr. President, in a Chamber where the debate on \nclimate change has become woefully one-sided and in a Congress where \nHouse Republicans just voted unanimously to oppose the only climate \nsolution Republicans have come to, I want to use my 140th climate \nspeech to remind us of a time when global warming concerns came from \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  Nearly 30 years ago this week, a Republican chair of the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Subcommittee on Environmental Pollution, \nwho also served twice as Governor of my State and as Secretary of the \nNavy, convened a 2-day, 5-panel hearing on ozone depletion, the \ngreenhouse effect, and climate change. It was June, 1986, and Senator \nJohn Chafee, a Republican of Rhode Island, gave opening remarks warning \nof ``the buildup of greenhouse gases, which threaten to warm the Earth \nto unprecedented levels. Such a warming could, within the next 50 to 75 \nyears, produce enormous changes in a climate that has remained fairly \nstable for thousands of years.''\n  ``[T]here is a very real possibility,'' Senator Chafee went on to \nsay, ``that man--through ignorance or indifference, or both--is \nirreversibly altering the ability of our atmosphere to perform basic \nlife support functions for the planet.''\n  Last weekend, the Washington Post wrote an article recalling this \nhistoric hearing, entitled ``30 years ago scientists warned Congress on \nglobal warming. What they said sounds eerily familiar.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthat article at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Imagine, by the way, a Republican-controlled Senate that would even \nhave a Subcommittee on Environmental Pollution. How things have \nchanged. The present Republican Chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee is the author of ``The Greatest Hoax: How the Global \nWarming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future.'' The contrast is stark \nbetween what Senate Republicans and their hearing witnesses were saying \n30 years ago and what the polluter-funded GOP is saying today.\n  Thirty years ago, Senator Chafee declared:\n\n       This is not a matter of Chicken Little telling us the sky \n     is falling. The scientific evidence . . . is telling us we \n     have a problem; a serious problem.\n\n  According to our current EPW Committee chairman, ``Much of the debate \nover global warming is predicated on fear rather than science.''\n  The depth and sophistication of climate science has done nothing but \nincrease since the Chafee hearings, and the damage from climate change \nis not just a projection; it has started to occur. Scientists are now \nable to connect the dots. Australian researchers, for example, have \ndetermined that the ocean warming that led to widespread and \ndevastating coral bleaching, killing off a significant chunk of the \nGreat Barrier Reef in March, was made 175 times more likely by human-\ncaused climate change. As one researcher put it, ``this is the smoking \ngun.''\n  Sadly, as the scientific consensus about the causes and consequences \nof human-driven climate change has strengthened over 30 years, the \nGOP's trust in science has eroded. They don't appear to even believe \nthe science in their home State universities. All you have to do is go \nlook at your own home State universities' positions on climate and how \nthey are presented. It is right there.\n  But when one looks at how that party is funded and how it has now \nbecome virtually the political wing of the fossil fuel industry, one \ncan understand this sad state of affairs.\n  Three decades ago, Republican Senator Chafee said:\n\n       Scientists have characterized our treatment of the \n     greenhouse effect as a global experiment. It strikes me as a \n     form of planetary Russian roulette.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       By not making policy choices today, by sticking to a ``wait \n     and see'' approach, . . . [b]y allowing these gases to \n     continue to build in the atmosphere, this generation may be \n     committing all of us to severe economic and environmental \n     disruption without ever having decided that the value of \n     ``business as usual'' is worth the risks.\n       Those who believe that these are problems to be dealt with \n     by future generations are misleading themselves. Man's \n     activities to date may have already committed us to some \n     level of temperature change.\n\n  Even with 30 more years of solid science buttressing it, many in the \npresent-day GOP deny that basic understanding and ignore even the home \nState mainstream climate science that underpins it. A few--a very few--\nRepublicans in Congress are now so bold as to accept mainstream, \nestablished science as it is taught in their home State universities, \nas is accepted by all our national science agencies and laboratories, \nand as it is warned of by our military and intelligence services, which \nis a nice step. But none will yet act on that understanding. Even that \ntiny cohort behaves in the face of this known risk--a risk the party \nrecognized 30 years ago--as if it is enough to accept the science and \ndo nothing. All 14 of the House Members who sponsored the House \nResolution on climate change--all 14 of them--just voted with \nExxonMobil and the Koch brothers against a carbon fee. When the whip \ncomes down.\n  Thirty years ago, the Chafee hearing witnesses included the long-time \ndirector of NASA's Goddard Center, Dr. James Hansen; Dr. Michael \nOppenheimer of Princeton; Dr. Robert Watson; and then-Senator Al Gore \nof Tennessee.\n  Dr. Hansen, now one of the leading advocates for immediate and \ndecisive climate action within the science community, educated the \nsubcommittee on the theory underpinning global climate models.\n  Dr. Oppenheimer, a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, talked about the need for immediate--30 years ago--climate \naction. Uncertainty, he told the Senators, was no excuse for inaction.\n  Dr. Watson, who would go on to chair the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change between 1997 and 2002\n\n[[Page S3872]]\n\nsaid: ``It is not wise to experiment on the planet Earth by allowing \nthe concentration of these trace gases to increase without full \nunderstanding the consequences.''\n  Senator Gore agreed with these scientists, testifying that ``there is \nno longer any significant difference of opinion within the scientific \ncommunity about the fact that the greenhouse effect is real and is \nalready occurring.''\n  The current GOP chair of our EPW Committee has mocked Dr. Hansen and \nthe IPCC and Vice President Gore, reserving a particular disdain for \nVice President Gore, who he says is ``drowning in a sea of his own \nglobal warming illusions,'' and ``desperately trying to keep global \nwarming alarmism alive today.''\n  Thirty years ago, the tone of the GOP was much different. Where \nRepublicans today mock the prudential rule, Senator Chafee actually \nadvocated for prudence in environmental policy. He said this:\n\n       The path that society is following today is much like \n     driving a car toward the edge of a cliff. We have a choice. \n     We can go ahead, take no action and drive off the edge--\n     figuring that, since the car will not hit the bottom of the \n     canyon until our generation is already long gone, the problem \n     of coping with what we have made inevitable, is for future \n     generations to deal with. We can hope that they will learn \n     how to adapt. On the other hand, we can put the brakes on \n     now, before the car gets any closer to the edge of the cliff \n     and before we reach a point where momentum will take us over \n     the edge, with or without application of the brakes.\n\n  Present-day Republicans just want to turn up the radio to the tune of \n``Drill, Baby, Drill'' and jam the accelerator to the floor. Our \ncurrent EPW chair has even said: ``CO2 does not cause \ncatastrophic disasters--actually it would be beneficial to our \nenvironment and our economy.''\n  Thirty years ago, Senator Chafee knew there was much yet to learn \nabout climate change. Scientists will agree on the margins that there \nstill is more to learn. But Senator Chafee said then that we have to \nface up to it anyway. I quote him again.\n\n       We don't have all the perfect scientific evidence. There \n     may be gaps here and there. . . . Nonetheless, I think we \n     have got to face up to it. We can't wait for every shred of \n     evidence to come in and be absolutely perfect; I think we \n     ought to start . . . to try and do something about \n     [greenhouse gases], and certainly, to increase the public's \n     awareness of the problem and the feeling, as you say, that it \n     is not hopeless. . . . We can do something.''\n\n  Six and one-half years ago, the United States was preparing to join \nthe gathering of nations in Copenhagen for the 2009 U.N. Climate Change \nConference. When that happened, business leaders took out a full-page \nad in the New York Times calling for passage of U.S. climate \nlegislation, for investment in the clean energy economy, and for \nleadership to inspire the rest of the world to join the fight against \nclimate change. ``[W]e must embrace the challenge today to ensure that \nfuture generations are left with a safe planet and a strong economy.''\n  ``Please don't postpone the earth. If we fail to act now, it is \nscientifically irrefutable that there will be catastrophic and \nirreversible consequences for humanity and our planet.''\n  Well, interestingly, one of the signatories of that advertisement was \nnone other than Donald J. Trump, Chairman and President of The Trump \nOrganization. It is also signed by Eric F. Trump and Ivanka Trump. Even \nthe 2009 version of the man who is now the Republican Party's \npresumptive nominee understood and put his name to the need to act on \nclimate change.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that \nadvertisement be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  Mr. President, what does this individual, now the Republican Party's \npresumptive nominee, want to do? He is proposing to roll back President \nObama's Clean Power Plan and cancel the landmark Paris climate \nagreement. The same guy who signed this advertisement has since labeled \ndecades of research by thousands of honest and honorable climate \nscientists as a ``hoax,'' a ``con job,'' and ``BS,'' to use a more \npolite form of his expression, all the while on his business side he \nwants a seawall to protect his golf resort from ``global warming and \nits effects.''\n  What do actual climate scientists think of the energy policies of the \nRepublican nominee-to-be? Well, in reference to canceling the Paris \nAgreement and undoing the Clean Power Plan, Dr. Paul Higgins, who is \nthe director of the American Meteorological Society's Policy Program \nremarked:\n\n       Undoing these efforts would mean that future emissions of \n     carbon dioxide would be larger and future atmospheric \n     concentrations would be higher. Higher CO2 \n     concentrations would mean larger changes in climate and \n     faster rates of change. Larger and faster changes in climate, \n     in turn, pose greater risk to society.\n\n  Dr. Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for \nAtmospheric Research, said: ``[My] quick reaction is that [his] \ncomments show incredible ignorance with regard to the science and \nglobal affairs.'' Incredible ignorance, that is the party standard.\n  Dr. Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at \nPennsylvania State University--a State that has a GOP Member in the \nSenate--put it bluntly when he said, ``[I]t is not an overstatement to \nsay that [these] climate change views''--of this man--``and policy \nproposals constitute an existential threat to this planet.''\n  Dr. Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at Texas \nTech University--that famous liberal, leftwing university, Texas Tech \nUniversity--has spoken of the potential economic cost of inaction. She \nsaid:\n\n       As the impacts grow ever more evident, severe, and costly, \n     what was obvious to the 195 nations who met in Paris will \n     become obvious to every human on this planet: doing something \n     about climate change is far cheaper than not.\n\n  A quick aside on Dr. Hayhoe's comment, when this becomes ``obvious to \nevery human on this planet,'' what will then be the legacy of the \nRepublican Party? Not a proud one. Indeed, it will be a legacy to run \nfrom. The fossil fuel companies, their trade associations, front \ngroups, and many in the GOP have spent the 30 years since the Chafee \nhearings obstructing responsible climate action despite better \nscientific understanding and growing public support for climate action. \nThe fossil fuel industry has particular blame. They have erected a \nmulti-tentacled, climate-denial apparatus that has deliberately caused \nthat obstruction, and there are plenty of scientists looking at that \nnow.\n  Citizens United is what gave that industry the unprecedented \npolitical weaponry that it has used to accomplish that end. The GOP-\nCitizens United-fossil fuel industry nexus will earn history's \ncondemnation. Let's just hope it is not too late.\n  The Washington Post article asked Dr. Oppenheimer to reflect on the \nintervening 30 years. Dr. Oppenheimer said: This hearing helped bring \nthe concern together, and essentially painted a picture that things are \nkind of spinning out of control, that science is trying to tell us \nsomething, that the world seems to be changing even faster than our \nscientific understanding of the problem, and worst of all, our \npolitical leaders are way behind the eight ball.\n  I knew Senator Chafee. He was a family friend. He may have been my \nfather's best friend. He was an optimist and a pragmatist. He used to \nsay: Given half a chance, nature will rebound and overcome tremendous \nsetbacks, but we must--at the very least--give it that half a chance. \nHe also knew nature's tolerance is not unlimited. At those \ngroundbreaking hearings, Senator Chafee warned:\n\n       It seems that the problems man creates for our planet are \n     never ending. But we have found solutions for prior \n     difficulties, and we will for these as well. What is required \n     is for all of us to do a better job of anticipating and \n     responding to today's new environmental warnings before they \n     become tomorrow's environmental tragedies.\n\n  With those words, I close and yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 11, 2016]\n\n 30 Years Ago Scientists Warned Congress on Global Warming. What They \n                      Said Sounds Eerily Familiar\n\n                           (By Chris Mooney)\n\n       It was such a different time--and yet, the message was so \n     similar.\n       Thirty years ago, on June 10 and 11 of 1986, the U.S. \n     Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works \n     commenced two days of hearings, convened by Sen. John H. \n     Chafee (R-R.I.), on the subject of ``Ozone Depletion, the \n     Greenhouse Effect, and Climate Change.''\n       ``This is not a matter of Chicken Little telling us the sky \n     is falling,'' Chafee said at\n\n[[Page S3873]]\n\n     the hearing. ``The scientific evidence . . . is telling us we \n     have a problem, a serious problem.''\n       The hearings garnered considerable media coverage, \n     including on the front page of The Washington Post (see \n     below).\n       ``There is no longer any significant difference of opinion \n     within the scientific community about the fact that the \n     greenhouse effect is real and already occurring,'' said newly \n     elected Sen. Al Gore, who, as a congressman, had already held \n     several House hearings on the matter. Gore cited the Villach \n     Conference, a scientific meeting held in Austria the previous \n     year (1985), which concluded that ``as a result of the \n     increasing greenhouse gases it is now believed that in the \n     first half of the next century (21st century) a rise of \n     global mean temperature could occur which is greater than in \n     any man's history.''\n       ``They were the breakthrough hearings,'' remembers Rafe \n     Pomerance, then a staffer with the World Resources Institute, \n     who helped suggest witnesses. ``You never saw front-page \n     coverage of this stuff.''\n       The scientists assembled included some of the voices that \n     would be unmistakable and constant in coming decades. They \n     included NASA's James Hansen, who would go on to become the \n     most visible scientist in the world on the topic, and Robert \n     Watson, who would go on to chair the soon-to-be formed United \n     Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n       And what they said was clear: Human greenhouse gas \n     emissions would cause a major warming trend, and sea level \n     rise to boot.\n       Here's how the hearings were covered on the front page of \n     The Post:\n       The New York Times also covered the hearings, writing that \n     ``The rise in carbon dioxide and other gases in the earth's \n     atmosphere will have an earlier and more pronounced impact on \n     global temperature and climate than previously expected, \n     according to evidence presented to a Senate subcommittee \n     today.''\n       Two years later, still more famously, Hansen would testify \n     in another series of hearings that had an even greater public \n     impact when it came to consciousness-raising--in part because \n     at that point, he said that the warming of the globe caused \n     by humans was already detectable. ``It is time to stop \n     waffling so much and say that the evidence is pretty strong \n     that the greenhouse effect is here,'' he said then. In 1986, \n     by contrast, scientists were still mostly predicting the \n     future, rather than saying they had measured and documented a \n     clear warming trend--one that could be clearly distinguished \n     from natural climate variability--and that it was already \n     having demonstrable consequences.\n       ``The 1986 testimony is interesting because it was so \n     similar to my 1988 testimony,'' Hansen recalls. ``I already \n     had, and showed, some of the climate modeling results that \n     formed the basis for my 1988 testimony.''\n       Granted, in some cases the future temperature projections \n     made in the 1986 hearings--based on assumptions about the \n     rate of increase in greenhouse gas emissions and a high \n     sensitivity of the climate to them--suggested temperatures \n     might rise even more, or even faster, than scientists now \n     believe they will. By email, Hansen clarified that we now \n     know the world is closer to one scenario he presented in \n     1986--called Scenario B--than to Scenario A, which assumed a \n     much more rapid rate of greenhouse gas growth, and \n     accordingly, much faster warming.\n       Still, the theoretical understanding was in place for why \n     temperatures would rise as greenhouse gases filled the \n     atmosphere--simply because scientists knew enough physics to \n     know that that's what greenhouse gases do.\n       ``We knew in the '70s what the problem was,'' said George \n     Woodwell, founding director of the Woods Hole Research \n     Center, who also testified in 1986. ``We knew there was a \n     problem with sea level rise, all disruptions of climate. And \n     the disruptions of climate are fundamental in that they \n     undermine all the life on the Earth.''\n       Much of the formal understanding had been affirmed by a \n     1979 report by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, led by \n     the celebrated atmospheric physicist Jule Charney of the \n     Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That group famously \n     assessed that if carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere were \n     to double, the ``most probable global warming'' would amount \n     to 3 degrees Celsius, with a range between 1.5 degrees and \n     4.5 degrees, a number quite similar to modern estimates.\n       ``We have tried but have been unable to find any overlooked \n     or underestimated physical effects that could reduce the \n     currently estimated global warmings due to a doubling of \n     atmospheric CO2 to negligible proportions or \n     reverse them altogether,'' the scientists behind the report \n     wrote.\n       Indeed, the fundamental understanding of the greenhouse \n     effect, and that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas because \n     of its particular properties, dates back to the 19th century, \n     when the Irish scientist John Tyndall conducted experiments \n     to determine the radiative properties of gases.\n       No wonder, then, that there was so much that scientists \n     could say about it in 1986. And indeed, if you look at global \n     temperature trends, it turns out they were speaking at a time \n     when the planet's temperatures were beginning a steady \n     upswing, one that, despite various yearly deviations, would \n     continue inexorably to the present:\n       ``This hearing helped bring the concern together, and \n     essentially painted a picture that things are kind of \n     spinning out of control, that science is trying to tell us \n     something, that the world seems to be changing even faster \n     than our scientific understanding of the problem, and worst \n     of all, our political leaders are way behind the eight \n     ball,'' said Michael Oppenheimer, a Princeton climate \n     scientist who testified that day, and argued that action was \n     warranted on climate change even though not everything was \n     known about its consequences.\n       ``I have to say, reading my own testimony . . . you know, \n     I'd stick by everything in that today, even though it's 30 \n     years later,'' Oppenheimer said.\n       There was an additional context, though, that we're now \n     less conversant with: The hearings were also about the issue \n     of the depletion of the Earth's protective ozone layer by \n     chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. Scientists had recently \n     discovered an ``ozone hole'' over Antarctica that frightened \n     the public, and seemed a definitive indicator of just how \n     much human activities could change the atmosphere.\n       Even today, some still confuse the issue of climate change \n     with that of the depletion of the ozone layer. They are not \n     the same, but they are closely related in that both showed \n     how seemingly small actions by individual humans, or by human \n     industry, could add up to planetary consequences.\n       However, the ozone problem would prove far easier to fix. \n     In 1987, just a year later, the nations of the world adopted \n     the Montreal Protocol, which is today regarded as a major \n     success in environmental protection. Under the treaty, a \n     flexible and adaptable approach was taken to reductions--and \n     regular scientific assessments allowed for course adaptation \n     based on the latest information about how well progress was \n     proceeding. Thus, by 2007, the U.N. Environment Program could \n     declare of the treaty that ``to date, the results of this \n     effort have been nothing less than spectacular.''\n       The contrast with climate change is stark Despite having \n     been alerted by scientists not only in 1986, but also in 1979 \n     and, frankly, even earlier, what happened was not policy \n     action, but rather the beginnings of a long political battle.\n       Even as the formation of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel \n     on Climate Change in 1988, and the global adoption of the \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, signaled \n     steps toward action in the scientific and diplomatic \n     communities, skeptical scientists emerged to challenges the \n     views expressed by Hansen and others, supported by \n     conservative think tanks and sometimes linked to fossil fuel \n     interests. Meanwhile, U.S. politics shifted, as over the \n     1990s and especially the 2000s the climate change issue \n     became polarized and it became rarer to see Republicans, such \n     as Chafee, who were also strong environmentalists and \n     advocates for climate action.\n       ``Thirty years ago we had a Republican senator who was \n     leading the charge on addressing what he said then was a real \n     and serious threat of climate change from the emission of \n     gases from fossil fuel burning,'' says Sen. Sheldon \n     Whitehouse (D-R.I.), recalling the 1986 hearings. ``You can \n     read through all the things that Senator Chafee said back \n     then, and it has all been proven true. It's very \n     disappointing that thirty years later, there is no such voice \n     anywhere in the Republican Senate, and if you look for a \n     micron of daylight between what the fossil fuel industry \n     wants, and what the Republican Party in the Senate does, you \n     won't find it.''\n       It was only in late 2015, in Paris, that the United States \n     helped to negotiate a global agreement to address climate \n     change, one in which each country sets its own pace on \n     reducing emissions. But scientists widely agree that this \n     accord isn't strong enough, on its own terms, to ensure that \n     warming remains below a 2-degree Celsius danger zone.\n       Thirty years after the 1986 hearings, meanwhile, \n     presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said \n     that if elected, he would attempt ``renegotiating'' that \n     agreement.\n       ``Those agreements are one-sided agreements, and they are \n     bad for the United States,'' Trump said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From New York Times advertisement, Dec. 6, 2009]\n\n       Dear President Obama and the United States Congress: \n     Tomorrow leaders from 192 countries will gather at The UN \n     Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen to determine the fate \n     of our planet.\n       As business leaders we are optimistic that President Obama \n     is attending Copenhagen with emissions targets.
