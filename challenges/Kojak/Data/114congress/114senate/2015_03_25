Mr. President, this week, the Senate will pass a \nbalanced budget. It is an important moment for our country. I know a \nlot of Americans are excited to see it finally happen.\n  Our friends across the aisle don't seem to be sharing in the \nenthusiasm, however. Instead, we seem to hear demands for more taxes, \nmore regulations, more overspending--basically, more failed policies of \nthe past.\n  These are odd demands, but in the spirit of budget week, we figured: \nWhy not give our friends what they are asking for? So last night we \noffered them a chance to support President Obama's budget. It drops tax \nafter tax on the American people to the tune of almost $2 trillion. It \npiles on the regulations. It overspends by trillions and trillions, \nnever balancing, ever--never balancing, ever.\n  No wonder a DC newspaper implied it was a manifestation of the left's \n``dream version of Obama.''\n  One would think our friends would have supported this dream budget \noverwhelmingly but, actually, hardly any were brave enough to do so. \nApparently, the President's budget is just so unserious and \nembarrassing that only a single Member of his party could be seen \nsupporting it in public.\n  What a contrast to the balanced budget before us today. It balances \nwithout raising taxes. It acknowledges the obvious truth that \nWashington has a spending problem and takes responsible action to get \nspending under control.\n  It also recognizes the undeniable fact that government programs \ncannot meet their mandate to the vulnerable if left unreformed, and it \nproposes improvements to programs such as Medicaid.\n  This balanced budget aims to make government more efficient, more \neffective, and more accountable. It will go a long way toward getting \nour fiscal house in order.\n  But that is not all this balanced budget is about. It is also about \ngrowing the economy. It is also about raising incomes. It is also about \ncreating jobs. In short, it is about promoting an economy that works \nbetter for the middle class of today and that leaves a more prosperous \nfuture for the middle class of tomorrow.\n  One way to do that is by embracing the energy revolution by lifting \nbarriers to responsible energy development, just as this budget \nproposes. Another way is by replacing our outdated and ineffective Tax \nCode with one that is simple and effective. So this budget proposes to \nrepeal unfair taxes, such as those in ObamaCare, and then sets the \ntable for comprehensive tax reform instead.\n  Ideas such as these are just common sense. No wonder the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office says that our balanced budget would \naccelerate economic growth.\n  The truth is middle-class Americans have seen a lot of unfairness out \nof Washington during the Obama years. The middle class has had to play \nby one set of rules and make tough choices while a big-spending Obama \nadministration got to play by its own rules.\n  It is time for that inequality to come to an end. It is time for \nWashington to make tough choices and balance its own budget just as the \nmiddle class has to.\n  Now is the time for Washington to move beyond failed ideas of the \npast, as we saw in the White House's leftwing dream budget, and support \na balanced budget instead--one that is focused on boosting the economy, \ncreating jobs, and raising wages.\n  That balanced budget is before us right now. I am calling on every \nSenator to support it, including our friends on the other side. We know \nthey don't have a budget proposal of their own. We know they are too \nembarrassed to support the President's budget. So why not show their \nsupport for the middle class by voting for this balanced budget \nproposal.\n\n[[Page S1834]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/25/senate-section/article/S1834-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to give those within the sound of my \nvoice a very brief tutorial on how serious the Republicans are about \nbalancing the budget.\n  I led a trip to South America. We had 10 or 12 Senators, equally \ndivided between Democrats and Republicans. It was a wonderful trip. I \nchose purposely Kent Conrad, who was the No. 1 person on the Democratic \nside of the aisle at the time on numbers, and I also decided to see if \nJudd Gregg, who was the Republican's No. 1 person on numbers, could go. \nThese two good men sat together that whole trip, hour after hour. They \nhad their yellow tablets, and they were doing what they loved to do--\nplay around with numbers.\n  When the trip ended, they had an idea. They were both experienced \nlegislators. They had been here when we did something that hadn't been \ndone before. We had military bases in America going back to World War I \nthat should have been closed, but we couldn't do it because of the \npolitics of the Senate. But we decided long ago to try something \ndifferent. We appointed a commission, they would report back to the \nSenate and the House, and they would make a decision as to which bases \nshould be closed--no filibuster, no tricky procedural rules; yes or no \non what they recommended. We did two rounds of base closings and we \nclosed scores of bases, saving the country billions of dollars.\n  Conrad and Judd decided to do the same thing with this deficit we \nhave. They drafted legislation based on the base closing commission \nlegislation, and they brought it before the Senate. It had a like \nnumber of Democrats and Republicans supporting this Conrad-Gregg \nlegislation. We had seven Republican cosponsors. Even the Republican \nleader today, at that time didn't cosponsor it, but he said he liked \nit. He said publicly that he liked it. In fact, he said: ``This \nproposal is our best hope for addressing the out-of-control spending \nand debt levels that are threatening our Nation's fiscal future.''\n  What a tremendous idea. I was so happy to have had something to do \nwith setting this program up.\n  But look at what happened. Seven of those Republicans who cosponsored \nthe legislation voted against proceeding to it. We couldn't even get on \nthe bill because the Republicans ran away from it. They ran away from \ndoing something about the deficit. Why? Ask them. I have ideas, but \nthat is the way it is. Even my friend, the now Republican leader, voted \nagainst it. It failed by 7 votes--7 votes of the Republicans who \ncosponsored it but who no longer voted for it.\n  So, based upon that, we were in a quandary. What should we do? So a \nnumber of us, Democrats and Republicans, asked President Obama if he \ncould do something with a commission of his own. Now, it wouldn't be as \ngood as what we had tried because that was pretty specific--to bring it \nback for an up-or-down vote.\n  So the President did what was the right thing to do. He found two \nstunningly good people who are good with money, good with numbers, \nincluding the former Senator from the State of Wyoming, who is such a \ngreat guy, Senator Simpson. He is just a fine man with a great sense of \nhumor, and he knew his numbers. Senator Simpson teamed with Erskine \nBowles, who had been the President's Chief of Staff. They set up the \nBowles-Simpson Commission. It was terrific. It gave us some hope that \nmaybe something could be done. They had long hearings. It was really \ngood. The hearings included people from the private sector and from the \nHouse and the Senate--Democrats and Republicans.\n  Now, even before that, when the Conrad-Judd effort failed, we thought \nthat we had some hope. Once again, the Republicans on the Bowles-\nSimpson Commission walked away from it. It really is unfortunate, but \nthat is what happened. It was quite interesting. People who had been \ncriticized over the years for being too liberal, big spenders--someone \nsuch as Dick Durbin from Illinois--voted for the Bowles-Simpson \nCommission. It took a lot of courage for him to do that, but he did. \nBut Republicans who we thought would have been for it voted against it, \nand it failed.\n  Then, Senator Biden, because of his close relationship having served \nin the Senate for 36 years, got with some Republicans, and they made a \nrun at it. There were all kinds of press that they were making \nprogress. What happened? The Republicans took a hike. They broke up the \nmeeting, wouldn't go any further, and that ended that.\n  So then, we had one last attempt. I worked hard on this. Others \nworked hard on this. It passed. It passed the Congress. We set up a \nsupercommittee: the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. The \ncommittee had an equal number of Democrats and Republicans--six of \neach. What happened? The Republicans, once again, walked away from it.\n  So all of this happy talk I heard this morning and I am going to hear \nover this week and over the next couple of days about this great budget \nthe Republicans have is an absolute farce. Pundits have written \naccordingly. Talk about a balanced budget--they have revenue coming in. \nOne example--of course, Republicans want to repeal ObamaCare, but they \nwant to use the revenue coming from ObamaCare for this fake budget of \ntheirs.\n  Any time the Republicans are asked to close tax breaks for companies \nshipping jobs overseas--no--but they are happy to cut Social Security, \nMedicare, and of course, never focus on middle class priorities. They \nuse the words, but it is just a joke. They want a loophole for wealthy \nhedge fund managers. They want unlimited tax breaks for the oil and gas \nindustry. In this budget, they have not asked millionaires and \nbillionaires to pay one extra penny.\n\n  So all this talk about this great budget we have is an absolute \nfarce. There are editorials all over the country. I read a number of \nthem yesterday, what they say about this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/25/senate-section/article/S1834-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1834-S1835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ANTIQUITIES ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know people are anxious to go to work on \nother things, but I want to talk about something called the Antiquities \nAct. It passed in 1906. President Theodore Roosevelt was the President \nat the time. Congress wanted to give him the authority to designate \nspecial lands and cultural resources as national monuments, and he did \nthat. Since then, 16 Presidents--8 Democrats and 8 Republicans--have \nused this 1906 act to protect America's treasures.\n  For example, way back in 1922, President Harding used the Antiquities \nAct to protect the Lehman Caves. It is now a beautiful facility. I have \nbeen down there. They are certainly not the deepest or the biggest \ncaves in the world, but they are unique and good, and we have enjoyed \nthem in Nevada. That was the basis for the 1986 legislation I initiated \nto create a national park in Nevada. The only national park we have in \nNevada is the result of the 1922 action of President Harding. That is \nwhy we have Great Basin National Park. It is a wonderful facility. It \nhas a glacier, the oldest living things in the world, the bristlecone \npines. It is a great park, and people from all over the world visit \nthis wonderful facility. So Nevada's lone national park exists today \nbecause President Harding used the Antiquities Act to first designate \nthe Lehman Caves.\n  Some Members of Congress--frankly, it is a minority--believe we \nshould repeal or gut this bill. They advocate weakening the \nPresidential authority that in the past has protected the Grand Canyon \nand even the Statue of Liberty. Who in this body thinks America has \nsuffered because Presidents in the past have protected the Petrified \nForest in Arizona, the Craters of the Moon in Idaho, and Capitol Reef, \nBryce Canyon, and Arches in Utah? I have been to all of them, and even \nthough Utah is an extremely conservative State, I have not heard one \nsingle Member of Congress or governmental authority say they were a \nhuge mistake. They draw millions of visitors to the State of Utah with \nthe beautiful lands they have there. What about Muir Woods in \nCalifornia? It is just stunningly important, and it came about as a \nresult of a President designating them a national treasure under the \nAntiquities Act.\n\n[[Page S1835]]\n\n  Sixteen Presidents--eight of each party--have used this act to \nprotect America's treasures.\n  I am proud of what President Obama has been able to accomplish \nthrough the work he has done under the Antiquities Act. He has moved \nwhere Congress has failed to act.\n  Caesar Chavez and the Chicano labor movement were honored by creating \nthe Caesar Chavez National Monument in California.\n  He protected Fort Monroe in Virginia in recognition of its storied \nhistory in defense of our Nation and the struggle for freedom for \nAfrican Americans. It is a beautiful facility.\n  We have in Honolulu the Honouliuli National Monument to remember the \nterrible internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.\n  Last month, President Obama protected by proclamation Pullman \nNational Monument, which celebrates the history of the African-American \nlabor movement in America.\n  As a westerner, I appreciate what he has done to protect America's \nbeautiful landscapes, such as the Rio Grande Del Norte and the Organ \nMountains-Desert Peaks National Monuments in New Mexico, the Browns \nCanyon National Monument in Colorado, and western landscapes in \nCalifornia, Washington, and Hawaii.\n  This is something which is so important to be done, so I am \ndisappointed that I hear that on the budget bill there is going to be \nan effort made to cut the Antiquities Act. I hope not. I absolutely \nwill do everything I can to protect this act. It has been in law since \n1906 and has been used by 16 Presidents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/25/senate-section/article/S1835-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 10:30 \na.m. will be equally divided and controlled by the two managers or \ntheir designees.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to thank Chairman Enzi \nfor his courtesy in allowing me to take a few minutes to discuss a \nbipartisan amendment I will be offering on this bill. It deals with \nwhat I think is going to be an enormous challenge this summer for the \nWest, and that is dealing with this wildfire challenge and the prospect \nthat we could literally have enormous fires--what could be virtually \ninfernos--throughout the West this summer.\n  I make that judgment because recently when I was home, I got a \nbriefing. For example, in Medford, OR, they told me it was the driest \nit had been for 25 years. In Medford, when you get an update on the \nfires--and, colleagues, it is worth noting that nobody used to have a \nfire briefing in March. That is just unheard of. We have fire briefings \nwell into the summer. But fires are getting to be a year-round \noccurrence. I was there in March, and the fire experts said it is going \nto be very dry. When you look southward to California, all you see is \ndry, dry, dry.\n  The fact is that as it gets drier and as it gets hotter on the forest \nfloor, should lightning strike, which is very common in rural America, \nall of a sudden you can have an inferno on your hands and one that \nreally knows no boundaries and can affect private property owners, \nState lands, and Federal lands. We had an important hearing in the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee the other day on the sportsmen's \nbill. It looked as if there were a lot of good ideas in the bipartisan \nbill, but it will be pretty hard to go hunting and fishing in the \nforests this summer if the forests are burning up.\n  So what a bipartisan group of us from the West want to do--and I \nparticularly commend our colleague Senator Crapo of Idaho. He and I \nhave teamed up on this effort. We have a large bipartisan coalition of \nSenators who have joined us. We want to fix the broken system of \nfighting wildfire in America.\n  What happens today, colleagues, is that the accounts for prevention \nget short shrift. In effect, the work that needs to be done with the \nsmaller trees and thinning out the underbrush doesn't get the funding \nthat is needed, so what happens is, as a result of the lack of \nprevention, you have these bigger fires and you have to put them out. \nThe accounts for dealing with fire suppression are also short of money, \nso what happens at that point is the agencies borrow from the \nprevention fund to put the fire out, and the problem just gets worse \nand worse.\n  So what Senator Crapo and I, with, as I have indicated, a large \nbipartisan coalition of Senators, are seeking to do is to end that kind \nof fire borrowing. What we are proposing is that the biggest fires--\nperhaps the 1 percent of the fires that really turn into infernos--you \nwould fight those from the disaster fund because they are, in fact, \ndisasters.\n  We have received an analysis from the budget officials indicating \nthat this would really be a wash from a budgeting standpoint because, \nin effect, while you do spend a bit of money from the disaster fund \nputting out these infernos, you also generate some real savings from \nthe prevention fund by not having as many fires in the first place.\n  What our bipartisan amendment will do is give the Departments of \nAgriculture and Interior the opportunity to access the disaster fund \nfor that 1 percent of the fires that can really break a community \napart. It seems to me that Americans across the country who live in \ncommunities where there are these fires deserve to know their homes and \nlives are not going to be threatened needlessly. That is what we will \nbe able to prevent with this bipartisan amendment.\n  Freeing up the Forest Service funds that our proposal will do will \nensure that the natural resources agencies have the resources they need \nto improve forest health and fund the very preventive work that is \nneeded to reduce the size and severity of future fires.\n  We are going to be joined in this amendment. As I have indicated, \nSenator Crapo and I base it on our bipartisan bill. Senators Stabenow \nand Baldwin will be cosponsors, and I believe others will as well.\n  It is an important amendment and it is an urgent amendment because we \nneed to have this in place quickly so as to give the natural resources \nagencies and our communities the tools they need this summer.\n  It is a real wake-up call when you get a fire briefing in March. That \nis an indication that we have a very, very difficult fire season coming \nup. This bipartisan amendment ensures that in a cost-effective way we \ngive our natural resources agencies the tools they need to fight these \ninfernos and protect our communities.\n  Once again, I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee, \nSenator Enzi, for giving me this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n[[Page S1836]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for his \ncomments.\n  One of the things that has concerned me since I came to the Senate is \nthe fact that, in my first year alone, I believe we spent about $3 \nbillion in disaster relief. Subsequently, it increased to $5 billion \nfor disasters per year, and now it is about $7 billion in disasters a \nyear. As an accountant, one of the things I have always said is, if you \nknow something is going to happen, you ought to put it in the budget. \nSo now you will find that there is $7 billion in disaster relief \nfunding for each of the 10 years in this budget. Using these funds for \nfires and major disasters sounds like a good idea to me.\n  I am a little bit rankled when I hear somebody say this budget is a \nfarce. It is as good an effort as a person can put together in 6 weeks \nwhen there hasn't been one for 8 years. That effort involves a lot of \nresearch, going back to find out where the problems were, why it wasn't \ndone, and what needed to be done. I am pleased with the budget. But, of \ncourse, the reason we have this process--in which we had the committee \nmark-up last week and considered a number of amendments and now will \nconsider many more amendments here on the floor--is so that everybody \ncan participate in seeing if we can complete the budget. It won't be \nperfect when we finish, but it will be better than it is right now, and \nit will be better when we start tomorrow morning.\n  Before we continue consideration of our balanced budget resolution \ntoday, I think it is worthwhile to reflect on what we accomplished \nyesterday for America's hard-working families. It was a good day \nyesterday as we approved amendments to prevent workplace retaliation \nagainst employees who ask or talk about salaries; to oppose cuts to \nMedicaid; to coordinate care for medically complex children with \nmultiple serious, rare, or chronic illnesses; and to help our veterans \ngain timely access to health care. As Senator Ayotte said yesterday, \nher amendment would ``ensure veterans don't have to wait in line, that \nthey can exercise private care options when they want to.'' I am proud \nto say that is something we all support.\n  The debate this week is a unique opportunity for hard-working \ntaxpayers to see an open and transparent legislative process, with \nMembers from both sides of the aisle offering, debating, and voting on \namendments to this resolution. This is something we haven't had in the \npast 8 years, and I think Members are energized to be able to do what \nthey were sent here to do--the people's business.\n  Among the topics we will consider today are: enhancing America's \nenergy security, protecting personal property rights from such agencies \nas the EPA, defending taxpayers against efforts to impose a carbon tax, \nhelping veterans get better access to VA medical facilities, \nsimplifying student loan repayment options, and saving Medicare.\n  I again thank Members for offering amendments that will help make our \ngovernment more efficient, effective, and accountable to America's \nhard-working taxpayers. It is what the American people want and \ndeserve.\n  I look forward to a strong and vigorous debate about our policies \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 347\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that I be allowed to call up my amendment \nNo. 347 and that the amendment be made pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Barrasso], for himself, Mr. \n     Sullivan, Mr. Rounds, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Wicker, Mrs. Capito, \n     Mr. Boozman, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Coats, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. Vitter, \n     Mr. Isakson, and Mr. Moran, proposes an amendment numbered \n     347.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To establish a spending-neutral reserve fund to keep the \n  Federal Water Pollution Control Act focused on protection of water \n  quality, to establish bright lines for Federal jurisdiction, and to \n     create clear and unambiguous exemptions for features that the \n Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or the Secretary \nof the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, claim they are not \n                          seeking to regulate)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. SPENDING-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO KEEPING \n                   THE FEDERAL WATER POLLUTION CONTROL ACT FOCUSED \n                   ON THE PROTECTION OF WATER QUALITY.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to ensuring that Federal jurisdiction under the \n     Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) \n     is focused on water quality, which may include limiting \n     jurisdiction based on the movement of birds, mammals, or \n     insects through the air or over the land, the movement of \n     water through the ground, or the movement of rainwater or \n     snowmelt over the land, or limiting jurisdiction over \n     puddles, isolated ponds, roadside ditches, irrigation \n     ditches, stormwater systems, wastewater systems, or water \n     delivery, reuse, or reclamation systems, by the amounts \n     provided in such legislation for those purposes, provided \n     that such legislation would not raise new revenue and would \n     not increase the deficit over either the period of the total \n     of fiscal years 2016 through 2020 or the period of the total \n     of fiscal years 2016 through 2025.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, this amendment that was just called up \nand made pending deals with the regulations the Obama administration \nhas proposed that would expand the Clean Water Act. The rule is an \nattempt to change the definition of what the law calls waters of the \nUnited States.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers \nfirst proposed the rule last year. They expect to have it finalized in \nthe next few months. Well, under this rule, the definition of ``waters \nof the United States'' would include ditches, would include dry areas \nwhere water flows only for a short period of time after it rains.\n  Federal regulations have never before listed ditches and other \nmanmade features as ``waters of the United States.'' This would be an \nalarming step. It would have a huge impact on farmers, ranchers, \nfamilies, and small businesses all across America. People whose \nlivelihood requires that they put a shovel in the ground would suddenly \nfind it much more difficult to make a living. The rule would amount to \na tax on family farmers and ranchers to use their own land after it \nrains. These are people who just want to grow crops, raise cattle, take \ncare of their families, maybe even just enjoy their own backyards. I \nhear this every weekend at home in Wyoming. I heard about it today from \nstudents from Lusk, WY, in Niobrara County. Now, Washington bureaucrats \nwould have a say in how all of these people use their property.\n  I oppose this rule. I would like to see it scrapped entirely. That is \nwhy last year I introduced the Protecting Water and Property Rights Act \nof 2014 to block the rule, to roll back this dangerous Washington \noverreach.\n  My bill had 38 cosponsors in the Senate, Members who heard from their \nconstituents back home about how worried they were about this harmful \nnew rule. We heard from business owners, who told us the uncertainty \nthe rule creates only delays economic investment and delays job \ncreation. Well, the Environmental Protection Agency says our concerns \nare overblown. The administration says there is a lot of \nmisunderstanding about what this regulation covers.\n  Gina McCarthy, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency, gave a speech last week. She said, ``We're not interested in \nthe vast majority of ditches--roadside ditches, irrigation ditches--\nthose were never covered.'' She also went on to say that the Agency \ncould have been, as she said, ``more crystal clear out of the gate \nabout what we were and were not proposing.''\n  Well, my amendment would help make sure this rule is crystal clear. \nIt simply lists things that the Environmental Protection Agency \nAdministrator and others in the Obama administration have already said \nwould not be regulated under this proposed rule. That is it.\n  My amendment would put limits on how the Environmental Protection \nAgency or the Army Corps of Engineers\n\n[[Page S1837]]\n\ndetermines the extent of Washington control. The limits would include \nnot allowing the agencies to control water based on the movement of \nbirds, mammals, or insects.\n  The amendment would prevent determinations based upon the movement of \nwater through the ground or the movement of rainwater or snowmelt over \nthe land.\n  Finally, my amendment would specifically say that Federal \njurisdiction under the Water Pollution Control Act does not extend to \nthings such as puddles, isolated ponds, roadside ditches, and \nwastewater systems. The Obama administration has said it does not \nintend for its rules to cover any of these features. Well, this \namendment spells it out. There will be no more room for uncertainty and \nno more room for misunderstandings. It will then be crystal clear.\n  Of course, some people may not want the rule to be crystal clear. \nThey may want to have some uncertainty in the rule. They may want to \nhave unaccountable, unelected bureaucrats in Washington to be able to \nchange their minds and then go back on their word--as we have seen them \ndo in the past--about what the regulation covers and what it does not. \nIf there is a Senator here who favors that kind of uncertainty, then \nthey can vote against my amendment.\n  As I said, I have been opposed to this rule from the very beginning. \nThis amendment does not block the rule, and it does nothing to prohibit \nthe Environmental Protection Agency or the Army Corps of Engineers from \nregulating the true waters of the United States. It simply takes the \nadministration at their word. If they say the rule is not meant to \ncover something, this just spells it out.\n  I urge Senators to vote in favor of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks, will the Chair \nnotify me when I have used 5 minutes of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the budget \nresolution offered by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. \nThis budget charts the wrong path for our Nation. It does not spur \neconomic growth or help the middle class because it does not focus on \ncreating high-quality jobs, boosting wages, or reducing inequality. It \nfails to address the cuts to government investments, which threatens \nour Nation's economic and national security. Instead, this budget \nstacks the deck against middle-class families by slashing government \ninvestments. It stacks the deck in favor of special interests by paving \nthe way for huge tax giveaways to powerful special interests and the \nwealthiest Americans.\n  In order to claim the budget will balance in 10 years, it relies on \naccounting gimmicks and $5.8 trillion in draconian cuts. It kicks \nmillions off the health insurance rolls and dismantles health care \nreform. But, ironically, it takes credit for the savings that are part \nand parcel of the Affordable Care Act, all the while setting the stage \nfor massive tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires.\n  It would also put powerful special interests ahead of seniors by \nforcing Medicare recipients to pay more for prescription drugs and \npreventive care. It does not provide adequate safeguards for Social \nSecurity and Medicare. By saying no to closing egregious tax loopholes, \nit only increases the pressure to cut programs for seniors and others.\n  You know, frankly, we have been talking for years here in Washington \nabout the deficit. But, this budget proposed by my colleagues has a \ncredibility deficit. So I think most of the observers and commentators \nare looking and saying: Well, that is impossible. No one is going to \nbelieve that you can repeal the Affordable Care Act but keep the \nsavings. No one is going to believe you can do all of those things and \nstill continue to keep a straight face.\n  So I think the credibility of the budget is highly questionable.\n  We should have engaged in a balanced approach to growing our economy \nand towards fiscal responsibility. A balanced approach requires not \nonly making wise reductions in spending, but it also requires raising \nrevenue. That is the way most government entities operate. Mayors and \nGovernors have to do it, and they do it, but here, we are avoiding very \ndifficult, tough choices.\n  It is obvious there are things that have to be done. They cannot be \nwished away. Look at our crumbling infrastructure. As I drive around \nRhode Island and the Northeast after a series of storms, I see the \nworst highway situation I think I recall in perhaps my lifetime, but at \nleast in a long time. Potholes and disruptions are all over our roads. \nAmericans expect it will be fixed, but you cannot fix it simply by \nwishing, you have to have the resources and the investment to make \nthose corrections.\n  As we go forward, it is important to go ahead and deal with all of \nthese issues in a balanced way--not through creative accounting \ntechniques but by making difficult choices. Programs that are not \nworking should be cut back. Revenue should be provided for investment \nin this country. That is what I think we should and we must do.\n  I have been particularly active with my colleague Senator McCain on \nthe Armed Services Committee because the Defense Department is facing \nserious financial challenges. All of our service sectors have warned \nthat if sequestration remains in place, if the Budget Control Act \nremains in place, together they will not provide the resources \nnecessary to adequately fund the readiness, the modernization of our \nforces and the welfare of our forces.\n  Admiral Gortney, for example, who is the commander of NORTHCOM, has \nmade this point along with everyone else, but he also went further to \nmake the point that I think is critical when we are talking about \ndefense and nondefense spending. You cannot draw this bright line \nbetween the Department of Defense and everybody else in terms of our \nnational security. NORTHCOM, which is responsible for our security in \nthe United States, depends upon border control agents at our border. \nThey depend upon the Department of Homeland Security. If that agency is \nnot adequately funded, if they are suffering through sequestration and \nthe BCA levels, then we will not have the kind of national security we \nneed. If it translates to further cuts in TSA agents at our airports, \nthat will undermine our security.\n  So this notion that we can draw a nice neat line between the \nDepartment of Defense and give them some more money through different \ntechniques but ignore the other side of the equation does not work.\n  One of the most significant examples comes from General John Kelly of \nSouthern Command. They have the capability of, through satellite \nimagery, through other intelligence means, identifying these fast boats \ncoming out of South America that have drugs and might have human cargo, \npossibly terrorists. Knowing where they are and where they are headed \nis fine, but unless you have Coast Guard cutters to intercept them, you \nwill not interdict this traffic. As a result, what we will have is a \nhole in our national security. The Coast Guard cutters come from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  So I know there has been an effort to use the Overseas Contingency \nOperation Fund. Senator Graham, in particular, has been very, very \naggressive with that. But I will try to explain later, if not now: \nThere are limitations. This fund is directed at our operations against \nAl Qaeda and the Taliban under the authorization for the use of \nmilitary force. To try to stretch this to build facilities in Alaska \nfor missile defense--that is quite a stretch. That is not what OCO was \ndesigned for.\n  I think it has become a valiant effort to put more money in, but the \nreality is, we have to face up, as Senator McCain and I suggested in \nour letter to the Budget Committee, and raise the baseline number for \nthe Department of Defense to a total--at least to a total that avoids \nsequestration or beyond. That is a realistic way to do it, and revenue \nis a way to pay for it. And I don't think the cuts should come out of \nnondefense to fund defense. This is an issue--again, are you going to \nshortchange Homeland Security? Are you going to shortchange other \nagencies that are critical to the defense of the United States? Are you \ngoing to shortchange the people of the United States? I do not think we \nshould.\n\n[[Page S1838]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is amendment No. 347.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 622\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside in order for me to call up amendment No. 622.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Burr], for himself, \n     Mr. King, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Shaheen, and Ms. \n     Ayotte, proposes an amendment numbered 622.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to \n           manageable Federal student loan repayment options)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO A \n                   SIMPLIFIED INCOME-DRIVEN STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT \n                   OPTION.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to addressing student loan debt, which may include \n     reducing overlapping student loan repayment programs and \n     creating a simplified income-driven student loan repayment \n     option by the amounts provided in such legislation for those \n     purposes, provided that such legislation would not increase \n     the deficit over either the period of the total of fiscal \n     years 2016 through 2020 or the period of the total of fiscal \n     years 2016 through 2025.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund amendment to the budget that will allow the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee to revise allocations to provide for a simplified \nincome-driven repayment program for Federal student loans.\n  This budget amendment is offered with the hope that it would allow \nfor legislation similar to the Repay Act, which I introduced earlier in \nthis Congress with Senator King, Senator Alexander, Senator Warner, \nSenator Shaheen, Senator Ayotte, Senator Rubio, Senator Capito, Senator \nCollins, and Senator Carper.\n  I wish to spend a moment telling my colleagues what the Repay Act \nwould do.\n  It is very simple. It would streamline the numerous loan repayment \nprograms into two easily understood options for those who take out \nstudent loans.\n  No. 1, it would create a fixed repayment program similar to the \ncurrent law's 10-year standard repayment.\n  No. 2, it would create a new simplified income-driven repayment \nprogram that consolidates numerous income-based programs into one \nprogram.\n  As we know today, students who go to college have to take out a \nnumber of different loans. It is confusing in the system to know \nexactly what that repayment system looks like--especially for somebody \nwho is trying to determine their job opportunities and the income they \nneed to meet their debt. This allows consolidation and simplification \nso that if students understand exactly what their exposure is almost \nfrom the very beginning, they would be left with a simple set of \nchoices upon graduation. Do I choose a fixed payment plan that would \npay off my loans in a straight 10 years? Or do I take the simplified \nincome-driven repayment plan, pay a little longer, and have the \nremaining loan balance forgiven after 20 or 25 years, depending upon \nwhether it is undergraduate or graduate loans?\n  Now, this is important for a few reasons, which I will illustrate \nfrom the quotes that have been made by many associations and financial \naid administrators who endorsed the Repay Act.\n  They say, No. 1: ``Consolidating the various federal income-based \nprograms into a single plan will help borrowers understand the benefits \nand protections inherent in our federal student loan system . . .''\n  No. 2:\n\n       Despite many protections in [existing] repayment plans, a \n     frustrating number of student loan borrowers continue to \n     default. This is due in part to the fact that the options \n     require borrowers to take proactive and cumbersome steps to \n     enroll.\n\n  And, No. 3: ``This proposal to collapse the different plans into one \nsingle income-based repayment plan should help ease the enrollment \nprocess for borrowers.''\n  Not only does it sort out the repayment obligations that a student \nhas, it makes the enrollment easier. And this comes from the \nindividuals who are responsible for the implementation of these \nprograms.\n  Those quotes are from associations representing financial aid \nadministrators across the country. They are people who are on the \nfrontlines of helping students as they prepare for payment after \ncollege. We should listen to them, and I say that strongly to my \ncolleagues. We should listen to them.\n  The other benefits of this legislation is that students will know, \nprior to entering college, based on the amount that they borrow, what \noptions will be available to them once they graduate from college. I \nknow that seems like common sense to a lot of folks, but if you haven't \nbeen through the student loan process today, then you don't realize \nthey don't have that clarity today--as they enter college--that this \nwill allow them to have.\n  This will promote better consumer behavior. It will lessen the chance \nstudents default based upon the confusion of the viable options that \nthey have available to them.\n  Now, I would think, from policymakers, our intent would always be, \nNo. 1: Does the plan fit the need of the individuals to whom it is \ntargeted? Clearly the student loan program does, but, No. 2: Have we \ndone this in a way that is simple, understandable, and workable?\n  If we can't answer that question, and we don't check that box, the \nlikelihood is that the net result is that we have defaults, individuals \nwho don't live up to repaying their obligation. When a student \ngraduates, they face up to 12 repayment options available to them, all \nwith some overlapping purpose or benefit and with great complexity in \nhow you actually sign up for the options.\n  Again, with the Repay Act, there are two options: 10 years straight \nrepayment or a repayment that is structured based on what your income \nis.\n  Senator King and I think the Repay Act makes for good policy, but we \nthink it makes for bad policy to have 12 cumbersome options that \noverlap in some cases.\n  Based on some preliminary scores from CBO and estimates from \nPresident Obama--since he has proposed much of what we do in the Repay \nAct--we believe this legislation will save in the area of $4 billion \nover the next 10 years and $1 billion to $2 billion over the next 5 \nyears. That is up to $6 billion in savings in the student loan program \nthat we could pump back into additional loan value for students in the \nfuture.\n  Now, unlike other options we have, which we will be voting on today, \nthat cost money--and pay for it by raising taxes--we save money by \nmaking our program more efficient and better suited for students' \nneeds.\n  I say this to my colleagues who might be asking: How do I vote? I \nhave to tell you: You have to wait to have a comparison bill. There \nwill be one.\n  I want you to ask yourselves: Which one saves $4 billion, and which \none costs more money? Which one uses the allocations that are currently \nthere, and which one raises taxes to put in place a new plan?\n  This amendment and the Repay Act is bipartisan--overwhelmingly so. If \nthe bipartisan list of cosponsors to the Repay Act isn't enough, many \nof the recommendations that are formed in this legislation came from \nthe President's very own budget.\n  This legislation also has the support of the Education Finance \nCouncil, the American Council on Education, the National Association of \nStudent Financial Aid Administrators, as well as the University of \nNorth Carolina System, which is important to me, since I represent \nNorth Carolina.\n  In short, this amendment represents legislation that, No. 1, is \nbipartisan; No. 2, saves money; No. 3, is based on the ideas and \nproposals of the President; and, No. 4, has the support of the\n\n[[Page S1839]]\n\nfinancial aid industry, which is responsible for the success of student \nloan programs.\n  Success means easy enrollment. Success means repayment of the \noutstanding debt.\n  I urge my colleagues, when given the opportunity, to vote for \nAmendment No. 622, a bipartisan-sponsored initiative.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to notify me when 6 minutes \nare consumed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, last week the Senate Budget Committee gave \na green light to the Republican budget. A caution light, a yellow \nlight, was more in order. It calls for $4.7 trillion in nondefense \nspending cuts over the next 10 years and no increases in revenue. Where \nwould those cuts come from? They would be piled on the backs of the \nmiddle class, the elderly, and children.\n  They would cut the earned-income tax credit, slash Medicare and \nMedicaid, child care, Head Start, education, public safety, and law \nenforcement.\n  And--just for good measure--the Republican budget rolls back reforms \non Wall Street--and on and on. All this and more is to pay for lower \ntaxes for millionaires and billionaires.\n  When I first came to the Senate, our economy was in a free fall. We \nwere losing 20,000 jobs a day, every day. Thousands of jobs were gone. \nOur financial system was crashing. Deficits were at historic highs.\n  That was 6 years ago. It has been a long road back. We asked the \nwealthy to pay their fair share. We passed long-needed reforms to Wall \nStreet. We have seen 12 million more private sector jobs, the deficit \ncut in half, and Wall Street at historic highs. Profits are up; \nunemployment and deficits are down.\n  That is the story, but it isn't over. We are not done yet. Not \neveryone has found solid ground.\n  My State still faces great challenges. Many New Mexicans are still \nstruggling, still pulling out of the worst recession in 75 years. How \ndo we go forward? How do we build on the progress we have made?\n  Those are the questions the voters elected us to solve. The short \nanswer is we have to work together. We have to get past the shutdowns \nand the showdowns. Politics is the art of standing your ground but also \nfinding common ground.\n  That is why the Republican budget is so troubling. It doesn't start a \nconversation. It doesn't reach across the aisle.\n  This budget is bad for working families, bad for the middle class, \nbad for our economy. It makes a U-turn right back to failed policies of \nthe past. This budget says no to the middle class, no to the most \nvulnerable, and no to the critical investments we know we need--but yes \nto lower taxes for hedge funds. It is Robin Hood in reverse, and it \nwill hurt so many people who have suffered so much for so long.\n  This is the wrong way to go at the worst possible time, because--make \nno mistake about it--this budget is one big yes for those at the top \nand one big no for everybody else.\n  In my State, one in three children is in poverty. For Native American \nchildren, it is even higher. It is 44 percent. One in five children \ngoes to bed hungry. Their parents can't find adequate child care. They \ncan't get quality medical care when they need it. They lack access to \nsafe housing and clean water.\n  This just isn't the case in New Mexico. We see it across the Nation. \nChildren and families are falling behind. This has to change. The \nfuture--not only for our children but for our economy--depends on \nchanging it. We need to be doing more, but the Republican budget does \nless.\n  It would cut programs for low-income children, seniors, and families \nby up to $660 billion over 10 years, including SNAP and child nutrition \nprograms.\n  Healthy kids are an investment in our future economy. We need renewed \ncommitment--not draconian cuts--to the programs that help children \nreach their full potential. That means infant and toddler care, \npreschool, and home-visiting programs. We know that they work and they \ncan help in a big way.\n  A recent White House report tells the story. These programs make a \ndifference, get results and save money--more than $8 for every $1 \ninvested.\n  That is why I introduced the Saving Our Next Generation Act, or SONG \nAct. We should fully pay for what works. That is why I am a cosponsor \nof the PRE-K Act to expand high-quality, early learning programs for \nchildren from birth to age 5.\n  Children should be our priority. They should not take a back seat to \nbillionaires and neither should the elderly, who depend on Medicare, \nnot a voucher program.\n  The Republican budget cuts $2.5 trillion from health care for low- \nand moderate-income people.\n  Repealing the Affordable Care Act, block-granting Medicaid--seniors \nwould pay more for prescription drugs and more for preventive services. \nCrucial support for nursing care and home health care would be slashed.\n  We have a lot to do to get America's economy back on track. The \nRepublican budget--at every turn--fails to do it. A budget isn't just \nnumbers. It is about choices, and it is about priorities.\n  That means investing in infrastructure. We have to upgrade our roads \nand manage our water resources. Federal dollars are almost half of New \nMexico's total transportation budget and 70 percent of funding for our \nhighways and bridges.\n  It means making sure we have an educated workforce--not cutting Pell \ngrants by 30 percent.\n  It means full funding for the PILT program--to help communities pay \nfor law enforcement, schools, and other services folks depend on.\n  It means making sure our national labs and our military bases have \nthe resources they need.\n  All of this makes a difference for the people of my State. It makes a \ndifference for hardworking families. It makes a difference for the \nfuture of our country.\n  These should be our priorities, including doing more for small \nbusinesses. They are the engine of our economy. They create most new \njobs. They need a fair tax policy--because they pay their fair share--\nand don't have an army of lawyers working to find tax loopholes.\n  We cannot ask Main Street to keep sacrificing while we fail to close \na single tax loophole on Wall Street.\n  We need a tax system that supports the middle class--not corporations \nsending jobs overseas. Our economy is recovering, but the benefit needs \nto go to all Americans, not just those at the top.\n  These are the choices we should be making. These are the choices the \nRepublican budget fails to make.\n  We need to invest in the programs that help all Americans get ahead--\nand strengthen our economy--so that every hardworking American has the \nopportunity to build a better future.\n  I hope we can work together and find common ground with a budget that \nmakes sense, with a fair tax policy, and with smart investments. We \nneed to look to the future--and move forward.\n  Now is not the time to return to the failed policies of the past.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 6 minutes.\n  Mr. UDALL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes \nscheduled for 12:15 p.m. now take place at 12:30 p.m., with the \nDemocrats controlling 15 minutes and the majority controlling the \nremaining time, with all provisions of the previous order remaining in \neffect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 652\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the amendment we are going to be \ndiscussing now--and I will say a few words about it in a moment--deals \nwith one of the most important issues facing our country; that is, the \nlack of affordability of college and the reality that when millions of \nour young people graduate school, they are left in crushing debt year \nafter year after year, and they are unable to refinance that debt which \nhas a huge impact on their lives.\n  I give time now to Senator Warren, who has played a great role in \nfocusing on this issue and has brought forth what I think is an \nexcellent amendment.\n  I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support \namendment No. 652, to refinance existing student loans and bring down \nthe high interest rates that are dragging down millions of Americans.\n  When rates are low, people refinance their mortgages. When rates are \nlow, businesses refinance their debt. Well, rates are low, and we want \nto give the 40 million Americans who are dealing with student loans the \nsame chance to refinance their loans.\n  Last year, Republicans blocked our efforts to lower student loan \ninterest rates. They said there were other, better ways to deal with \nstudent loan debt, but they did nothing. So tens of millions of \nborrowers got nothing, and millions of borrowers are still stuck paying \ninterest rates at 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent, and even higher.\n  While Republicans were busy blocking student loan refinancing, our \ncountry's student debt problem got worse--much worse. In the last year, \noutstanding student debt has increased by $100 billion dollars. Nearly \n1 million more borrowers have fallen behind on their student loans. The \ninterest rate on new student loans only got higher.\n\n  This amendment offers us a chance to actually do something for the \nmillions of Americans who are dealing with student loan debt. The idea \nis simple: Refinance outstanding student loans down to 3.9 percent for \nundergraduates, a little higher for graduate students. The amendment \nwould save borrowers hundreds and in some cases thousands of dollars a \nyear, all without adding a dime to our deficit. It is fully paid for by \nclosing a tax loophole that allows millionaires and billionaires to pay \na lower tax rate than middle-class families.\n  We have a choice--protect a tax loophole for billionaires or give \ntens of millions of people a chance to refinance their student loans. A \nchoice--protect a tax loophole for billionaires or give millions of \nmiddle-class people a chance to build some real economic security.\n  Congress has worked far too long for the billionaires. Now it is time \nfor Congress to work for hard-working people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let's be frank. We live in a global \neconomy. We need the best educated workforce in the world to compete. \nYet we are making it harder and harder for middle-class families to \nsend their kids to college. At the same time, we are saying to those \nyoung people who go to college: You are going to be living with an \noppressive debt for decades--for decades.\n  Several months ago, I talked to a young woman in Burlington, VT. Her \ncrime was that she went to medical school in order to become a primary \ncare physician. Those are exactly the people we need. She left medical \nschool with $300,000 in debt. Does anybody think that makes any sense \nat all?\n  Right now, if you want to go out and buy a new car, you can get \ninterest rates in some cases of 0 percent, 1 percent, 2 percent. If you \nwant to refinance your home, you can pay 3 percent, 4 percent, 5 \npercent. Yet, when parents want to send their kids to college or young \npeople themselves take out loans, they are forced to pay 6 percent, 8 \npercent, or even a higher percent for the crime of wanting to get a \nhigher education.\n  Senator Warren's amendment is eminently sensible. It significantly \nlowers interest rates, cutting them almost in half to 3.9 percent. This \nwould be a huge blessing for millions of young people who are having a \nhard time buying homes, a hard time even starting families because they \nare dealing with this oppressive debt.\n  The last point I would make--and I hope everybody remembers this--\nwhen\n\n[[Page S1841]]\n\nWall Street, because of their greed, recklessness, and illegal \nbehavior, needed to be bailed out, the Fed provided them with zero and \none-half of 1 percent interest rates by the trillions of dollars. If we \ncould bail out Wall Street--if the Fed could bail out Wall Street with \nextremely low interest rates, it is time for us to treat the young \npeople in this country and their parents with the same respect. We need \nto substantially lower interest rates on student debt, and the Warren \namendment would do that.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I appreciate and support the comments \nfrom my colleague, my neighbor from Vermont, Senator Sanders. I am \npleased to be here to support Senator Warren's bill, which I am \ncosponsoring.\n  This amendment would allow our young people to refinance their \nstudent loans. Student loan debt has now surpassed credit card debt in \nthis country. This is an issue about the economy of this country, but \neven more important it is an issue about the future of our young \npeople.\n  In New Hampshire, we have the second highest student loan debt in the \ncountry. I have talked to young people and their families, who say they \nare delaying getting married, they are delaying having children, and \nthey are delaying buying houses because of their student loan debt. \nYet, families can refinance their houses and they can refinance their \ncars. They should be able to refinance their student loans.\n  This is critical to getting our economy moving again in the way it \nshould. It is critical to ensuring that our young people have a future. \nI hope all of our colleagues will take a look at this legislation and \nwill agree that it makes sense. We need to do this for our families, \nfor our students, and for our country.\n  I yield back to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. The Senator from Rhode Island, 3 minutes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I will be even briefer than that.\n  Mr. SANDERS. The Senator from Rhode Island gets 2 minutes, then.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nadded as a cosponsor to Senator Warren's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Rhode Island is the very proud location of some of \nthe best universities in the country. We have very high university \ndensity in our small State. We have everything from Brown University in \nProvidence, to our wonderful State universities led by the University \nof Rhode Island, to leading Catholic colleges such as Providence \nCollege and Salve Regina in Newport, RI. To support kids in getting \ntheir college educations and to bring down the cost is a priority for \nus in Rhode Island. I am proud to cosponsor this amendment.\n  I yield back any further time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I thank the Presiding Officer for recognizing me.\n  Mr. President, I, too, wish to rise in support of this amendment. In \na nation that is finding itself increasingly with global competitors, \nwhere other nations--some of the most active economic competitors we \nhave are doing everything they can to keep the cost of college low. In \nGermany, 4 percent to 5 percent of median income is the cost of \ncollege. In Canada, 5 percent to 6 percent of median income is the cost \nof college. In England, 6 percent to 7 percent of median income is the \ncost of college. Other competitive democracies know to widen the \navenues to greater college education. But here in the United States, \nthe cost of college is over 50 percent of the median income.\n  We are raising barriers to our children getting in the game, being on \nthe field, and playing. I say that when you field a team--when Stanford \nwould compete in football, we didn't leave four or five of our players \non the side lines; we got everybody on the field. That is what we need.\n  This amendment is common sense. We should not be profiting as a \ngovernment off the backs of our students. We should allow them to \nrefinance their student debt. That is why I support it, and I am \ngrateful for my colleagues' support as well.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, how much time do we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats have 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, over the last several months, I have had \nthree town meetings in Vermont with young people on this issue. It is \nan issue of huge concern to them and their parents. As Senator Booker \njust mentioned, we are competing with countries all over the world that \nsay to their young people: If you have the ability and you have the \ndesire, you can go to college regardless of your income.\n  In Germany, tuition for college is now zero. In many Scandinavian \ncountries, it is now zero. What they are saying to the young people is, \nwe need you to get the best education to help us create the strongest \neconomy, to create the jobs we need.\n  How insane is it for us to literally discourage bright young people \nfrom attending college or to tell others that if they graduate college \nor graduate school, they are going to be $70,000, $80,000, $100,000 in \ndebt? What sense does this make for the well-being of the middle class \nof this country or for our economic competitiveness?\n  In the next month, I will be personally introducing legislation that \nwill cut and do away with tuition in public colleges and universities, \nbut today what we are focusing on is legislation that is so sensible, \nso obvious, it is hard for me to imagine that anybody can vote against \nit. I have in my office at least two attorneys who are struggling with \nhuge student debts. This is true all over this country. They graduated \nfrom college 15 years ago. They are still paying off that debt, and it \nimpacts what they can do. We have evidence out there that families are \nnot having children because of student debt, not buying homes because \nof student debt. Why is it that people have to pay double or triple \ninterest rates because they got an education as opposed to what they \nwould pay when they purchase a car or a home? Does anybody think that \nmakes sense?\n  Today we have an opportunity to stand up for the young people of this \ncountry and say we want them to get an education and we want them to \nhave the freedom to live their lives after they leave school. That is \nwhat this amendment is about.\n  I yield time to the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Kaine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I also rise to speak on behalf of this \nbudget amendment. I will be brief.\n  There is a wonderful organization that analyzes education in this \ncountry called the Lumina Foundation. Their main area of research is \nthe percentage of adults in the country and competitor countries who \nhave higher education degrees. Because of the GI bill, the United \nStates rocketed ahead of other nations and became the clear leading \ncountry in the world in the percentage of adults with higher education \ndegrees. There wasn't a close second. But now we are 10th to 15th in \nthe world and slipping.\n  I would argue that the economic future for this country is not one \nthat we would like if the United States continues to slip further and \nfurther behind other nations in the percentage of our folks with higher \neducation degrees. That is why I support this amendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be here on the \nfloor of the Senate with Senator Warren, Senator Sanders, and all of my \ncolleagues on the Democratic side who feel very strongly that if young \npeople are going to have a fair shot to get ahead, to enter the middle \nclass, to be a part of a thriving economy, they have to come out of \ncollege without mountains of debt so they can go and buy a house and a \ncar and have a family and a career and not be saddled with outrageous \ndebt. That is what this amendment is about.\n  If there were ever an amendment that said we want middle-class \nopportunity for everybody, it is this one. I hope we will have a \nunanimous vote.\n\n[[Page S1842]]\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me conclude by saying this: The high \ncost of college and student debt is one of the great issues facing our \ncountry. We are trying to lower student debt significantly. Our \nRepublican colleagues' response to the crisis is to cut $90 billion in \nmandatory funding for Pell grants. The choice is pretty clear. We are \nlooking at the future of this country and the need for our young people \nto get the best education possible and to not graduate college deeply \nin debt. That is what this amendment is about. I hope we will have \nstrong bipartisan support for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I don't think there is anybody on either side of the aisle \nwho isn't concerned about student debt, the cost of interest and \ncollege and the number of people graduating with debt. Addressing \ncollege costs and the burden of high student debt loans must be a \npriority, but it can't be done on a budget bill. We can't have policy \non a budget resolution. I know this doesn't include all of her policy, \nso it is an incomplete bill.\n  The Office of Management and Budget last month disclosed that \nparticipation in the existing income-based repayment plan has been much \nhigher than was anticipated, and the administration is currently in the \nprocess of extending those existing repayment options to all the \neligible borrowers with outstanding student loans. Therefore, the OMB \nnow projects that the existing student loan portfolio will cost \ntaxpayers an additional $22 billion. That is $22 billion more being \nspent to alleviate the repayment burden of borrowers with outstanding \ndebt. We can find that number in the President's budget.\n  The CBO did score the bill that Senator Warren introduced last \nCongress on which this amendment is based. The CBO projected that the \ngovernment will make billions in profit--listen to this--from buying \ntens of billions worth of private student loans from banks and \nrefinancing them at lower rates. They are going to buy up loans and \nthen refinance those loans at lower rates, and somehow the way that \nscores is positive for the Federal Government? Wow. That is why we are \ntalking about needing some changes in the way we do scoring around \nhere. Think about that. If the government can make money from buying up \nprivate loans while charging the borrower a lower rate, why stop there? \nWe can make trillions for the country.\n\n  CBO, as well as leading academic economists and think tanks, all \nbelieve credit reform accounting is seriously flawed. They favor fair \nvalue accounting under which loans are valued at what they are worth to \nthe private sector. Last year CBO showed that under fair value \naccounting, the Federal student loan portfolio does not make a big \nprofit. It actually has a significant cost. One of the reasons for some \nof the high interest rates is that when the Affordable Care Act was \npassed, it set those rates higher so there would be revenue for the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  I hope we will defeat this amendment and support the bipartisan King-\nBurr proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 622\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 622, offered by the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. \nBurr.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support the \nBurr-King amendment No. 622, which creates a deficit-neutral reserve \nfund to reduce overlapping student loan repayment programs.\n  The student repayment system is a mess right now. There are nine \ndifferent alternatives and they are very confusing. Even the names are \nconfusing. There is the income-based repayment, the income-contingent \nrepayment, the income-sensitive repayment, and the pay-as-you-earn \nrepayment. In other words, it is very complicated and it is one of the \nthings that makes it confusing and hard for students.\n  Senator Burr and I have introduced this amendment in order to \nsimplify this decision. Basically we have taken suggestions from \nindividuals--students, institutions, as well as the President--to \nsimplify the loan repayment provision to reduce it to basically two \noptions, a fixed repayment over 10 years or an income-related repayment \nover a longer period of time.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. I believe it is an \noverdue simplification of this process, and I believe it will enable \nthe students of America to deal with this issue in a more constructive \nway.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, we think the Burr-King amendment is a \nsensible, noncontroversial amendment, and I don't believe we have any \nobjection to it on this side of the aisle.\n  I suggest a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any further debate?\n  Without any further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 622) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 652\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on amendment No. 652, offered by the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Ms. Warren.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, not seeing the Senator from \nMassachusetts, I will make this point: If there is an eminently \nsensible amendment to come before us, this is it. It addresses the \ncrisis that exists all over this country where young people are \ngraduating college deeply in debt and have that onerous debt around \ntheir necks for decades.\n  This amendment simply gives these young people the opportunity to \nrefinance their debts so they can substantially lower their student \ndebt, and in some cases cut their student debt in half. It is hard for \nme to imagine how anybody could vote against an amendment as sensible \nas this amendment but so important to millions of families in this \ncountry who want to be able to send their kids to college and for the \nyoung people who want to graduate college without this oppressive debt.\n  I strongly ask for a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the proper way to do this is to consider the \nfull bill and run it through committee and then the floor and not try \nto make policy in a budget resolution.\n  I ask for a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield back any remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Warren amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Texas (Mr. Cruz).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis).

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the Federal budget is a pressing concern for everybody \nin this body, including myself, especially given the political climate \nwe have in Congress. We have been two Houses divided for some time.\n  Back in 2011, the Republican House and the Democratic Senate agreed \nthat Federal spending was out of control. They just couldn't agree on \nwhat to do about it. So Members from both Chambers came together to \ngive Congress two options: either pass a responsible budget to help \nreduce the deficit or face drastic cuts to every discretionary Federal \ndepartment.\n  That threat of sequester was supposed to represent the end of the \nroad, forcing Congress to put differences aside and to work together, \nbut sometimes even a dead end is not enough to motivate some folks to \ndo the right thing. Congress failed to come up with a bipartisan, long-\nterm spending plan and sequestration went into effect 2 years ago.\n  Sequestration has had devastating effects nationally and in my home \nState of Nevada. Take, for instance, sequestration's impact on our \nnational forests. We have 17 million acres of national forest managed \nby the U.S. Forest Service. Under its current structure, the Forest \nService uses the same pool of funds to manage our national forests that \nit does to fight wildfires. In bad fire years, suppression can use over \n40 percent of the U.S. Forest Service's budget. So it is no surprise \nthat their budget is still in disarray 2 years after sequestration cuts \n$200 million during the hot, dry summer that saw millions of acres of \ntrees burn across the West.\n  Sequestration proved to be irresponsible and its impacts long-\nlasting, and our forests weren't the own casualties. The Indian Country \nwas slammed from education to health care, to infrastructure. Indian \nHealth Service saw its budget cut by a similar amount. Health care in \nIndian Country is chronically underfunded anyway. The additional 5-\npercent cut to the IHS budget resulted in 800,000 fewer outpatient \nvisits for Native Americans. Indian schools--many of which are in such \nbad shape that nobody in this body would send their kids there--saw \ntheir budgets cut by $67 million, which resulted in bigger class size, \ncutbacks to academic programs, cutbacks to building maintenance, and \nreduction in technology upgrades. Sequestration was almost as \ndevastating to the public education system in this country, and it had \nits impact on seniors and low-income children and families. It will be \nagain if Congress doesn't act.\n  Between now and September 30, Congress must pass a responsible budget \nthat reduces our deficit, and we have time to agree on that or we will \nface greater cuts than we saw last time. The President's budget \nproposal makes significant investments in infrastructure and education \nand our outdoors. These initiatives will help grow our economy, \nparticularly in rural States such as Montana, but there is one big \nproblem. The President's budget fails to reduce the deficit in a smart \nand meaningful way, but the other options on the table are worse.\n  The House last week unveiled its budget proposal. It is the height of \nirresponsibility. The House wants to privatize Medicare by turning it \ninto a voucher program. It wants to turn Medicaid into block grants and \ncut those. They want to cut taxes for millionaires and big corporations \nwhile they phase out portions of the earned-income tax credit, \nsqueezing the wallets of millions of working-class Americans. The \nHouse's plan also cuts the Pell Grant Program.\n  It repeals the Affordable Care Act--that is no surprise. The House \nhas voted over 50 times to repeal the ACA, ignoring the fact that we \nhave some 16 million more Americans that have affordable access to \nhealth care than before the law was passed, but in a show of boundless \nhypocrisy, the House balances its budget by counting the $700 billion \nin Medicare savings and the $1 trillion in new revenue that the \nAffordable Care Act provides.\n  Now some folks might say, well, that is the House of Representatives. \nLook at how they handled the funding for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity this year. They nearly shut down the agency tasked with \nprotecting our borders and preventing terrorist attacks on America. The \nHouse gave up on responsible governing years ago. But the fact is the \nbudget before us today in the Senate isn't much different. It repeals \nthe Affordable Care Act, but again pretends to keep the $700 billion in \nsavings to Medicare and the $1 trillion of revenue created by the \nAffordable Care Act--after it has been repealed. Now, I am a farmer, \nnot an accountant, but I want to state that this is the kind of new \nmath that doesn't add up to me.\n  The Senate budget--similar to the House--also guts the Pell Grant \nProgram by one-third. Why is that important? Well, in Montana, students \nare graduating from college with more than $27,000 in debt in student \nloans. The last thing they need are less Pell grants and more student \ndebt, which is exactly what will happen if this Senate budget passes.\n  It also puts States on the hook for over $1 trillion in Medicaid \nfunding. What does that mean? It means we are not going to take care of \nit anymore. We are going to push it off on States and act like it \ndoesn't exist. Just like the House, it raises taxes on the lowest wrung \nof the economic ladder by repealing the extension of the earned-income \ntax credit and child tax credit. These credits keep over 13 million \nAmericans--working families with relatively low incomes--out of \npoverty.\n  While this rhetoric about passing a balanced budget sounds good--and \nI do support a balanced budget--the reality is this budget doesn't cut \nit. It does not balance. Why? Because this budget relies on gimmicks \nsuch as using the Overseas Contingency Fund, which is supposed to fund \nthe war on Afghanistan and action against ISIS but instead has become a \nslush fund for the Department of Defense. This budget assumes hundreds \nof billions of dollars in ``unallocated cuts.'' That is great \nmessaging. We are going to slash the budget by hundreds of billions of \ndollars, but we are not going to tell you where we cut it out. We can \ntalk about cuts, but when it gets to specifics--the real tough \ndecisions--we are not going to talk about those. We are not even going \nto tell you where they are. It is not only secretive, but it is bad \npolicy, and these kinds of smoke and mirrors are the worst Washington \nhas to offer.\n  While the President's budget spends far too much, at least it is \nhonest, open, and transparent. The House and Senate budgets are just a \ndisplay of bad mathematics. They lack any sort of realistic plan to \nkeep our economy growing by investing in America. Instead of balancing \nthe budget on the backs of middle-class families and seniors and \nstudents and our Nation's most vulnerable, we need to fully invest in \nthe measures that will help this economy go, such as roads, bridges, \nour outdoor economy, education for our kids and our grandkids because \nthat is the only way they are going to be able to compete in this \nglobal economy. In 2015, every nation is interconnected. Business \ntransactions occur between multinational corporations, scientific \ndiscovery is shared between universities on different continents, clean \nair and clean water and carbon emission standards are achieved by \ninternational agreements, but global security seems to be a battle that \nwe--the United States--are fighting alone--and at what cost?\n  Last week, my Appropriations subcommittee on military construction \nheld a hearing on the Defense Department's construction budget. The \nUnited States spends more on defense than the next nine nations \ncombined. Let me say it one more time. The United States spends more on \ndefense than the next nine nations combined, including the United \nKingdom, Germany, India, and--yes--China. Two of America's greatest \ninternational threats, ISIS and a nuclear Iran, pose a grave threat to \nus but also to our allies in the Middle East and Europe. Yet we are the \nones paying the overwhelming\n\n[[Page S1844]]\n\nmajority of these costs. This budget hides those costs from the \nAmerican people. With 47 Senators pushing us to go to war with Iran, I \nthink the American people deserve to know how we are spending their \ndollars overseas.\n  Do not misunderstand me. Congress's foremost concern should be with \nprotecting our Nation and in keeping our communities safe, but that \nshould also be the foremost concern of our allies around the world. \nTime and time again, though, it is the U.S. taxpayer and American lives \nwho are on the line, and that price is far too high. It is not just \ndollars and cents. It is the lives of our kids. It is the wounds they \nwill face when they return from war, if they return from war at all. \nThese are pricetags we cannot afford.\n  While we send our troops and our treasures overseas, our allies are \nfree to invest significantly in more public education, health care, \ninfrastructure, research and development, and lower taxes. Why? Because \nwe are paying the bill. Their economies grow in relation to our \ndeficit. As Congress looks to responsibly cut spending, we must look at \nthe billions we waste overseas, and we need to level with the American \npeople about the true cost of war. While caring for our veterans is a \ncost we absolutely should bear, we can no longer afford to fight and \nfund every international conflict. We have to stop paying for war on \nour children's credit.\n  We need to think about the future and invest in public education, \nhealth care, and infrastructure, in sound forest management, and in \nlower taxes. A global economy and a global defense will allow us to \ninvest in middle-class families, educating our children, protecting our \nseniors, and making sure Americans can afford food and shelter. These \nare investments we must make, but the budget before us stops investing \nin America.\n  We can do better, and we must do better.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 601\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent to set \naside the pending amendment and call up Bennet-Stabenow amendment No. \n601.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow], for Mr. Bennet, \n     for himself and Ms. Stabenow, proposes an amendment numbered \n     601.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To create a point of order against legislation that would \n  privatize Medicare, cut guaranteed benefits, increase out-of-pocket \n        spending, or turn Medicare into a premium support plan)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title IV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST LEGISLATION THAT WOULD \n                   PRIVATIZE MEDICARE, CUT GUARANTEED BENEFITS, \n                   INCREASE OUT-OF-POCKET SPENDING, OR TURN \n                   MEDICARE INTO A PREMIUM SUPPORT PLAN.\n\n       (a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the Senate \n     to consider any bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, \n     amendment between the Houses, or conference report that \n     would--\n       (1) privatize or change the Medicare program under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) \n     into a system that provides a payment either to pay for or \n     offset private plan premiums or the traditional fee-for-\n     service Medicare program;\n       (2) result in a reduction of guaranteed benefits for \n     individuals entitled to, or enrolled for, benefits under the \n     Medicare program; or\n       (3) increase out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs \n     or preventive services under the Medicare program.\n       (b) Waiver and Appeal.--Subsection (a) may be waived or \n     suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-\n     fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative \n     vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly \n     chosen and sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal of \n     the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under \n     subsection (a).\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, Medicare turns 50 years old this year. \nThis is not the time to turn our back on Medicare and the universal \nnature of Medicare. We all understand and are confident that after \npaying into the system year after year or turning age 65 or meeting the \nother qualifications that we have means that health care will be \navailable to everyone, regardless of where you live, regardless of who \nyou are.\n  Medicare is a great American success story. Before Medicare became \nlaw, only half of Americas who were 65 years of age or older had any \ntype of health insurance. They could not find health insurance. Those \nwho found health insurance were paying through the roof to be able to \nget that insurance. Often times they were paying--they lacked coverage \nfor surgery or health expenses that occurred outside the hospital. You \ncould have one single surgery or illness and be totally wiped out.\n  So our country came together and said: We are going to make sure that \nfor seniors in this country, health care will be available to everyone. \nWe have done that. It is extremely successful. I am very, very \nconcerned about what this budget does to Medicare, as well as the \nbudget in the House of Representatives. First of all, let me say that \nthere is no question that Medicare, as with every other public program, \nwas designed to improve and evolve and be strengthened and add new \nthings--certainly for the security of future generations.\n  That is why the prescription drug bill was passed. That is why the \nAffordable Care Act--we took even better steps forward to make sure \nthere were no gaps in coverage under prescription drugs. Seniors today \nare spending thousands of dollars less out of pocket to get critically \nneeded medicines than they did before the Affordable Care Act. They now \nhave no out-of-pocket costs for annual wellness visits or for other \nprevention.\n  Now, in this bill that is undermined in two different ways. First of \nall, there is the Affordable Care Act, which 16.4 million people are \nnow using to get health care for themselves and their families, and \nmost of them, by the way, are people who could not afford health care \nin the past, just as seniors could not 50 years ago. All of them will \nlose their health care under this budget, the House and the Senate \nbudget. The changes that we made to improve prescription drug coverage \nand lower the costs to seniors will be gone. That was part of the ACA. \nThere are the changes to protect people, to be able to know that when \nthey have insurance, they are going to be covered when they get sick \nand not dropped. If they are sick, if they have a serious disease, they \ncan still get insurance even if they have a preexisting condition. All \nof the things in the Affordable Care Act are gone under this budget.\n  Now, interestingly, and as the distinguished Senator from Montana \nsaid, all of the revenue raised under the Affordable Care Act stays in \nthis bill. So they keep the money, but they take away your medical \ncare. To add insult to injury, because actually repealing the \nAffordable Care Act increases the deficit, the Affordable Care Act is \nexempted from the point of order that is required in the budget when an \naction actually increases the deficit.\n  So then you add to that what is being done in Medicare. The House \ncuts $150 billion from Medicare for senior citizens, by moving away \nfrom what has been the foundation of Medicare--which is a guaranteed \nbenefit. You pay in, and it is a guaranteed benefit. They turn it into \nsomething they call premium support.\n  The Senate proposes even more than that--$434 billion in cuts to \nMedicare over the next 10 years. They are not specified, but they are \nusing the same kind of language that relates to the security of the \nprogram and issues that in the past have been called vouchers--or some \nother change that all ends up in the same place, which is cutting \nMedicare.\n  Our children, our grandchildren know that grandpas and grandmas, \naunts and uncles, and moms and dads right now have health care because \nof this wonderful American success story called Medicare. It is \nseriously undermined in this budget. I would urge my colleagues to come \ntogether and send a clear message that we stand together in a \nbipartisan way to continue to support Medicare and say: Hands off the \nMedicare program and the promise made to our seniors now and to those \nin the future.\n  The Bennet-Stabenow amendment would create a point of order against \nlegislation and would require a supermajority vote on anything that \nwould privatize Medicare, would cut guaranteed benefits, increase out-\nof-pocket\n\n[[Page S1845]]\n\nspending or use premium support schemes to undermine the fundamental \nnature of what Medicare is.\n  Now, I also find it quite extraordinary that in the House budget, \nwhich is more specific, when the Affordable Care Act health exchanges \nare eliminated, two pages later in their budget, they create health \nexchanges for Medicare. Some would say: ObamaCare and Medicare.\n  This is a very strange debate we are having on health care. So we \nwant to make it very clear: Hands off Medicare. Hands off Medicare. \nWhether you are trying to privatize it in some way, turn it over to \nprivate insurance companies, vouchers, cut guaranteed benefits, \nincrease out-of-pocket costs, use what has been called premium support \nschemes to undermine Medicare's universal nature of what it is, stop \nit. Hands off Medicare.\n  That is what we need to be doing in this budget. I hope colleagues \nwill come together and vote for the Bennet-Stabenow amendment to \nguarantee that happens.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 755\n\n  Mr. President, I have a second amendment that is a side-by-side \namendment for the Barrasso amendment that will be called up later. I \nhave been asked also to move forward on that amendment as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and call \nup Stabenow amendment No. 755.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Ms. Stabenow] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 755.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to \n keeping the Federal Water Pollution Control Act focused on protection \n of water quality, to establish bright lines for Federal jurisdiction, \n and to create clear and unambiguous exemptions for features that the \n Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or the Secretary \nof the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, claim they are not \n                          seeking to regulate)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___.

Mr. President, obviously, I care very passionately \nabout Medicare and about health care, and I believe strongly that this \nis a fundamental right of every American. We do not decide when we are \ngoing to get sick. We do not decide when our children are going to get \nsick or what is going to happen to us as it relates to our health.\n  But another important part of health relates to the ability to have \nclean, drinkable water. The Clean Water Act has been a vital tool for \npromoting the health and livelihood--the economy--of Americans for the \npast 40 years. In fact, according to the EPA, the Clean Water Act has \nkept tens of billions of pounds of sewage and chemicals and trash out \nof our waterways. It has helped double the number of American waters \nthat meet standards for fishing and swimming. I can tell you that in \nMichigan, we love the Great Lakes. They are in our DNA. The ability to \nfish, the ability to swim--in fact, we have a $7 billion fishing \nindustry, in which my family has been a proud participant, and a $16 \nbillion recreational boating industry. The jobs of more than 800,000 \nresidents are supported by the economic asset of our Great Lakes, and \nwe want to make sure the Clean Water Act is strong.\n  Now, we also are very proud of agriculture in Michigan. We have more \ndiversity of crops than any other State in the country other than \nCalifornia. We are working on that. So we are able to do that, in part, \nbecause of the abundance of water, frankly. Unlike friends in other \nStates, the issues around water--clean abundance of water for \nagriculture, for ranchers, for forests, for farmers--have not been \nissues for us. We certainly want to keep it that way.\n  Now, last year the EPA proposed a rule to define the waters of the \nUnited States, basically to clarify two different Supreme Court \nrulings--one in 2001. After that ruling in 2001, the former \nadministration, the Bush administration, began working on a rule to \nclarify this question of the waters and regulating the waters of the \nUnited States.\n  Then there was an even more complicated, confusing decision. I never \nthought you could actually have five different decisions out of a nine-\nmember Supreme Court. But that is what happened. We ended up with even \nmore confusion in 2006. So both administrations--the Bush \nadministration and the Obama administration--understood, as does \neveryone, that we have to fix this. We have to clarify this, for \nfarmers and ranchers and for citizens and communities. I started in \ncounty government. I understand for local governments how important \nthat is as well.\n  So the rule that is before us now--the proposed rule--has been \ndebated for over 200 days, including 400 public meetings and over one \nmillion comments. I am not sure that is a record, but it is pretty \nclose--87 percent of which have been positive to moving forward. Now, \nthe proposal was not meant to target agriculture, but it has led to a \nlot of legitimate questions in my mind about the standing of \nagriculture's historic exemption under the clean water regulations.\n  So my amendment would help to clarify agriculture's role, while \nmaintaining important clean water protections. This is very important. \nWe can do both. We need to do both. We need to make clear the historic \nrole in agriculture as it relates to separate actions from the Clean \nWater Act, and we also need to have a Clean Water Act. So this would \nestablish a deficit-neutral reserve fund for legislation that would \nensure that the Clean Water Act is focused on protecting water quality, \nupholds existing exemptions in the Clean Water Act for agriculture and \nranching that have existed for decades.\n  Our farmers and ranchers deserve to have the certainty of getting \nthis done and having it done right and knowing that what has been going \non for decades for them will be the law of the land. It also ensures we \nrely on scientific evidence as we examine the impact that water quality \nhas on the different types of water bodies, and it provides certainty--\nas I said before--to landowners in rural communities regarding the \nscope of the Clean Water Act.\n  We had an important hearing on that yesterday in the Agriculture \nCommittee. Clearly, we need to provide that certainty for our farmers \nand our ranchers. Now, unfortunately, my colleague from Wyoming has an \namendment that appears to attempt to address this, but it is overly \nbroad and, frankly, unclear. It does not even mention agriculture. It \ndoes not mention the historic exemptions of agriculture, ranching, and \nforestry. It does not mention rural communities that may be affected.\n  So I do not believe that is the direction this Senate should go. We \nneed to be clear. We do not need more confusion; we need less \nconfusion. So my amendment clarifies the scope of any changes made to \nthe Clean Water Act so that exemptions important to agriculture are \nmaintained. The Barrasso amendment, unfortunately, would also roll back \nefforts to protect the health of the Great Lakes. All of us who \nrepresent the Great Lakes should be concerned about that--and the \nChesapeake Bay, the Mississippi River system, the Colorado River system \nand so many other systems around the country and all our sources of \ndrinking water for the United States.\n  I would encourage colleagues, when this comes up, to vote no on the \nBarrasso amendment, to vote yes on the\n\n[[Page S1846]]\n\nStabenow amendment, and to make it clear that we support the Clean \nWater Act, we support decisions being made based on science, and we \nalso want to make sure that the historic relationship with agriculture \nand the Clean Water Act is maintained.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 350\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendments and call up my amendment No. 350.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Blunt] for himself and Mr. \n     Thune, proposes an amendment numbered 350.\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To create a point of order against legislation that would \n            create a Federal tax or fee on carbon emissions)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST LEGISLATION THAT WOULD \n                   CREATE A TAX OR FEE ON CARBON EMISSIONS.\n\n       (a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the Senate \n     to consider any bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, or \n     conference report that--\n       (1) would result in revenues that would be greater than the \n     level of revenues set forth for the first fiscal year or the \n     total of that fiscal year and the ensuing fiscal years under \n     the concurrent resolution on the budget then in effect for \n     which allocations are provided under section 302(a) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974; and\n       (2) for any year covered by such resolution, includes a \n     Federal tax or fee imposed on carbon emissions from any \n     product or entity that is a direct or indirect source of the \n     emissions.\n       (b) Waiver and Appeal.--\n       (1) Waiver.--Subsection (a) may be waived or suspended in \n     the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (2) Appeal.--An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be \n     required to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a \n     point of order raised under subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this amendment. \nThis amendment is designed to create a point of order against a carbon \ntax.\n  This point of order would protect American families and workers from \nattacks on carbon, and attacks on their utility bills, attacks on \nthings that are absolutely essential for families--and for \nopportunities for families as we look at utilities and energy.\n  A carbon tax would increase the cost on energy. It would kill jobs as \nit increased the cost on energy, and make life for families more \ndifficult than it needs to be.\n  At a time when we are struggling to see our economy move forward, \nfamilies and job creators in Missouri and across the country need to be \nable to continue to count on affordable and abundant energy resources.\n  We have tremendous opportunities and more American energy. We need to \nuse that in a way that benefits families and benefits the future.\n  According to a 2013 Congressional Budget Office report, a tax of \nabout $21 per metric ton on carbon would raise the price of electricity \nby an average of about 16 percent in the country. In the State of \nMissouri, my State, it would increase, according to that 2013 CBO \nreport, the utility bill by 27 percent.\n  We are more coal dependent than many of our States, but apparently if \nthe average in the United States is 16 percent, all you have to do is \nadd that to your utility bill to see what kind of problem that creates \nfor a bill that, in many cases, families are struggling to pay already.\n  Twenty-seven percent in the fifth most coal-dependent State, \nMissouri, where 82 percent of our electricity comes from coal, adds a \nhuge and new burden that wouldn't be there otherwise as people try to \nrespond to this decision that the government could make to decide to \nmake it impossible to have the kinds of utilities that are now \navailable to families.\n  The National Association of Manufacturers, in that same year, 2013, \nfound that a carbon tax would lead to a loss of worker income and, in \nfact, would lead to the loss of jobs--the equivalent of about 1.3 \nmillion to 1.5 million jobs in the first year and as many as 21 million \njobs by 2053.\n  Now, more than ever, we need to send a clear message to the Obama \nadministration that we don't support a carbon tax as the administration \nmoves forward with regulations that, in fact, would have exactly the \nsame impact a carbon tax would have.\n  The Congress has said no repeatedly, privately, publicly, over and \nover again, to a carbon tax, but it doesn't seem to slow down the \nconstant desire to look at a regulation that could produce the same \nthing. These regulations are regressive, they have the most negative \nimpact on families that are struggling to pay their utility bill now, \nthey have a negative impact on the elderly, they have a negative impact \non people on fixed incomes, and they have a negative impact on public \ninstitutions such as schools and hospitals.\n  There is nobody but the ratepayer, the person who gets the utility \nbill--you and I, when we get our utility bill, everybody whom we know \nwho gets a utility bill--there is nobody to pay that utility bill but \nthem. These costs are passed along by the laws of every State. There is \nno mythical utility company that is going to absorb these new costs if \nwe allow them to happen.\n  The recently proposed clean power plan would, under section 111 of \nthe Clean Air Act, act as a tax on energy by making affordable and \nreliable means of electricity, such as coal-fired and natural gas-fired \nplants, more expensive.\n  Also, it would take plants that clearly had lots of life left in them \nand somebody has to pay for them. If those plants aren't usable, they \ndon't go away. Somebody still has to pay the bill, and the somebody is \neverybody who gets a utility bill.\n  These costs go directly to ratepayers, they go directly to consumers, \nand they have a real negative impact on the kinds of things we should \nbe looking for--ways to have a positive impact. These costs ripple \nthrough our economy. They inflict damage on consumers at all levels.\n  We saw what happened when gas prices went down just a little bit. The \ndecline in gas prices, with the opportunity we see now with more \nAmerican energy, suddenly families felt as though they had the first \nincrease that many families have had in the last 6 or 7 years, where \nincomes have been flat but outgo has been on the increase. When you saw \ngas prices go down, suddenly people were able to do things they \ncouldn't do before: one more meal out a week, newer shoes quicker than \nyou thought you might get newer shoes for your kids or yourself.\n  Those things begin to happen. But if you increase the utility bill by \n17 percent or 27 percent or more than that--if all of your utilities \ncome from coal right now, your utility bill is going to go up higher \nthan that if we go in this direction.\n  A carbon tax would have the same impact. The similarities are clear. \nThey are so clear, in fact, that under the so-called Clean Power Act, \nregional authorities and States were supposed to come up with their own \nplan as to how to implement it.\n  One regional transmission organization, the PJM Interconnection, \nsimply created an explicit price for carbon in the models it was using. \nWhether the administration calls it a carbon tax or not, everybody who \nlooks at how they are going to provide utilities knows that is exactly \nwhat it is.\n  If we want to grow our economy, we need to increase rather than \ndecrease. We need to encourage rather than discourage access to low-\ncost, abundant, available fuels, and find the cleanest possible way to \nuse those fuels.\n  We have seen great progress in this direction. We need to be doing \nthings that encourage that progress to occur rather than things that \nwill absolutely and with certainty increase utility bills for families \nand decrease job opportunities for young people.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment that will make a \ndifference. I am certainly grateful that my friend Senator Thune, the \nchairman of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, is \ncosponsoring this amendment with me.\n  I urge my colleagues to support its adoption.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S1847]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wish to try to, as we are about halfway \nthrough the budget debate, summarize where we are and the very clear \ndifferences that exist between my Republican colleagues and those of us \non this side. I think if the American people pay attention, the \ndifferences are very clear.\n  What some of us are trying to do is to take a hard look at the very \nserious problems facing our Nation and do our best to come up with \nsensible solutions to those problems. I think that is what the budget \nprocess should be about. What are the problems facing this country? \nWhat are the best solutions that we go forward with?\n  But, already, we have strong disagreements as to how we even look at \nthe problems facing the country. From my perspective, and I think from \nthe perspective, quite honestly, of the vast majority of the American \npeople, the major economic problem we face is a disappearing middle \nclass.\n  The good news is that compared to where we were 6\\1/2\\ years ago, we \nhave made significant progress. I think most Americans remember that \nafter the Wall Street crash--caused by the greed, recklessness, and \nillegal behavior on Wall Street--that at that point, as President Bush \nwas leaving office, we were hemorrhaging 800,000 jobs a month. That is \nhard to imagine, 800,000 jobs a month.\n  My Republican colleagues and I would agree and say the job creation \nnow is not as strong as it should be. Fair enough. I wish to see more \nthan 200,000 jobs a month being created. But no one will deny that \n200,000 jobs a month being created is a heck of a lot better than \nlosing 800,000 jobs a month, which is where we were when President Bush \nleft office.\n  My Republican friends say the deficit is too high. I think they have \na point. It is about $483 billion, a very high deficit. But I hope no \none denies that a $483 billion deficit is a heck of a lot less than the \n$1.3 trillion deficit that existed when President Bush left office.\n  When President Bush left office, the financial system not only in \nAmerica but all over the world was teetering on collapse. We learned \nlater, actually, that economists literally believed the system would \ncollapse. If you put your credit card into the ATM machine, nothing \ncomes out. That is where we were 6\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  Today, for better or worse, the stock market is soaring and the \nfinancial system today seems reasonably solid. No one denies it is a \nlot better than it was 6\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  So we have made some progress despite, I must say, consistent \nRepublican obstructionism, but we have made some progress. But I would \nbe the first to agree, with my Republican friends or anybody else, that \nwe are not anywhere near where we should be.\n  Unemployment has gone down. The official unemployment rate is about \n5\\1/2\\ right now. But let me tell you, the official unemployment rate \nis not the real unemployment rate. When you include those people who \nhave been given up looking for work and those who are looking for part \ntime, real unemployment in this country today is about 11 percent. \nYouth unemployment--which we never talk about, but it is a very serious \nproblem--is about 17 percent. African-American youth unemployment, \nwhich we never talk about, is much higher than that.\n  So what we are trying to do, as we look out and we recognize a \nproblem that says--the American people tell us in every poll I have \nseen that their most serious issue is jobs and wages. How do we create \njobs? How do those jobs pay us a decent wage?\n  Does anyone disagree with that? I don't think so. That is the issue. \nSo what have we tried to do in this process? What we on this side have \ntried to do is say: OK, how do we create jobs? What is the fastest way \nwe can create the millions of jobs our country and our economy need?\n  What economists tell us is the fastest way to create jobs is through \ninvestment in our infrastructure.\n  Does anybody, any Republican, Democrat, progressive, conservative, \ndisagree that our infrastructure is in a state of terrible disrepair--\nthat is, our roads, our bridges, our water systems, our wastewater \nplants, our airports, our rail systems, our levees, our dams. I don't \nthink there is any disagreement.\n  What the experts tell us--and I speak as a former mayor and concur \nwith the experts--is that when you delay work on infrastructure, it \nonly gets worse. If you do not rebuild a crumbling road, it gets worse. \nIf you do not rebuild a decaying water system, it becomes worse and \nmore expensive to repair.\n\n  So what have we said here on this side? What we have said is, let's \nnot kick this can down the road, which we have done for many years. \nLet's acknowledge the problem, and let's make serious investments in \ninfrastructure--rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges and rail \nsystems and water plants and wastewater plants, et cetera. That is what \nwe have said. And we brought forth an amendment, which I offered, which \nwould create some 9 million jobs in rebuilding our crumbling \ninfrastructure--9 million jobs over a period of 6 years. I think the \nway we paid for that $478 billion investment makes sense to most \nAmericans, who understand we have major corporation after major \ncorporation that pays zero in Federal income taxes because they take \nadvantage of absurd loopholes--loopholes that allow them to invest \ntheir money and put their money in the Cayman Islands, in Bermuda, in \nLuxembourg, and in other tax havens and pay nothing in Federal income \ntaxes. So we have said: Let's repeal those loopholes. Let's raise the \nrevenue we need. Let's invest it in the infrastructure. In the process, \nlet's create millions of decent-paying jobs. I would say that is a \nsensible response to the job crisis.\n  In terms of income and wages, I think everybody or almost everybody \nunderstands that the Federal minimum wage today of $7.25 an hour is \nliterally a starvation wage. It has to be raised. What we are trying to \ndo on our side is to raise the minimum wage, and I will have an \namendment to do that.\n  We are trying to deal with the serious inequities regarding pay \ndifferentiation in America between male and female workers. Women \nworkers are making 78 cents an hour compared to the wages paid to men. \nThat makes no sense. We brought forth an amendment--Senator Mikulski \nbrought forth an amendment to bring pay equity. That is an important \nissue.\n  We are also going to fight for reform of overtime rules so that \npeople who are making $25,000 a year--so-called supervisors at \nMcDonald's or Burger King--are not earning time and a half despite the \nfact they are working 50 to 60 hours a week.\n  So those are a few of the issues we are trying to focus on--creating \njobs and raising wages. I have to say, unhappily, that my Republican \ncolleagues have not been supportive of those efforts. What they have \nbeen absolutely persistent about is doing anything to cut Medicare, cut \nMedicaid, cut education, and cut nutrition. They will do anything other \nthan ask the wealthiest people in this country, who are doing \nphenomenally well, the largest corporations, which are enjoying \nrecordbreaking profits--they will do anything to prevent those groups \nfrom paying more in taxes even if it means massive cuts to programs \nworking families desperately depend upon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 777\n\n  Mr. President, with that, at this point, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe pending amendment be set aside and call up amendment No. 777.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders], for himself and Mr. \n     Whitehouse, proposes an amendment numbered 777.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS.

DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO PROVIDING \n                   HEALTH CARE TO VETERANS WHO HAVE GEOGRAPHIC \n                   INACCESSIBILITY TO CARE.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to providing health care to veterans who reside more \n     than 40 miles driving distance from the closest medical \n     facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs that provides \n     the care sought by the veteran, by the amounts provided in \n     such legislation for those purposes, provided that such \n     legislation would not increase the deficit over either the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through 2020 or the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through 2025.\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I would remind the Presiding Officer of the \nhearing we had yesterday dealing with veterans affairs and the \nopportunity we had to discuss the implementation of something we now \nrefer to as the choice act.\n  One of the successes and, in my view, one of the few successes we had \nlast term--in fact, with Senator Sanders being on the floor as well--\nwas the passage of the choice act. That legislation was Congress \nresponding to scandal within the Department of Veterans Affairs--the \nfraudulent wait lists, the lack of services available to veterans who \nwere waiting, and a number of veterans falling through the cracks. \nCongress responded and passed legislation now referred to as the choice \nact.\n  What that choice act said in simple terms is that if you are a \nveteran and you are unable to receive the services you need from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs within 30 days or if you are a veteran \nwho lives more than 40 miles from a VA facility, the choice act allows \nyou--in fact, requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide \nyou with services at home if you so choose. It is your choice.\n  That bill was passed by Congress in August of 2014, signed by the \nPresident in September, implemented since then beginning in November, \nand it is now March of 2015. What we have discovered during that period \nof implementation is there are a number of pitfalls by which veterans \nare not receiving the care we indicated they would receive following \nthe passage of that legislation. A lot of that problem is related to \nthe 40-mile provision. Again, if you live more than 40 miles from a VA \nfacility, the law says the Department of Veterans Affairs will provide \nyou with service, if you so choose, with a local provider.\n  A couple of things have happened. The interpretation by the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs of a couple of provisions has precluded \na significant number, in my view, of veterans from being able to \nutilize this choice program.\n  Yesterday, the Department of Veterans Affairs, to their own credit, \ndecided that they had been interpreting the law incorrectly. That \nprovision related to as the crow flies, meaning that the 40 miles was \nto be computed as the crow flies, and that was the way the VA \ndetermined they were required to interpret that provision. Yesterday, \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs decided they had the authority to \nreally make that 40 miles highway miles. So if you happen to live on \none side of a lake or one side of a mountain, it is no longer as the \ncrow flies. That is a piece of good news.\n  But here is the issue I have raised numerous times, and here is the \nissue that still remains a problem for many veterans. I smile when I \nsay this because there are not many lakes in Kansas and there are no \nmountains in Kansas, so ``as the crow flies'' is not a significant \nissue to most Kansans as it is in many other places in the country. But \nyesterday's decision by the Department does increase the number of \nveterans who may qualify for the choice act.\n  Among other things, what is still missing is the idea of a facility \nwithin 40 miles. The problem is this: The Department of Veterans \nAffairs has interpreted and continues to interpret that to mean even \nthough there is a VA facility within the 40 miles that does not provide \nthe service the veteran needs, it is still a facility within 40 miles, \nand thus the veteran will be required to transport themselves to a \nhospital 2, 3, 4 hours away.\n  I have said this before on the Senate floor. As a House Member before \ncoming to the Senate, I represented a congressional district made up of \ntens of thousands of square miles, larger than the State of Illinois. \nThere is no VA hospital within that congressional district. We worked \nhard to create outpatient clinics where routine services could be \nprovided closer to home for those veterans. Now we are saying: If you \ncan't access the care that is more than 40 miles from your home, the VA \nis going to give you the option of seeing your hometown doctor, being \nadmitted to your hometown hospital. But here is one of the problems: If \nthere is an outpatient clinic within that 40 miles, even though it \ndoesn't provide the service you as a veteran need, the VA says you \ndon't qualify for the choice act.\n  I am of the view that they have the ability to interpret that law \ndifferently. They say it takes a legislative change. I am not sure \nthere is a lot of value in continuing to have the debate about who is \nright about that. What I do know is there are many veterans in Kansas \nand across the country who are not receiving the services promised by \nthe choice act because there is an outpatient clinic within the 40 \nmiles, but it doesn't provide the service they need.\n  To give folks an understanding of what I am talking about, most \noutpatient clinics don't provide colonoscopies. So we have a veteran \nwho needs a colonoscopy. The VA is to provide that service. Yet, in the \ncase of where I come from, my hometown, the VA hospital is 3 hours away \nand the outpatient clinic is half an hour away, and because there is an \noutpatient clinic half an hour away, that veteran can't utilize the \nchoice act. But the outpatient clinic doesn't provide colonoscopies, so \nthat veteran is told by the VA that he or she has to drive the 3 hours \nto the hospital in Wichita to get the colonoscopy. Well, there is a \ncommunity hospital within that area, within that veteran's hometown \nthat provides colonoscopy.\n  That situation is what the choice act was designed to accomplish--\nservice provided at home. So this amendment creates a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund that requires the VA to utilize its current authorities to \noffer community care to veterans who are currently unable to receive \nthe health care services they need from a VA medical facility within 40 \nmiles of where they live because the facility they have won't or can't \nprovide the services they need.\n\n[[Page S1849]]\n\n  This is something we ought to be able to resolve. This amendment is \nwidely supported.\n  There is legislation--S. 207--which I have introduced and which has \nmany cosponsors, Republicans and Democrats, and we will continue to \npush this legislation. In fact, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs has \nindicated they will not only have the hearing we had yesterday on this \ntopic, but also the chairman and the ranking member and their staffs \nwill work over the recess to get this legislation front and center in \nour committee and, presumably, on the Senate floor.\n  This amendment is cosponsored by Senator Collins and Senator King of \nMaine. Senator Tester, Senator Blunt, Senator Toomey, Senator Hoeven, \nand Senator Vitter--Republicans and Democrats from States across the \ncountry--realize this is something which needs to be resolved.\n  While I believe the Department of Veterans Affairs should resolve \nthis, they haven't. While the Department of Veterans Affairs believes \nCongress should resolve this, we haven't. What I do know is veterans \nwho are entitled to care are not receiving it, and, in a sense, false \npromises were made until we get this issue corrected and the VA then \nimplements the choice act as intended.\n  This is an important issue. I would say to my colleagues, \nparticularly those who served in the Senate with me in the last 4 \nyears, in my view, we haven't accomplished much in those 4 years, but \none of the areas in which we did come together and did pass significant \nlegislation was the choice act. Now we need to make certain that \naccomplishment results in those who are entitled to those benefits \nreceiving them.\n  Who, I would ask, in this country would we expect to have the best \nquality health care? Who would we expect? I think it would be those who \nserved our country--our military men and women, those who retired and \nbecame veterans. And I would say that the employees and Members of \nCongress have the opportunity of choosing a hospital or a doctor, and \nour veterans ought to have the same opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to explain this \namendment. I ask for support when it is considered during the budget \nconsideration. I would ask my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring the \nunderlying legislation that will follow.\n  I thank my colleagues on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, \nparticularly the chairman, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Isakson, and \nthe ranking member, the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Blumenthal, for \ntheir commitment to seeing that this is accomplished.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to explain one more time why this is \nsomething of significance and how the quality of life of our veterans \nis affected not because we don't want to care for them but because we \nlack common sense to implement a law when we know how it should work, \nwe know what it should say, and yet we are impeded from accomplishing \nwhat matters so much. This is not a Republican issue; this is not a \nDemocratic issue; this is an American issue that mostly calls for \ncommon sense.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are engaged in an annual ritual on the \nfloor of the Senate--the budget resolution.\n  The budget resolution comes to the floor, and Senator Enzi of Wyoming \nand Senator Sanders of Vermont lead the effort to debate the budget \nresolution. This is not a law because it is never sent to the \nPresident. It is something passed by the House and the Senate that kind \nof says: The President told us we couldn't spend anything more than X; \nwe will tell you how we would spend it. It always is different from \nwhat the President suggested. So we get into a debate about how we are \ngoing to spend our Federal budget.\n  That is what a budget resolution is all about, and we have to make \nchoices--just as families make choices when it comes to things they buy \nfor their families and for their homes.\n  So I will talk about an amendment I am going to offer which gives us \na choice.\n  First, today on Capitol Hill we have visitors walking the corridors \nwearing purple sashes. If we look closely, written on those sashes it \nsays Alzheimer's Association. It is not unusual for us to get visits \nfrom people who are interested in medical issues--cancer, diabetes, \nAlzheimer's. The list goes on. They come here basically with very \nfundamental requests: Can you find more research dollars to help us \nfind a cure? Can you provide support to the families who are facing \nthis disease? I have faced that so many times as a Congressman and as a \nSenator.\n  I use this as an illustration, because Alzheimer's is a disease and \nan issue which is becoming more dominant in America. I am about to \nstate a statistic which I didn't believe when I heard it, and I went \nback and checked and double checked, and it is true. I have spoken on \nthe floor here about 3 minutes. In that 3-minute period of time, three \nAmericans have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. One American is \ndiagnosed with Alzheimer's every 68 seconds in America. It is a disease \nwhich is starting to gallop across our Nation and affect more and more \nfamilies. It is expensive, costly--costly, of course, to the victim who \nloses touch with the people they love and the life they want to lead; \ncostly, too, to the caregivers--the children, the spouses, and others--\nwho turn their lives around and start to care for the person with \nAlzheimer's.\n  Last year in America we spent $200 billion on Medicare and Medicaid \nfor Alzheimer's victims, and, sadly, the projection is that in just a \nfew years, we are going to see this figure surpass $1 trillion. It will \nliterally eat up the Medicare and Medicaid programs as we know them. \nThat is one disease, but it is one that is so serious that we have to \ntake it seriously.\n  I can speak in personal terms--and I bet everyone can--about cancer, \nwhat it has meant to my family, what it means to families all across \nAmerica.\n  Here is what it gets down to: Will we make a decision as a nation to \nmake the right investment in biomedical research? We have the best \nbiomedical research agency in the world--the National Institutes of \nHealth. Nobody questions that. The Centers for Disease Control is right \nby its side in the work that it does. The Department of Defense, \nVeterans Administration, even the Department of Energy, all do work in \nrelation to medical research and medical technology.\n  So the question that is posed to us--to this generation of Senators \nsitting on the floor--is this: Are we going to do further research in \nareas that can cure disease, alleviate human suffering, and, yes, \nreduce the cost to the government?\n  I have found this is the most bipartisan issue in the world. I have \nbeen all over Illinois, and we have a lot of Republicans, Democrats, \nand Independents. When I stop to talk about biomedical research, \neverybody is on board. The mother with the diabetic son, the father \nwith a wife suffering from some form of cancer--they are all on board, \nthey are listening. And they should.\n  What I will offer as an amendment here is generally just a marker. It \ndoesn't mean that medical research will be enhanced or grow in size, \nbut it basically puts us on record as to whether the United States \nSenate believes that we should invest additional money into biomedical \nresearch.\n  Why should we put more money into it? I went out to the National \nInstitutes of Health. There is a doctor out there named Dr. Francis \nCollins. I think he is one of the best. Francis Collins, back in 1988--\nif I am not mistaken--was given the task of mapping the human genome. I \nam a liberal arts lawyer, so I am lost. The human genome has something \nto do with our DNA and tells the people who research it a lot about us \nand diseases we are likely or not likely to have. So they mapped the \nhuman genome, which took years to do, and with that information they \nare making giant strides now in finding cures for diseases and \nbreakthroughs and identifying some of these issues.\n  We all read about Angelina Jolie and what she is going through with \nher fear of cancer. It is based on a family history, medical advice, \nand, yes, something that has been found in her DNA through the human \ngenome project that leads her to be more sensitive and worried about \nher own health. She is a\n\n[[Page S1850]]\n\nfamous actress, and that is why we pay close attention. But it applies \nto families across the board.\n  Here is the point I am getting to. We are falling behind in \nbiomedical research. In the last 10 years we have lost 23 percent of \nour spending power to fund medical research. That means that, 10 years \nago, one out of every three promising research projects was funded. \nToday, it is one out of six. I don't need to tell the Senator from \nMaryland, Mr. Cardin, because NIH is in his State, and he knows what \nthey do and he knows the researchers and Dr. Collins.\n  I went to Dr. Collins, and I said to him: What can we in the Congress \ndo to help you find cures for diseases?\n  Senator, he said, it is very basic: Give us 5-percent real growth in \nour appropriation for 10 straight years--5 percent over inflation. Give \nme that, Senator, and I promise you--I promise you, we will pay for it \nover and over in saving money on medical treatment, in alleviating the \nsuffering of disease that we face in this country.\n  That is what I am trying to do. The American Cures Act is legislation \nI put in to do that.\n  Well, what will it cost, Senator? It is easy to come up with some \nidea on the floor that is going to cost a lot of money and not pay for \nit. What will it cost us?\n  Over a 10-year period of time, a 5-percent real growth increase in \nNIH, CDC, and the other departments I mentioned, over a 10-year period \nof time as additional spending comes to $150 billion.\n  In that 10-year period of time, we will appropriate more than $15 \ntrillion in Federal spending. Work the decimal points. I am talking \nabout a tiny sliver of a small percentage that goes into medical \nresearch. And I am also saying that I am willing to stand here as a \nSenator and promise you that medical research will pay for itself over \nand over and over again.\n  I am of an age that I can remember the fear of polio--some folks with \ngray hair may remember that too--when, as a kid, kids were coming down \nwith polio, crippled by it, many of them living in iron lungs, and \nparents were scared to death. We didn't know where it was coming from. \nMy mother had a theory that it had something to do with water standing \nin the street:\n  Don't you go play in that puddle. You may get polio.\n  Who knew? No one knew. But we were afraid because we knew fellow \nclassmates who were getting polio.\n  And then, 60 years ago, along comes Jonas Salk. Every school child in \nAmerica knew that name. We didn't look forward to that shot; that is \nfor sure. But the notion that we would be liberated from the fear of \npolio, that was such an amazing discovery that it was national and \ninternational news. Medical research can do that. Jonas Salk did that. \nWe have done it over and over again.\n  So now, will our generation give up on biomedical research? Will we \ndecide that balancing the budget, eliminating the deficit is more \nimportant than a small contribution toward the National Institutes of \nHealth? I hope not. The amendment I will offer will ask the Senate to \ngo on record to support this effort.\n  Senator Moran from Kansas was here earlier. He has a similar \namendment. I am going to vote for Senator Moran's amendment. I hope he \nvotes for mine.\n  Let's be bipartisan about this. Let's find something we can agree on. \nLet's make it biomedical research. Let's make it a commitment to the \nNIH.\n  I know that people we represent in every State of the Union will say: \nYou did the right thing, Senator. Put politics aside. Give the money to \nthose researchers to find cures for those diseases. It is not only \ngoing to save us money; it is going to save lives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the budget \nproposal that has been offered by Senate Republicans, which will help \nNebraska families--and all American families--have a brighter future.\n  For far too long, families have been paying more and forced to expect \nless from an increasingly inefficient and out-of-touch Federal \nGovernment. While we have made progress, our economy is not where it \nshould be, and, unfortunately, the government's spending habits remain \nunsustainable.\n  Our $18 trillion debt isn't just a threat to our economic security. \nIt is a threat to our national security. It is time to offer bold \nsolutions and tackle these problems.\n  Republicans were sent to Congress to stop this irresponsible \nmentality--to stop wasteful spending, to balance our budget, and to \nallow our economy to grow and flourish. Families all across this Nation \nhave been forced to tighten their belts. Now it is Washington's turn.\n  I am here today to highlight some of these initiatives and to show \nwhat Senate Republicans are doing to safeguard the hard-earned tax \ndollars entrusted to us by the American people.\n  Back home, many Nebraskans are wondering how this budget will affect \ntheir families and their daily lives. With that in mind, the budget we \nhave presented will adhere to three basic rules--cut spending, balance \nthe budget, and do it all without raising taxes.\n  This budget cuts $5.1 trillion in spending over 10 years. The budget \npreserves the spending caps put in place by the Budget Control Act.\n  Like many of my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee, I believe \nnational defense must be the Federal Government's No. 1 top priority.\n  I have the honor of serving as chairman of the Emerging Threats and \nCapabilities Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee. I fully \nunderstand the very real threats that our Nation faces each and every \nday. But in order for us to ensure our military men and women have the \nresources and training they need to fulfill the missions that we give \nthem, we must make hard decisions and we must set priorities.\n  Some red lines just won't disappear. The red ink of our debt is here \nto stay unless we make some real changes.\n  Our budget preserves the needed pressure to compel Congress to make \nthose hard decisions in order to properly fund the security of our \nNation. This budget also provides much-needed resources for \ninfrastructure improvements all across our Nation. It does this through \na deficit-neutral reserve fund to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure \nwith a new highway bill in May.\n  The budget resolution provides this mechanism so that a bill can move \nforward, allowing authorizers to find either new revenue or offsets in \norder to extend the life of the highway trust fund.\n  Ultimately, the committees of jurisdiction have to write the policies \nand the deficit-neutral reserve fund gives them the flexibility to do \nso.\n  As chairman of the commerce Subcommittee on Surface Transportation \nand Merchant Marine Infrastructure, Safety, and Security, I know there \nis much work to do on our roads, our bridges, our ports, and our \nharbors. I also believe that infrastructure is another core duty and \nresponsibility of the Federal Government. For us to meet that \nresponsibility, we have to learn to live within our means.\n  Second, this budget doesn't raise a dime in taxes--not one dime. The \nanswer to our debt crisis isn't taxing hardworking Americans more. \nRather, the answer rests in a government that is wiser--a more prudent \nsteward of those tax dollars that every American entrusts us to spend \nwisely.\n  This is a very timely topic because millions of Americans are \npreparing to file their taxes right now. An estimate from the National \nTaxpayer Advocate in 2013 indicates that Americans collectively spend \n6.1 billion hours and $168 billion on efforts to navigate through our \nvery confusing Tax Code and to file their taxes.\n  Hard-working Americans--including many who work two or three jobs to \nsupport their families--should not be expected to dedicate these \ncountless hours to comply with all these burdensome requirements, nor \nshould they spend their money and have to hire expensive accountants to \ndo so. When the income tax was first ratified in 1913, the entire Tax \nCode was 400 pages. Today's Tax Code and the regulated rules now total \nmore than 73,000 pages. While these regulations cause stress and \nfrustration for families, they also create financial hardships that \nhold back businesses, and they hold back job creators.\n  Tax day is an annual reminder that our complex laws desperately need \nto be reformed. I remain committed to promoting a simpler, fairer tax \nsystem\n\n[[Page S1851]]\n\nthat provides certainty and one that encourages economic growth. \nMoreover, the vast majority of economists agree the single best way to \ncreate jobs and the single best way to generate economic growth is \nthrough comprehensive tax reform.\n  This budget sets us on a path toward that needed reform. It is my \nhope that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will work with \nus so we can accomplish this. Let's take a moment now and look at the \nPresident's budget proposal. His plan would raise taxes by $1.8 \ntrillion to pay for new spending projects.\n  I think the President's budget is tone deaf. It is tired. It is the \nsame old tax-and-spend policies that got us into this mess in the first \nplace. There is nothing in it that actually cuts spending or addresses \nthis mounting debt.\n  Under the President's budget, interest rates alone will triple from \nthe $229 billion we currently spend to more than $769 billion a year. \nLet me repeat that. We currently spend more than $229 billion per year \non our interest alone. That is going to triple to over three-quarters \nof a trillion dollars by 2025. That is money we could use to reinvest \nin our military, we could use to pay down our national debt or that we \ncould use to improve the Nation's infrastructure. I think the \nPresident's proposal is a recipe for a national disaster.\n  Our budget offers a realistic way forward. Importantly, this budget \nhelps to keep Congress on track regarding the appropriations process. \nFor the first time in a long time, Congress is meeting the budgetary \ndeadlines as prescribed by law. Passing appropriations bills on time \nallows us to provide the American people with more certainty in \nplanning for their futures.\n  I have been a Member of the Senate for 2 years. In that time, I have \nseen firsthand the regulatory burden that is hindering our small \nbusinesses and preventing growth. I have seen the regulatory burden \nthat hurts families and makes it hard for them to get ahead. Our budget \nprovides a framework to lighten that burden, to lighten that burden of \ngovernment and reduce the cost of responding to Washington bureaucrats. \nBecause of the spending reductions in this budget, the CBO has \nestimated the size of the economy will grow by 1.5 percent per person \nin 2025. That is going to provide an additional $1,200 in income to \nfamilies each year. That is the type of growth Nebraskans care about. \nWith additional money in their pocket, middle-class families can save \nmore and they can reinvest in their children and their future \npotential. They can buy a home. They can save for their kids' \neducation. They can put something away for their retirement or maybe \ntake a family vacation.\n  In order to make this budget work, we have to address things that \ndon't work. This week marks the fifth anniversary of ObamaCare. That is \na law that does not work. ObamaCare has been harming our economy and \nmillions of families ever since it was signed into law. I have been \ncontacted by over 19,000 Nebraskans who have expressed to me their \nconcerns and their frustrations with this law.\n  Passage of this budget provides Congress the chance to send a bill to \nthe President's desk to repeal and replace ObamaCare once and for all.\n  I would also like to touch on some of the amendments I will be \noffering and explain how they will help Nebraska's families and \nAmericans all across this Nation. My amendments cover a broad range of \ntopics from national defense to pay equity, education, and regulatory \nrelief. My amendments help families. They help families have more \neconomic security, and they ensure our own national security.\n  One amendment, which passed yesterday with bipartisan support, will \nbolster the basic principle of equal pay for equal work. It reinforces \nand it updates existing law to protect employees from retaliation for \nseeking information or discussing their salaries. My nonretaliation \nlanguage closely tracks one of President Obama's April 2014 Executive \norders on that very same issue. This is a commonsense approach to a \nvery important issue that impacts women all across our Nation.\n  I have also worked across the aisle with Senator Angus King from \nMaine on an incentive-based paid family and medical leave proposal. Our \nidea is not more one-size-fits-all redtape. It is a tax incentive for \nemployers, particularly employers of hourly and low-wage workers. It \noffers a limited amount of paid leave so workers can meet the complex \nfamily needs they have.\n  A common complaint I hear from Nebraskans is regulatory overreach, \nparticularly with the EPA. That is why I have offered an amendment that \nwould prohibit the consideration of greenhouse gas emissions under the \nNational Environmental Policy Act. The Obama administration has \nproposed guidance on how Federal agencies should consider greenhouse \ngas emissions and climate change impacts while conducting NEPA reviews. \nThis was not the intent of NEPA, and regulations like these could cause \nsignificant project delays.\n  In my home State of Nebraska, NEPA reviews already take far too long, \nespecially when it comes to our highway projects. Time and resources \nare being wasted on bureaucratic paperwork that adds no meaningful \nenvironmental benefit. My amendment would stop these burdens and end \nthe unnecessary process that would delay operations without improving \nenvironmental outcomes.\n  The American people want a government that abides by commonsense \nprinciples. It is our responsibility to ensure their money is being \nresponsibly used by this government, by us. Every day that we move \nforward and that we move our country forward, if we can not add the \nburdens onto the American people, that is a good day. This budget is a \nstep in that direction. It provides the right tools to rescue a \nprosperous America for future generations. We have a responsibility to \noffer a better future, to offer a better future than the one we were \nhanded. Let's step up to the plate and make that happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, a budget is the statement of the \nprinciples and priorities of our country. I have heard a lot of my \ncolleagues talk about specific amendments, some of which I support and \nsome of which I oppose. But I think it is important first to talk about \nthe underlying budget and what it stands for as far as the principles \nand priorities of America. On all counts, a review of the budget that \nis before us fails middle-income families in America. It doesn't invest \nin job growth or opportunity or U.S. competitiveness. It doesn't allow \nfor a growing middle class, particularly to narrow the wealth \ndisparities in America. It doesn't end sequestration.\n  Let me talk for a moment about sequestration. We have had a lot of \ndebate about this on the floor. Sequestration should never take place. \nIt is across-the-board, mindless cuts, no priorities. When we have been \nsubject to sequestration, we have heard from all of our agencies, how \nthey can't plan, how they can't enter into long-term agreements in \norder to carry out the missions they are responsible to carry out. It \ndoes not allow them the flexibility to deal with the current needs. It \nis wasteful. It costs taxpayers money, and they are not getting the \nbenefits of those dollars. When we take a look at the budget that is \nbefore us, it not only would maintain those levels, it actually \naccelerates some of the levels that would be established through these \nacross-the-board cuts.\n  Let me just give you the observations from the Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities, which is a nonprofit, nonpartisan research \norganization which wrote that the Senate budget ``cut[s] funding below \nthe already-damaging sequestration levels in the years after 2016 for \nnon-defense discretionary programs--the part of the budget that funds \neducation, job training, early intervention programs for children, \nbasic scientific and medical research, and transportation, all of which \nare important to increasing opportunity, raising productivity, and \nboosting long-term economic growth.''\n  This budget is also not right for our Federal workforce. It does not \ngive them the resources they need to carry out their very important \nmissions to the American people.\n  I want to underscore the fact that our Federal workers are the best \nin the world. They carry out their mission more efficiently and \neffectively than anyone in the world. My colleague Senator Durbin was \ntalking about the National Institutes of Health. He talked\n\n[[Page S1852]]\n\nabout the important research being done there, and they need greater \ntools in order to get the job done. I was meeting with constituents \ntoday on Parkinson's who say, look, there are exciting things \nhappening, but we need to fund the research. If we don't fund the \nresearch, we are not going to get the answers. We have the capacity. \nToday at NIH, one out of every six eligible grants goes forward, five \nout of six do not. A few years ago, it was one out of three. We are \nmoving in the wrong direction. This budget continues moving us in the \nwrong direction on research. I can mention, I will be talking to the \nAlzheimer's groups, as Senator Durbin did. They need to understand. \nLast week, the cancer advocates were here to find a cure for \ncancer. They encouraged us to increase this year's budget at NIH by $2 \nbillion in order to get back to where we were. That will not get us \nback to where we were, but if we continue with a $2 billion increase \nfor a few years, we could get back to where we were a few years ago. \nThe budget does not allow us to do it.\n\n  This past week, I was visiting AstraZeneca at their biologics lab \nlocated in Frederick, MD. They are doing exciting things. I mention \nthat because the research at NIH that will not go forward, as Senator \nDurbin pointed out when he was on the floor, not only affects NIH, it \naffects all the life science companies located in our communities. \nThese are great jobs. This is job growth that is being held down.\n  At AstraZeneca, they are working on the answers to deal with the \ndiseases based upon our own individual DNA. That is what biologics lets \nus do. That is being slowed down because of a budget that will not \nallow NIH to reach its full potential. The budget we have will not give \nNIH the tools it needs.\n  I could go to the FDA, which protects our food supply. We have the \nsafest food supply in the world, but they need the resources to carry \nout their mission.\n  I could go to the EPA. We all like clean water and clean air. The \nChesapeake Bay is critically important to my State, our region, and \nthis country. They depend upon the Environmental Protection Agency \nhaving the tools to protect our clean water and clean air. This budget \ndoes not allow for that type of resource so that we can reasonably \nexpect the mission to be accomplished.\n  As I pointed out earlier, it is also costing us economic growth \nbecause the partnership with the private sector is not there.\n  I will point out another part of the environmental risk of this \nbudget, and that is the EPA's popular Clean Water and Drinking Water \nState Revolving Loan Funds. All of us are fighting for those loan funds \nbecause our local governments need them to improve their drinking water \ncapacity, wastewater treatment facility issues. And we have had a \nmajority of Senators say: Let's increase those funds.\n  In Maryland, those funds improve critical water infrastructure, which \nin turn helps us protect the water quality of the Chesapeake Bay. A \nhealthy bay is critical to healthy Marylanders and a healthy Maryland \neconomy. Without the support from the State revolving fund, many small \ncommunities--and these funds go to small communities--that are working \nhard to reduce their wastewater discharge in the bay will be without \nthe critical financial resources they need to help protect the bay.\n  Our large jurisdiction, the city of Baltimore, has used the State \nWater Quality Revolving Loan Fund that has funded the EPA's Clean Water \nState Revolving Fund to upgrade the Back River wastewater treatment \nwork. Without adequate resources, they cannot move forward on that.\n  My point is, take a look at this budget. I understand their numbers, \nbut it doesn't tell us how we spend the money. We can't get the funds \nwe need under the caps that are imposed on the nondefense discretionary \nspending, including the programs I just mentioned.\n  This budget ignores tax expenditures. I think Americans would be \nsurprised to learn that we spend more money in the Tax Code than we do \nin the appropriations bills that are passed every year by Congress. \nYet, there is no attempt in this budget to rein in those tax \nexpenditures. There are many loopholes that benefit the wealthiest and \ngive incentives to companies to take their jobs overseas. There is no \neffort to rein in those types of wasteful tax expenditures. In fact, it \nhas made it worse because it makes room for additional tax breaks for \nAmerica's wealthiest. That is not what we should be doing. This is at \nthe cost of our most vulnerable. Because we have made more room for \nthose tax breaks, our most vulnerable are at risk.\n  I will give one example in this budget document, which is Function \n600. This category includes items such as SNAP, formerly known as food \nstamps, school lunch, and child nutrition programs. In the tax bill, \nthis category includes the earned-income tax credit, the low-income \npart of the child tax credit. The budget allows the expansion of these \ntax credits to expire in 2017, thereby resulting in tax hikes for tens \nof millions of working families and their children. The budget would \nmake major cuts in Pell grants, making it harder for low-income and \nmiddle-income families to send their children to college.\n  We had a debate on the floor about the cost of a college education. \nIt is much more difficult with this budget resolution, adding to the \nstaggering debt American families are currently incurring.\n  The budget fails to provide the resources so we can rebuild America, \nthe infrastructure investments. We talked on both sides of the aisle \nabout the need to increase transportation spending in this country so \nthe United States can be more competitive, create more jobs, and \nmaintain our existing systems.\n  In Maryland, we have two major transit systems we want to move \nforward. Anyone who has experienced the traffic in this region knows \nhow congested the traffic is in our part of the country. We have some \nhelp on the way with the Purple Line, but the budget that is submitted \nmakes it difficult for these projects to move forward.\n  I met with the people in regard to the modernization of our ports. \nThe Port of Baltimore is critical to the economy of our State. It is \nimportant for U.S. competitiveness. It creates a lot of jobs. The \ndredging needs of the Port of Baltimore and other ports around our \ncountry will be difficult to meet under the budget caps in this budget \nagreement.\n  Lastly, I have some initial observations about the overall budget \nagreement. It is partisan. There was really no effort made to come up \nwith a bipartisan budget. We should have done that. The American people \nwant us to have a bipartisan budget. It will not be the budget I want, \nit will not be the budget the Democratic Party wants, it will not be \nthe budget the President wants, but it will be a budget that will allow \nus to move forward, Democrats and Republicans working with the White \nHouse, to give the predictability this country needs and provide the \ninvestments so important for the growth of our middle class and for job \ngrowth.\n  I heard my colleague talk about the ability of this budget to allow \nfor the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. We just celebrated the fifth \nanniversary of the Affordable Care Act this past month. The budget \nallows for the repeal, but it is interesting in that it doesn't repeal \nthe revenues. It takes the revenues we put in place but repeals the \nbenefits. There is a little bit of irony in that. And it will clearly \nadd to the deficit. I will give the reason why, but they use a magic \nwand, so we don't have to worry about that. Why would the repeal of the \nAffordable Care Act add to the deficit? Because the Affordable Care Act \nhas helped us reduce the growth rate of health care spending in this \ncountry. You don't have to take my word for it; the Congressional \nBudget Office said that Federal health care spending between 2011 and \n2020 will be $600 billion less than they previously estimated. The \nAffordable Care Act is bringing down health care costs. It is bringing \ndown the Federal deficit. The Federal deficit through 2025 was adjusted \ndown by $400 billion since the January projection.\n  It is saving health care consumers, those of us who buy our insurance \nand use our health care system--it is now projected that because of the \nsavings between 2010 and 2014, the years of the Affordable Care Act, \nthe average family is saving $1,800 a year. These are results from the \nAffordable Care Act that this budget will allow us to repeal.\n  Look at the number of uninsured. It has been reduced by 16.4 million. \nWe reduced the uninsured rate by 35 percent.\n  We increased the number of individuals enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP.\n\n[[Page S1853]]\n\nThe increased rate is at 17.5 percent. In Maryland, that is 300,000 \nmore in those programs.\n  We improved insurance coverage. We now have much better coverage, \nsuch as coverage for preventive care and screening tests.\n  There are no caps. There are no annual caps or lifetime caps.\n  Parents can keep their children on their policy until age 26.\n  Those enrolled in the program get value for their premiums. If not, \nthe insurance company has to rebate the excess charges. Since 2011, $9 \nbillion has been rebated to health care consumers.\n  We ended preexisting conditions. If anyone doesn't think that makes a \ndifference, I have a story about two Marylanders, Jack and Akisha. They \ncame to my office last year for help in navigating the Maryland health \nmarketplace. In August of 2014, they were able to apply for insurance \nthrough a special enrollment period, but while waiting to hear back \nabout the status of their application, Jack suffered an injury. If that \nhad happened in 1995 or 2005, that might have prevented Jack and Akisha \nfrom obtaining the coverage they so badly needed. But thanks to the \nAffordable Care Act, they got coverage and it covered everything. There \nwas no exclusion.\n  Coverage is now affordable. Seventy-one percent of the people who got \ninsurance through the Maryland exchange got premium tax credits so they \ncould afford their coverage.\n  In Maryland, we reduced our uninsured rate from 12.3 percent in 2013 \nto 7.8 percent in 2015. We all benefit from that. It is not just people \nwho have insurance who benefit. Our premiums cover the cost of people \nwho don't have insurance. We don't have to pay for those people because \nthey now have insurance. There are fewer people using emergency rooms. \nWe are making health care more affordable.\n  Since we closed the doughnut hole, 8.2 million seniors have saved \n$11.5 billion. In Maryland, the average savings for a Medicare \nbeneficiary is $1,400.\n  There are no copayments under the Medicare system. The solvency of \nthe Medicare system is stronger today.\n  I think the most exciting thing about the Affordable Care Act is how \nwe are changing the delivery system in this country. Take a look at it. \nDeaths as a result of hospital-acquired conditions have been reduced by \n17 percent since 2010. These are circumstances such as ulcers, \ninfections, traumas, and falls--that has been reduced dramatically as a \nresult of the Affordable Care Act. Medicare hospital readmissions are \ndown. From 2012 until 2013, there were 150,000 fewer readmissions.\n  The Affordable Care Act is working. All of these facts make one point \nabundantly clear: The Affordable Care Act has transformed our country \nfor the better. It has brought quality, affordable care to millions of \nAmericans. It has expanded coverage for young people, minorities, and \nworking families. In a span of only 5 years, it has saved seniors \nbillions of dollars on their prescriptions, strengthened our safety \nnet, and recovered a recordbreaking $19.2 billion in taxpayer funds \nfrom those committing health care fraud. The Affordable Care Act will \ncontinue to save our country billions of dollars into the future, and \nthe budget we are acting upon would repeal that progress.\n  There are other aspects of the health care program that are affected \nby the budget, including the attempt to turn Medicaid into a voucher \nprogram--Medicaid, which is for our most vulnerable, our seniors, and \ntheir long-term care needs. I hope we would not want do that, but the \nbudget allows that.\n  The budget just doesn't add up. It creates deficits far beyond what \nwe can do other than to use a magic wand to deal with it. This is not a \nbudget we should be acting upon. A lot of amendments will be offered. I \nwill be offering some amendments. I know some of my colleagues have \noffered amendments.\n  First, I will point out that there are a lot of amendments that I \nhope we will not take up and pass. I urge my colleagues to take a good \nlook at them. I will mention one, although I could mention many that \ngive me a heartache.\n  Senator Barrasso, my good friend, has introduced a bill concerning \nthe waters of the United States. To me, it sends a signal that Congress \nis uninterested in providing the regulatory community clarity on the \nscope of the Clean Water Act. The proponents of this amendment used the \nvote to justify passing legislation, either through appropriation \nriders or stand-alone measures, to undermine the process the EPA is \nundertaking to provide clarification on the scope of the Clean Water \nAct. I question the stated purpose of the amendment to protect water \nquality.\n  We have a better choice. I thank Senator Stabenow for offering what I \nexpect to be a side-by-side amendment. The Stabenow amendment clarifies \nthe agriculture exemptions under the Clean Water Act while maintaining \nimportant clean water protections. These two goals are not mutually \nexclusive.\n  There are many amendments that have been offered. Senator Durbin \nmentioned one that I hope everyone will support on NIH funding and \nmedical research. I am working on amendments dealing with small \nbusiness. I am the ranking Democrat on the small business committee. We \nneed to help provide more credit to our companies.\n  The Affordable Care Act advanced oral health. I will be offering some \nadditional amendments on oral health and racial profiling. I hope the \nSenate will go on record on voter enfranchisement. I hope we will go on \nrecord to make it easier for us to reach the consensus we need to pass \nthese important bills.\n  When the amendment process is over, I must urge my colleagues to \nreject the underlying budget. What we need is a bipartisan budget, one \nthat invests in America's future with a growing middle class, keeps \njobs in America, and reforms our Tax Code. Working together, we can \nbuild a stronger, more prosperous America for all Americans.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 796\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up my amendment No. 796.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 796.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to \n                            saving Medicare)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO SAVING \n                   MEDICARE.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to extending the life of the Federal Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund, which may include the creation of a \n     point of order against legislation that accelerates the \n     insolvency of such Trust Fund, by the amounts provided in \n     such legislation for those purposes, provided that such \n     legislation would not increase the deficit over either the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through 2020 or the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through 2025.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to talk about the \ncurrent debate of the fiscal year 2016 budget. Isn't it wonderful we \nhave a budget that we have brought to the floor--something we haven't \nhad for I think it has been the last 5 years under Democratic \nleadership. Naturally, there are differences between both sides, but it \nis great that we are using this budget process and, hopefully, we will \npass this budget and go on from there. The House is going to pass \ntheirs, so I appreciate what they are trying to do over there as well.\n\n  First and foremost, I wish to thank the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for all his hard work in putting this product together. He \nhas done great work in producing a budget that I believe most Senators \ncan support, as well as finding a way to navigate some pretty \ntreacherous minefields along the way.\n  Let's look at just some of what Senator Enzi's budget will \naccomplish.\n\n[[Page S1854]]\n\n  The most striking thing about this budget is it balances in the 10-\nyear window, eventually reaching a $3 billion surplus. This shouldn't \nbe all that surprising, but given our Nation's recent budgetary \nhistory, to some, it is. President Obama likes to brag about all of the \ndeficit reduction that has taken place under his administration, yet \nthe President has yet to send a balanced budget to Congress. More often \nthan not, his claims of deficit reduction are measured against an \ninflation baseline that routinely ignores the fact that almost all of \nthe reduction can be attributed to increased revenues extracted from \nhard-working American taxpayers with precious little coming in the way \nof any spending cuts. The Senate Republican budget prepared by the \nchairman of the Budget Committee would achieve $4.4 trillion more in \ndeficit reduction than President Obama's most recent budget proposal. \nThis is a statement about fiscal policy, with the recognition that now \nis the time to get our Nation's fiscal house in order.\n  The budget accomplishes its objectives in a number of ways, most \nnotably by providing a path toward reining in our unsustainable \nentitlement programs. Let's keep in mind that when we are talking about \nour entitlements--Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security in \nparticular, just to mention a few--we are talking about tens of \ntrillions of dollars in unfunded liabilities over the long term. Ever-\ngrowing programs have us on a path toward a fiscal crisis that \nthreatens to swallow up our government and take our economy down with \nit.\n  The Senate Republican budget would allow us to begin to tackle each \nof these programs' shortfalls, offsetting much of the deficits, and \ngiving policymakers in Congress and the administration more room to \nwork toward lasting solutions to these problems. With each of these \nthree major programs, the budget would help stave off fiscal calamity \nand give us a real opportunity for long-term reforms.\n  Entitlement reform is one of the great causes of our time. If we are \nserious about bringing down our deficits and debt and ensuring the \nsolvency of our safety net programs, we cannot continue to kick the \nproverbial can down the road.\n  I have been disappointed with each of President Obama's budgets, none \nof which would make a dent in our entitlement programs. This budget \nbefore us this week would enable us to begin the process of finding \nlong-term fixes to these programs to ensure Medicare, Medicaid, and \nSocial Security still exist in the future for our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  In addition to putting our government on a more fiscally sustainable \npath, this budget would support strong economic growth and job \ncreation. Most notably, it contains a reserve fund designed \nspecifically for this purpose, which includes, among other things, \nlowering the cost of investment, reducing the costs to businesses and \nindividuals from the Internal Revenue Code, creating a competitive \nfinancial sector, and improving congressional budgetary scorekeeping.\n  Of course, the budget gives us a path forward on repealing the so-\ncalled Affordable Care Act, which continues to be an albatross on our \neconomy and on the well-being of hard-working taxpayers. I don't see \nhow anybody can make out a case that it is not going to take us right \ninto real difficulties, financially. It isn't going to work, either.\n  The budget specifically includes a repeal of Obama's tax on medical \ndevices. There is one for us. They needed $30 billion more, so they \nstuck in a gross sales tax on sales for all medical device companies. \nThat is an idea I am totally opposed to, and the repeal of ObamaCare's \ntax on medical devices is something I have been pushing for since the \nlaw was first enacted. Sooner or later we are going to win on that \nbecause it has to be taken care of. This budget does that. An \noverwhelming majority of Senators--79, to be exact--voted to repeal \nthis tax the last time we debated a budget in this Chamber. So I should \nnot be the only one who is pleased to see this particular provision \nincluded in the budget.\n  The budget also includes provisions specifically to repeal the \nindividual and employer mandates--causes that I have also championed \nhere in the Senate. As I said, Senator Enzi and his fellow members of \nthe committee deserve a lot of credit for the work he and they have \ndone thus far on the budget. I am very pleased to offer my support.\n  I am aware that given the partisan climate we are working in, this \nbudget has some detractors on the other side of the aisle. As I have \nlistened to their arguments against the budget over the past few days, \none thing has become pretty clear: My Democratic friends haven't come \nup with any new arguments in a long time. Rather than constructive \nproposals to help address our Nation's fiscal difficulties, our friends \non the other side of the aisle are content to simply continue \npretending that raising taxes is a fix-all elixir for all of our \nbudgetary problems.\n  Indeed, they have continued with the tired, debunked talking points, \narguing that every problem will be solved if Republicans will simply \nallow for modest tax hikes on the so-called rich. How many times have \nwe heard that? Yet even though our debt as a share of our economy is at \nlevels not seen since the years surrounding World War II, it is most \noften the case that when my friends call for more taxes, often under \nthe guise of closing unspecified ``loopholes,'' they want to \nimmediately spend it, ignoring the pile of debt the current \nadministration has accumulated.\n  We have been through that over and over and it is time for the \nAmerican people to wake up and realize what they are doing to us. This \nbudget helps us to understand that better.\n  I would wager that few reasonable people, if put on the spot, would \nseriously argue that the American people are undertaxed. Yet if we hear \nthe arguments coming from the other side, that appears to be their \nposition. Yet we are taxed at the highest percentage of the total \nbudget than we have ever been. So we have heard our colleagues lament \nthe lack of tax hikes in Chairman Enzi's budget, and we have already \nhad some votes on amendments to raise taxes. What we have not heard, \nhowever, is a plan that would line up all of my colleagues' spending \npriorities, which are vast and numerous, with enough tax hikes to cover \nthe cost. Until my friends on the other side of the aisle either \nproduce such a plan or acknowledge that there are not enough palatable \ntax hikes out there to pay for all the spending they support, no one \nshould take their arguments against the budget seriously.\n  Let's take a look at this chart. By my staff's reckoning, if we look \nat all the tax hikes my friends on the other side of the aisle put to a \nvote in the last Congress, including the so-called Buffett rule, taxes \non corporate jets, oil and gas, and others, they are on the record for \nsupporting about $69 billion in specific tax hikes that have not yet \nbeen enacted into law. Yet the first Democratic amendment to this \nbudget purported to raise taxes by $478 billion. That is $408 billion \nmore than what my friends on the other side have specified in the \nrecent past.\n  Now what does that mean? The Sanders amendment, which we voted on \nyesterday and almost all Democrats supported, essentially proposed to \nraise taxes by over $400 billion with unspecified tax policy. Perhaps \nmy Democratic friends would care to tell the American people how they \npropose to raise that $400 billion in additional revenue, where the tax \nhikes will come from, and who is going to get hit by them. I will not \nbe holding my breath waiting for an answer.\n  So the Senate Democrats' revenue raisers well is almost completely \ndry, as we see on this chart: revenue necessary for spending increases, \n$478 billion; the Buffett rule, $45.151 billion; the oil and gas, $16 \nbillion; tax compliance they say is $4.28 billion. If we look at the \nwhole thing, the total offsets are $69.5 billion. That is a new bill. \nThat is the total offsets they are talking about. It is unbelievable to \nme.\n  As I said, there are definitely people who want to criticize this \nbudget, but when it comes to taxes and revenues, the critics don't have \na leg to stand on.\n  I wish to speak for a few moments about an amendment to the budget I \nplan to offer this week. My amendment addresses the need for \ncomprehensive tax reform. The budget already includes a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund for tax reform and administration. My amendment would add \nmore detail to this fund to more fully describe what our tax reform \nefforts should look like. Specifically, it would make clear that\n\n[[Page S1855]]\n\ntax reform should be comprehensive and address individual, business, \nand international provisions of the Tax Code. It would also state that \nour reform efforts should be aimed at creating a Tax Code that is more \nefficient, progrowth, fair, and simple. It would put in place other \nprinciples for reform as well; namely, permanence, competitiveness, and \npromoting savings and investment. It would set forth goals to reduce \nincome tax rates while remaining revenue neutral.\n  As most of my colleagues know, I have been advocating for tax reform \nfor some time now. This amendment would set this effort off on the \nright path.\n  I will have other priorities to discuss when it comes to this budget. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues to get them adopted.\n  The Senate is doing good work with this budget. It is thankfully \nworking to fulfill its responsibilities. Once again, I wish to thank \nour distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee for his efforts on \nthe budget. I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to join me in \nsupporting this product.\n\n\n                          Medicare SGR Formula\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to speak about the \nongoing efforts in the House of Representatives to address the Medicare \nsustainable growth rate, or SGR, formula.\n  As we all know, the House is poised to pass legislation that would \npermanently repeal and replace the SGR with an improved payment system \nthat rewards quality, efficiency, and innovation. This bipartisan \nexercise represents what Congress is truly capable of when Members \ndecide to set aside their differences and work together.\n  Since SGR first went into effect, Congress has continually acted to \nprevent its reimbursement cuts from taking place. This has meant \nnumerous and repetitive SGR patches, usually cobbled together at the \nlast minute behind closed doors, much to the tremendous concern of our \nphysicians throughout this country. For years, this cycle has bothered \nMembers of Congress in both parties. That is why over 2 years ago, \nformer Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus and I set out to fix this \nproblem once and for all on the Senate side.\n  People said it was a lost cause and that our efforts were doomed from \nthe beginning. But in late 2013, we introduced our legislation and got \nit reported out of the Finance Committee on a voice vote. That bill, \nwhich was also drafted with the input and support of the leaders on the \nrelevant committees in the House of Representatives, formed the basis \nfor the legislation the House will be voting on this week. They deserve \na lot of credit for this. It has taken a lot of work to get to this \npoint, and we are not there yet, but we are getting close. We just need \nto finish the job.\n\n  The House bill is important for a number of reasons. Yes, it includes \nthe plan to repeal and replace the broken SGR system. I think everybody \naround here would like to do that, but there is more to it. The bill \nalso includes a 2-year extension of CHIP, the Child Health Insurance \nProgram that Senator Kennedy and I put through a number of years ago \nand a temporary extension of key Medicare extenders that need immediate \ncongressional action. This will give the relevant committees time to \nreform these programs in a responsible manner. It also includes \nprovisions to strengthen Medicare's ability to fight fraud and bolster \nexisting program integrity efforts. Most importantly, the bill includes \na downpayment on entitlement reform without any tax hikes.\n  For years, Members of Congress have been pushing for legislative \nfixes that will help rein in our unsustainable entitlement programs to \nensure they will be around for future generations. I personally have \nbeen working very hard in this effort.\n  In 2013, I put forward five separate reform proposals to Medicare and \nMedicaid that were designed to be bipartisan in hopes that I could \njump-start the legislation on entitlement reform. I shared those \nproposals with anyone who would listen and even some, including \nPresident Obama, who would not.\n  Today, I am happy to say that two of those ideas--the limitation on \nthe so-called Medigap first-dollar coverage and more robust means \ntesting for Medicare Parts B and D--are included in the House's SGR \nbill. For years, the idea of bipartisan Medicare reform seemed like a \npipedream, particularly since President Obama and allies in Congress \ndemanded that any changes to the program be coupled with significant \ntax hikes. But here we are, just a few votes away from enacting \nmeaningful Medicare reforms into law.\n  I commend Speaker Boehner and Minority Leader Pelosi for their \nefforts to reach a bipartisan deal on this legislation. They both \ndeserve a lot of credit, as do those who are voting with them in the \nHouse. In addition to the leaders of the relevant committees, their \nwork and their willingness to set aside partisanship for the greater \ngood has been vital to this effort. This has not been easy by any \nstretch of the imagination.\n  It was also encouraging to hear today that President Obama says he \nintends to sign the bill. Think about that. Specifically, he said about \nthe SGR legislation: ``I've got my pen ready to sign a good bipartisan \nbill.'' I commend him for that. It is my understanding that an official \nstatement of administration policy will be forthcoming. This is super. \nThis is something we ought to all applaud and be ready to do.\n  I am not here to say the House bill is perfect; of course, it is not. \nI am aware that some of my colleagues in the Senate are hesitant to \nsupport this package and have made public statements indicating as \nmuch. Ultimately, I think anyone who is looking for a reason to vote no \non the House bill could probably dig through it and find something to \noppose. This is true of any bill of this magnitude, especially in a \ndivided government. Although I do have to say that some of the straw \nman arguments raised in the past week or so against this legislation \nhave been interesting, to say the least.\n  I know there are Senators who have a vision of what for them would be \nan ideal solution for SGR, CHIP or any other parts of this legislation. \nIndeed, I have my own thoughts as to how I would like to improve this \nbill, but I have been around long enough to know that anyone who waits \naround for a perfect bill better be prepared to wait for a very long \ntime. We waited long enough for a solution on SGR. It is time to get \nthis done. This is a good bill and it is coming at the right time.\n  The time to act is now. I can't imagine another bipartisan \nopportunity like this coming around again any time soon, and I have \nbeen informed by Members of the House, that this is the last time they \nare going to increase SGR and take care of it. So we have to take this \nand get it through. Anyone who thinks we can continue to put this off \nto wait around for the perfect bill to come together is fooling \nthemselves. Make no mistake, if we don't do this now, we are looking at \nmany more years of last-minute costly SGR patches, and I have been told \nthe House is through. They have done their job, and it may be a long \ntime before you can get another patch, which means we have to do the \njob here or every physician in this country is going to hate everybody \nin this Senate. Well, they shouldn't hate everybody; there are some of \nus who are pushing hard to get this done.\n  Let's get this done.\n  I hope all my colleagues will support the House's SGR package, \nespecially if it is as big a vote as I have been indicating here today. \nI think it will be a big vote. I think they deserve a lot of credit. It \nsolves some problems we couldn't otherwise solve, and it also makes \ngood changes to some of our entitlement programs that are long overdue.\n  I want to commend Speaker Boehner and Minority Leader Pelosi. I want \nto commend them for the work they are doing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Over the course of the next few days, we are likely going to debate a \nseries of amendments relative to the ongoing nuclear negotiations with \nIran. It is my hope that over the course of this debate, on a handful \nof amendments that may be offered, that the way in which we conduct \nthis debate and the way in which these votes come out is going to unify \nus rather than divide us.\n  A lot has been made over the partisan division that has been created\n\n[[Page S1856]]\n\nover the past few weeks with respect to our support for negotiations, \ndespite the fact that we have all said--Republicans and Democrats--that \nour priority, our hope, is that we can divorce Iran from a nuclear \nweapons future through negotiation rather than through military action, \ndespite the fact that historically we have all tried to keep close to \nthe idea that politics stops at the water's edge, that we understand \nthe limitations of our ability to substitute ourselves for the \nadministration when negotiating foreign policy with foreign powers. So \nmy hope is that this debate unites us because there is a lot to be \nunited about.\n  The fact is we all understand the catastrophe that would be wrought \nif Iran was able to obtain a nuclear weapon. This is a country that has \npledged over and over again to wipe Israel, America's sacred ally, off \nthe map. This is a regime that has killed Americans, has sponsored, \nfunded, and organized terrorism all over the world. It is also not just \nabout Iran because we know what would happen in the region. Their Sunni \nrivals would have no choice but to become nuclear powers themselves.\n  The stakes are high and we are all united around the common belief \nthat it should be the policy of the United States and the policy of the \nSenate to make sure Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon, but I just \nwant to make a couple of additional points clear that should underscore \nthe debate we are going to have about that simple, unifying principle.\n  The first is that these negotiations that are occurring are about the \nfuture of Iran's nuclear program. They aren't negotiations about Iran's \nsupport for terrorism or Iran's role in fighting ISIS or Iran's other \nweapons programs. I know this is hard to hear because the resolution of \nthese other pressing issues is instrumental to preserving the security \nof America and our allies. But let's all be clear that this set of \nnegotiations is about the future of Iran's nuclear program, and for \nCongress at this point to step in and essentially move the goalposts \nand say we will only support the outcome of these negotiations if they \nsatisfy another set of concerns that we have--grave concerns about \nIran's policy in the region and the world--is disingenuous because we \nall supported a sanctions regime intended to get them to come to the \ntable and talk about their nuclear program. Frankly, it becomes easier \nto solve many of these other vital issues if we remove the question of \nIran's potential nuclear weapons program from the laundry list of items \nwith which we have great concerns about.\n  Second, let's talk about the role Congress can play and how, again, \nthat can be unifying if we choose to do it in the right way. If the \nnegotiations fall apart, then we are likely all going to stand together \nin imposing a new set of sanctions on Iran. I don't think there is \ndisagreement at all within this body about the fact that within days of \nthose negotiations failing, we will be back here imposing new crippling \ncosts on the Iranian economy. If this agreement succeeds and there is \nink put to paper, then this Congress reserves the right--has the right, \nhas the ability--to statutorily stop the implementation of that \nagreement from going forward, once we are able to review it and look at \nits parameters, conditions, and elements.\n  We don't need to vote on sanctions legislation today. We don't need \nto vote on legislation establishing our ability to review the agreement \nbecause we already reserve those powers. We already have the ability to \npass sanctions in the event of failure or to vote on approval or \ndisapproval in the event of success. But we aren't in the room \nnegotiating this deal, so if we want to respect our proper place in the \nconstitutional order, then I think it makes sense for us to look at \nthose who are negotiating who have said that a bright, bold, blinking \nsignal of division within the American political system would be \ndetrimental to negotiations.\n  I want to see the product of these negotiations so I can use my power \nas a U.S. Senator to vote them up or down, but if we take steps now, if \nwe vote on budget amendments that signal our support to take steps to \nundermine those negotiations by either precipitously passing sanctions \nlegislation or setting up a process of approval or disapproval before \nthe negotiations take place, then I am limiting and I am decreasing the \nlikelihood that I will see that deal. We have a role to play, but that \nrole comes at the end of these negotiations rather than in the middle.\n  Lastly, if we are serious that the policy of the United States is to \nstop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, then we have to be serious \nabout what the consequences of the failure of negotiations truly are. \nIt is disingenuous to suggest that there are credible and likely \noptions other than military action should these negotiations fail, \nespecially if the U.S. Congress takes steps that allow the world \ncommunity to blame us for the failure of those negotiations. Why is \nthat? Well, because the easy thing to do would be to simply reinstate \nglobal sanctions if the negotiations fall apart, try to squeeze Iran \neven more tightly. But that is unlikely to happen if it is the United \nStates that gets blamed for the failure of the negotiations. Why? \nBecause our partners in those sanctions will not join us. They will \nwalk away and either lift the sanctions or look to cut their own deals \nwith Iran.\n  It is easy to say we will just put the sanctions back in place, but \nit is impossible, at best very difficult, to do if we are doing that \nunilaterally. Let's be honest about what military action really means. \nIt means setting back Iran's nuclear program by 3 to 5 years, but it \nalso means setting off a catastrophic series of events in the region \nthat will do great harm to our allies, great harm to U.S. security \ninterests, dragging us into a conflict that in the end will not serve \nU.S. national security interests, especially given the fact that it \nwill only temporarily halt Iranian nuclear ambitions.\n  Now I still say we should keep on the table the potential of military \naction, but we should just be honest about the fact that if we take \nsteps to undermine these negotiations today, if we, the U.S. Congress \nare blamed for these negotiations falling apart, then it becomes \nvirtually impossible to put these sanctions back together; thus, giving \nus only one option, a military option, one that has grave and \nconsequential aftershocks for the United States and for our allies.\n  I simply come down to the floor knowing we are going to set forth in \nmotion a series of amendments, many of them surrounding the question of \nIran's nuclear program, tomorrow. I am hopeful the result of those will \nbe to signal this Congress's unity, a unity that we have expressed many \ntimes over that we will not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon and \nthat a negotiated settlement is the preferable way to do that, \nreserving for ourselves all of the inherent powers of this body to pass \nsanctions if they fail, to approve or disapprove the deal if the \nnegotiations succeed. The best way to disabuse Iran of the notion that \nthey can ever obtain a nuclear weapon is in the next 48 hours for this \nCongress to stand united--united in our position to guarantee a \nnonnuclear weapons future for Iran.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 352\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Roberts], for himself and Mr. \n     Flake, proposes an amendment numbered 352.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to \n                  Federal employee performance awards)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO FEDERAL \n                   EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE AWARDS.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to reform of Federal employee performance award and \n     bonus programs by the\n\n[[Page S1857]]\n\n     amounts provided in such legislation for those purposes, \n     provided that such legislation would not increase the deficit \n     over either the period of the total of fiscal years 2016 \n     through 2020 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2016 \n     through 2025.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, to get right to the subject, this \namendment would restrict Federal Government employees from receiving \nbonuses when they are delinquent in paying their Federal taxes.\n  During this time of budgetary constraint, Federal agencies are \nlooking for cost savings in order to avoid staff furloughs and cuts to \nimportant Federal programs. Given these constraints, the government \nshould not spend scarce taxpayer dollars by giving bonuses to Federal \nemployees unwilling--let me underscore ``unwilling''--to pay their tax \nbills.\n  We just learned this week that, according to the Internal Revenue \nService, as of September 2014, 304,000 Federal employees owe $3.5 \nbillion in Federal taxes. That is an increase of over $200 million in \ndelinquent taxes owed by Federal employees from last year. While most \nFederal employees play by the rules--the great majority--it is \nincredible that the delinquent tax debt of Federal employees has \nreached this level.\n  Let's look at one agency, everybody's favorite agency, the Internal \nRevenue Service. Last year the Treasury Department's Inspector General \nfor Tax Administration issued a report on the Internal Revenue Service \nbonuses awarded to personnel who have violated the tax laws or who have \nbeen subject to serious infractions of employee policy.\n  According to the Inspector General, close to $3 million was awarded \nto staff with violations on their records, with about half of that \namount going to people who have violated the Tax Code. Other personnel \nat the IRS received cash bonuses or other awards despite being cited \nfor drug use, making violent threats, fraudulently claiming \nunemployment benefits, and misusing government credit cards.\n  In fact, the report indicates that close to 70 percent of the IRS \npersonnel received some sort of personal reward. That is incredible. \nThat is remarkable when you think about the sorts of problems your \naverage taxpayer has in getting help from this agency. Under my \namendment, seriously delinquent--let me underscore that again--\nseriously delinquent people who will not pay their back taxes, Federal \nemployees, regardless of agency, would be ineligible to receive a bonus \nor cash award. However, if you make even the most minimal effort to pay \nyour debt or you are suffering a hardship, the amendment would not \nblock a bonus from being made. Awarding personnel bonuses to employees \nwho have continued tax liabilities today is unconscionable and should \nbe stopped. I look forward to support for this sensible restriction on \nawards given to employees who owe the Federal Government.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 462\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and call up Roberts amendment No. 462.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Roberts] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 462.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Mr. President, this amendment would repeal ObamaCare's \nmedicine cabinet tax. The health care law now prohibits individuals \nfrom using funds in their medical savings accounts, such as an FSA or \nan HSA, to purchase over-the-counter medications without a \nprescription. Fifty million Americans participate in FSAs and other \nhealth savings accounts. These accounts allow individuals to set aside \ntheir own money each year on a pretax basis to pay for health care \nexpenses such as copayments and prescriptions, or over-the-counter \nmedications.\n  Rather than promoting cost effectiveness and accessibility, this \nprovision instead directs participants to potentially more costly, less \nconvenient, more time-consuming alternatives. Further, it injects \nunnecessary confusion and complexity into a system that was previously \nstraightforward and easy for consumers to utilize. This provision of \nObamaCare restricts Americans' choice and flexibility in how they \nmanage their health care expenses and adds yet another burden on our \nphysicians. It should be repealed. Folks should be allowed to spend the \nfunds in these accounts as they see fit.\n  I hope for support for these two amendments when we begin the \nproceedings.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SPENDING-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO REQUIRING \n                   THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW STATES TO OPT \n                   OUT OF COMMON CORE WITHOUT PENALTY.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to prohibiting the Federal Government from \n     mandating, incentivizing, or coercing States to adopt the \n     Common Core State Standards or any other specific academic \n     standards, instructional content, curricula, assessments, or \n     programs of instruction and allowing States to opt out of the \n     Common Core State Standards without penalty, by the amounts \n     provided in such legislation for those purposes, provided \n     that such legislation would not raise new revenue and would \n     not increase the deficit over either the period of the total \n     of fiscal years 2016 through 2020 or the period of the total \n     of fiscal years 2016 through 2025.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this amendment No. 515 is in response to a \nclear and a growing and a dangerous trend, specifically for the \nDepartment of Education to inappropriately intervene and use carrots \nand sticks, and weapons sometimes, to intervene in State education \npolicy to promote certain agendas over the rights of the States.\n  This began in earnest in 2010 when the U.S. Department of Education \nbegan offering funding through Race to the Top grants to States \nparticipating in a State consortium working toward a ``common set of K-\n12 standards.'' Over time, it became increasingly clear that this was \nall about mandating common core and forcing it on States.\n  In 2011, the Department of Education took the next step. It offered \nwaivers to No Child Left Behind in exchange for the adoption of \n``college- and career-ready standards in reading/language arts and \nmathematics and aligned assessments.'' Again, this is clearly all about \ncommon core.\n  Now, during a time when States are facing increasing budget \nshortfalls and an inability to meet the progress requirements outlined \nin No Child Left Behind, funding and waivers were a very enticing \noption. They were a set of carrots and sticks that had an impact. This \nheavyhanded coercion of\n\n[[Page S1858]]\n\nStates to adopt specific standards and assessments is unprecedented and \nit is something we should all be against. It goes against the tradition \nof State and local control of public education.\n  My amendment specifically would create a spending-neutral reserve \nfund to rightly prohibit the Federal Government from taking similar \nactions to mandate, incent, or coerce States to adopt the common core \nState standards or any specific set of standards, instructional \ncontent, curriculum, assessments, or programs of instruction.\n  My amendment would also allow States who have already adopted certain \nstandards to opt out without fear of the Federal Government pulling \nback those incentives or grants or waivers. I firmly believe these \ndecisions should be in State and local hands. This is really crossing \nthe line into the Federal Government using coercive tactics in that \nregard. So I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 811\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and call up my amendment No. 811.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 811.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to \n   ending Washington's illegal exemption from Patient Protection and \n                          Affordable Care Act)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO ENDING \n                   WASHINGTON'S ILLEGAL EXEMPTION FROM THE PATIENT \n                   PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to developing methods that ensure that all Members \n     of Congress, the President, the Vice President, and all \n     political appointees of the Administration procure their \n     health insurance on the individual exchange in the same way \n     as Americans at the same income level, by the amounts \n     provided in such legislation for those purposes, provided \n     that such legislation would not increase the deficit over \n     either the period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through \n     2020 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through \n     2025.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this separate amendment is about a \ndifferent but equally important topic. It restores our pledge to \nAmerica that Congress as well as the President and the Vice President \nand their political appointees live under the same rules Washington \npasses on America, specifically with regard to ObamaCare.\n  This amendment is my ``no exemptions for Washington from ObamaCare'' \namendment. It says that Members of Congress, the President, the Vice \nPresident, their political appointees go to the exchange for their \nhealth care just like every other American does who is going to the \nexchange. No special rules, no special exemptions, no special \nsubsidies. We live by the law going to the exchange just like all \nAmericans.\n  This amendment specifically does not apply to congressional staff. It \nis about Members of Congress, the President, the Vice President, their \npolitical appointees. I think it should be the first rule of American \ndemocracy that what Washington passes on America, it lives with itself. \nSame way, same rules, no special exemptions, no special subsidies, no \nspecial rules.\n  We specifically passed that with regard to ObamaCare and the \nexchanges when we passed a Senate floor amendment in this regard. \nUnfortunately, after the passage of ObamaCare, and when Washington \nfolks understood what that language meant, there was a furious attempt \nto get out from under that language. That ended up resulting in a \nspecial Executive order and OPM rule promulgated by President Obama \nthat completely frustrates the clear language and intent of that Senate \nfloor amendment.\n  This budget amendment would say: No, we are going to live by what we \nsaid, and we are going to apply to ourselves ObamaCare and getting our \nhealth insurance on the exchanges, just as we would have that operate \nwith regard to all other Americans.\n  I urge support for this amendment as well.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I can \nutilize a felt pen during my presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, today I rise to discuss the budget \nblueprint we are debating here in this Chamber and that we will be \nvoting on here on the floor of the Senate shortly. In evaluating this \nbudget, this budget produced by my Republican colleagues, I am asking \nthe question: Is this a budget designed to work for working Americans? \nThat is just a simple core question.\n  If your vision of America is that you want families to thrive, then \nyou are going to design a budget for those working families to thrive. \nSo that is a key question as we discuss this blueprint. It is certainly \nclear that a budget designed to work for working Americans means jobs. \nIt means quality, affordable education. It means retirement security. \nIt means financial fairness for consumers. It means fixing a Tax Code \nthat is stuffed full of favors for the wealthy and well-connected and \ninstead directing resources to establish a foundation for working \nfamilies to do well and provide us all the foundation for raising their \nchildren so they can get a good start in life.\n  I thought we should go through and evaluate how this budget performs \non basic items related to the success of working families. We have here \na little scorecard so we can keep track. The middle-class budget report \ncard, Senate GOP budget. How does it do?\n  Well, let's start at looking at investment in infrastructure. Europe \nis spending 5 percent of its gross domestic product on infrastructure. \nChina is spending 10 percent. In America, only 2 percent. We are vastly \nunderbuilding our infrastructure, which means we are failing to create \ngood-paying jobs now, which is a foundation for the success of working \nfamilies, and we are imperiling the success of our future economy by \nfailing to make this investment.\n  Indeed, we have a huge infrastructure deficit. There is no effort to \naddress this deficit in this budget. Oh, the budget does have symbolic \nlanguage that recognizes theoretically the need to invest in \ninfrastructure but does not direct resources to that effect. So in \ncommittee and on the floor, we have offered amendments to say: Let's \nmake a real investment in this effort, not just happy words.\n\n  Well, in committee, it was rejected on a party-line vote, 10 to 12. \nThen yesterday on the floor Senator Sanders offered an amendment that \nwould take and direct a substantial investment to taking--closing \negregious tax loopholes--and directing those resources to building the \ninfrastructure in America. It would create 9 million jobs across this \ncountry. And what happened? The Republicans resoundingly rejected it.\n  Why is that the case? Why do they not see the need to invest in \ninfrastructure in America--voting, as we have, 45 Democrats saying yes, \nlet's invest in infrastructure, let's create jobs, and 52 of my \ncolleagues across the aisle saying, No way, no how, we are not going to \ndo the important work to address the deficit in infrastructure?\n  So, unfortunately, this budget gets an F when it comes to \ninfrastructure.\n  Surely, as we turn to education, we will find this budget does a \nsomewhat better job. We all understand that early childhood education \nhas an incredible return, so surely this budget invests in Head Start \nto give our children of challenged families the ability to start on a \npath to success. We know we have a world knowledge economy in which \neducation is essential. So, surely, this budget provides for more \neligible children to participate in the Head Start Program.\n  But if that was your assumption, you will be sorely disappointed, \nbecause this budget makes cuts to Head Start that would kick 110,000 \nchildren off the program over a 10-year period. It is direct damage to \nthe success of 110,000 children, and that is before you combine it with \nsequestration cuts. At that point the estimate is it would cut 620,000 \nAmerican children out of Head\n\n[[Page S1859]]\n\nStart over this coming decade. That is just wrong.\n  Let's turn to higher education. One of the biggest stresses for \nAmerican families is the galloping inflation in tuition and the \ndeclining ability of Pell grants to cover a small portion of that \ntuition for our most financially challenged families. So, surely, this \nbudget invests in Pell grants. I certainly would have expected it to. \nBut, indeed, we find it cuts $101 billion over 10 years out of Pell \ngrants. In other words, this budget is designed to continue to close \nthe doors of opportunity for our students from financially challenged \nfamilies across this country.\n  I believe in opportunity. I believe in the American dream. But this \nbudget, the Republican budget, believes in closing the doors on \nopportunity in this Nation. That is just wrong.\n  Well, Pell grants aren't the only component of higher education that \nhelps make college affordable. Another piece is low-interest loans. \nMost families are going to have to borrow to help finance higher \neducation. In fact, of those students who have college debt, the \naverage debt today, coming out of college, is about $26,000. That is \nthe average. Many of our children have debts at $50,000 or $75,000 or \n$100,000 coming out of a 4-year college. That kind of feels like the \nsize of a home mortgage as a millstone around their neck. So surely \nthis budget lowers interest rates on our students' loans so they can \nrefinance their loans to take advantage of the current low interest \nrates. Wouldn't that be a wonderful thing to do, to create opportunity?\n  We had a vote on this floor for an amendment to do just that, to \nenable our students to refinance, to take advantage of the current \nlower interest rates--and my Republican colleagues defeated that \namendment 53 to 46.\n  Not only that, but their budget has a provision that gets rid of the \nno-interest period when a student on a Stafford loan is in college and \ngets rid of the 6-month grace period--no-interest rate period--when a \nstudent graduates from college. This is estimated, for a student who is \nstarting college in 2015, to increase the cost of their interest \npayments by about $5,000 to $7,000 as they repay their loan.\n  So, Head Start, savaged in this budget--just simply wrong. Pell \ngrants, savaged in this budget--just simply wrong. Interest accruing \nincreased--and that is just wrong.\n  It is clear there is no commitment to education in this budget, the \nfoundation for opportunity. This budget, no question about it, that is \nan F on education.\n  Let's turn to another area. Hopefully we can get a better grade. Food \nsecurity. Food security for American families. A lot of families are \nhaving a very tough time putting food on the table. But what do we \nfind? We find this budget has a $660 billion reduction over 10 years in \nprograms that support low-income Americans, explicitly including the \nSNAP program--the SNAP program, the name we now use for food stamps.\n  There is a quote attributed to Queen Marie Antoinette, who was the \nwife of Louis XVI. During the French Revolution, she was reported to \nhave said, when told that the citizens were protesting the high price \nof bread because they were spending 50 percent of their income just on \nbread: ``Let them eat cake.''\n  That has become a symbol of a ruler completely out of touch with the \nchallenges faced by ordinary citizens.\n  So what do we have in this budget? We have in this budget provisions \nthat say to hungry children across America, to children of challenged \nfamilies across America: Let them go hungry.\n  So here, too, only one grade is earned by this budget in food \nsecurity, and that is an F for failing our children on food.\n  Let's turn from our children to our seniors on Medicare, for example. \nThis budget recreates the Medicare doughnut hole. This is the doughnut \nhole seniors fall into when they get no coverage to help them buy drugs \nafter an initial period in which they got some subsidies, and then they \nfall off a cliff into the doughnut hole.\n  Well, 53,000 seniors would pay more for their drugs in just my State \nnext year. That is about 5 million seniors across the course of this \ncountry who are now going to be ensnared in this doughnut hole.\n  Moreover, this budget cuts $430 billion out of Medicare. So whether \nit is getting rid of key provisions designed to help our seniors, such \nas eliminating the doughnut hole or simply solid investment in our \nhealth care program for seniors, this budget too gets a failing grade. \nThat is an F for failing our seniors on Medicare.\n  How about consumer protection? We have made a lot of progress in \nconsumer protection. We used to have consumer protection split between \na whole series of agencies. Of course, the key agency in all of it was \nthe Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has monetary personnel in the \npenthouse--that was really what they were paying most attention to--and \nfolks kept coming to the Federal Reserve and saying: Hey, there are \nthese new predatory home mortgages that are going to do enormous damage \nto families across the country, and the Federal Reserve had no response \nto this. They did not act. In fact, they had consumer protection locked \nin the basement of the Federal Reserve, and they threw away the key. \nThey were simply totally uninterested.\n  So back in 2009 and 2010, we said: Let's consolidate these programs \nthat have responsibility for consumer protection to one agency, the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, and let's make sure this agency \nhas the funding, like every other financial regulator, so that it can't \nbe essentially starved to death by those legislators who, on behalf of \npowerful special interests, don't believe in consumer protection. The \nCFPB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has returned $5 billion \nback to consumers who were cheated, and it has prevented billions more \nfrom being stripped away through other predatory practices.\n  So you would think that all 100 Members of this Senate would stand \nand say: We want a budget that strengthens the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau because it does so much that is right in America in \nending cheating, ending predatory practices against working Americans.\n  But, no, what we have in this budget is an effort to eliminate the \nfinancial independence of the CFPB. If you can think about it as oxygen \nto a scuba diver--folks want to be able to step on that air hose or \nconstrict that air hose, starve that agency to death. So this budget \ngets an F on consumer protection.\n  Well, certainly, since this budget does so much to cut food, cut Head \nStart, cut Pell grants, increase interest rates, fails to invest in \ninfrastructure, and it does so much damage to our seniors on Medicare, \ncertainly it is asking for some sacrifice from our richest Americans, \nsome bit of sacrifice from the corporate fat cats who are getting \negregious tax loophole benefits.\n  In particular, one loophole that I think drives every American \ncitizen nuts is a loophole that subsidizes the shipment of our jobs \noverseas. Can't we all agree to shut down that loophole?\n  Well, you would think so. But we had a vote on shutting down this \nloophole in committee, and a party-line vote said: No, we are going to \nleave this loophole in place.\n  So in terms of protecting American jobs by shutting down a loophole \nthat funds our adversaries overseas or our competitors overseas, this \nbudget gets an F.\n  How about tax fairness for the middle class? I have heard a lot of \nhappy words about fighting for the middle class. Is there something in \nthis budget that proceeds to say the best off are going to pay their \nfair share so that middle-class Americans get a better break?\n  In 1995, the richest Americans paid about 30 percent of their \nadjusted gross income in taxes. But by 2012, that rate had dropped to \n17 percent.\n  So does this budget rectify that? Does this budget say folks at the \ntop end should pay their fair share? No, it doesn't, not one slim dime \nextracted on behalf of fairness from the best off in our society.\n  So what we have here, attack the middle class, no tax fairness, so \nthere is an F grade on tax fairness.\n  Attack the middle class in every possible way. Attack the children, \nattack food security, fail on infrastructure, fail on consumer \nprotection, and proceed to protect all the egregious provisions for the \nvery best off in our society.\n  It is unfortunate to see such a dramatically terrible budget put \nbefore\n\n[[Page S1860]]\n\nthis body. I think the American citizens can only be deeply \ndisappointed to see a budget put forward intended to accelerate and \nincrease inequality in our Nation, destroy our jobs, ship them \noverseas, underfund food security, failure on investment for our \ninfrastructure, a failing grade all around.\n  We can do much better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am sure the Senator from Oregon is \nright. We can do much better. We sure as hell didn't do any better for \nthe last 6 years.\n\n\n                             Sequestration\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to talk for a few minutes--and I have a couple \nof my colleagues waiting, so I won't take as long as perhaps I would--\nabout sequestration.\n  Sequestration was a poison pill that originally was designed to force \nRepublicans and Democrats to sit down together and reach a bargain that \nwould entail increasing some revenues and also budget cuts. And the \nlooming axe that would fall out there was sequestration, which was \nbelieved at the time that because sequestration was so terrible it \nwould force the two parties together to come to an agreement. Well, we \nknow they never did, and we know now, ever since 2011, we have been \nliving with sequestration.\n\n  While we have been living with sequestration, the world has turned \ninto a place of enormous turmoil and threats to the security of our \nNation, which has escalated dramatically in those intervening years. At \nsome point, I would like to come to the floor, maybe later, showing the \nworld in 2011 and the world in 2015.\n  Thanks to a feckless foreign policy, leading from behind and \nabandoning our allies, this administration has caused the world to be \nin more turmoil and not in just the opinion of this Senator. Every \nwitness before our Committee on Armed Services has agreed on one thing. \nThese witnesses have been Madeleine Albright, Henry Kissinger, George \nShultz, Brent Scowcroft, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and I could go on and on. \nWe have had the smartest minds in America before our committee and \nevery one of them has said exactly the same thing, no matter whether \nthey served under Republican or Democratic administrations, they said \nthey have never seen the world in more turmoil.\n  So sequestration, if there ever was a reason for it, is long gone. \nThe fact is not only are we not going to be able to defend this Nation, \nbut we are going to put American lives at risk. That is not the opinion \nof this Senator from Arizona, it is the opinion of every one of our \nservice leaders who have, again, been before our committee.\n  So now we are not repealing sequestration, but we have this--and it \nis a gimmick--overseas contingency operations, which was not designed \nfor this but is now a way of increasing our spending on defense. I \nwould much rather have had us face the issues square head-on and \nincrease our defense spending in the normal way in the budgetary \nprocess. That didn't happen. So now as we begin our votes on the \nbudget, I am faced with two choices, and this body is faced with two \nchoices: either the increases in overseas contingency operations or go \nback to sequestration. Those numbers are not acceptable.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to go ahead and pass \nthis budget and give our military what they need. In fact, they need \nmore than what is in the budget before us, but at least it is some \nability to address the challenges to our Nation.\n  I just want to mention we are not only talking about the defense of \nour Nation, we are talking about the lives of the men and women who are \nserving in the military. In the view of our military commanders, their \nlives are being put at risk. I don't know how anyone in this body, no \nmatter how they feel about defense, could vote in a way that would put \nthe lives of the men and women serving in the military at greater risk. \nI don't know how anyone would do that.\n  All four service chiefs agreed, during questioning from Senator King \nof Maine, that ``American lives are being put at risk.'' The Secretary \nof Defense testified before the committee, ``Sequestration threatens \nour military's readiness, the size of our warfighting forces, the \ncapabilities of our air-naval fleets, and ultimately the lives of our \nmen and women in uniform.''\n  The National Defense Panel, put together with some of the brightest \nminds in America, said unless sequestration is reversed, ``the United \nStates could find itself in a position where it must either abandon an \nimportant national interest or enter a conflict for which it is not \nfully prepared.''\n  I don't know anybody who is more respected than Lt. Gen. Brent \nScowcroft by all, and he said:\n\n       Absolutely, I would [repeal sequestration]. It is a \n     terrible way to determine force structure strategy, or \n     anything like it. It's undermining our ability to do what we \n     need to do to retain . . . alert for the contingencies of the \n     world.\n\n  General James Mattis: ``No foe in the field can [wreak] such havoc on \nour security that mindless sequestration is achieving.''\n  General Jack Keane: ``Sequestration is not only irresponsible, in the \nface of emerging challenges, it is downright reckless.''\n  GEN Ray Odierno said the following:\n\n       Sequestration is the single greatest barrier to the \n     effectiveness of our Armed Forces--to its Training, \n     Readiness, and Modernization. I assure you that ending \n     sequestration is the most prudent measure we can take for \n     ensuring that our military is able to meet the demands of \n     global security now and in the future.\n\n  General Odierno went on to say:\n\n       The choices we must make to meet sequestration-level \n     funding are forcing us to reduce our Army to a size and with \n     limited capabilities that I am not comfortable with. If we \n     follow this path to its end, we will find a hollow Army.\n       If we do not have the resources to train and equip the \n     force, our Soldiers, our young men and women, are the ones \n     who will pay the price, potentially with their lives.\n\n  That is from the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army. The young men and \nwomen are the ones who will pay the price, potentially with their \nlives.\n  Gen. Mark Welsh, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, said: ``The \nvulnerabilities sequestration introduces into our force will encourage \nour adversaries, worry our allies, limit the number of concurrent \noperations we can conduct, and increase risk to the men and women who \nfight America's next war.''\n  Secretary of State George Shultz, one of the most revered men in \nAmerica, had this to say: ``Sequestration seems to me like legislative \ninsanity.''\n  Secretary of State Madeleine Albright: ``I'm very concerned about \nsequestration and the deep cuts that have been taken . . . I think it \njeopardizes America's military reach.''\n  The Director of National Intelligence said:\n\n      . . . just based on my best professional judgment and having \n     served in this business for a long time I'm very concerned \n     about it. And if we revert to sequestration in 2016, the \n     damage to the intelligence community will be quite profound.\n\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff:\n\n       In an age when we are less certain about what will happen \n     next, but quite certain it will happen more quickly, we will \n     be further away and less ready than we need to be. Simply \n     stated, sequestration will result in a dramatic change in how \n     we protect our nation and how we promote our national \n     interests.\n\n  Lt. Gen. John Kelly, the commander of U.S. Southern Command:\n\n       If sequestration returns in FY16, our ability to support \n     national security objectives, including conducting many of \n     our essential missions, will be significantly undermined.\n     . . . . I would tell you in Latin America, in Southern \n     Command, [sequestration] will be, just simply put, a \n     catastrophe. It will essentially put me out of business.\n\n  The commander of our Southern Command, who is responsible for our \nSouthern Hemisphere, goes on to say:\n\n       If sequestrations happen, I will be down to maybe one Coast \n     Guard, maybe two Coast Guard cutters. That means of the 158 \n     [metric] tons [of cocaine] I would expect to get this year, I \n     probably if I'm lucky will get 20 tons.\n\n  Admiral William Gortney, Commander of the Northern Command: \n``Sequestration targets both current and future readiness and risks a \nhollow force undertrained and underprepared for today's emerging \nthreats.''\n  My friends, I will come to the floor one more time with a map--a map \nof the Middle East and a map of other parts of the world where the \nUnited States is under almost unprecedented threat.\n  We are faced with the prospect of threats to the United States of \nAmerica and the men and women who are\n\n[[Page S1861]]\n\nserving it in uniform. We are moving forward with OCO, which is very \nunsatisfactory but a way through this at least for 1 year. I would \npoint out this is only for 1 year and that the ability of the Defense \nDepartment to plan is in great jeopardy. This makes it incredibly \ndifficult, but we are where we are.\n  I understand, as do my friends on both sides of the aisle, that we \nneed to increase defense spending and that there are a lot of needs in \nthe country. All of them are serious and compelling, but I don't know \nanything more compelling right now than what our military leaders have \ntold us, which is that we are putting the lives of the men and women \nserving in uniform at risk.\n  So I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as dire as the \ndeficit is, and it is a challenge to the future of our children as \nwell, right now we are facing a far greater risk. I hope we can pass \nthis budget with the OCO in it and then sit down and seriously work to \nrepeal this Damocles sword called sequestration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe quotes I read from earlier.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                      All Service Chiefs (1/28/15)\n\n       Each of the four service chiefs agreed during questioning \n     from Senator King (I-ME) that ``American lives are being put \n     at risk'' by sequestration.\n\n\n                Secretary of Defense Ash Carter (3/4/15)\n\n       ``Sequestration threatens our military's readiness, the \n     size of our warfighting forces, the capabilities of our air-\n     naval fleets, and ultimately the lives of our men and women \n     in uniform.''\n\n\n                     National Defense Panel (2014)\n\n       ``The defense budget cuts mandated by the Budget Control \n     Act (BCA) of 2011, coupled with the additional cuts and \n     constraints on defense management under the law's \n     sequestration provision, constitute a serious strategic \n     misstep on the part of the United States. Not only have they \n     caused significant investment shortfalls in U.S. military \n     readiness and both present and future capabilities, they have \n     prompted our current and potential allies and adversaries to \n     question our commitment and resolve. Unless reversed, these \n     shortfalls will lead to a high risk force in the near \n     future.''\n       Unless sequestration is reversed, ``the United States could \n     find itself in a position where it must either abandon an \n     important national interest or enter a conflict for which it \n     is not fully prepared.''\n\n\n                       Brent Scowcroft (1/21/15)\n\n       ``Absolutely, I would [repeal sequestration].

I assure you that ending \n     sequestration is the most prudent measure we can take for \n     ensuring that our military is able to meet the demands of \n     global security now and in the future.''\n       ``Should sequestration or sequester funding levels return \n     in FY16, the Army will have to further limit the readiness of \n     forces around the world while slashing Army modernization, \n     extending and postponing maintenance cycles, and standing by \n     as the conditions of our facilities deteriorate.''\n       ``With an increase in threats around the world that have \n     rendered some of our planning assumptions optimistic, we must \n     acknowledge that the FY16 post-sequestration spending cap, \n     which was set almost four years ago, has not kept pace or \n     accounted for an increasingly complex and dangerous world . . \n     . With the velocity of instability increasing around the \n     world . . . now is not the time to be dramatically reducing \n     capability and capacity.''\n       ``If we are forced to take further endstrength reductions \n     beyond the planned levels in the President's budget due to \n     sequestration, our flexibility deteriorates, as does our \n     ability to react to strategic surprise. We are witnessing \n     firsthand mistaken assumptions about the number, duration, \n     location, and size of future conflicts and the need to \n     conduct post-stability operations. These miscalculations \n     translate directly into increased military risk.''\n       ``A return to sequestration-level funding would require the \n     Army to size and equip the force based on what we can afford, \n     not what we need, increasing the risk that when called to \n     deploy, we will either not have enough Soldiers or will send \n     Soldiers that are not properly trained and equipped.''\n       ``The choices we must make to meet sequestration-level \n     funding are forcing us to reduce our Army to a size and with \n     limited capabilities that I am not comfortable with. If we \n     follow this path to its end, we will find a hollow Army.''\n       ``If we do not have the resources to train and equip the \n     force, our Soldiers, our young men and women, are the ones \n     who will pay the price, potentially with their lives.''\n\n\n                  Admiral Jonathan Greenert (1/28/15)\n\n       ``A return to sequestration in FY 2016 would necessitate a \n     revisit and revision of the DSG. Required cuts will force us \n     to further delay critical warfighting capabilities, reduce \n     readiness of forces needed for contingency response, forego \n     or stretch procurement of ships and submarines, and further \n     downsize weapons capacity.''\n       ``We will be compelled to go to fewer places, and do fewer \n     things.

It is also the least ready--less than half of our \n     combat coded units are fully combat capable. As Secretary \n     James and I testified a year ago, a return to sequestered \n     levels of funding in FY16 will multiply the number of very \n     tough choices we will be forced to make in our FY16 POM \n     recommendations. All of them impact our ability to do the \n     jobs the Nation, and the joint force, expect of us.''\n       ``We will not have sufficient force structure to meet the \n     fundamental requirement to simultaneously Defeat an \n     adversary, Deny a second adversary, and Defend the \n     Homeland.''\n       ``The vulnerabilities sequestration introduces into our \n     force will encourage our adversaries, worry our allies, limit \n     the number of concurrent operations we can conduct, and \n     increase risk to the men and women who fight America's next \n     war.''\n\n\n                    General Joseph Dunford (1/28/15)\n\n       ``In order to maintain the readiness of our forward \n     deployed forces, we've assumed risk in our home station \n     readiness, modernization, infrastructure sustainment, and \n     quality of life programs. As a result, approximately half of \n     our non-deployed unites, those who provide the bench to \n     respond to the unexpected, are suffering personnel, equipment \n     and training shortfalls. In a major conflict, those \n     shortfalls will result in a delayed response and/or \n     additional casualties. We're investing in modernization at an \n     historically low level.''\n       ``BCA funding levels with sequester rules will preclude the \n     Marine Corps from meeting the requirements of the Defense \n     Strategic Guidance. Sequester will exacerbate the challenges \n     we have today. It will also result in a Marine Corps with \n     fewer active duty battalions and squadrons than would be \n     required for a single major contingency. Perhaps \n     disconcerting, it will result in fewer Marines and sailors \n     being forward deployed in a position to immediately respond \n     to crises involving our diplomatic posts, American citizens \n     or interest overseas.''\n       ``The foundation of the all-volunteer force. . .is trust. \n     Sequestration will erode the trust that our young men and \n     women in uniform, civil servants and families have in their \n     leadership. And the cost of losing that trust is \n     incalculable.''\n\n\n               Secretary of State George Shultz (1/29/15)\n\n       ``Sequestration seems to me like legislative insanity.''\n\n\n            Secretary of State Madeleine Albright (1/29/15)\n\n       ``I'm very concerned about sequestration and the deep cuts \n     that have been taken. . .

And if we revert to sequestration in 2016, the \n     damage to the intelligence community will be quite \n     profound.''\n\n\n                          Ash Carter (3/4/15)\n\n       ``The prospect of sequestration's serious damage to our \n     national security and economy is tragically not a result of \n     an economic emergency or recession. It is not because these \n     budget cuts are a mathematical solution to the nation's \n     overall fiscal challenge--they are not. It is not because \n     paths of curbing nondiscretionary spending and reforming our \n     tax system have been explored and exhausted--they have not. \n     It is not due to a breakthrough in military technology or a \n     new strategic insight that somehow makes continued defense \n     spending unnecessary--there has been no such silver bullet. \n     And it is not because the world has suddenly become more \n     peaceful--for it is abundantly clear that it has not. \n     Instead, sequestration\n\n[[Page S1862]]\n\n     is purely the collateral damage of political gridlock. And \n     friends and potential enemies around the world are \n     watching.''\n       ``Under sequestration, our military--and our national \n     security--would have to take on irresponsible and unnecessary \n     risk--risk that previous Administrations and Congressional \n     leaders have wisely chosen to avoid.''\n       ``Allowing sequestration to return would deprive our troops \n     of what they need to accomplish their missions.''\n       ``All who bemoan unnecessary Pentagon program delays and \n     the associated cost overruns should know that sequestration \n     will only make these problems worse.''\n\n\n                        Martin Dempsey (3/4/15)\n\n       ``The PB16 budget. . .is what we need to remain at the \n     lower ragged edge of manageable risk in our ability to \n     execute the defense strategy.

Mr. President, when you walk into the capitol of \nColorado, there in that great rotunda is a mural on the wall by Thomas \nHornsby Ferril, and it starts out with a very simple phrase that reads: \n``Here is a land where life is written in water.'' So during this \nbudget I will be offering amendment No. 443 to make sure we are \nprotecting that lifeblood of Colorado--our water--and to make sure our \nState property rights, State law, is able to prevail against the \nintrusions by the Federal Government.\n  Over the past several decades, we have watched as the Federal \nGovernment has attempted to assert bypass flows or Federal reserve \nwater rights that impede our ability to carry out private water rights \nand to, indeed, protect Colorado private water rights. Whether it is \nthe imposition of a bypass flow on a ditch that is going through Forest \nService ground or perhaps the new Forest Service ski area water rule or \nthe groundwater rule they are now discussing, these are, once again, \nchallenges to the supremacy of State water law.\n  This government has a long history of yielding to State water law--\nmaking sure that State water law is supreme when it comes to how we \ncarry out and manage our State water rights. Over the years, bipartisan \ncoalitions in Colorado, Wyoming, and beyond have emerged to make sure \nwe are protecting our water rights, to make sure the Federal Government \nisn't coming in outside of our system of water law.\n  Colorado is extremely complex. We are the only State in the Union \nthat carries out our water law, our surface water rights in the way we \ndo. Unfortunately, whether it is the Forest Serve, the Department of \nInterior or the Department of Agriculture, other agencies have \ncontinued to seek their ways to impose a water right at the Federal \nlevel without going through the same channels, the same water law \nsystem that other people in Colorado do--people who by rights, by law, \nand by our constitution have the rightful ownership of Colorado water \nrights and water permits.\n  This amendment protects communities, businesses, recreationists, \nfarmers, and ranchers that rely on these privately held water rights \nand permits from Federal takings. The amendment recognizes the \nlongstanding authority to manage water according to our State law.\n  Today, water rights and permit holders face challenges, and this can \ncome to an end when we put into our budget our principles, our \npurposes, and our efforts in making sure we put policies forward in the \nnext several months that respects Colorado water law.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment, which is a vote \nto protect constitutionally held private water rights and permits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as many of us here have said before, a \nbudget is far more than simply numbers on a page. A budget is a \nstatement of values, of priorities, the kind of Nation we are, and the \nkind of Nation we want to be.\n  For Democrats, that means our budget should help us move toward an \neconomy that is built from the middle out, not from the top down, and a \ngovernment that works for all families, not just the wealthiest few.\n  When Democrats wrote our budget last Congress, we made our values and \npriorities crystal clear. We put jobs, economic growth, and the middle \nclass first. We replaced the automatic budget cuts evenly among defense \nand nondefense investments, with an equal mix of responsible spending \ncuts and revenue raised by closing wasteful tax loopholes used by the \nwealthiest Americans and biggest corporations. We addressed our long-\nterm deficit and debt challenges fairly and responsibly. And we kept \nour promises that we have made to our seniors and families.\n  The Republican House didn't simply accept our budget, of course. But \nI am very proud that coming out of the terrible government shutdown at \nthe end of 2013, we were finally able to break through the gridlock and \ndysfunction to reach a bipartisan budget deal that put in place a \nbudget for 2 years, prevented another government shutdown, and rolled \nback the worst of the automatic cuts.\n  That deal wasn't the budget I would have written on my own and it \nwasn't the one Republicans would have written on their own, but it did \nend the lurching from crisis to crisis, it helped workers, it helped \nour economy, and made it clear that there is bipartisan support for \nrolling back sequestration in a balanced way.\n  Our bipartisan deal was a strong step in the right direction, and I \nwas hopeful we could work together to build on it. But Republicans have \ntaken a very different approach this year.\n  Instead of building on our bipartisan budget deal, this Republican \nbudget would be a huge step backward. Instead of moving us toward a \ngovernment that works for all of our families, this budget would push \nus toward a budget that works for the wealthy and well-connected, but \nactually leaves the middle class and working families behind.\n  We know there is bipartisan support to replace sequestration in a \nbalanced and fair way. Not only did we prove that with our bipartisan \nbudget deal last time, but Democrats and Republicans across the country \nhave continued to come out against the senseless cuts to defense and \nnondefense investments.\n  But in this Republican budget--a budget that aims nearly 70 percent \nof all its spending cuts at programs that combat poverty, that cuts \nmore than $1 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid, that calls for a \ntotal of $5 trillion in spending cuts--in this budget, my Republican \ncolleagues couldn't even find a single penny to pay for more \ninvestments in education, research, or defense investments for this \ncoming year.\n  To put that in perspective, the budget agreement I reached with \nChairman Paul Ryan in 2013 found $85 billion in savings to pay for \nsequester relief over 2 years. That is less than 2 percent of the total \nsavings this Republican budget claims to have in it. And yet the \nacross-the-board cuts to both defense and nondefense priorities remain \nin place. Why is that?\n  Well, instead of using a tiny fraction of the enormous cuts this \nbudget has in it to pay for investments that both Republicans and \nDemocrats agree must be made, it relies on a gimmick and increases OCO \nfunding to appear to patch over the problem on the defense side, but \nthen doesn't actually allow for the increased OCO funding to be even \nspent, and does nothing at all for nondefense investments such as \neducation, research, jobs, and infrastructure.\n  I know our Republican colleagues are sincere when they say they want \nto find a way to increase the caps, especially for defense purposes, \nbut this budget in front of us today simply does not do that. Gimmicks \nand lip service are not enough for me, and I don't see why they are \nenough for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, especially \ngiven the deliberate choice not to use any of the $5 trillion in cuts \nin this to pay for some relief, a choice that should greatly concern \nanyone who genuinely wants to fix this problem.\n  So I come to the floor to offer another way--a way that would make it \nclear that we will in fact fix these senseless across-the-board cuts \nknown as sequestration.\n  My amendment builds on the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 and extends \nthe replacement of sequestration through fiscal years 2016 and 2017. \nThis amendment maintains the principle that Democrats will not \nabandon--that sequestration should be replaced evenly across defense \nand nondefense investments. And it builds on the idea that \nsequestration should be replaced with a mix of responsible spending \ncuts and new revenue raised by closing wasteful tax loopholes.\n  By providing Defense with real resources to replace the sequester \ncuts, it gets rid of the OCO gimmick that was added in committee.\n  Finally, it includes language to automatically release the additional \ndefense and nondefense funding to the Appropriations Committee upon the \nincrease in the statutory caps, similar to language that we passed in \nthe previous budget.\n  Now we all know there is going to have to be a solution to these \nautomatic cuts. President Obama has said he will not sign spending \nbills that lock in sequestration. And the fact is we simply can't make \nthe investments we need to make on both defense and nondefense if these \ncaps remain in place.\n  We should be able to give our appropriations committees the guidance \nthey need to write responsible bills at bipartisan levels, and not wait \nfor another crisis to hit before we come together and make a deal.\n  I know there are Republicans who understand how devastating the \nautomatic cuts are for our defense and nondefense investments. I know \nthere are Republicans who understand the value of investing in jobs, \ninfrastructure, education, and research. I know there are Republicans \nwho have seen the impact of sequestration in their States the way I \nhave seen in my home State of Washington. And I know there are \nRepublicans who look at this budget and wonder why it couldn't use some \nof the trillions of dollars in cuts to reinvest in American innovation \nor in our investments.\n  So I am ready to work with any Republican truly interested in \nbuilding on our bipartisan budget deal in a balanced and responsible \nway. I know my colleagues will stand with me because, to us, this is \nabout middle-class economics, plain and simple.\n  We believe that when working families do well, they spend more, they \nboost demand, and they grow the economy in a healthy and sustainable \nway. We believe when low-income families\n\n[[Page S1864]]\n\nare offered a hand up and an opportunity to get a job or earn more or \njoin the middle class, that means more taxpayers, less need for \nhousing, less need for nutrition support, and it means a growing \neconomy. We believe the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations \nshould pay just a bit more toward their fair share. And we believe that \nreplacing these automatic cuts in a fair and responsible way is an \nimportant part of moving toward an economy that works for all families, \nnot just the wealthiest few.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so we can agree now \non responsible and realistic top-line spending numbers for this year, \nso we can restore these investments in critical defense and nondefense \nprograms, and so we can start to allow the appropriations committees to \ndo their work and not wait until September for another crisis, another \ngovernment shutdown, and the whole country looking at us as if we can't \nmanage our way anywhere.\n  If my Republican colleagues have any other ideas for how we get this \ndone, my door is open, and I am ready to get to work. But I hope we can \nsupport this amendment when we vote on it later this afternoon so we \ncan get to work and not have another summer, another fall where the \nAmerican public looks at Congress wondering if we can't get our act \ntogether.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly on an \namendment I have already submitted in the budget bill, but which also \nqualifies as a ``Waste of the Week.'' So I am going to do a two-for \nhere.\n  As I have said previously, I am coming to the floor every week to \npoint out a waste of funds that, if eliminated and addressed, can save \nthe taxpayer a lot of money. We have the thermometer growing in terms \nof the amount of money we have been able to offer--in terms of programs \nthat simply are not working, can be reformed or changed or dropped, and \nsave the taxpayer a lot of dollars.\n  This week's waste addresses a well-intentioned Federal program that \nhas moved away from its original intention of addressing an important \nsocial need. Officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance \nProgram, or SNAP, this program is more commonly known to the American \npublic as food stamps.\n  This program started under President Kennedy in the early 1960s as a \ntemporary lifeline to those in need. Over time, the program grew. More \nthan 30 years later, the Republican Congress, with a Democratic \nPresident--President Clinton--reformed welfare in 1996. During that \nreform, they made reforms to the SNAP program, or the food stamp \nprogram by adding some qualifying information.\n  These reforms required that in order to qualify for food stamps, \nable-bodied adults had to register for work and accept a job if it was \noffered to them or go to a training program in order to qualify for \nfood stamps. That was in the law. It was a welfare reform program that \nwas supported by both Democrats and Republicans, under a Democratic \nPresident and a Republican Congress, and history has shown that it \nworked.\n  In 2009, our current President, President Obama, as part of the \nstimulus law, modified this program and put it in a position where it \nnow is spending a lot more money, and removed essentially those \nrequirements that were agreed to by both Democrats and Republicans. As \na journalist said: Today, SNAP is ``an open-ended income-supplement \nprogram that discourages work.''\n  According to the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Between 2008 and 2013, SNAP recipients grew by nearly 69%. \n     By contrast, the poverty rate increased just 16.5% during the \n     same period.\n\n  With our economy recovering and more job opportunities becoming \navailable, I have submitted this amendment to reinstate the \nrequirements that was agreed to, as I said, in a bipartisan way under \nPresident Clinton.\n  This legislation, if we make this reform, has been scored as saving \nat least $19 billion over a period of time--no small amount. It is good \nstewardship of our financial resources at a time when we need to have \nthat stewardship because of the credit crunch we are now in.\n  What we add here to the ever-growing thermometer that tries to take \nus to $100 billion of savings for taxpayers is a $19 billion chunk of \nsavings that has been documented as achievable simply by returning the \nprogram to the place where it was implemented by both Republicans' and \nDemocrats' support.\n  In addition to the aforementioned amendment, I would also like to \nvery briefly discuss two other important amendments I have submitted to \nthe debate on the budget bill now before us.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 595\n\n  Mr. President, I therefore ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that I be allowed to call up amendment No. \n595, and that the amendment be made pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats], for himself and Mr. \n     Warner, propose an amendment numbered 595.\n\n  Mr. COATS.

Mr. President, this amendment, which I will briefly state \nthe intent of here and which I have offered, along with Senator Warner, \nwould help to strengthen our cyber security defenses by calling for \nincreased sharing of information on cyber security attacks and threats.\n  Millions of Americans have been subject and impacted by cyber attacks \non companies and universities, to mention a few, and the Coats-Warner \namendment would help to strengthen our defenses against cyber attacks \nby calling for greater information sharing, but in a way that protects \nindividual privacy and civil liberties.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 368\n\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment \nbe set aside and that I be allowed to call up amendment No. 368, and \nthat the amendment be made pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 368.\n\n  Mr. COATS.

Mr. President, this amendment calls for States to have the \nflexibility to seek innovative Medicaid reforms that can both \nstrengthen the program and make more efficient use of taxpayer dollars.\n  My State of Indiana has been a leader in innovative Medicaid reforms \nand the advancement of consumer-driven health care under the leadership \nof our former Governor Mitch Daniels and our current Governor Mike \nPence.\n  I believe States should have the opportunity to innovate the Medicaid \nProgram by using flexible, accountable financing mechanisms that are \ntransparent and that hold States accountable for efficiency and quality \nhealth care systems.\n  This program, carefully developed under two Governors, has now \nprovided those in Indiana, of lower income, opportunities to enter into \na program that uses innovative, cost-saving techniques, but provides \nquality health care with participation by our providers and the \nhospitals, with participation by our State, and with requirements that \ngive the consumer more choices and provide for more quality of care. It \nis something that I think can serve as a model as we go forward trying \nto address our health care needs and reform of the Affordable Care Act \nor repeal with suggested substitutes that will achieve the goals of \nproviding quality care to people who are of low income but at a much \nlower price and with much less regulation than is currently within the \nACA.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 545\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I would like to speak on my amendment, No. \n545, which is an amendment that stands for the principle of building on \nthe work of the bipartisan Menendez-Kirk legislation to call for \nconsequences should Iran cheat on its obligations of the agreement with \nthe United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, we should stand for the principle \nremembering the 290 Americans who have died at the hands of Iranian \nterror, including 13 Americans from Illinois. Let me read their names: \nJames Lewis from Illinois, William Sheil from Illinois, Alvin Belmer, \nDavid Gay from Illinois, Joseph Livingston from Illinois, John A. \nPhillips, Jr., who went to church with me, Eric Pullman, and Gary R. \nScott--all killed at the hands of Iranian terror. In the memory of \nthese Americans, we want to make sure we carry out a sense of the \nSenate that expresses our views that if Iran cheats on this agreement, \nthere should be sanctions.\n  I call on all Members to make sure they back the old bipartisan \ncoalition of Menendez-Kirk.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until \n4:45 p.m. today be equally divided between the managers or their \ndesignees, and that at 4:45 p.m., the Senate vote in relation to the \nfollowing amendments in the order listed, with no second-degree \namendments in order prior to the votes: Stabenow No. 755; Barrasso No. \n347; Sanders No. 777, as modified, on climate change; Blunt No. 350 on \nEPA; Hatch No. 796 on Medicare; Bennet-Stabenow No. 601 on Medicare; \nMurray No. 801 on sequester replacement; Cotton No. 481 on Israel.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided between the managers or their designees prior to each vote, and \nthat all votes after the first in this series be 10 minutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. For the information of all Senators, there will be up to \neight rollcall votes at 4:45 p.m. I allocate time to the Senator from \nMontana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 388\n\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, last night, I offered amendment No. 388, \nto ensure the States and local governments are the driving force behind \nthe national monument designations. I ask unanimous consent to add \nSenator Hatch as a cosponsor to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAINES. This is a fair and commonsense proposal that I believe \nMembers on both sides of the aisle can support. Before major land \ndecisions are made by the Federal Government, the people affected most \nby these decisions should have a seat at the table and have their \nvoices heard. I was confused when I heard the senior Senator from \nNevada claim this morning that my amendment would in some way gut or \nrepeal law, providing the ability for national monument designations to \ntake place. That is simply false. In sharp contrast, it is designated \nto strengthen the law by ensuring that the voice of the people is heard \nas designations are considered. After all, it is the people who are \naffected by these decisions, not politicians in Washington.\n  As a fifth-generation Montanan and a lifelong sportsman, I treasure \nand am committed to protecting our public lands. I deeply appreciate \nthat landmarks like Pompeys Pillar in Montana or Lehman's Cave in \nNevada have been protected for future generations. But there is a \ndifference between targeted designations to protect historic landmarks \nand designating hundreds or even thousands or millions of acres against \nthe will of the States and local residents.\n  The Senator from Nevada is saying that Washington, DC, should have \nmore influence over local land use decisions than the folks in Western \nStates who live and work on this land every day. I disagree. I believe \nthe farmers, the ranchers, the sportsmen, the community members, and \nthe State and local governments should have a say in local land \ndecisions. I remind him the 1906 act was designed to prevent damage to \nspecific sites of historical, scientific or cultural significance.\n  As the law States, ``. . . the smallest area compatible with the \nproper care in management of objects to be protected.'' The law was not \nintended to block out access or damage operation of nearby landowners. \nThe law was not intended to be used as a way for a President, as they \nare leaving office, to unilaterally make decisions without consulting \nthe States in the local communities.\n  Strengthening the role of locally impacted residents and States is \nvitally important because, unfortunately, Presidents of both parties \nhave also abused the Antiquities Act, designating unjustifiably \nexcessive, large-scale pieces of ground through unilateral action \ndespite local opposition from land users.\n  Let me remind the Senator from Nevada of the Grand Staircase-\nEscalante National Monument designation. Local residents oppose that \ndesignation. Since the monument was designated in 1996, there has been \na reduction in grazing. Development of a large coal mine has stopped. \nLocal rural communities are struggling.\n  Wouldn't it have been better to protect the Grand Staircase in a way \nthat also protected local communities? Look to New Mexico, where the \nOrgan Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument was designated in 2014 \nMay against the will of local communities.\n  Representative Steve Pearce had a bill to protect 50,000 acres of \nland, which he worked with local residents and affected communities to \nimplement. That bill was ignored, and the administration instead \nintroduced a monument of 500,000 acres that touches all the way to the \nMexican border.\n  During President Obama's first term, an internal document surfaced \nfrom the Interior Department revealing the Obama administration's plans \nto use the Antiquities Act to designate 14 new national monuments, \ncomprising millions of acres across our country. One of the areas on \nthe list is 2.5 million acres of land across northern Montana, \nconnecting Canada's Grasslands National Park to the Bitter Creek \nWilderness Study Area. Right in the middle of this designation are \nsignificant swaths of public lands. This potential designation is very \ncontentious in Montana, which I believe Montanans must have a voice in \ndetermining whether it goes forward.\n\n[[Page S1866]]\n\n  During a recent House Natural Resources Committee hearing, Interior \nSecretary Sally Jewell confirmed that she wants public input and local \ninput in Antiquities Act designations. So why would anyone oppose \nelevating State and local input in these designations?\n  Despite the claims made by the Senator from Nevada, my amendment will \nnot repeal the Antiquities Act. It is not going to gut the law. It will \nnot repeal existing protections on our national parks and national \nmonuments. It will not prevent future designations from being made. My \namendment simply ensures that local residents and the States have a \nmeaningful voice in determining monument designations.\n  In 2010, former Interior Secretary Salazar stated during a Senate \nhearing that the administration would have a conversation and dialogue \nwith people locally and across the country before any monument \ndesignations occur.\n  My amendment simply holds this and future administrations accountable \nto what they said they would do, and it protects the voice of the \npeople in decisions such as this. Protecting the voice of the people \nshould not offend Members of this body. It should be our abiding \ncommitment. It should be our priority.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 465\n\n  Mr. DAINES.

Mr. President, article I, section 8, clause 7, of the \nU.S. Constitution specifically provides for the establishment of the \nU.S. Postal Service. However, the Postal Service currently teeters on \nthe brink of insolvency. In fact, a January 2015 Congressional Research \nService report states that the Postal Service has reached its statutory \nborrowing limit of $15 billion and has run up more than $40 billion in \ndeficits since fiscal year 2007. However in the midst of the Postal \nService's financially tenuous circumstance, State and national \npolitical committees are granted postal discounts which can amount to \nas high as a 26-percent reduction in the standard rate paid by \nnonprivileged users.\n  Congress would do well to put State and national local committees on \nthe same playing field as ordinary Americans. The Postal Service would \ncertainly benefit from these groups paying the ordinary postage rate. \nParticularly in rural States like Montana, the Postal Service plays an \nimportant role in the vitality of our communities, and it connects \npeople. Accordingly, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting \nbudget amendment No. 387, which would signal the Senate's willingness \nto address the postage discount it provides to State and national \npolitical committees.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nRepublican budget resolution. I would ask--there are time restraints \nhere. I will go as far in my speech as I can and then ask the remainder \nbe included in the Record.\n  Mr. SANDERS. The Senator has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Please let me know--is that done without objection?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Can the Presiding Officer tell me when 7 minutes have \nelapsed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, the budget the Republicans in the Senate \nhave presented us with imagines a future where we give even more tax \nbreaks to millionaires and special interests, while pulling the rug out \nfrom under working families. Instead of addressing the major challenge \nfacing our Nation today--that middle-class families continue to face an \neconomy rigged against them and their efforts to attain a better future \nfor themselves and their family--this budget is fundamentally \nmisaligned with the values of working Americans.\n  Over the last 30 years, we have seen Wall Street and giant \ncorporations make record profits and middle-class families have been \nleft behind. According to the Economic Policy Institute, over the last \n30 years, wages for the top 1 percent rose almost 10 times as fast as \nthose for the bottom 90 percent. Last year, Oxfam calculated that the \n400 wealthiest individuals in our country have more wealth than the \nbottom 150 million Americans. As a result, today the concentration of \nincome at the very top has risen to levels last seen in the 1920s--a \ntime of vast inequality that ended in economic disaster for our entire \nNation.\n\n  We have a responsibility to turn back this dangerous trend, and \nMinnesotans know how to do it. We have done it in Minnesota. We know \nhow to grow our economy. We know that we grow it from the middle out, \nnot the top down.\n  Paul Wellstone had a saying: We all do better when we all do better. \nAnd we all do better when people in the middle have money to spend. A \nhigher percentage of middle-class people are entrepreneurs. There is \nmore social and economic mobility when there is a strong middle class. \nWe all do better when we all do better. Even those at the top do \nbetter. We saw that during the Clinton administration when every \nquintile was helped.\n  Minnesotans know that a middle-class budget would ensure health care\n\n[[Page S1867]]\n\naccess and fair workplaces for all Americans so that families can \nconcentrate on doing the best job they can as workers, community \nmembers, parents, daughters, and sons instead of worrying about whether \ntaking time off for a sick child will get them fired or whether a long-\nterm illness will bankrupt their family.\n  So we could and we should be crafting a budget that supports middle-\nclass families and those aspiring to be in the middle class. Opening up \neconomic opportunity, helping to lay the foundation for economic \ngrowth, and supporting innovation are key to a dynamic economy.\n  We could have a budget that makes smart investments, finds sensible \nsavings, and makes sure everyone is paying their fair share of taxes, \nbut that is not the budget the Republicans have crafted. Instead of \nstability and opportunity for the middle-class Minnesotans, the \nRepublican budget proposal would slash billions of dollars in \ninvestments that grow our economy. The Republican budget would do \nnothing to close the loopholes that disproportionately benefit large \ncorporations and superwealthy individuals.\n  Since 2010, we have seen more than $4 in spending cuts for every $1 \nin revenue. The new Republican budget would make that situation even \nworse. This budget would bring that to $10 in spending for every $1 in \nrevenue, and these cuts are coming directly at the expense of programs \nthat serve middle and lower income families.\n  The budget would cut over $6 million in job-creating research in my \nState of Minnesota alone, where we are making crucial investments in \nareas such as renewable energy and health innovations. In fact, the \nEconomic Policy Institute says the cuts in the Republican budget would \nresult in over 45,000 jobs lost in Minnesota. It would also cut funds \nfor workforce training to help Minnesotans compete for 21st-century \njobs. Over 35,000 workers would lose access to training opportunities, \naccording to the Department of Labor. Considering the skills gap that \nevery Senator on this floor acknowledges to me exists in their States, \nthat just makes no sense whatsoever.\n  The Republicans would cut education in their budget. We are talking \nabout Head Start Programs. The Republican budget would cut 620,000 \nchildren from Head Start. We would lose those slots over 10 years. In \nMinnesota, that means 883 fewer slots for preschoolers who would \nbenefit from early childhood programs.\n  I will tell you something about Head Start. This quality early \nchildhood education program has a return on investments of $8 to $16 \nper child, and I will explain why. A child who has had a quality early \nchildhood education is less likely to be in special education, less \nlikely to be left back a grade, and has better health care outcomes. \nThe girls are less likely to get pregnant in adolescence. They graduate \nfrom high school at a higher rate. They are more likely to go to \ncollege, graduate from college, have better jobs, pay more taxes, and \nthey are much less likely to go to prison. That is why you have an $8 \nto $16 return for each kid who has a quality early childhood education. \nThis is wrong. It is also wrong because kids are only 3 years old once, \nand they are beautiful children. They deserve this, and their parents \ndeserve this. This is wrongheaded.\n  The Republican budget not only hits early childhood education, it \nhits Pell grants. In Minnesota, 160,000 students last year were able to \ngo to college because of the Pell Grant Program. When my wife Franni \nand I went to college, a full Pell grant paid for almost 80 percent of \na full public college education. Today, it pays for less than 35 \npercent. Further cuts will make it even harder for students to pay for \ncollege. Yet my colleagues want to cut Pell grants further. We should \nnot be doing that, and that is why I am offering an amendment to \nrestore funding for Pell Grants in this budget.\n  And that is also why I have worked with Senator Warren on the \namendment to make higher education more affordable by allowing \nAmericans to refinance student debt. Student debt is now over $1.3 \ntrillion and this is holding back our economy because recent grads are \nless likely to buy a home, start a new business, or purchase other big-\nticket items like a car because they are tied to this debt. \nUnfortunately, our amendment failed, but I am going to keep working \nwith Senator Warren on this commonsense issue.\n  One of the other keys to prosperity is infrastructure, and \nunfortunately, the Republican budget does nothing to address our \nNation's crumbling roads, bridges, dams, levees, water systems, waste \nwater plants, airports, and rail systems. And yet investing in \ninfrastructure is one of the best ways to help businesses and create \nmillions of middle-class jobs in the short and long-term.\n  As I said, the Republican budget also seeks to repeal the Affordable \nCare Act, even though we know that 16.5 million Americans now have \nhealth coverage because of the Affordable Care Act. In Minnesota, since \nthe Affordable Care Act fully went into effect, the uninsured rate has \ndropped by over 40 percent, and now 95 percent of Minnesotans have \nhealth insurance. But under the Republican budget, we would go back to \nthe days when someone with a pre-existing condition could not get \nhealth insurance. We would go back to the days when half the \nbankruptcies in this country were linked to someone getting sick, and \nback to the days when women were charged more than men for health \ninsurance.\n  That is not what Americans want. Americans don't want to go back to \nthe days of high-cost, low value health care.\n  Americans don't want a budget that will undercut the very sources of \nprosperity for the middle class. We can afford to make the investments \nwe need for the future, and do it in a fiscally responsible way. Part \nof that is fixing our broken Tax Code. Our economy loses hundreds of \nbillions of dollars from a wasteful, inefficient, and, frankly, unfair \nTax Code riddled with loopholes. If we reform our Tax Code to make it \nfairer and more efficient--by doing things like closing the loophole on \nwhat is called carried interest--we can afford to invest in education, \ninfrastructure, and innovation to help American workers compete in the \nglobal economy.\n  Instead, the Republican budget would allow U.S. companies to continue \nto shift billions in profits to tax havens and middle-class jobs \noverseas. It allows millionaires and billionaires to pay lower rates on \ntheir income than many middle-class taxpayers.\n  On top of this, the Republican budget leaves the deck stacked in \nfavor of the rights of big corporations and Wall Street ahead of \nAmerican workers. Americans want a fair chance. They want equal pay for \nequal work. They want us to preserve the promise of Social Security for \ntheir generation and generations to come. And they want everyone who \nworks full time to be able to keep their family out of poverty. These \nare the things that could be in a budget that supports the middle \nclass.\n  Finally, let me note that the Republican budget is filled with \nfiscally irresponsible budget gimmicks. Not only is it very vague about \na lot of the cuts it would make, the budget also uses an off the books \naccount, the Overseas Contingency Operations Fund, which falls outside \nof the budget caps, to significantly increase defense spending without \npaying for it. And even as the Republican budget repeals the Affordable \nCare Act, it doesn't say how it will replace the savings and revenue \nfrom the bill. This isn't even smoke and mirrors, it is right out there \nfor us to see. This budget also repeals a rule the Senate has had in \nplace since 2007 to prohibit reconciliation legislation that would \nincrease the deficit.\n  Again, the Republican's budget plan for America is fundamentally out \nof step with the values of working Americans. It's the same tired \ntrickle-down plan we have seen fail time and time again. It's a plan \nthat says we can reduce our deficit and spend billions more on defense \nwithout raising a nickel of new revenue. It's a plan that says we can \ngrow our economy by cutting health care for seniors and children and \nthe poorest in our society. It's a plan that says that cutting pre-\nschool and college aid is a better investment than closing tax \nloopholes that encourage giant, multinational corporations to use \nelaborate accounting tricks and ship jobs overseas. This plan just \ndoesn't make sense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 7 minutes.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I will end by saying that this is not \neven\n\n[[Page S1868]]\n\nsmoke and mirrors; this is riddled with gimmicks and is fundamentally \nunfair to working Americans. It is the same trickle-down economics that \nwe have seen fail time and time again.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this budget and embrace a real plan \nthat supports middle-class families and those aspiring to the middle \nclass. We need a budget that builds on the progress we made since the \ngreat recession and takes us into a better future for all Americans.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. How much time does the Democratic side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic side has 5 minutes remaining.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 350\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wish to respond and speak as to why I \nam in opposition to the Blunt amendment which requires a point of order \nfor a carbon tax.\n  The scientific community is not in debate. The scientific community \ntells us that climate change is real. It is caused by human activity \nand by a very significant increase in carbon emissions. The scientific \ncommunity tells us that climate change is already causing devastating \nproblems in our Nation and around the world. The scientific community \ntells us that if we do not get our act together--not just the United \nStates but China, Russia, India, and the entire world--the planet we \nwill be leaving for our kids and grandchildren will be substantially \nless habitable than the planet we enjoy.\n  We have a moral responsibility to respond to this crisis, and we have \nto use every tool we can in our arsenal. What does that mean? It means \nwe need to invest heavily in weatherization and energy efficiency so we \ndon't waste energy. It means we have to move aggressively toward wind, \nsolar, geothermal, biomass, and other sustainable energies. It also \nmeans we have to tell those people who are producing carbon in \nsignificant amounts and are causing the problem that they cannot \ncontinue to do that with impunity. They will have to pay a tax on that.\n  We can argue about how we go forward in transforming our energy \nsystem and how we cut carbon pollution, but we should not pick out one \nparticular approach and say that it is going to require 60 votes to go \nforward.\n  I strongly object to Senator Blunt's amendment.\n  What we will be doing is offering a side-by-side. This side-by-side \ncould not be simpler. The American people and the scientific community \nare pretty clear when it comes to climate change: It is, in fact, real, \nand it is caused by human activity. What we will do is offer a side-by-\nside to establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to recognize that \nclimate change is real, is caused by human activity, and that Congress \nneeds to take action to cut carbon pollution.\n  Young people all over this country want action. While many of my \nRepublican colleagues refuse to acknowledge the reality that climate \nchange is caused by human activity, many Republicans outside of Capitol \nHill, in fact, do understand that. We have prominent conservative \neconomists and economic advisers, such as Nobel laureate economist Gary \nBecker, Mitt Romney's former economic adviser Gregory Mankiw, and \nformer Reagan adviser Art Laffer, who have all called for taxing \ncarbon. It is not a radical idea. These are conservative Republicans \nwho understand that people who are causing the problem cannot do that \nwith impunity.\n  More recently, George Shultz--I think we all know George Shultz is \nthe former Secretary of the Treasury and Secretary of State under \nPresidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan--published an op-ed in the \nWashington Post calling for a carbon tax. The idea of a carbon tax is \nsomething that is gaining more and more support from Democrats, \nRepublicans, Independents, people who are very worried about what is \nhappening to our environment.\n  In terms of the side-by-side, I personally am strongly opposed to \nSenator Blunt's amendment, which just looks at a tax on carbon. I \nshould also say that as a coauthor, along with Senator Boxer, with \nregard to a carbon tax, we put huge amounts of money into helping those \nfamilies who might see higher utility bills. That is probably the main \nsource of funding allocation. So we are aware of the problem, and we \naddress it in our legislation, and it should be addressed in any \nlegislation.\n  But once again, in terms of the side-by-side, we are going to give \nour Republican colleagues an opportunity----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrat's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 434\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up my amendment No. 434.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden], for himself and Mr. \n     Crapo, proposes an amendment numbered 434.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for an adjustment to committee allocations for \n                     wildfire suppression funding)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. ADJUSTMENT FOR WILDFIRE SUPPRESSION FUNDING.\n\n       If a measure becomes law that amends the adjustments to \n     discretionary spending limits established under section \n     251(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control \n     Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 901(b)) for wildfire suppression \n     funding, the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the \n     Senate may adjust the allocation called for in section 302(a) \n     of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 633(a)) to \n     the appropriate committee or committees of the Senate, and \n     may adjust all other budgetary aggregates, allocations, \n     levels, and limits contained in this resolution, as \n     necessary, consistent with such measure.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 777, as Modified\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, since my friend from across the aisle raised \nthe issue of climate change, I will use the remainder of my time to \ntalk about that issue because I will urge my colleagues to vote no on \namendment No. 777.\n  We voted earlier--and it was a unanimous vote--that climate change is \nreal. I believe virtually everyone agrees that over time the Earth's \nclimate has shifted at various levels of speed and in various \ndirections.\n  I had an opportunity to go on a trip to China, and we visited one of \nthe country's labs researching climate change. I had the opportunity to \ntour the lab with the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin. One of the \namazing things was--as we finished the tour after looking at five \ndifferent ways the scientists were measuring what caused climate change \nand how real it was--when Senator Durbin said to me: I am sure glad \nSenator Inhofe is not with us because this backs up everything Senator \nInhofe has been saying.\n  So climate change is an issue that has not really been resolved among \nall the scientists, even in some countries that have different opinions \nthan we do.\n  Every snowstorm, every heat wave that we have today--we have changed \nit from global warming to climate change because now we are blaming \neverything on this phenomenon. One of the comments I made is that \ninstead of spending $5 billion on one side to prove there is climate \nchange and another $5 billion on the other side to disprove climate \nchange, maybe we ought to spend $10 billion a year just on fixing \nthings.\n  So I think there are some problems with the amendment, and I hope my \ncolleagues will vote no.\n  I see that it is almost time for the vote, so I yield back our time.\n  Go ahead and start on the vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 755\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 755, offered by the Senator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the \nStabenow amendment.\n  This amendment would establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund that \nwould do a few things. First of all, it would\n\n[[Page S1869]]\n\nensure that the Clean Water Act is focused on protecting water quality, \nupholding the existing exemption in the Clean Water Act for \nagriculture, ranching, and forestry that has existed for decades so our \nforesters and ranchers have the certainty they need. It would ensure \nthat we rely on scientific evidence as we examine the impact that water \nquality has on the different types of water bodies, and it provides \ncertainty to landowners and rural communities that are guided by the \nscope of the Clean Water Act.\n  I appreciate my colleague from Wyoming and his approach. I believe \nmine is much more specific. It is deficit neutral instead of spending \nneutral, so it allows us to offset any changes we would like to make to \nsupport these efforts through either revenues or spending cuts as \nopposed to a spending-neutral reserve fund. Most importantly, it makes \nvery clear support for both the Clean Water Act and agriculture.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. We would be happy to take that amendment. We would prefer \nto do that by voice vote because we have a lot of votes pending.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I actually would prefer a recorded \nrollcall vote. I appreciate that offer, but I would ask for a recorded \nrollcall vote.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I support the Stabenow amendment. \nRanchers and property owners in rural America think the EPA is out of \ncontrol. I agree. It is right to rein in the EPA and restore current \nprotections and exemptions for rural America.\n  A key area where the Stabenow amendment falls short is excluding \ncities, suburbs, and the job-creating businesses and working families \nthat reside outside of rural America.\n  My amendment, which will be next, addresses concerns raised by the \nU.S. Conference of Mayors and the National Association of Counties, \nwhich want certainty regarding the EPA's power grab.\n  The Senator from Michigan does things to protect farmers and ranchers \nfrom the EPA. My amendment is supported by the American Farm Bureau. \nThis support is because my amendment is specific and holds the EPA and \nthe Corps to the promises they have already made.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we yield back the time in opposition.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, if there is time remaining, I would \nsimply say that I think our amendment is stronger and much more \nspecific. Also, it upholds two goals: supporting the Clean Water Act, \nwhich has for 40 years protected us with clean fishing and drinking \nwater--and in our beautiful Great Lakes, certainly all that we hold \ndear--but it also clarifies specifics for agriculture, ranchers, \nforesters, and communities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 347, offered by the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Barrasso.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 347\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise in support of my amendment No. \n347, an amendment to hold the EPA and the Army Corps to their word \nabout the scope of their proposed waters of the United States rule. The \nadministration says there is a lot of misunderstanding with their \nproposed waters of the United States regulation and what it covers.\n  Time and time again, we have heard from the EPA and the Corps that \nthis rule would not cover things such as puddles, rainwater, snowmelt, \nand irrigation ditches. The Barrasso amendment would help to make sure \nthis rule is crystal clear by listing out those things the EPA and the \nCorps have indicated or led folks to believe would not be covered under \nthe rule.\n  So if you believe the waters of the United States rule does not go \nfar enough, that the Federal Government should be in the business of \nregulating puddles in our constituents' backyards, then vote against my \namendment. That is what voting against my amendment would mean. That is \nwhy I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment to protect the waters of \nthe United States.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, we just voted together on a very \nspecific amendment that makes it clear that all of our traditional \nagriculture, forestry efforts, all of the local government efforts that \nare occurring in this country right now will continue even under a \nrevised clean water rule, which, by the way, is only having to be done \nbecause of two Supreme Court decisions that created a tremendous amount \nof confusion for communities and farmers and ranchers.\n  Unfortunately, regardless of what was just said, the Barrasso \namendment is very general, very broad. It does not add any clarity. It \nwould keep the confusion that is out there. I would urge that we vote \nno. We have already made a clear statement here in the Senate. We do \nnot need to go back to what the Supreme Court did when in 2006 they had \nfive different opinions coming from nine different Justices and created \nchaos. We do not need two different amendments that say two different \nthings. We just did something very clear and specific. Let's hold that \nand vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this really wasn't the week of the Senator \nfrom Vermont. In an article in the Wall Street Journal on Monday, ``The \nMyth of the Climate Change `97%,' '' they say the 97 percent figure \ncame from 79 respondents out of 3,146.\n  Secondly, today is the day they finalized the annual Gallup poll. The \nGallup poll came out and made the statements that came to the \nconclusion that the current level of worry on global warming and \nclimate remains at record lows, right behind the loss of tropical rain \nforests.\n  So don't vote for this based on the assumption that the 97 percent \nfigure is accurate or that people care that much.\n  Mr. SANDERS.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 796, offered by the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we all know Medicare is on an unsustainable \ncourse. Independent actuaries at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices--CMS--estimate that, over the next 75 years, the program has \n$35 trillion--that is with a T--in unfunded obligations.\n  CBO says that, without reforms, Medicare's hospital insurance trust \nfund will be insolvent early in the decade following 2025. And \naccording to the Medicare trustees themselves, the hospital insurance \ntrust fund could be insolvent as early as 2021. At that time Medicare \nwill no longer be able to pay out full benefits to seniors.\n  We need to reform Medicare in order to save Medicare. We have a moral \nobligation to put Medicare on a sustainable path. It is crucial we \nensure its solvency into the decade if we want to keep the promise we \nhave made to those at or near retirement.\n  That is where we are, and that is about all I am going to say about \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  There is 45 seconds remaining in opposition to the amendment.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I think there is no objection to the \namendment on this side. If the Senator would like a voice vote, we \nwould be fine with that.\n  Mr. HATCH. A voice vote would be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 796) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 601\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate prior to a \nvote in relation to amendment No. 601.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise today in offering an amendment with \nSenator Stabenow to guarantee we keep a sacred promise to our Nation's \nseniors to protect the Medicare Program for years to come.\n  The budget we have in front of us doesn't balance our values or \npriorities as a country. Unfortunately, it misses the mark entirely for \nour seniors. To put it into perspective, the Senate Republican budget \ncuts the Medicare Program by almost three times as much as the House \nRepublican budget.\n  My amendment ensures we protect our seniors from any effort to cut \nMedicare beneficiaries' guaranteed benefits, privatize Medicare into a \npremium support plan or increase out-of-pocket spending on drugs or \nprevention services.\n  In 2013, over half the Medicare beneficiaries had incomes below \n$23,000 a year. We can't attempt to balance the Nation's budget on the \nbacks of our seniors. There is a reason why the National Committee to \nPreserve Social Security and Medicare is urging a ``yes'' vote on this \namendment and a ``no'' vote on the Republican budget.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Bennet-Stabenow \namendment, and I yield whatever time remains to the senior Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I will raise a point of order against this \namendment. The amendment offered by my\n\n[[Page S1871]]\n\nfriends across the aisle would prohibit consideration of certain \nMedicare legislation.\n  I know all my colleagues are committed to preserving Medicare. We all \nwant Medicare to be there for today's and tomorrow's seniors, and right \nnow its finances are deteriorating rapidly. However, my colleague's \namendment is not germane to the budget resolution.\n  The Committee on Finance has jurisdiction over the Medicare program. \nThe Committee on the Budget does not. The Bennet-Stabenow amendment \ninstructs the Committee on Finance how to write a Medicare reform \nbill--language that is inappropriate to include in a budget resolution. \nIn fact, adopting this amendment would kill the privilege of the budget \nresolution.\n  For this reason, I am compelled, as chairman of the Committee on the \nBudget, to raise a point of order against the amendment.\n  Mr. President, the pending amendment, No. 601, is not germane to the \nbudget resolution now before the Senate. Therefore, I raise a point of \norder against this amendment under section 305(b)2 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive all applicable \nsections of that act for the purpose of the pending amendment. I ask \nfor the yeas and nays on protecting Medicare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

On this vote, the yeas are 46, the nays are \n53.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment fails.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 801\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 801, offered by the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, Democrats and Republicans agree that the \nautomatic spending cuts across defense and nondefense investments are \nterrible policy, and it has to be fixed.\n  I am proud that the bipartisan budget act that we passed last \nCongress did exactly that for the past 2 years. It offered us a \ntemplate for how we can tackle this challenge in a bipartisan way once \nagain. That deal succeeded because it rolled back cuts to defense and \nnondefense equally, and it did it with a balanced and responsible mix \nof savings and new revenue.\n  The amendment before us builds on that deal and extends the sequester \nrelief for 2 more years. We don't need to rely on gimmicks in this \nbudget or the hopes that we are going to solve this later. We need to \nfix this now.\n  In 2013, it took a government shutdown to bring both sides to the \ntable to get a deal for this. I am hoping we don't have to wait for \nanother crisis, and I encourage our colleagues who oppose sequestration \nto support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, if we want to change the Budget Control Act \nof 2011, we need to pass the bill to do so later in the year. The \nbudget resolution cannot fix sequestration. This particular amendment \nincreases both defense spending and nondefense spending. Without a \njustification, it calls for spending $148 billion more than allowed by \nthe BCA. The BCA requires the defense program to receive half of the \nreductions. That is not the case here. With nondefense limits, much \nwork remains to eliminate inefficiencies in the nondefense side of the \nledger.\n  According to the CBO, there are 260 programs spending $293 billion in \nthe 2015 budget that are not operating under a current authorization. \nThat means the policy experts haven't done their work. So we can't tell \nif we need that much more money.\n  This amendment seeks more money for nondefense. This amendment calls \nfor an increase in spending and pays for it by extracting more taxes \nfrom American taxpayers. The tax increases in this amendment total $120 \nbillion. Finally, perhaps the most important reason----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask for a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 481, offered by the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Cotton.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, for decades, this Congress has provided \nbipartisan support to the U.S.-Israel alliance in part because the \nsupport of the\n\n[[Page S1872]]\n\nAmerican people for the Israeli people is so strong. Unfortunately, for \nalmost as long, the United Nations has singled out Israel for unfair, \ndiscriminatory treatment, whether it is the 1975 Zionism is Racism \nResolution or the recent obsession of the Human Rights Council.\n  It has been the longstanding U.S. policy to prevent unfair, \ndiscriminatory treatment against Israel at the United Nations and other \ninternational institutions. I believe it is urgent that this Congress \nreaffirm that policy.\n  This amendment will allow a funding mechanism to adjust funding to \nthe United Nations or other international institutions should they \ntarget Israel for unfair, discriminatory treatment. I hope we never \nneed this mechanism, but I believe it is critical that Congress \nreaffirm our commitment to the U.S.-Israel alliance in preventing \nunfair, discriminatory treatment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I believe there is general support on \nthis side of the floor for that amendment, and I suggest a voice vote.\n  Mr. COTTON.

This amendment would delete the reconciliation \ninstructions in Section 201 of the budget resolution.\n  When it comes to tackling the big economic challenges in this \ncountry, the best legislation is bipartisan legislation.

Mr. President, before I begin, I thank all of those \ninvolved with this intricate process. Senate Budget Committee chairman \nMike Enzi and ranking member Bernie Sanders have worked tirelessly \nleading up to this point. It certainly is not an easy process, and I do \nnot want their efforts to go unnoticed.\n  I stand here today to discuss many important issues that concern my \nconstituents across the great State of Nevada. These are issues that I \nhope to address during this year's budget process to improve the \nquality of life in the Silver State.\n  I have filed several amendments to this year's budget ranging from \ninfrastructure and tourism, to medical care at VA facilities, and to \nprotecting our way of life in Nevada with the support of the Second \nAmendment. These amendments will deliver needed solutions.\n  Developing critical infrastructure for Nevada is a top priority of \nmine. It remains the first step toward long-term job growth and \nsustainability. Trucking, tourism, and trade needs are met when proper \ninfrastructure is in place.\n  In fact, I filed amendment No. 466 that would help promote travel and \ntourism here in the United States. Last year, over 40 million visitors \ncame to the Silver State, supporting almost 400,000 jobs. The future \nInterstate 11, and the many other important highway projects throughout \nour Nation, have the potential to open more markets for tourism and \ntrade, which will create jobs and improve our economy. In Nevada, we \nare a State that welcomes more visitors, both domestic and \ninternational, on a yearly basis. We want more people to experience all \nour State has to offer and strive to provide the best services to those \nalready visiting Nevada.\n  I recognize there are limited resources dedicated for transportation \nand infrastructure. I believe it is important we prioritize roads and \nbridges that give us the biggest bang for our buck. It is important we \nexpand high priority corridors and projects of regional and national \nsignificance, because those are the types of projects that will spur \nlong-term economic development.\n  One example of these critical projects is the proposed I-11 corridor. \nThis future highway would connect Phoenix and Las Vegas, the two \nlargest cities in the Nation not connected by an interstate, cutting \nthe travel time by over 1 hour. It would provide new economic \ndevelopment opportunities in the Southwest and would play a large role \nin boosting the global competitiveness of the region. My amendment, \namendment No. 453 would prioritize Federal investments in \ninfrastructure projects with national and regional significance such as \nthe I-11 corridor.\n  In Nevada, we have a local resident called the sage grouse. Listing \nthe sage grouse as an endangered species would have a devastating \nimpact on Nevada's economy. Like many of the other States, Nevada's \nEcosystem Council has spent years diligently developing a robust action \nplan to avoid a listing. Further collaboration between the Federal \nGovernment, the State, and local stakeholders will go a much longer way \nto protect and balance both Nevadans' way of life and the sage grouse \npopulation. My amendment, amendment No. 452, says the Department of the \nInterior should enter into State conservation agreements with each of \nthe 11 States with sage grouse populations. State plans should be given \nthe opportunity to show results before the Federal Government \nintervenes.\n  If the Federal Government adds the sage grouse to the endangered \nspecies list, it would devastate rural economies across these affected \nStates, including Nevada. States must be given an opportunity to show \nthey can foster a sustainable sage grouse population.\n  Since becoming a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, \naddressing the backlog of disability claims has remained one of my top \npriorities. The fact that Nevada's veterans continue to have one of the \nlongest waiting times in the Nation at 257 days on average is \nunacceptable. That is why I invited VA Secretary Robert McDonald to \ncome and see what is going on in the Silver State. It is also why I \noffered amendment No. 457. This amendment says we should prohibit \nbonuses for certain VA executives until the backlog of veterans' \ndisability claims is eliminated. Our veterans have been waiting too \nlong, and my amendment brings us one step closer to eradicating the \nbacklog.\n  Furthermore, ensuring America's veterans receive timely and quality \nhealth care is also a promise our nation must keep. And as our military \ncontinues to have more women in uniform, VA facilities must adapt to \nthe meet their specific health care requirements. That is why my \namendment No. 456 is so important because it keeps this promise by \nensuring VA medical facilities properly meet the needs of women \nveterans. Safety, privacy, and dignity should be accounted for in every \nVA hospital and clinic. As I continue holding the VA accountable in my \nrole on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, quality health care and \ntimely benefits will remain a priority of mine, and it is a priority \nnow as we consider the budget resolution.\n  As an avid sportsman and gun-owner, I enjoy our way of life in \nNevada, but I am concerned by actions from this administration that \nwould directly infringe on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding \ncitizens.\n  Recently, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, \nATF, issued a proposal that would ban popular .223 caliber ammunitions, \nseverely limiting access to one of the most widely used cartridges in \nAmerica for sporting purposes. That is why I filed amendment No. 454 to \nprotect law-abiding American citizens' Second Amendment rights and \nprohibit the ATF from reclassifying ammunition primarily intended for \nsporting purposes. This issue is important to Nevadans, and it is \nimportant to me. Amendment No. 454 makes sure that the constitutional \nrights of Nevadans are protected.\n  There are an estimated 400,000 untested rape kits sitting in law \nenforcement and crime lab storage facilities across the Nation. Each \none of these untested rape kits represents a missed opportunity to help \nbring justice and healing to a survivor of sexual assault. That is why \nI filed amendment No. 455. This amendment prioritizes the elimination \nof the rape kit backlog to hold perpetrators accountable and help \nprevent these despicable crimes from happening in the first place.\n  Finally, I would like to discuss a sense of the Senate amendment I \nfiled regarding the bipartisan principles of no budget, no pay \nlegislation, Amendment No. 45l. My sense of the Senate would endorse \nthe solutions in No\n\n[[Page S1877]]\n\nBudget, No Pay that would encourage Members of Congress to come to the \ntable and work together to pass their own budget and appropriations \nbills on time in order to receive pay. It just makes sense--if Members \nof Congress do not do their jobs, they should not get paid. And by the \nway, we also say pay is not retroactive.\n  My amendments take the needs of Nevadans into consideration and make \nthem a national priority.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in order to make them a \nreality.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about our \nNation's war against ISIS and why we must pay for it responsibly. As \nour Nation's Armed Forces continue their critical mission to degrade \nand destroy ISIS, which is already months underway, we need to consider \nanother part of our strategy--paying for the war. This is not a new \nconcept. Our Nation has a long history of paying for our military \nmissions. In fact, every war since the Revolutionary War, to the first \nGulf War, was paid for.\n  Through each of our Nation's armed conflicts, new revenue streams not \nonly provided the resources our military needed, they reminded the \nAmerican people that our country was at war and we all needed to \ncontribute to the effort. But after 14 years and 2 wars that have cost \nour Nation trillions of dollars, I fear we have forgotten this \nimportant lesson from our history.\n  We cannot write another blank check for a war. Paying for a war \nagainst ISIS is the right thing to do. It is fiscally, morally, and \nmilitarily responsible. As we continue to debate this war authorization \nin Congress, we need to be honest with the American people and each \nother about what it will cost our Nation. That is why, as we debate the \nbudget this week, I have offered an amendment that requires us to raise \nthe revenue to pay for the fight against ISIS. The American people \ndeserve no less.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me on this amendment to pay for a \ncritically important war against ISIS and ensure we fight this battle \ntogether as one country.\n  Thank you.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 432\n\n(Purpose: To provide additional resources to create the opportunity for \nmore Americans to obtain a higher education and advanced job skills by \n  supporting two free years of community college paid for by raising \n revenue through requiring millionaires and billionaires to pay their \n                              fair share)\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up my amendment No. 432, which is \ncosponsored by Senators Schumer, Sanders, and Stabenow. \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Ms. Baldwin], for herself, Mr. \n     Sanders, and Mr. Schumer, proposes an amendment numbered 432.\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, March 24, 2015, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, my amendment would create a free \ncommunity college program, making a bold investment in our Nation's \nstudents, its workforce, and the future of our economy. It pays for \nthis investment in a balanced way, and my amendment would actually \nreduce the deficit by enacting the Buffett rule--asking millionaires \nand billionaires to pay their fair share of taxes while giving our \nstudents a fair shot at the opportunities a higher education brings. I \nbelieve every student in America deserves a fair shot and an affordable \neducation, and I believe a college education should be a path to the \nmiddle class, not a path into debt.\n\n[[Page S1878]]\n\n  Inspired by programs in Tennessee and Chicago, this spring President \nObama proposed a program that would allow students to attend community \ncollege for 2 years at no cost. This will give students who are willing \nto work hard the opportunity to obtain a certificate, an industry-\nrecognized credential, or associate's degree. That provides the skills \nthey need to access in-demand jobs or earn credits they can transfer \ninto a 4-year institution.\n  I would urge all my colleagues to support the Baldwin, Schumer, \nSanders, Stabenow amendment in order to support higher education, to \nsupport free community college, and invest in our students and our \nworkforce.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 436\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside in order to call up Baldwin amendment No. 436.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Ms. Baldwin], for herself, Mr. \n     Warner, Mrs. McCaskill, and Mr. Whitehouse, propose an \n     amendment numbered 436.\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To preserve the point of order against reconciliation \n    legislation that would increase the deficit or reduce a surplus)\n\n         Strike section 405.\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, amendment No. 436 is also cosponsored by \nSenators Warner, McCaskill, and Whitehouse. This amendment is very \nsimple. It would strike section 405 of the chairman's mark. Section 405 \neliminated a point of order against reconciliation legislation which \neither increases the deficit or would reduce a surplus.\n  I see no good reason why we should be making it easier to increase \nthe debt and deficit that the majority claims to care so much about. If \ntheir reconciliation legislation is so important, then they ought to \npay for it. If this amendment fails to be adopted, we will find \nourselves in the same situation we were in the early 2000s.\n  In 2001 and 2003, the then-Republican majority used reconciliation to \npass a $1.3 trillion tax cut in 2001 and then another $350 billion tax \ncut in 2003. Both of these efforts were entirely unpaid for. Not a \nsingle dime was offset. So much for fiscal responsibility. It was not \nuntil 2007, when Chairman Conrad took control of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, when a point of order was put into place to stop \nreconciliation from being used as a tool to add to the deficit. Let's \nnot use the reconciliation process to add to our deficit.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my commonsense amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I agree with my friends that we cannot \ndeny that climate change is real and that humans do contribute to it. \nHowever, we also cannot deny that we will continue to rely on fossil \nfuels for decades to come, including for the bulk of our electricity. \nCoal, specifically, is one of the only two baseload fuels we have that \nwe are able to run 24/7, rain or shine.\n  With new regulations, we are facing more pressure on our baseload \ncoal. Last winter during the polar vortex, the PGM system that provides \nelectricity for West Virginia and the electricity we are using right \nnow in DC will be running full capacity. We saw a record number of \nplant outages when they were most needed.\n  Further threats to our reliability could result in rolling blackouts, \nwhich puts the lives of the most vulnerable, the elderly, the sick, and \nthe poor at risk. The Fossil Energy Research and Development Program at \nthe Department of Energy supports a group of 1,000 projects, including \n$7 billion of private sector investment, representing 55,000 jobs \nacross the United States. Research supported in this program has led to \ncleaner burning plants over the past decade, and we have reduced \npollutants and increased the efficiency of coal-fired powerplants.\n  Right now, DOE has $8 billion of fossil energy loan guarantees that \nneed to be utilized. The best way to reduce impacts of climate change \nwhile still ensuring a reliable electric grid is to invest in the \nresearch and development of advanced fossil fuel technology. To combat \nclimate change, I would ask for the support of this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 578\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside and call up amendment No. 578.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Manchin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 578.\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to \n         addressing methamphetamine abuse in the United States)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO ADDRESSING \n                   METHAMPHETAMINE ABUSE IN THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to addressing methamphetamine abuse in the United \n     States, by the amounts provided in such legislation for those \n     purposes, provided that such legislation would not increase \n     the deficit over either the period of the total of fiscal \n     years 2016 through 2020 or the period of the total of fiscal \n     years 2016 through 2025.\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, this amendment would encourage our \ncountry to increase our investment in combatting methamphetamine use. \nMeth abuse has devastated communities across the country. Meth can \ncause violent behavior and psychosis. In the long run, it changes the \nway the brain works, causing long-term emotional and cognitive \nproblems.\n  Domestic meth labs, fueled by demand from addicts, endanger \ncommunities and the environment. In 2013, in West Virginia, law \nenforcement officials seized 533 meth labs. That was an 86-percent \nincrease over 2012. I have fought in my State to address meth abuse \nfrom every angle: reducing access to the products that are used to make \nmeth, taking down meth labs, and improving treatment for addicts.\n  But this is a national problem, not just a West Virginia problem. It \nrequires a national response. During\n\n[[Page S1879]]\n\ncommittee markup I had a similar amendment to enhance investments in \nefforts to reduce prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse, which \npassed by voice vote.\n  This drug addiction is devastating families and communities all over \nAmerica. Too many young people have lost before their lives begin, and \ntoo many adults are being pulled away from productive lives. We must \nchange. Congress must do more to combat meth abuse. That is why I urge \nthe support of my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO ENHANCING \n                   THE CHILD AND DEPENDENT CARE TAX CREDIT.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to enhancing the child and dependent care tax credit \n     in order to offset the growing costs of child care, including \n     by making the credit fully refundable, by the amounts \n     provided in such legislation for those purposes, provided \n     that such legislation would not increase the deficit over \n     either the period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through \n     2020 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through \n     2025.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, just a brief description of both. Both are \ndeficit-neutral reserve funds. The first provides reasonable \naccommodations for pregnant workers. That is No. 632. We have had a \nstandard in place for a quarter century pursuant to the Americans with \nDisabilities Act that individuals who have a disability in the \nworkplace are given reasonable accommodations at the worksite.\n  We should have the same for pregnant workers. We have a case that was \ndecided today by the Supreme Court, Young v. UPS. This was a mixed \nresult, but I think Peggy Young, the plaintiff in that case, got a good \nresult. But there is still not a clear standard which we could place in \nthe law, just like we have in the context of an individual with a \ndisability in the workforce. So we need a clear standard to increase \nemployment opportunities and prevent employment discrimination against \npregnant workers.\n  Secondly, amendment No. 633 is a further development of existing \npolicies as it relates to childcare. We have had in the Tax Code now \nfor a long time a tax credit for families who are paying for the cost \nof childcare.\n  That tax provision is a way to provide tax relief to offset childcare \nexpenses for families. The problem, though, is under current law--as it \nis currently structured--it doesn't provide the kind of relief it \nshould. In fact, the way it is designed now, very few families are able \nto benefit from it. I want to make it--I think it should be refundable. \nThat is the best way to provide a measure of relief that is not there \nnow for families.\n  Childcare for some families--if it is not the most expensive part of \ntheir budget, it is often second or third--thousands of dollars. It has \ngone up across the country by some 70 percent in less than 30 years. We \nneed to help families be able to pay for something as essential as \nchildcare. That is what that amendment is about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n             Amendments Nos. 842, 843, 952, and 953 En Bloc\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To expand the deficit-neutral reserve fund for veterans and \n                            servicemembers)\n\n       On page 54, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       (6) vocational programs of the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs, which may include legislation that improves \n     vocational rehabilitation and counseling for veterans with \n     service-connected disabilities and members of the Armed \n     Forces with severe injuries or illness;\n       (7) improving research at the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs, which may include legislation that expands research \n     on post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, or \n     toxic exposures;\n       (8) improving the delivery of health care and benefits to \n     veterans or members of the Armed Forces, which may include \n     legislation that improves delivery of health care and \n     benefits to victims of military sexual trauma;\n       (9) improving the delivery of care and benefits to \n     veterans, which may include legislation that enhances \n     oversight and investigations by the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs Office of Inspector General;\n       (10) maintaining and enhancing access, choice, and \n     accountability in veterans care through the Veterans Access, \n     Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-146);\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, this amendment builds on the reserve \nfund in section 307 to provide for better medical research into the \nissues affecting women in our military, most particularly women who \nbecome veterans, which is a neglected aspect of health care in our \nVeterans Affairs health care system.\n  It focuses on military sexual trauma, which is continuing to be a \nscourge in the military, and its effects. But it also deals more \ngenerally with the need for research into post-traumatic stress and \ntraumatic brain injury, which is unfortunately lagging in our Veterans \nAffairs system, as determined as our VA is to do more of it.\n  It would also build on existing programs for job training and \nvocational rehabilitation so our veterans entering the job market and \nseeking to become productive in well-paying jobs will be able to \nfulfill that ambition. It essentially fills in some of the gaps left by \nthe Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act which this body \npassed not long ago, to meet the emergency as well as the sustained \nneeds of our veterans that are unfulfilled by our present VA.\n  It is our obligation to do better for our Nation's heroes, keep faith \nwith them and leave no veteran behind when it comes to jobs and health \ncare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly about four of \nthe amendments I have brought up this evening to provide some \nbackground and detail.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 391\n\n  First, I would like to speak about amendment No. 391, an amendment I \nhave offered that would help small\n\n[[Page S1882]]\n\nbusinesses to provide health insurance to their employees.\n  The Affordable Care Act made important strides toward making health \ncare more affordable and accessible to millions of Americans. One of \nthe ways the ACA was intended to expand coverage was through business \ntax credits, to help business owners who want to do right by their \nworkers and provide health insurance. These tax credits were a good \nfirst step.\n  But over the past 2 years, it has become clear we need to do more, to \nexpand and simplify them to help more small businesses. Although many \npeople I speak with have benefitted greatly from the new coverage \nafforded by the ACA, I have also spoken to many small business owners \nin Delaware who have wanted to take advantage of the tax credit but \ncould not because it was too complicated or they did not qualify.\n  We need to listen to these concerns and strengthen our health care \nsystem so it works for everyone. That is why I am offering my amendment \nto expand access to the ACA's small business tax credit, which is based \non legislation I have introduced with eight of my colleagues. The small \nbusiness owners I speak with who do not see their employees as labor \ncosts or lines on a balance sheet, who see them as members of their \nfamily and a key part of their business and community, those small \nbusiness owners want to do right by their workers and help ensure that \ntheir health care needs are covered.\n  We should do everything we can to help them meet those goals. So I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment to expand \nhealth care tax credits for small business owners.\n  If I might very briefly speak to the three remaining amendments I \nhave made pending.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 394\n\n  Amendment No. 394 is cosponsored by Republican Senator Pat Roberts of \nKansas and is also cosponsored by Senator Schumer. It is the startup \ninnovation credit. It makes the research and development tax credit \naccessible to early-stage and startup companies, an important way that \nwe can take a long-established tax credit that is of real benefit to \nsignificant, profitable companies that invest heavily in R and make \nit accessible to those fast-growing, early-stage companies in our \neconomy.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 392\n\n  Second, I have the college savings bill. This is amendment No. 392 \nwith Senator Rubio of Florida. It is a deficit-neutral reserve fund \nthat encourages the use of college savings accounts. Study after study \nhas shown that if young children have even as little as $500 in a \nsavings account for college, they are three times more likely to enroll \nin college.\n  Access is also reliant on affordability. College savings accounts \nmake college more affordable and thus more accessible, but it also \nlifts young people's sights and helps them focus on the importance of a \ncollege education.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 343\n\n  The last amendment is No. 343, which provides for support for farm \nbill conservation programs, which have been cut over the last 5 years \nby $2 billion.\n  It is important that we preserve the long bipartisan-supported \nconservation programs in our farm bill that make a huge difference for \nfarms of all kinds across our Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support each of my amendments I discussed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                Amendment Nos. 341, 539, and 795 en bloc\n\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside to call up my amendment Nos. 341, 539, and 795 \nen bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are called up en bloc.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 341\n\n(Purpose: To establish a spending-neutral reserve fund relating to the \n         promotion of United States offshore energy production)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___.

Mr. President, speaking first to amendment No. 341, a \nprincipal challenge in our society today is how do we create better \njobs with better benefits for working families.\n  There are some industries that clearly have done that. Those include \nthe energy industry and, by extension, the low cost energy being \nproduced domestically that in turn is creating new manufacturing jobs.\n  To further this process, I will first point out that over 85 percent \nof the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf is closed off to energy exploration \nand production.\n  Opening the American OCS, as it is called, will provide hundreds of \nthousands of jobs and increase our national security by increasing our \nenergy security.\n  My amendment encourages the security and these jobs by opening up \nAmerica's Outer Continental Shelf to energy exploration and production.\n  Amendment No. 539. I am a doctor. I have been working in the public \nhospital system of Louisiana for the last 25 years caring for the \nuninsured. I am so aware of the importance of safety-net programs such \nas Medicaid. I point out, though, that Medicaid is a broken program--so \nbroken that it is bankrupting State governments and contributing to our \nrunaway national debt.\n\n[[Page S1883]]\n\n  The question is how do we preserve this important program but, at the \nsame time, also preserve the financial integrity of our State \ngovernment, of our Federal Government, and, if you will, ultimately the \npocketbook of the taxpayer.\n  This amendment would build upon proven models that will provide \nfinancial security for the patients who benefit from Medicaid as well \nas for the States that provide those benefits for those Medicaid \npatients.\n  This is an important beginning to reform Medicaid to preserve its \nbenefits, but, again, to protect the American taxpayer.\n  Lastly, amendment No. 795. I return to what I said earlier. A chief \nchallenge now is how do we create better jobs with better benefits for \nworking families. Those jobs oftentimes are in construction, mining, \nand manufacturing.\n  The EPA is promulgating new regulations which they estimate for \nambient air quality standards, which they estimate the cost of \ncompliance will be $3.9 billion in the year 2025.\n  This is estimated to decrease our gross domestic product by $140 \nbillion, a $3.9 billion cost, leading to a $140 billion decrease in our \neconomy. Inevitably, there are lost jobs associated with it, working \nfamilies that are less well off.\n  The EPA would prevent construction of manufacturing and energy-\nintensive enterprises.\n  My amendment ensures the American energy and manufacturing \nrenaissance is not interrupted by EPA's costly regulation. It preserves \nthose jobs for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 715\n\n  Mr. COONS.

Mr. President, I have two amendments that I want to \nspeak to very briefly this evening that I hope we will have an \nopportunity to consider tomorrow when we move to a very accelerated \nprocess. One of them relates to lands and one relates to water--our \noceans and how we move about on our oceans.\n  The first amendment I would like to speak to is an amendment that \nwould establish a neutral reserve fund for land sales, transfers, and \nexchanges.\n  Before I get to describing that, I want to take just a couple of \nminutes and speak to the overall budget itself in comparison and \ncontrast to that submitted by the President. The budget before us is a \nstark contrast to the President's request, which simply pretended that \nsequestration didn't exist, never came remotely close to balancing, and \nwould have led to the return of trillion dollar deficits by 2025.\n  The Republican budget we have in front of us, as compared to the \nPresident's request, while far from perfect--believe me, far from \nperfect--does present a very significant choice between a direction on \nenergy that takes us backwards and a proposal that we see laid out in \nthis Republican budget that gives us a clear choice when it comes to \nthe future of our energy and natural resources policy.\n  The President's budget featured tens of billions of dollars of tax \nhikes and fees for our Nation's oil, gas, and coal producers. It would \nhave stripped away offshore revenue sharing, which is a matter of \nfairness and should be expanded to all coastal producing States.\n  I know that is an issue the Chair and I agree on.\n  The President's budget also ignored basic responsibilities such as \ncleaning up abandoned legacy wells that the Federal Government drilled. \nThey drilled these years ago, decades ago, and while we have seen major \nspending increases at most agencies and departments, in the one area \nwhere they are obligated to do the cleanup, we are not seeing that \naddressed. The President's budget would have done nothing to promote \nresource development even in places where there is overwhelming public \nsupport for it, such as my State of Alaska, which has seen restriction \nafter restriction placed upon it by this administration. I have had an \nopportunity to speak many times on this floor about that.\n  Instead, the President sought new programs to subsidize the high \ncosts of his regulatory plans, and he has tried to find ways to avert \nthe serious consequences, such as the weakening of the reliability of \nour electric grid that will consequently fall on its weight.\n  Ultimately, the President's budget would have led to lower energy and \nmineral production in our country. It would have lowered energy and \nmineral security. It would have led to fewer jobs, lower revenues, \nhigher prices, and higher dependence on others. It would have lavished \nsubsidies as it deepens our debt. It takes us in exactly the wrong \ndirection when we talk about our energy future, our energy security.\n  The President's budget would have done nothing to turn around the \nnegative trends we are seeing in production on Federal lands either. \nHis energy proposals are about as balanced as the budget that he \noffered.\n  As we have seen increased oil production around the country, we have \nseen the benefits that it has yielded in terms of lower prices, we have \nseen the jobs that it has created, and we have seen the opportunities \nfor us. Yet this oil production is not happening on our Federal lands. \nIt is going gangbusters on State and private lands. Natural gas \nproduction has outright declined for years on Federal lands, and the \nPresident's regulators are now hard at work to ensure that coal follows \nsuit.\n  We talk a lot about the conventional fuels--fossil fuels--and it is \nimportant to recognize that we are seeing similar patterns on Federal \nlands when it comes to other energy sources. The President talks a lot \nabout increasing generation from our renewables. I agree. It is \nsomething we need to move towards. We are seeing increased renewable \nproduction, but are we seeing it on our Federal land? It may come as a \nsurprise to the Chair and to others in this body what we heard from \nrepresentatives of the wind industry.\n  My staff asked what percentage of wind projects are actually on \nFederal land? And surely, given the commitment we have to renewable \nenergy, one would expect that to be a high percentage. The answer back \nwas hardly any. Some 98.6 percent of wind projects are apparently on \nState and private land--98.6 percent. Not even 2 percent are on Federal \nland.\n  That stat shows what we mean and why we are right when we say it is \nincredibly hard to develop any type of energy on Federal lands. \nSecretary Jewell said as much in front of our committee. She said: It \nis just hard to do so on Federal lands.\n  So I am glad to be here as the chairman of the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources to affirm that we have a better way forward.\n  The energy revolution--renewable and petroleum--in this country has \nbeen on State and private lands. That is a fact. So I have filed an \namendment that would complement language that is already in the \nresolution by focusing on sales, transfers or exchanges of land with \nState or local governments.\n  The budget resolution already contains language for land acquisition \nand conservation efforts. So nothing in the language that we have \nincluded in this amendment actually sells, transfers or exchanges a \nspecifically identified piece of property. Any legislation enabled by \nthis spending-neutral reserve fund will have to go through the process \nand be voted either up or down in regular order.\n  The language does specify what cannot be considered, and that is any \nland that is located within a national park, within a national preserve \nor a national monument. Those would continue to be protected.\n  This language would provide balance by enabling the types of \nexchanges, sales or transfers with States or local governments that are \noften used to craft balanced, comprehensive land policies, such as we \ndid in the lands package on NDAA that we passed last Congress.\n  When we have an opportunity to consider this amendment, a vote for it \nis really a vote in support of--as a priority of this Congress--\ncomprehensive approaches to land policies to facilitate economic \ndevelopment, empower States, and improve our conservation systems.\n  I would encourage Members to take a look at what I have offered here \nthis evening and what I hope we will be able to take up for a vote \ntomorrow.\n  The second matter, very briefly--and I know the Senator from Colorado \nis here as well, and others wish to speak tonight--is an amendment I \nhave offered just now that I hope we will have a chance to vote on \nwhich focuses our priorities as a nation on what is happening in the \nnorth.\n  We are an arctic nation. Now we are by virtue of my home State. But \nit is not just Alaska. We are an arctic nation, and as such we have \nresponsibilities, we have obligations. There is activity happening in \nthe north country that is without question.\n  What is also without question is that as an arctic nation, we are \nwoefully behind in certain infrastructure related to our Arctic. What \ndo most people think of when they think of the Arctic?\n\n[[Page S1885]]\n\nIce. How do we move through the Arctic Ocean filled with ice? An ice \nbreaker. And it is not just for commerce, it is from a national \nsecurity perspective, it is from a research perspective. It is for all \nthose things that, again, would allow us to be a leader as an arctic \nnation.\n  This is not easy for us, because ice breakers don't come cheap. But \nit should be a priority for us, as a national asset, for an arctic \nnation.\n  I won't go through the list of what other nations have in terms of \ntheir assets, but suffice it to say our neighbors to the east in Russia \nhave over 30 ice breakers. The ice breaker capacity our Canadian \nfriends have is six.\n  But it is not just arctic nations that have arctic capacity through \ntheir ice breakers. It is nations such as China. Think how far away \nChina is from the Arctic. India is considering building an ice breaker. \nThink how far away they are. It begs the question: Why, as an arctic \nnation, are we not stepping up? So I am challenging my colleagues: \nThink broader.\n  I invited all Members of the Senate to join the Arctic Caucus and \nunderstand again what it means for you and your respective States, the \nbenefits, but also the obligations.\n  I look forward to the discussion on the issue of how we build out our \narctic capacity and our infrastructure, and I also look forward to \nfurther discussion on how we can do more to ensure the opportunities we \nhave for our economic development and our energy security can continue \non the lands we are blessed to have as a nation, and the opportunities \nthat will be made further available if we are able to move forward with \nthe ideas I have proposed this evening.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier today I came to the floor to talk \nabout the danger this Republican budget poses to our economic and \nnational security. I would like to expand on why this budget is out of \nbalance and to further highlight the risks of using OCO, as some of my \ncolleagues on the other side have proposed, instead of eliminating the \nsequester.\n  This budget, instead of taking a balanced approach to growing our \neconomy and fiscal responsibility, like raising revenue by closing \negregious tax loopholes and investing that revenue in job creation \nmeasures, doubles down on unrealistic and unfair cuts to programs that \nhelp grow and strengthen America's middle class. This perverse standard \nis evident across this budget and it reinforces a disturbing trend by \nmy colleagues on the other side--if it is a broad- based investment in \nour economy, like investing in infrastructure or providing aid to \njobseekers, then it must be paid for by cuts on the backs of middle-\nclass Americans; but, if it is for a set of powerful special interests \nlike the extension of tax expenditures then the deficit doesn't matter \nto many of my colleagues on the other side. This sort of double \nstandard is what causes the American people to feel that Congress is \nout of touch.\n  Most alarmingly, this budget does not eliminate the automatic \nspending reductions, known as the sequester, contained in the Budget \nControl Act. The Senate Republican budget leaves hundreds of billions \nof dollars in devastating automatic cuts to discretionary spending in \nplace and then makes an additional $236 billion in cuts over 10 years \nto investments for middle-class families. These cuts to our non-defense \nand defense budgets will cause substantial harm to our economic and \nnational security. That is why we have to eliminate the sequester--and \nwhy there must be balance in relief for non-defense and defense sides \nof the ledger.\n  Every senior civilian and military leader in the Department of \nDefense who has come before the Armed Services Committee has warned \nthat if defense budgets are subject to sequestration, we will likely \nnot be able to meet the national defense strategy without an \nunacceptable level of risk. It will have a damaging impact on our \nmilitary readiness, modernization, and the welfare of our service \nmembers and their families.\n  Earlier today I mentioned the testimony of Admiral Gortney and \nGeneral Kelly and how the non-defense and defense sides of the budget \nwork together to protect our homeland. Indeed, helicopters and cutters \nfrom the Coast Guard, which falls on the non-defense side of the \nledger, are critical to stopping drug smuggling and human trafficking \ninto the homeland. And General Kelly made clear that, because of the \nlimited number of Coast Guard cutters available, they are only stopping \nabout 20 percent of the traffic--and there is a direct correlation: the \nmore cutters they have, the more trafficking they can stop.\n  Senator McCain and Senator Graham have been trying repeatedly to \nincrease spending for defense accounts. Their absolute commitment to \nthe men and women of the armed services is without question. However, \nthey have been compelled, by those opposed to an increase of the base \nbudgets of the Armed Forces and who favor the continuation\n\n[[Page S1886]]\n\nof sequestration, to resort to a budgetary gimmick.\n  They would use the Overseas Contingency Operation account to try and \nincrease defense spending to the President's base level of $561 \nbillion.\n  First, I believe we should just eliminate the sequester all together, \nand that means going to the Budget Control Act cap of $577 billion for \ndefense in FY16. Second, using OCO as an escape valve as my Republican \ncolleagues have suggested isn't sustainable. It is a gimmick and as we \nhave heard in testimony, OCO funding isn't flexible as discretionary \nspending and could damage our long-term readiness.\n  General Odierno, Chief of Staff of the Army, made this point:\n\n       So first, I would just say there's a risk to not funding \n     the base, in putting it in OCO, because with that has to come \n     flexibility within OCO for us to spend it on the things that \n     are necessary. So . . . because OCO has limits and it has \n     restrictions, and it has very strict rules that have to be \n     followed. And so if we're inhibited by that, it might not \n     help us. What might happen at the end of the year, we have a \n     bunch of money we hand back because we're not able to spend \n     it.\n\n  General Welsh, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, made a similar point \nin describing the Air Force's need for modernization and how one-off \nfunding through OCO particularly constrains its platform-based force.\n  That is not how we should support the greatest fighting force in \nhistory. This may seem to be a clever way to bypass the Budget Control \nAct, but it has real ramifications for our men and women in uniform.\n  Indeed, the problem with these approaches is that they don't work. \nAnd, it seems even Senator Graham's amendment to boost OCO funding in \nthe budget runs into technical difficulties. Indeed, it does not appear \nto do what it purports to do--to boost defense spending--because it \nfails to lift the actual OCO cap. Now, it is true that a budget \nresolution isn't law, but plays an important role in the process of \ngoverning and setting the rules for our appropriations process.\n  Now, I expect there will be an attempt to correct that on the floor, \nbut we shouldn't be engaging in these diversions to begin with. We \nshould be crafting a budget that is serious and acknowledges our \neconomic and security needs.\n  So my colleagues and I are offering several amendments in order to \ndemonstrate there is a better path and to address some of the glaring \nproblems with this budget. However, as we have seen with Senator \nSander's reasonable attempt to provide $478 billion in transportation \nfunding, paid-for by closing egregious offshore tax loopholes, my \ncolleagues refuse to agree to the kind of commonsense proposals that I \nbelieve a vast majority of Americans would support.\n  But I hope my colleagues can join with me on some of these types of \nmeasures like ones to establish a budget point of order that will keep \nborrowing costs down for students; closing egregious offshore tax \nloopholes--which during our last budget debate was a bipartisan \namendment adopted by voice vote; or lowering drug prices for seniors by \nletting the Secretary of HHS negotiate drug prices--indeed, it is \nparticularly troubling that many pharmaceutical companies dodge taxes \nthrough offshore tax loopholes, but profit off of Medicare, and are \nlegally protected from having to negotiate drug prices with the \ngovernment.\n  We have a blueprint for responsibly managing the budget and meeting \nthe needs of a great and growing nation. It requires a balance of cuts, \nwhich we have done already, and new revenue. And as we see demonstrated \nby the Republican budget, we cannot cut our way to prosperity--much \nless cut our way towards a balanced budget. And we all know that the \nbest way forward is to promote broad-based economic growth so that \nmillions of hardworking Americans and their families can have a \nbrighter and stable economic future.\n  So I hope my colleagues on the other side will join with us in \nsupporting amendments that put middle-class families and broad-based \neconomic growth first.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/25/senate-section/article/S1886-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GARDNER.

Mr. President, I rise today to correct the record on the \nmatter of tax expenditures. Many myths have been created and reinforced \nby my friends on the other side of the aisle on the subject of tax \nexpenditures. In my 4 years as ranking Republican on the Senate Finance \nCommittee, I came to the floor several times to set the record \nstraight. I am afraid I need to do it again today, this time as \nchairman. Today I will focus on the tax expenditures in the individual \nincome tax. According to 2014 Congressional Budget Office data, the \nindividual income tax accounts for 47.1 percent of Federal revenue. By \ncontrast, the corporate income tax accounts for 11.9 percent of Federal \nrevenue.\n  It boils down to three basic points. All points that can be derived \nfrom an objective, nonpartisan review of the data from Congress's \nnonpartisan official tax scorekeeper. I am referring to the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, of which I am the vicechair.\n  First point: Tax expenditures are not spending, with one exception. \nThat exception is for refundable tax credits. They count as outlays \nunder the Congressional Budget Act. Ironically, refundable tax credits \nare the policies my friends on the other side are most in favor of \nexpanding. Just look at the slew of Democratic amendments filed to that \neffect. My Democratic friends erroneously describe most tax \nexpenditures as spending. Yet they seek to expand the minority of tax \nexpenditures which score as spending. Go figure.\n  Second point: The vast bulk of tax expenditures tend to distribute \ndisproportionately to middle and lower Income taxpayers. A cursory \nexamination of the Joint Committee on Taxation's annual tax expenditure \npamphlet will lead an unbiased reader inevitably to that conclusion.\n  Third point: The vast bulk of tax expenditures are attributable to \nwidely applicable tax benefits, like the charitable contribution \ndeduction, mortgage interest deduction, and State and local tax \ndeduction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan analysis of Joint Committee on Taxation data, performed by the \nFinance Committee staff.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            [March 25, 2015]\n\n       Fact Sheet: Who Benefits From Tax Expenditures?\n       Tax expenditures are often portrayed as ``loopholes'' that \n     disproportionately benefit the wealthy. However, examination \n     of the facts reveals that many of the largest tax \n     expenditures disproportionately benefit middle class \n     Americans or those with income below $200,000.\n       According to recent (Feb. 2013) Joint Committee on Taxation \n     estimates, those taxpayers with adjusted gross income \n     exceeding $200,000 collectively pay 57% of the individual \n     income tax burden. The remaining 43% of the individual income \n     tax burden is paid by those taxpayers with less than $200,000 \n     of adjusted gross income. The following summarizes how the \n     benefit of various tax expenditure items is split between \n     ``high income'' taxpayers with adjusted gross income \n     exceeding $200,000 and the remaining taxpayers with less than \n     $200,000 of adjusted gross income:\n       Mortgage Interest Itemized Deduction: 35% of the benefit of \n     the mortgage interest tax expenditure goes to taxpayers with \n     income exceeding $200,000. Taxpayers with income below \n     $200,000 receive 65% of the benefit. By a ratio of almost 2 \n     to 1, taxpayers under $200,000 benefit from it.\n       Earned Income Credit: The earned income credit is fully \n     refundable. This means that taxpayers receive it in full \n     whether they pay income tax or not. The earned income credit \n     is phased out as earned income rises. High income taxpayers \n     are not eligible to receive any benefit from the earned \n     income credit.\n       Child tax Credit: This credit is also limited to lower and \n     middle income taxpayers. Again, none of it goes to higher \n     income taxpayers.\n       Charitable Contribution Deduction: Of all of the tax \n     expenditures listed, at 57% this one distributes in the \n     highest proportion to taxpayers above $200,000 in income. The \n     tax savings benefit of the charitable contribution deduction \n     is distributed to wealthy taxpayers in the exact same \n     proportion as the share of total income taxes they pay. This \n     result hardly seems unfair.\n       State and Local Income and Sales Tax Deduction: 55% of this \n     broad-based deduction goes to high income families leaving \n     the remaining 45% to middle class earners. High\n\n[[Page S1887]]\n\n     income taxpayers receive most of the benefit from this tax \n     expenditure because they also pay most of the state and local \n     income and sales taxes.\n       Tax-Free Portion of Social Security Benefits: Just 2% of \n     the tax benefit from favorable tax treatment of Social \n     Security goes to recipients with income exceeding $200,000.\n       Real Property Taxes: While some may say that only those \n     with villas are taking the property tax deduction, 75% of the \n     real property tax benefit goes to taxpayers with less than \n     $200,000 of income.\n       Education Credits: Once again, 100% of the benefit goes to \n     taxpayers with income under $200,000.\n       Medical Expense Deduction: 88% of this tax benefit goes to \n     taxpayers with income under $200,000.\n       Child Care Credit: This is a modest tax credit targeted for \n     taxpayers that incur child care costs in order to work. Like \n     the child tax credit, it mainly benefits low and middle \n     income families. 95% of the benefit goes to taxpayers with \n     income under $200,000.\n       Student Loan Interest Deduction: This tax benefit is phased \n     out as a taxpayer's income rises. All of the benefit goes to \n     taxpayers earning less than $200,000.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    10 Largest Tax Expenditure Items\n\n\n                JCT Estimated 5 Year (2012-2016) Amounts\n\n 1) $707 Billion--Exclusion of Employer Provided Health Insurance and \n                          Health Care Benefits\n\n       Employer paid premiums for health insurance and other \n     health benefits are generally not included in the employee \n     recipient's taxable income and are also not subject to \n     employment taxes. In addition, employees can usually pay for \n     their share of employer provided health insurance and other \n     health benefits with pretax earnings.\n\n         2) $649 Billion--Tax Deferred Retirement Savings Plans\n\n       Both employer and employee contributions to pension plans \n     are generally excluded from taxable employee compensation. \n     Earnings on pension plan assets are also tax exempt. \n     Employees are taxed upon receipt of pension plan \n     distributions. Taxpayers accumulate savings for retirement \n     more rapidly with this benefit of tax deferral.\n\n    3) $596 Billion--Reduced Tax Rates on Long-term Capital Gains & \n                               Dividends\n\n       Recently enacted legislation has dramatically increased the \n     taxation of both long-term capital gain and qualified \n     dividend income for high income individuals. The tax rate for \n     these high income individuals has increased from 15% to 20% \n     beginning in 2013. This increased rate is lower than the \n     maximum rate applied to ordinary income which is now 39.6%.\n\n4) $402 Billion--Deduction of Nonbusiness State & Local, Income, Sales, \n               Personal Property and Real Property Taxes\n\n       Individual taxpayers can deduct amounts paid for non-\n     business state and local income, sales, real estate and \n     personal property taxes as an itemized deduction.\n\n  5) $364 Billion--Deduction for Mortgage Interest on Owner Occupied \n                               Residences\n\n       Interest on home mortgage loans may be deducted. There is a \n     $1,000,000 limit on the maximum qualifying loan amount and it \n     can be used to carry up to two taxpayer residences. Interest \n     on additional indebtedness of up to $100,000 is also \n     deductible when such indebtedness is secured by the \n     taxpayer's primary residence.\n\n                 6) $320 Billion--Earned Income Credit\n\n       The earned income tax credit is designed to subsidize the \n     wages of low and moderate income taxpayers. The credit is \n     greatly enhanced when the taxpayer is also supporting \n     children. This credit is fully refundable in the case of \n     taxpayers that have no income tax liability because of other \n     provisions in the tax system such as the standard deduction \n     and personal and dependency exemptions.\n\n                   7) $289 Billion--Child Tax Credit\n\n       Under current law taxpayers are entitled to a partially \n     refundable tax credit in the amount of $1,000 for each \n     qualifying child under the age of 17. The credit is phased \n     out for high income taxpayers.\n\n 8) $240 Billion--Exclusion of Cafeteria Plan & Other Employee Fringe \n                                Benefits\n\n       Under current law an employer's qualified cafeteria plan \n     allows employee participants to voluntarily reduce their \n     otherwise taxable compensation so that the reduction can be \n     used to purchase certain benefits such as health insurance \n     and dependent care with before-tax earnings. Repeal of this \n     provision would cause employees to purchase these benefits \n     with after-tax earnings.\n\n          9) $236 Billion--Exclusion of Capital Gains at Death\n\n       Under current law the tax basis of property included in a \n     decedent's estate is adjusted to fair market value on the \n     date of death. Accordingly, the gain element in a decedent's \n     appreciated property escapes income tax.\n\n        10) $225 Billion--Deduction for Charitable Contributions\n\n       Individual taxpayers can deduct gifts to qualified \n     charitable organizations as an itemized deduction. When a \n     taxpayer makes a gift of long-term capital gain property \n     (i.e., appreciated stock) the amount of deduction is equal to \n     the value of the gift. Accordingly, the capital gain in the \n     gifted property is not taxed.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                            [March 25, 2015]\n\n           Debunking the Myths of So-Called Tax Expenditures\n\n       Some in Washington have claimed that eliminating tax \n     expenditures is the same as getting rid of wasteful spending \n     or closing unwanted loopholes. The reality is somewhat \n     different. Middle-class families would hardly agree that \n     incentives to save for college and retirement or to buy a \n     home are loopholes. Here's a closer look at the myths of tax \n     expenditures:\n       Myth: Tax Expenditures Are Spending.\n       Fact: The federal government cannot spend money that it \n     never touched and never possessed. Tax expenditures let \n     taxpayers keep more of their own money. And only by the \n     public consent is the government permitted to take some of it \n     in taxation to pay for certain public goods. When tax hike \n     proponents say we are giving businesses and individuals all \n     this money in tax expenditures, they are incorrectly assuming \n     that the government has that money to give in the first \n     place, when in fact it does not. To the contrary, the \n     government never touches the money that a taxpayer keeps due \n     to benefitting from a tax expenditure, whereas with spending, \n     the government actually collects money from taxpayers and \n     then spends it.\n       Another difference between tax expenditures and spending is \n     that reducing or eliminating a tax expenditure without an \n     offsetting tax cut to reach a revenue neutral level will \n     cause the size of the federal government to grow, while \n     reducing or eliminating spending causes the size of the \n     federal government to shrink.\n       Myth: Tax Expenditures are Loopholes.\n       Fact: This is deliberately inaccurate. A loophole is \n     something that Congress did not intend and would generally \n     shut down, at least going forward, once it learned of the \n     loophole. Tax expenditures, by contrast, were generally \n     placed by Congress into the tax code deliberately. For \n     example, the largest tax expenditure is the exclusion for \n     employer-provided health insurance and benefits. The second-\n     largest: the home mortgage interest deduction.\n       Whether you agree with a particular tax expenditure or not, \n     an honest debate requires recognition that tax expenditures \n     were designed by Congress with economic or social goals in \n     mind and are not inadvertent loopholes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/25/senate-section/article/S1887-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO RICHARD F.

Mr. President, tucked away in the mountains, hills, and \nvalleys of Vermont is a widely recognized, vibrant college campus that \nalso happens to be my alma mater--Saint Michael's College. To students, \nfaculty, staff, and alumni alike, the Saint Michael's community is \nalmost like a family: once you become a part of it, it becomes part of \nyour life. Later this year, one of our campus's family members--Marilyn \nCormier--will leave the grounds of Saint Michael's, retiring after \nnearly 33 years of dedicated service to the college. Marilyn is known \nto many, and all who have worked with her have admired her tenacity, \nher love for Saint Michael's, and her commitment to the institution she \nhas called home for over three decades. I will miss her.\n  In 1982, Marilyn traveled halfway around the world from her home in \nSri\n\n[[Page S1888]]\n\nLanka and landed at Saint Michael's. She started working in the Office \nof Academic Affairs, ultimately becoming the director of government and \ncommunity relations and the secretary of the board of trustees, the \nposition from which she will retire. Marilyn's passion for connecting \nthe academic community of Saint Michael's with surrounding Vermont \ncommunities and communities across the country and abroad has made her \na valued mentor to students and faculty alike. St. Mike's could not \nhave had a more effective ambassador, champion, and problem-solver than \nMarilyn has been in this crucial role. Her energy is only matched by \nher creativity and her clear, sharp focus on what matters.\n  Marilyn's considerable talents also benefited the Vermont Council on \nWorld Affairs, an organization headquartered at Saint Michael's \nCollege. As a member of the board of directors, Marilyn has connected \nstudents with cross-cultural opportunities throughout Vermont and \nacross the globe. In 2012, Marilyn helped to organize a delegation of \nrepresentatives visiting the French city of Honfleur. It was a treat \nfor both Marcelle and me to be a part of that special visit.\n  Over the years, I have crossed paths with many people connected to \nSaint Michael's, from public figures in the Nation's Capital, Vermont \nand across the country, to visitors in my office, to members of my own \nstaff. One constant in each of these encounters is the praise they have \nfor Marilyn for her work in helping so many students achieve their \ngoals. She has empowered students to become leaders in their \ncommunities. I know these are commitments that will continue, even as \nMarilyn prepares for this exciting next chapter in her life.\n  Saint Michael's is a special place that many visit and come to call \nhome. So it has been for Marilyn Cormier. Marcelle and I wish our dear \nfriend all the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/25/senate-section/article/S1888-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    NAACP LEGAL DEFENSE AND EDUCATIONAL FUND, INC., 75TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this year marks the 75th anniversary of the \nNAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., one of the great civil \nrights organizations in the Nation's history. Seventy-five years ago, \nThurgood Marshall established LDF or the ``Inc. Fund''--as it was \ncommonly known then--as a separate legal entity. The efforts of the men \nand women of this organization throughout the years have transformed \nour Nation for the better. I am grateful for the leaders who have \ndedicated their lives to the perennial effort to move this country \ntoward a more perfect union. I would extend a special thanks to \nSherrilyn Ifill, the current president and director-counsel of LDF; \nLeslie Proll, the director of the Washington, DC, office; and Debo \nAdegbile, the former acting director-counsel of LDF. Their dedication \nis emblematic of the hard-working staff of the Legal Defense Fund.\n  Most of us know about LDF's work to dismantle segregation in the \nhistoric Brown v. Board of Education case, but the organization's \nadvocacy for civil rights extends far beyond litigating groundbreaking \ncases. The grass roots leaders of LDF have also helped achieve greater \nracial justice through its legislative efforts, including working with \nmembers from both sides of the aisle in Congress. The Legal Defense \nFund has contributed its knowledge and expertise on issues such as \nvoting rights, equal employment access, fair housing, education and \ncriminal justice, and their efforts have resulted in legislation and \npolicies that have improved the lives of millions of Americans.\n  This year, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the march from \nSelma as well as the 75th anniversary of LDF, I once again urge my \nfellow Senators to join our effort to restore the protections of the \nVoting Rights Act that were gutted by the Supreme Court's narrow \nmajority in Shelby County v. Holder. The best way to honor civil rights \nheroes such as Thurgood Marshall, and all the men and women of LDF, is \nto enact real and meaningful legislative reforms that advance the \nprinciples of equality for which those individuals dedicated their \nlives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/25/senate-section/article/S1888-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1888-S1889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING MOUNT SNOW'S 60TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to point out that \nwe are completing another brisk ski season at one of Vermont's fabled \nslopes, Mount Snow. This year marks the 60th anniversary of winter \nsports at Mount Snow, and while the temperatures dropped well below \nzero for many weeks, outdoor enthusiasts of Vermont and from far beyond \nhave descended on Dover, VT, to embrace Mother Nature's challenge, and \nthey have enthusiastically embraced the joys and challenges of our \ngorgeous mountainous terrain.\n  Mount Snow was born in the 1950s as Alpine skiing solidified itself \nas a popular American sport. It has been a vital contributor to the \neconomies of Vermont and New England ever since. Since its birth as one \nof Vermont's go-to ski slopes, Mount Snow has been an innovator and a \npioneer, staying ahead of the industry and adding features to the \nresort that are now commonplace at ski areas throughout our country and \nthe world.\n  As Mount Snow enters a new phase in its development, its future will \ninclude state-of-the-art advancements with a new ski lodge to meet \nskier needs and an expanded snowmaking infrastructure to ensure \nsnowmaking is available across the mountain. As the closest mountain to \nBoston and New York City, these improvements will only encourage more \npeople to choose Vermont as their primary destination for skiing and \nriding.\n  I want to congratulate the entire team at Mount Snow for 60 years of \ngreat and vibrant winter activity, and I look forward to all they have \nplanned for the future. I ask unanimous consent that an article from \nthe Manchester Journal sketching Mount Snow's history and planned \ngrowth be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Manchester Journal, Nov. 22, 2014]-\n\n                 Mount Snow To Make Major Improvements\n\n                         (By Brandon Canevari)\n\n       Dover.--Mount Snow--which is celebrating it's 60th \n     anniversary this year--is about to undergo some significant \n     changes.\n       The resort has had a master plan in place for a while now, \n     which is now in motion.\n       ``We're seeking financing for a couple of major capital \n     projects,'' said Mount Snow Communications Director Dave \n     Meeker. ``Thus far it's been very successful and we're well \n     on our way to reaching our goal. It's a total investment of \n     about $52 million dollars.''\n       One of the two major projects that resort is looking to \n     begin is the construction of a 20 million gallon snowmaking \n     water reservoir called West Lake.\n       ``That is really going to be the biggest step towards our \n     goal of having 100 percent snowmaking coverage on the \n     mountain,'' said Meeker.\n       Once they begin the project, Meeker said that it will \n     probably take about two years to complete.\n       ``It will take a couple years to get it completed because \n     it's not just excavating the pond. It's installing the new \n     pipes, installing the new facilities to push the water to the \n     mountain,'' said Meeker. ``There are just a lot of other \n     components that go along with constructing a reservoir that \n     size and with all the machinery and stuff that goes along \n     with it.''\n       The other components to the project are installing \n     snowmaking pipes, pump houses, booster houses and the other \n     components that are needed for snowmaking.\n       The other major component to the first phase of the plan is \n     the construction of a 36,000 square foot base lodge at \n     Carinthia Parks at Mount Snow.\n       ``It'll have skier services, food and beverage, retail, all \n     sorts of stuff. So, it will be a great improvement over to \n     the base area at Carinthia,'' said Meeker.\n       Depending on how financing goes, Meeker said that the \n     resort could break ground on West Lake as early as next \n     summer. When they will be able to build the base lodge and \n     make some of the other improvements that they are planning \n     though is still uncertain.\n       ``The timeline really depends on financing,'' said Meeker. \n     ``Our planning director, they've been globe-trotting \n     basically, going out and seeking investors and we've been \n     very successful so far. So . . . if we had all of the \n     investors today we'd be making plans to break ground as soon \n     as possible. So, it really hinges upon when we are able to \n     get enough investors to secure the financing to begin these \n     projects.''\n       The mountain installed 645 new low-energy snowmaking guns \n     this year as part of their master plan as well.\n       ``That would have been a big component to the improvements \n     that we would be making in future after building West Lake, \n     but we had the opportunity to take advantage of a program \n     that was offered by Efficiency Vermont this year to upgrade \n     our snowmaking system to all low-energy guns,''\n\n[[Page S1889]]\n\n     said Meeker. ``A lot of other resorts took advantage of it, \n     but we took full advantage of it. It was the largest single \n     snowgun update of any resort in Vermont's history and that \n     was a big step in the right direction for our snowmaking \n     system to run as efficiently as possible and also make the \n     best product possible.''\n\n\n                              Anniversary\n\n       Mount Snow's 60th Anniversary is right around the corner \n     and Meeker said that a weekend of festivities have been \n     planned in celebration.\n       The celebration is going to be on Friday, Dec. 12, which is \n     known as ``Founder's Day.'' The date is the first day Mount \n     Snow opened back in 1954, Meeker said.\n       ``Since it's on a Friday and it is our 60th we're going to \n     celebrate all weekend long. So, we're going to have stuff \n     going on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Saturday we're going to \n     have a party at the Snow Barn with Orange Crush, which is an \n     80s band, so we're going to have a throwback party. We're \n     already encouraging people to wear retro gear all weekend \n     long; whatever time period in which they have some clothes \n     from the past.''\n       Part of what the resort will be doing to celebrate is \n     offering $12 lift tickets when the tickets are purchased in \n     advance online. The resort is also going to have a big \n     historical display of Mount Snow memorabilia.\n       There are also going to be parties at Cousins and the Main \n     Base Lodge.\n       On Sunday of that weekend, Meeker said they are also \n     probably going to have an ``old school'' bamboo gate series.\n       ``Back in the day when people would run gates they would be \n     made of bamboo and so we're going to set some of those up. \n     We're going to have a straight ski category,'' said Meeker. \n     ``It's just going to be a real focusing on our history.''\n       While the Dec. 12 weekend is going to be the big \n     celebration of the resort's 60th Anniversary, Meeker said \n     that they will be celebrating throughout the winter with some \n     other events as well.\n       ``We love to celebrate things here at Mount Snow,'' said \n     Meeker. ``It's one of the things that we do so hopefully \n     folks will come out and help us celebrate because it's not \n     just about our history this season, it's about our future and \n     we have a lot of great stuff to talk about with that.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/25/senate-section/article/S1889-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                          Louisiana Casualties\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I come to the floor today with a heavy heart to remember \nand commemorate the 11 soldiers, including 4 members of the Louisiana \nNational Guard, who we lost this month as a result of a helicopter \ntraining accident on the Santa Rosa Sound. These were brave men, having \nregularly risked their own lives while flying in combat and in \nresponding to the numerous hurricanes Louisiana has been devastated by \nduring the many years of service they gave. I agree with Major General \nCurtis, the Adjutant General of the Louisiana National Guard, in \ndescribing them as the best of us. They were selfless men willing to \nsacrifice their own safety and lives if it meant ensuring our security \nor saving the life of another. Nothing can ever fill the void left by \ntheir absence, an absence that makes it our duty to keep their memories \nalive, so that others may know of their bravery and sacrifice. \nRecognizing the valor that each of these men served with, today I \nsubmit for the record specifics regarding Louisiana's soldiers.\n  Chief Warrant Officer George Griffin joined the Louisiana National \nGuard in 1994 before deploying to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom in 2004 and again in 2008. He is remembered as one of the most \ntalented and respected warrant officers in the Louisiana National \nGuard, who routinely sought to teach his fellow aviators to be the best \nthey could be. He also served during State deployments in response to \nHurricanes Katrina, Rita and Isaac; in support of Operation River \nGuardian in 2011, which sought to extend the levee protecting Klotz \nSprings; and in the response to the Deepwater Horizon spill. He is \nsurvived by his wife Becky, his four children, Marianne, Cody, Dylan, \nand Logan, and his father George.\n  Chief Warrant Officer George Strother joined the Louisiana National \nGuard in 1988, serving until 2007 before rejoining the Guard in 2009. \nIn addition to his service in response to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and \nIsaac, he deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in \n2004, to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in 2011, \nand Kosovo in 2014 as a member of the NATO peacekeeping force. He was a \ndevoted husband, father, and servicemember. An experienced combat \naviator and instructor, he is remembered as a caring man with an \noutsized personality that touched the lives of everyone he met. He is \nsurvived by his wife Melissa; his children Chelsie and George II, and \nhis mother Sara.\n  Staff Sergeant Lance Bergeron enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in \n1994, serving on Active Duty until 1998 and as a reservist until 2001, \nwhen he joined the Louisiana National Guard. He was a seasoned combat \nveteran, having deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom \nin 2004 and again in 2008. He also deployed in response to Hurricanes \nKatrina, Rita, and Isaac, and as a part of Operation River Guardian in \n2011. He is remembered as an experienced crew chief that the members of \nhis unit looked up to and aspired to be. According to men in his unit, \nhe served with an unparalleled excitement and dedication to his duty as \na National Guard member, husband, and father. He is survived by his \nwife Monique, his two children Callie and Landon, and his parents Mark \nand Stella.\n  Staff Sergeant Thomas Florich enlisted in the Louisiana National \nGuard in 2007, and served as a Black Hawk repairman. He served in \nnumerous State deployments, including Operation Deepwater Horizon and \nin response to Hurricane Isaac. He is remembered as a cheerful man \ndedicated to the National Guard and always willing to step up if it \nmeant the unit would be able to better complete its mission. Staff \nSergeant Florich is not only survived by his parents Stephen and \nKimberley, but also his wife Meghan, who is pregnant with their first \nchild.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/25/senate-section/article/S1889-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR.

Friends of Children of \nMississippi operates Head Start and Early Head Start Programs in \nHumphreys, Sharkey, Issaquena, Madison, Leake, Rankin, Copiah, Kemper, \nNewton, Clarke, Jasper, Smith, Jones, Wayne, and Green Counties.\n  Friends of Children of Mississippi has a notable record of providing \nquality early childhood development and educational services to low-\nincome children in our State. In the organization's 48-year history, it \nhas transitioned nearly 140,000 children into the public schools of \nMississippi.\n  Friends of Children of Mississippi was recognized recently by the \nNational Head Start Association for its accomplishments. Its two-\ngeneration model, which engages parents of Head Start and Early Head \nStart children to break the cycle of poverty and put families on the \npath to self-sufficiency, was featured in a National Association report \nas a case study for exceptionally effective two-generation programs. \nSince the Friends of Children of Mississippi two-generation program \nbegan in 2003, almost 97 percent of enrolled parents have successfully \ncompleted their GED or gone to college and transitioned to employment. \nThis well-deserved honor is a credit to Dr. Hogan and his colleagues in \nthe 15 counties they serve across Mississippi.\n  A native of Waynesboro, MS, Dr. Hogan has been recognized nationally \nfor his work to break intergenerational cycles of poverty and to expand \neducational opportunities for African Americans in our State. I am \npleased to commend Dr. Hogan for his service and to wish him and his \ncolleagues continued success in their work to provide a solid \neducational foundation for Mississippi's children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/25/senate-section/article/S1889-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1889-S1890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RAIL SAFETY AND POSITIVE TRAIN CONTROL\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, today I voice my concerns on an important \nrail safety issue that we have been working on in the Senate Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation. While railroads and commuter \nrails may face the immense challenge of implementing appropriate PTC \nprecautions, now and always we must place the safety of our citizens \nabove the fear of difficulties incurred by necessary technological \nchange. We must face these difficulties head-on in order that our \ncitizens' lives be ensured safety in public transportation.\n  New Jersey runs on rail. Our economy simply could not sustain itself\n\n[[Page S1890]]\n\nwithout it. Our Northeast corridor alone moves more than 700,000 people \na day. Without the necessary PTC safeguards, these people will face the \nthreat of a devastating crash more so every day. The sheer volume of \ncommuters itself presents momentous concern for the State to be able to \nsuccessfully guarantee the well-being of its rail lines. Knowing now \nthat crashes like the Metro-North accident could have been prevented by \nPTC protections, I can say with bursting resolve that it is time for us \nto do better. The application of PTC directly translates into lives \nsaved. To me and for many, that is an easy trade--as easy as it ever \ngets.\n  But it is rarely ever that simple. I recognize that for many in the \nrail industry, who share my commitment to improving safety, the reality \nis that difficult investment decisions need to be made and the current \ntimeline is not achievable, even for those with the best of intentions. \nImplementation will take time. We cannot expect these complex \ntechnological improvements to come overnight. In spite of this, we can \nstill hold these improvements to a reasonably tight schedule, one that \nis attainable.\n  I am hopeful that in the time between today's committee vote and \nbefore the final passage of PTC legislation, we can work to shorten the \nextension and find a better balance. I look forward to working with the \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation Committee chairman, ranking \nmember, and the rest of my colleagues to improve this initiative.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/25/senate-section/article/S1890-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO EDWARD WILLIAMS\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Edward C. \nWilliams, Jr. Ed honorably served the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for \nmore than 15 years, most recently as State director for my Senate \noffice. Ed has been a trusted advisor and friend over the 8 years we \nworked together.\n  A native of Wilkes-Barre, an alumnus of the Head Start program in \nLuzerne County, and a graduate of Franklin and Marshall College in \nLancaster, Ed has deep roots in Pennsylvania. Prior to joining my \nstaff, he served in the House of Representatives for Congressman Paul \nKanjorski as a staff assistant, later earning a leading advisory role \non House budgetary proceedings. When he was recommended to my staff \nfollowing my election to the Senate in 2006, we knew right away that we \nwanted Ed on our team. He was the first legislative staffer hired for \nmy Washington, DC office, serving as our projects and appropriations \ndirector.\n  Ed immediately became one of my most valued and effective legislative \naides. To further his education he attended law school at night while \nworking full-time in Washington, DC and passed the bar. He was promoted \nto senior counsel in my office shortly thereafter. In 2010, Ed accepted \nthe position of State director for my Senate office. Overseeing seven \ndistrict offices and serving as my primary liaison to many of the \nState's most prominent leaders, Ed has never failed to exceed \nexpectations. Were it not for Ed, many of our most ambitious projects \ncould never have been realized.\n  In my years of public service, I have had the privilege of working \nwith many intelligent and hard-working professionals. Without question, \nEd ranks among the top. He is one of the most capable and diligent \npeople I have had the pleasure of working with, and his commitment to \nexcellence is evident in all that he does.\n  On a personal note, getting to know Ed has been a privilege. A true \nchampion for the people of our State, Ed should be extremely proud of \nthe great work he has done for thousands of our constituents. I will \nforever be grateful to him for his public service.\n  My staff and I will miss Ed greatly, but we know that he will remain \na close friend and trusted advisor. I wish him, his wife Lisa, and \ntheir son Matthan well in this exciting new chapter of their \nlives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/25/senate-section/article/S1890-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DAWN JUSTICE\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I honor Dawn Justice, who is \nretiring from serving as president and chief executive officer of the \nIdaho Bankers Association.\n  Dawn, who grew up in Sarasota, FL, began her career in the hotel \nindustry working in hotel management for the Hilton and Hyatt hotels. \nHer work in this field took her to California, Texas, Singapore, and \nThailand before we were blessed that she chose to make Idaho her home \n24 years ago. Prior to her work with the Idaho Bankers Association, she \nalso worked as vice president of human resources for the Idaho \nAssociation of Commerce and Industry and special projects assistant for \nBoise State University, where she also earned her master of public \nadministration degree.\n  For the past 11 years, Dawn has led the Idaho Bankers Association \nwith remarkable skill and knowhow. Throughout her time with the \nassociation, Dawn has been instrumental in advancing a number of the \norganization's priorities, including initiatives involving the Idaho \nBank Act, Personal Information Security Act, the Credit Report \nProtection Act, the Residential Mortgages Practices Act, the Uniform \nPrudent Investor Act, and much more. She has utilized her indispensable \ntalents advocating for policy objectives of importance both at the \nState and national levels.\n  Dawn's efforts and advocacy on behalf of the Idaho banking community \nhave been exceptionally helpful as we have worked together over the \nyears. She has been an outstanding advocate in explaining the need for \ntraditional banking and the costs of overregulation on consumers, small \nbusinesses and communities. She was instrumental in providing valuable \ninsight and recommendations that helped me craft and advance my \nregulatory relief legislation into law. Additionally, her help pushing \nback against harmful Dodd-Frank rules and providing insight into how \nmany of these rules would negatively impact credit and economic growth \nopportunities in Idaho has been especially appreciated.\n  Dawn, thank you for your hard work and effective leadership. You have \nbeen a great strength in advancing Federal policy changes of assistance \nto Idahoans. I commend you for your service to Idaho and our Nation. I \nwish you all the best and hope you have a retirement filled with many \ngood times with your loved ones. Congratulations on your remarkable \ncareer and retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/25/senate-section/article/S1890-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/25/senate-section/article/S1890-4", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/25/senate-section/article/S1890-5", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1890-S1891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:30 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 216.

Res. 112\n\n       Whereas each year, Internal Revenue Service Publication 17, \n     entitled ``Your Federal Income Tax'', provides individuals \n     with general instructions on how to file their taxes for the \n     previous taxable year;\n       Whereas in each year prior to 2015, free printed versions \n     of Internal Revenue Service Publication 17 were made widely \n     available to taxpayers at libraries, post offices, and \n     taxpayer service offices, and even by mail at the request of \n     a taxpayer;\n       Whereas in an effort to save money, the Internal Revenue \n     Service no longer disseminates a free printed version of \n     Internal Revenue Service Publication 17 as it transitions to \n     a fully electronic tax filing system, including an electronic \n     system for providing instructions on filing taxes;\n       Whereas the Internal Revenue Service directs taxpayers to \n     the Internet to download an electronic version of Internal \n     Revenue Service Publication 17, even though the limited \n     availability of a printed version of this publication burdens \n     individuals who do not have access to a computer or printer \n     and individuals who struggle to navigate a computer;\n       Whereas the dissemination of printed copies of Internal \n     Revenue Service Publication 17 is a basic taxpayer service \n     that the Internal Revenue Service is ignoring in an effort to \n     reduce spending;\n       Whereas the Internal Revenue Service has experienced budget \n     cuts for 5 consecutive fiscal years, amounting to a reduction \n     in its budget of $1,200,000,000, or 10 percent, since fiscal \n     year 2010;\n       Whereas the Internal Revenue Service should prioritize its \n     resources on areas that are critical to the ability of \n     taxpayers to file their taxes in a timely and proper manner; \n     and\n       Whereas the decision of the Internal Revenue Service to \n     stop disseminating printed copies of Internal Revenue Service \n     Publication 17 adversely impacts populations that do not have \n     access to, or understand how to use, a computer, and the \n     decision unnecessarily burdens and restricts the ability of \n     taxpayers to comply with the convoluted and complicated \n     provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate urges the Internal Revenue \n     Service to--\n       (1) resume printing copies of Internal Revenue Service \n     Publication 17; and\n       (2) provide free copies of such publication to the \n     taxpayers of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/25/senate-section/article/S1894-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1894-S1895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 113--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n CITIZENS' STAMP ADVISORY COMMITTEE SHOULD RECOMMEND THE ISSUANCE OF, \n  AND THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE SHOULD ISSUE, A COMMEMORATIVE \n                STAMP IN HONOR OF THE HOLIDAY OF DIWALI\n\n  Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. Cornyn) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs:\n\n                              S.

Res. 114\n\n       Whereas colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of \n     cancer death among men and women combined in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas in 2015, more than 130,000 individuals in the \n     United States will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer and \n     approximately 50,000 more will die from it;\n       Whereas colorectal cancer is 1 of the most preventable \n     forms of cancer because screening tests can find polyps that \n     can be removed before becoming cancerous;\n       Whereas screening tests can detect colorectal cancer early, \n     which is when treatment works best;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     estimates that if every individual aged 50 or older had \n     regular screening tests, as many as 60 percent of deaths from \n     colorectal cancer could be prevented;\n       Whereas the 5-year survival rate for patients with \n     localized colorectal cancer is 90 percent, but only 39 \n     percent of all diagnoses occur at that stage;\n       Whereas colorectal cancer screenings can effectively reduce \n     the incidence of colorectal cancer and mortality, but 1 in 3 \n     adults between the ages of 50 and 75 are not up to date with \n     recommended colorectal cancer screening;\n       Whereas public awareness and education campaigns on \n     colorectal cancer prevention, screening, and symptoms are \n     held during the month of March each year; and\n       Whereas educational efforts can help provide to the public \n     information on methods of prevention and screening, as well \n     as symptoms for early detection: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the designation of March 2015, as ``National \n     Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month'' and the goals and ideals \n     of that Month; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the month with appropriate awareness and educational \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/25/senate-section/article/S1895-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 115--DESIGNATING APRIL 2015 AS ``NATIONAL CONGENITAL \n                 DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS (for himself and Mr. Cardin) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
