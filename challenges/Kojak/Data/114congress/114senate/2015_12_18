Madam President, we know our constituents are deeply \nconcerned about America's struggling economy. So let's take steps, as \nthe legislation we will consider proposes, to support more jobs, more \nopportunity, and more economic growth.\n  Let's enact permanent tax relief for American families and small \nbusinesses. Let's set the table for pro-growth tax reform. Let's \npermanently eliminate an energy policy from the 1970s that not only \ncosts American jobs but also strengthens America's adversaries like \nIran and Russia. This will end the absurd position we are in now, where \nthe Iranians, as a result of the President's deal, can export oil and \nthe United States can't.\n  Here is something else. We know our constituents are deeply concerned \nabout America's national security. So let's take steps, as the \nlegislation we will consider proposes, to strengthen our national \nsecurity in a dangerous world. Let's help ensure our military has more \nof the funding it needs to train, equip, and confront the threats that \nface us from literally every corner of the globe. Let's bolster the \nFBI's ability to confront terror within our borders. Let's bring badly \nneeded reform to the Visa Waiver Program. The last provision is \nespecially important. Let's prevent the transfer of dangerous \nterrorists from Guantanamo's secure detention center into America's \ncommunities. Let's provide the people we represent with some long \noverdue protection from cyber attacks. Let's honor our veterans and \nenact critical reforms to help address the crises we have seen at the \nVA.\n  The legislation we will consider today would take steps to strengthen \nour economy and strengthen our national security. It would also bolster \nthe First Amendment. It would attack key pillars of ObamaCare and \nprevent a taxpayer bailout of this partisan law. That last provision is \nespecially important. Protecting the middle class from financing a \nbailout of ObamaCare means we are likely to speed up America's day of \nliberation from ObamaCare as well.\n  So here is my view. This legislation helps our economy, helps our \nnational security, and strikes more blows to a partisan health law that \nhurts the middle class. I think it is legislation worth supporting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8838-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, before I leave the floor, I would \nlike to say something about last year. The American people voted for a \nnew majority last November. We were humbled to have their support and \ntake the Senate in a new direction. The Senate has made great strides \nin the year since. I think we have shown how the Senate can not only \nget back to work, but also return to a place of higher purpose.\n  We have committees working again. We opened up the legislative \nprocess. We gave Senators from both parties more of a say. As a result, \nwe have gotten a lot done for the American people.\n  There are numbers that help tell the story, such as the fact that \nthis Senate allowed 200 rollcall votes compared to just 15 last year. \nBut it is the substance of what we passed that truly shows what a new \nand more open Senate can achieve for the American people: replacing No \nChild Left Behind with the most significant K-12 education reform in \nmore than a dozen years; addressing crumbling roads and bridges with \nthe first long-term Transportation bill in a decade; a balanced budget \nfor the first time since 2001; help for our veterans; hope for the \nvictims of modern slavery; modernizing changes for our military and its \nacquisition systems; and notable, bipartisan reforms for programs like \nMedicare--reforms that set a precedent for further positive action in \nthe future.\n  We brought a permanent end to more of Washington's artificial cliffs \nand manufactured dramas by working toward real reform instead of just \ntemporary patches, and we will do that again today. We will enact \npermanent tax relief for families and small businesses. We will bring \nan end to a job-destroying, 40-year ban on energy exports. We will \nfinally pass landmark cyber security legislation after years of Senate \ninaction. And just last night, we passed the first significant \nenvironmental reform bill in decades, one that will create more \ncertainty for businesses and ensure uniform safety standards for \nproducts our families use.\n  This is all very good news for the American people. Nearly all the \npolicies I mentioned were, or will be, signed into law by the \nPresident.\n  Others, while important, do not have his support. That includes \nlegislation to rescue the middle class from the pain of ObamaCare, to \nsupport Keystone's energy jobs, and to protect Kentucky's small \nbusinesses and coal families from Washington's regulatory assault.\n  It is now clear that it will take a new President--a new President--\nto achieve those things for the American people. But we are proving \nthat you can still get a lot done with a President from a different \nparty. We are proving you can actually enact significant, long-term \nreforms, achieve conservative policy goals, and get them signed into \nlaw.\n  I am proud of what the new Senate has accomplished. I wish to thank \nthe many friends across the aisle who joined us in passing so many \nbipartisan reforms for the American people. We are not only putting the \nSenate back to work; we are putting it back on the side of the American \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8838-4", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the accomplishments of the first session \nof this Senate has been a demonstration of what can happen when the \nminority is not trying to block everything. There has been no need this \nlast year for scores and scores of cloture petitions being filed \nbecause we didn't block things; we rarely did that. In the past, of \ncourse, it was done all the time. So we have demonstrated that it is \nimportant to have a minority that is responsible.\n  Of course, we know the issues that have passed this year are issues \nthat we worked on for a number of years and that had been blocked by \nRepublicans. We are glad to have been part of this Congress and able to \nmove forward on a number of issues that have been languishing for a \nlong time.\n  Of course, next year we need to do more for the middle class. There \nare lots of things that we haven't been able to do and should do--\nminimum wage, making sure that my daughter and my granddaughter are \npaid the same as a man who does the same work.\n  We also have to understand that the lack of college affordability is \ncrushing our country. It is often said it is a larger debt than credit \ncards, and we have to do something to relieve that pressure on the \nAmerican people.\n  It is often said that legislation is the art of compromise, and I \nknow that is true. Crafting bipartisan legislation is hard, tedious \nwork. It requires a complex calibration of competing interests, needs, \nand realities. The legislation that will soon be before this body, the \ncombined omnibus spending bill and tax extenders package, is a perfect \nexample of a bipartisan compromise wrought in good faith.\n  It wasn't easy. In fact, coming to an agreement on this package was a \npainstaking endeavor by Senate and House leaders and by House and \nSenate Members, but it was especially hard for our staffs. I am so \nappreciative of their exceptionally good work. I know it meant\n\n[[Page S8839]]\n\nlong hours, late nights and weekends spent here in the Capitol. Without \ntheir diligent efforts, we wouldn't be here voting on this legislation \ntoday.\n  On my leadership staff, no one worked harder than my chief of staff, \nDrew Willison. He was my lead negotiator, and he did an admirable job--\na tremendous job. He worked very, very hard. I won't go into all the \nhard work that he did, but I remember one night I was having trouble \ndozing off. I called him at midnight, and he responded on the phone. \nFor the next three hours I still didn't do too well sleeping, so I \ncalled him at 3 a.m. He still responded. He was here at the Capitol \nworking--working to make this agreement a reality. In all his years \nhere, I have found that Drew, a congressional fellow who came in from \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, was so good that I wouldn't let \nhim leave, and he has been a Senate person since then. He was selected \nby me to be Assistant Sergeant at Arms. In everything he has been asked \nto do, he has done a remarkably good job. So I wasn't surprised at all \nthat he was able to do the work he did on these bills with tremendously \ndifficult legislative issues that will be before this body shortly.\n  I want to speak for just a minute about Gary Myrick, Secretary for \nthe minority. He has been my floor general and my chief of staff. I \ndepend on his expertise on the issues now before us, which soon will be \nbefore us, and on everything we do here in the Senate. He is an expert \non Senate rules, and I appreciate very much his good work.\n  Bill Dauster, my deputy chief of staff--nobody on Capitol Hill better \nunderstands policy or legislation than Bill. Anytime legislative \nstaff--not just mine, but anyone's staff in the Senate--has an issue \ndealing with legislation, they know Bill will be available. I admire \nhim. He is a fine man. I so appreciate the example he sets in being \ngood to everybody.\n  Kate Leone is my senior health counsel. To say she does an \nexceptional job is an understatement. Kate is probably the world's \nleading expert on ObamaCare, and she is an absolute expert on all \nhealth policy issues. She brought her expertise to this agreement in \nfull force with the able assistance of McKenzie Bennett, who also works \non health care issues for me. Again, I appreciate very much her hard \nwork.\n  Ellen Doneski, my chief tax policy adviser, deserves praise. Tax \npolicy is difficult. I took a couple of courses in law school on tax \npolicy. To be honest with you, it didn't interest me very much, but for \nmy lack of interest, Ellen has been stupendous. Even while not feeling \nwell, she has worked her way through the last few weeks exhausted, \nworking with Democrats, Republican counterparts, and making intricate \ntax decisions and putting intricate tax provisions in the agreement \nthat is before this body.\n\n  Alex McDonough, my senior policy adviser, handles my energy and \nenvironmental problems. This legislation is one of the greatest \ninvestments in renewable energy in American history. It is amazing what \nwe have done in this legislation. The writing of this legislation was \ndone by Alex. This work that has been done on this bill dealing with \nrenewable energy--picture 65 coal-fired powerplants with an average \nmegawatt production, let's say, of 800 megawatts. Sixty-five coal-fired \nplants would be gone, and they will be gone. That is how much pollution \nfrom fossil fuel will be saved as a result of the work done here. If \nyou don't like that example, try 50 million automobiles will be taken \noff the roads--not 5 million, 50 million.\n  Alex, I appreciate your good work very much. This legislation \nwouldn't be what it is today without Alex.\n  Gavin Parke, my senior policy adviser and counsel was here working \nhard on banking and financial in this legislation. He worked like \neveryone: long, hard hours on very complicated banking issues, housing \nissues. I appreciate and admire his good work and his pleasant \npersonality. He was assisted by Sammi Swing, who worked with him on \nsome housing issues that were extremely difficult in this bill.\n  My brilliant chief counsel, Ayesha Khanna, oversaw cyber security, \nsurveillance, and all kinds of things when I needed a good legal mind \nto help me work my way through understanding these issues. I appreciate \nher tireless efforts.\n  My senior adviser, Tyler Moran, I don't think there is anyone in \nWashington who understands immigration issues more than Tyler. She \nworked in the White House. I was able to coax her into coming from the \nWhite House to work with us, and she has done an outstanding job on \neverything dealing with immigration--whether it is the DREAMers, \nwhether it is litigation that followed the President doing an Executive \norder, helping the DREAMers' parents, whatever it is, children coming \nacross the border, all related issues, including refugees and visas.\n  Jessica Lewis is one of the most pleasant, nicest people I have ever \nknown. She is my national security advisor. I so appreciate her \ndemeanor, her intellect, and her hard work. Late yesterday, when we \nfinished work here, we went to one of the secure rooms in the Capitol, \nand we spent time with her telling me what is going on around the \nworld. A lot of it is not very pleasant, but that is her job. I \nappreciate her work on foreign policy and intelligence issues. She is \nassisted by my deputy national security advisor, Julie Klein, who is \nalso a good person and knows foreign policy.\n  Sara Moffat worked on interior-related issues and many other \nenvironmental issues but especially wild horses, sage grouse, and many \nother environmental issues that kept popping up on this bill.\n  George Holman helped me to fend off attacks on campaign finance \nreform and other issues as they arose.\n  Caren Street spent weeks on the EB-5 visa issue. I found her to be \nsomeone who is very intelligent and always available. I appreciate her \ngood work and her wonderful smile.\n  Bruce King is stunningly smart. He is a Stanford person. He is my \nadviser, my confidant on issues relating to budget and finance. He is \nformerly staff director of the Budget Committee. He worked on all \nbudget components of this bill and there were lots of them. I admire \nhis soft speaking and his directness. I really like him as a person.\n  Jason Unger is my legislative director. I have such admiration for \nhim. He also is quiet and very effective. He is a person who believes \nin public service. This young man, who graduated with high honors from \nUCLA, decided he wanted to do something in public service, so he taught \nfor the Teach For America Program for 5 years in Compton, CA. It is a \nvery difficult job. He taught little kids, and I bet he did a wonderful \njob, as he has done in the Capitol working with me as my legislative \ndirector.\n  My staffers were not alone in their efforts. They were helped \ntremendously by staff from other offices. The four principal leadership \nnegotiators were, as I mentioned, Drew Willison, my chief of staff; \nHazen Marshall from Senator McConnell's staff; Dick Meltzer from Leader \nPelosi's staff; Austin Smythe; and Cindy Herrle from Speaker Ryan's \noffice. They worked well together. I am sure once in a while they would \nraise their voices with one another, but it worked out real well. It \nwas a good team, and we have the result to prove it.\n  As I indicated, these were tough negotiations, but these five \nindividuals worked very hard. They made tough choices and brought them \nto their principal and decisions were made. It was amazingly \ncooperative. It was done in a collegial manner. I believe that all the \nleaders were exceptionally well represented by these men and women.\n  I would be remiss not to mention Barbara Mikulski's outstanding \nappropriations team. The entire staff deserves our thanks but \nespecially Staff Director Chuck Kieffer, who is an institution of the \nU.S. Senate. He is a fine person, a hard worker, and no one understands \nthe appropriations process better than he does, and of course Deputy \nStaff Director Jean Eisen, who has been remarkably involved.\n  This leaves me to say a word about Barbara Mikulski. When the history \nbooks are written of what has taken place in the U.S. Senate during the \nlast 40 years, she will be a principal of that history. I had the good \nfortune of being able to come to the Senate with her. We served on the \nsame committees. We have served on the Appropriations Committee for \nsure and enjoyed our relationship. There is no one I have served with \nin public office I have more respect for than Barbara Mikulski. I \nadmire her. I admire how she has been so dynamic in the U.S. Senate. \nShe is\n\n[[Page S8840]]\n\none of the finest orators we have ever had in the Senate while I have \nbeen here. She does it in a unique way, but we all listen.\n  Barbara Mikulski, thank you very much.\n  We also had to work hard with the Finance Committee. I extend my \nappreciation to our ranking member, Ron Wyden. He and I have served \ntogether in Congress for a long time, more than three decades, but not \nonly do I appreciate his work but also his staff director, Josh \nSheinkman. I may not pronounce his name just right, but everybody knows \nJosh. I want the Finance Committee and all of their staff to know how \nmuch we appreciate this product that they were responsible for piecing \ntogether.\n  I already talked a day or so ago about Dennis McDonough, the \nPresident's Chief of Staff. He is a remarkably fine man.\n  Brian Deese, Senior Adviser to the President, was one of the reasons \nwe got the great agreement we got out of Paris with those accords \ndealing with the environment.\n  Katie Beirne Fallon, President Obama's Legislative Affairs Director, \nI have already laid out on the record what a wonderful person she is.\n  Jason Furman, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, I extend \nmy appreciation to him and his entire family whom I know.\n  Marty Paone, I talked about him.\n  We really care a great deal about them.\n  There are many others who helped craft this compromise.\n  From the Republican Leader's office: Brendan Dunn and Scott Rabb.\n  From Speaker Ryan's office: George Callas and Matt Hoffman.\n  From Leader Pelosi's office: Katherine Monge and Wendell Primus.\n  From Senator Cornyn's office: Monica Popp.\n  From the Senate Finance Committee: Ryan Abraham, Brett Baker, Kim \nBrandt, Chris Campbell, Adam Carrasco, Anne Dwyer, Karen Fisher, Liz \nJurinka, Matt Kazan, Jay Khosla, Jim Lyons, Juan Machado, Todd Metcalf, \nMatt Prater, Josh Sheinkman, Katie Simeon, Tiffany Smith, and Todd \nWooten.\n  From the Senate HELP Committee: Nick Bath and Andi Fristedt.\n  From the Senate Banking Committee: Mark Powden.\n  From the Senate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources: \nAngela Becker-Dippmann and Sam Fowler.\n  From Senator Schumer's office: Meghan Taira.\n  From Senator Gillibrand's office: Brooke Jamison.\n  From Congressman Levin's office: Karen McAffe.\n  I realize I may be missing some people. So to everyone who helped \npush this legislation across the finish line, thank you. You have done \nAmerica a great service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8840-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to discuss the state of the U.S. \nSenate. My 39 years of service in this body have given me an \nincreasingly unique vantage point to reflect upon this institution. \nOver the years, I have seen the Senate both at its best--rising to meet \nthe lofty expectations of the Framers--and, unfortunately, I have seen \nit at its worst.\n  Last year I came to the floor repeatedly to speak out against what I \nviewed as the abuse of the Senate by the previous majority, under which \nthis great body fell into great dysfunction. In addition to identifying \nthese abuses, I did my best to lay out a vision for how the Senate \nought to function--how we could best live up to the best traditions of \nour forebearers.\n  Over the past year, since my selection as President pro tempore, I \nhave endeavored to continue to offer what lessons I have learned and \nwhat accumulated knowledge I have acquired over my nearly four decades \nhere to help our new Republican majority to get the Senate working \nagain. After a year of hard work, I can report a significant degree of \nsuccess. Under the leadership of our new majority leader and his team, \nthe Senate is back to work for the American people.\n  By the end of last Congress, these best traditions of the Senate that \nhave allowed it to serve the Republic for so well for so long were \nleft, in my opinion, in severe disrepair. The then-majority leadership \ncurtailed debate on an unprecedented scale, moving to cut off debate \nbefore this body could even begin considering legislation. The leader \nalso used the so-called nuclear option to permanently weaken the \nopportunity to debate nominations, including crucial lifetime \nnominations to the Federal court. In all of last year, the Senate voted \non only 15 amendments, with the majority leadership refusing to \ncountenance any amendment it did not support. The 113th Congress set a \nrecord for bills that bypassed committees--this institution's \nincubators of consensus. Instead of adhering to the committee process, \nthe legislation was crafted in the back rooms of leadership offices and \nbrought directly to the floor.\n  Thanks to this institutional degradation, the Senate became a \nwasteland of partisan warfare. Much of the time spent in session was \nwasted on voting on the previous majority's messaging bills. This \nlegislation had no chance of passing the Senate and was designed simply \nto buttress the majority's election-year arguments. The time that was \nnot spent on this political gamesmanship was otherwise wasted largely \non rushing through President Obama's nominees at a breakneck pace.\n  Our new majority has thus faced the daunting task of restoring the \nSenate to its proper function so this body can resume its rightful role \nas the source of wise legislation. These efforts have produced some \nimpressive statistics.\n  This year, the Senate has held almost 200 votes on amendments of \nindividual Senators. That figure is nearly 9 times as many as last \nyear. Earlier this year, the Senate brought up more amendments in a \nsingle week than all of last year.\n  Debate has also flourished. The Senate spent over 25 percent more \ndays in session than last year. The majority leader has greatly \ncurtailed the practice of filing cloture as soon as debate begins, \nrestricting it to rare occasions that involve time-sensitive measures \nand, particularly, sensitive bipartisan legislation.\n  Furthermore, our committees are all back to work. With only a few \nexceptions, the legislation passed by the Senate has been crafted by \nthe committee rather than by leadership. The close, collaborative \nenvironment that the committees foster helps build bipartisan \nconsensus, even in these polarizing times. In fact, many of our \ncommittees posted impressive statistics of bipartisan legislating. The \nFinance Committee--the accomplishments of which I spoke on yesterday--\nhas passed 37 bills, all bipartisan. The Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee has passed 71 bills, all bipartisan. The \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee has passed 10 pieces \nof legislation, and all but one was bipartisan.\n\n[[Page S8841]]\n\n  According to the Resume of Congressional Activity, as of December 1, \nthe Senate had passed 391 measures as compared to 290 in 2014 and 246 \nin 2013. While this year's number compares favorably to the two \nprevious years, the Senate's productivity is best measured not by a \nsimple count of measures passed, in which a post office naming counts \nthe same as a comprehensive budget for the entire Federal Government, \nbut instead by the sort and substance of measures passed. This measure \npaints by far the best picture of the good work done by the Senate in \nthe first year of our new Republican Senate majority.\n  Instead of wasting the Senate's precious time on political show \nvotes, the new majority leadership has focused the Senate's \nconsideration on measures that can actually pass, which almost always \nrequire bipartisan support. We have also made sure to fulfill \nCongress's most basic fiscal management responsibilities. We passed the \nfirst bicameral budget since 2009 and the first budget that balances in \n14 years. Based on that budget blueprint, the Appropriations Committee \npassed all 12 appropriations bills for the first time since 2009. While \nthe minority unfortunately chose to block numerous attempts we made to \npass these bills on the floor through regular order, we struck a \nmultiyear bipartisan budget deal to last through the rest of the Obama \nadministration. Passing this legislation warded off the threat of \nanother shutdown or a disastrous default on our debt. We have also \nstruck a deal on an omnibus spending bill for next year that, while \nimperfect, makes important progress in a number of areas, such as \nrepealing the antiquated oil export ban to create jobs at home and ward \noff the influences of Vladimir Putin and other dangerous rogues abroad, \nincreasing resources for our military at a time of great threat, \nstrengthening the Visa Waiver Program to protect against terrorists, \nand provisions to bar the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to American \nsoil.\n  As we look forward to next year, our leadership has built a pathway \nto return to regular order in the appropriations process, allowing \nCongress to fulfill our constitutional duty to oversee the executive \nbranch through the power of the purse.\n  The Senate also overcame a bitter partisan dispute to pass the annual \nNational Defense Authorization Act to further our most basic \nresponsibility to provide for the common defense. Under the leadership \nof our Armed Services Committee, with colleagues on both sides, we \npassed into law a bill that contains a wide variety of critical defense \nitems, from acquisition reform to aid to Ukraine. Moreover, among the \nmost important accomplishments of the year have been the long-term \nchallenges tackled by the Senate. Over the past few years, Congress \nearned a well-deserved reputation for kicking the can down the road on \na number of key issues that affect Americans' lives in crucial ways--\nfrom our commutes to our health care to our children's education. This \nyear Congress has taken a number of crucial steps to end this cycle of \nirresponsible delays. Instead of passing yet another patch to the \nhighway trust fund, we passed the first long-term highway bill in a \ndecade; instead of leaving seniors in a lurch with yet another doc fix, \nwe permanently fixed how Medicare reimburses physicians and passed a \nreal down payment on real entitlement reform; instead of consigning \nourselves to a backseat role in shaping the international economy of \nthe future, we passed the first trade promotion authority legislation \nsince 2002; instead of waiting until the last minute to pass another \nextension of critical tax breaks, we have struck a deal to make much \nimportant tax relief permanent and provide multiyear extensions of \nothers, providing vital certainty to business and family budgets; and \ninstead of leaving our schools webbed in by No Child Left Behind and \nthe Obama administration's conditioned waivers, we passed the Every \nStudent Succeeds Act, which the Wall Street Journal called the greatest \ndevolution of power to the States in a quarter century.\n  Moreover, we pushed against the Obama administration's most egregious \noverreach, preparing the way to reverse them under a future President. \nWe passed Congressional Review Act resolutions to repeal the \nPresident's most onerous and job-killing labor and environmental \nregulations, and most importantly, we passed the Senate's first repeal \nof ObamaCare.\n  Finally, after the turmoil in the confirmation process in recent \nyears, we have moved at a deliberate pace in examining the President's \nnominees. Despite the spurious claims of some on the other side, our \nrecord on confirmations fits favorably within historical norms. As of \nDecember 10, 316 of President Obama's judicial nominees have been \nconfirmed, constituting more than 37 percent of the actual active \nFederal bench.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to finish my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  By comparison, only 292 of President George W. Bush's nominees had \nbeen confirmed at the same point in his tenure, constituting less than \n35 percent of the active judiciary. There are only 65 judicial \nvacancies today. Vacancies have been lower in only 13 of the 83 months, \nor less than 16 percent of the time, that this President has held \noffice. During 2015, the average number of judicial vacancies has been \n58, the lowest average for any year of the Obama Presidency.\n  This is a record of achievement that speaks for itself, one that \neasily shows why PoltiFact awarded the minority leader three Pinocchios \nfor his accusations that the Senate, under our new Republican majority, \nhas been unproductive by historical standards. While there have been, \nno doubt, many bumps in the road--and we still need more mutual \nrestraint of both the minority and the majority--there should be no \ndoubt that our new Republican majority has the Senate back to work for \nthe American people.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the extra time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8841-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8841-S8842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGETARY REVISIONS\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, on November 2, 2015, the President signed \nthe Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 into law, H.R. 1314, P.L. 114-74. \nThis bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 266 to 167 \nand the Senate by a vote of 64 to 35. Section 101 of H.R. 1314 \nredefined the term ``discretionary spending limit'' to add $50 billion \nin budget authority for fiscal year 2016. This increase was split \nevenly between defense and nondefense spending. More specifically it \nincreased the fiscal year 2016 discretionary spending limit for the \nrevised security category to $548.091 billion in new budget authority \nand the revised nonsecurity category to $518.491 billion in new budget \nauthority. Section 3404 of the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution \nprovides me with the authority to adjust levels and allocations for \nsuch changes in definitions in enacted legislation. I am therefore \nadjusting the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations and the \nbudgetary aggregates to reflect the spending limits of the Bipartisan \nBudget Act of 2015.\n  In addition to the changes triggered by P.L. 114-74, section 251 of \nthe Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, \nallows for various adjustments to the discretionary spending limits, \nwhile sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 \nallow the chairman of the Budget Committee to establish and make \nrevisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with those \nadjustments. The Senate will soon consider H.R. 2029, the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act, 2016. This bill includes numerous provisions that \nmeet the terms laid out in section 251 of BBEDCA to generate a change \nin the discretionary spending limits. As such, this spending is \neligible for an adjustment under the Congressional Budget Act.\n  Earlier this year I made adjustments to budgetary aggregates and the \nCommittee on Appropriations' allocation to reflect provisions in \nappropriations bills that qualified for cap adjustments under BBEDCA \nthat were being considered on the Senate floor. The adjustments I make \ntoday take these adjustments into consideration and reflect the \nappropriate level for adjustments for considering this Omnibus \nappropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S8842]]\n\n  Section 3102 of S. Con. Res. 11 provides a separate allocation to the \nCommittee on Appropriations for overseas contingency operations, OCO/\nglobal war on terrorism, GWOT, spending. Furthermore, the budget \nresolution provides the chairman of the Committee on the Budget the \nauthority to change levels, aggregates, and allocations related to OCO/\nGWOT based on new information. As such, I am making the appropriate \nadjustments to bring allocation levels in line with the amounts \nprovided in H.R. 2029.\n  As a result, I am increasing the budgetary aggregate for 2016 by \n$36,072 million in budget authority and reducing the aggregate for \noutlays by $997 million. I am increasing the fiscal year 2016 non-OCO/\nGWOT allocations to the Appropriations Committee by $25,000 million in \nbudget authority for defense, revised security category, $33,666 \nmillion in budget authority for non-defense, revised nonsecurity \ncategory, and $15,722 million in general purpose outlays. I am also \nreducing the OCO/GWOT allocation to the Committee on Appropriations by \n$22,594 million in budget authority and $16,719 million in outlays.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide \ndetails about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    REVISION TO BUDGETARY AGGREGATES\n  (Pursuant to Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and\nSection 3404 of S.

Madam President, I rise to speak on the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act of 2016, otherwise known as the omnibus bill.\n  I wish to report to my colleagues in the Senate that the House has \npassed the bill this morning with a robust vote of 316 to 113. Three \nmonths ago it was unclear if we would be at this positive point. We \nwere uncertain if we could get a budget deal that would lift the caps \nfor defense and nondefense spending, it was unclear if we could cancel \nsequester, and it was unclear if we could avoid a government shutdown.\n  I am happy to say today that we have completed our work, and we have \ndone it in the traditional style of this institution and also of the \nAppropriations Committee and by working on a bipartisan basis. The \nchairman of the committee, the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, \nand I worked across the aisle to get the job done. I thank him for the \nleadership he provided the committee, for his professionalism, and for \nthe ability and the fact that we could work, both he and I, together. I \nthank both of our staffs for working with civility and candor.\n  For the third year in a row, we left no appropriations bill behind. \nWe negotiated and we compromised. We compromised without capitulation \nof our principles, which has always been a strong tradition of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  As we bring this bill to the floor, I urge all of my colleagues to \nvote for this bill. I want to do it on the basis of content and on the \nbasis of merit.\n  Now, I will tell you what this bill does. First of all, it does a lot \nto protect the United States of America. We know that right now America \nfeels on edge. We know our leadership needs to provide clarity, \nconsistency, and specificity, but most of all, we need to provide the \nresources that our institutions need so they can protect our country.\n  This bill provides $606 billion for the national defense of the \nUnited States of America and to support, train, and equip our troops; \nto deal with the new threats of biosecurity and the rising efforts of \nISIL so we can follow through with our vow to defeat and destroy them.\n  We have a must-do list to make sure our troops have the best weapons \nand know that the troops and families are supported. We looked out for \ntheir health care and Tricare, and we looked out for the food that they \nneed to buy in their commissaries.\n  We know that protecting America is not only accomplished in the \nDefense Department. It also lies in the important agencies that do the \ntough work. We have adequately capitalized the State Department and \nprovided money for embassy security so we can protect our embassies and \nthose who work with them abroad. We have also funded Homeland Security. \nWe have approved close to $11 billion so that the Coast Guard can \nprotect our ports and waterways, and we have added $50 million in new \ngrants to counter violent extremism. We also made sure that we have \ngiven TSA, or the Transportation Security Administration, the equipment \nand people it needs to protect travelers with all of the airport \nscreeners that have been requested. At the same time, we have funded \nthe FBI, which is doing such an able job of rooting out the terrorists, \nincluding the lone wolf threats that are emerging in our own country.\n  I want to particularly do a shout-out to the FBI in the Baltimore \ndistrict for uncovering a plot in our own home State of Maryland where \nsomeone was organizing and planning a lone wolf effort.\n  I also wish to thank my colleagues for what we did in the budget \ndeal. This bill provides $65 billion more to meet our national security \nneeds, support compelling human needs, and promote the middle class. We \nmade sure we kept our promises to our veterans. We have a $1.3 billion \nincrease for veterans health care to meet their health\n\n[[Page S8843]]\n\nneeds, the educational needs we promised them, and to deal with this \nbacklog of disability benefits.\n  We are not only looking to the past, we are looking to the future. We \nhave made robust funds available in our innovation area, whether it was \nthe Department of Energy or the National Institutes of Health, which is \nin my home State. On our committee and across the aisle--Senator Patty \nMurray, the ranking member, and Senator Roy Blunt, the chairman of the \nHHS committee--we renamed the National Institutes of Health the \n``National Institutes of Hope'' because of what it does to find the \ncures and the breakthroughs for Alzheimer's, on which we have almost \ndoubled the research in order to break the code on how we can find a \ncure or a cognitive stretch-out. We have added $2 billion because we \nworked together, because we know that when we want to find the cure for \ncancer, Alzheimer's, autism, we need to be able to do that.\n\n  We looked also at working out other compelling needs, such as Head \nStart, child care and development grants in which we have added more \nmoney, and we make the first payment to fund the programs for \nelementary, middle, and high school.\n  We also meet the physical infrastructure needs, where we have \nincreased our funding in the T-HUD bill for Transit New Starts to $2.2 \nbillion.\n  We increased the funding for the HOME Program. Instead of cutting it \nby 90 percent, we increased it by $50 million, to $950 million.\n  We have also looked out for our ports, creating jobs by keeping goods \nmoving through the full funding of the harbor maintenance trust fund \nand the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  This is about jobs. This isn't about money; this is about jobs. In my \nown home State of Maryland, the Port of Baltimore is an incubator for \njobs. It keeps people going, whether it is the people who work to bring \nthe ships in, whether it is the longshoremen, the tugboat operators, or \nthose who benefit from the goods and services coming into our port or \nleaving our port. It is the ports that create our jobs, and we in \nMaryland are ready for the new ships coming through the newly built \nPanama Canal. We know this is a big deal that could help our \ncommunities all over America if we invest in our ports.\n  I know many of our colleagues also want to know about riders. We \nfaced hundreds of policy riders, some of which were highly \ncontroversial. We did the best we could with them. But while everybody \ntalks about one item or this item, I want to talk about some of the \nones we were able to deal with.\n  We prevented double-trailer trucks from taking over our highways. We \nprotected women's health against devastating riders. We also made sure \nthose who regulate our financial institutions so that we never have \nanother meltdown like we had 8 years ago are taken care of, and we \nlooked out for the environment.\n  The appropriations bills are good bills, and I could go over more \nitems, but I see that the chairman of the committee is on the floor. I \nagain reiterate my appreciation to Senator Cochran and his very able \nstaff.\n  I also want to comment about the other side of the dome. Working with \nCongressman Hal Rogers, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nand Ranking Member Nita Lowey has indeed been a very professional \nrelationship. I wish that now, with new leadership in the House, they \ncould function like the Appropriations Committee. Do we disagree? Yes. \nThe Presiding Officer is a member of that committee, and she knows we \nare ready to duke it out when we have to. But we put it all out on the \ntable. We discuss it. We debate it.\n  We had an open process with amendments in our committee. We have \nworked to resolve conflict by actually meeting and discussing with each \nother. We need the same thing with our colleagues on the other side of \nthe dome. That is what we mean when we say we want to get back to \nregular order.\n  Thanks to the budget deal we have now, I do hope that next year we \ncan bring bills up one at a time for debate, discussion, and amendment. \nI hope we can do that. But I also hope the tone of the Appropriations \nCommittee is adopted. We can make sure we advocate for our States and \nfor our viewpoints, but we can do it in a way that it gets done.\n  I want to conclude by thanking my entire staff, Chuck Kieffer and \nJean Toal Eisen, the staff on the other side of the dome, and all of \nthose who worked for me. I want to recognize Shannon Kula and Rachel \nMacKnight, as well as Brigid Houton and Mara Stark Alcala and Jean \nKwon.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I am pleased to recommend approval of \nthe Omnibus appropriations and tax relief bill that will soon be \nconsidered by the Senate. This bill is consistent with the Budget Act \nthat was enacted in November. It funds the operations of the Federal \nGovernment for the remainder of this fiscal year. It provides funding \nfor the Department of Defense and the State Department, along with the \nFBI, Customs and Border Protection, and U.S. immigration enforcement \nprovisions. It provides a $2 billion increase for the National \nInstitutes of Health. It also funds improvements to our Nation's water \nand surface transportation infrastructure.\n  I deeply appreciate the good work and active leadership of our \ncommittee's vice chairwoman, the distinguished Senator from Maryland. \nShe has been a pleasure to work with. She has been very helpful in \nproducing this bill.\n  I also thank the very able staff members of the committee who have \nbeen very diligent and professional throughout this process. They are a \ncredit to the Senate.\n  Madam President, I urge approval of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8843-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 145\n\n  Mr. FLAKE.

Madam President, reserving the right to object, the bill \nSenator Flake is referring to, S. 145--a bill I support--is part of a \npackage of 11 bills that have been approved by the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee known as the lands bills. By the way, of the 11 \nbills, 7 of the principal sponsors are Republican and 4 are Democrats. \nS. 403 by Senator Klobuchar is on that list, which includes the North \nCountry National Scenic Trail; S. 521 that I introduced concerning the \nPresident's Station in Baltimore; S. 593 by Senator Barrasso that \nincludes the Bureau of Reclamation report on their infrastructure \nassets; S. 610 that I introduced dealing with P.S. 103, which is \nThurgood Marshall Elementary School; S. 873 by the chair, Senator \nMurkowski, to designate wilderness within the Lake Clark National Park \nand Preserve; two bills, S. 1103 and S. 1104, by Senator Daines \nextending deadlines; S. 1240 by Senator Heinrich designating the Cerro \ndel Yuta and Rio San Antonio wilderness areas in New Mexico; S. 1305 by \nSenator Barrasso concerning the Colorado River Storage Project Act; \nand, lastly, S. 1483 by Senator Alexander that would direct a \nfeasibility study for designating the James K. Polk Home in Columbia, \nTN, as a unit of the National Park System.\n  So therefore I ask unanimous consent that the request by Senator \nFlake be modified so that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of the following calendar items en bloc: Calendar No. \n204, S. 145; Calendar No. 205, S. 403; Calendar No. 206, S. 521; \nCalendar No. 208, S. 593; Calendar No. 209, S. 610; Calendar No. 211, \nS. 873; Calendar No. 212, S. 1103; Calendar No. 213, S. 1104; Calendar \nNo. 214, S. 1240; Calendar No. 215, S. 1305; and Calendar No. 216, S. \n1483; that the applicable committee-reported amendments be agreed to, \nthe bills, as amended, if amended,\n\n[[Page S8844]]\n\nbe read a third time and passed, and the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  That would be the list I just mentioned, the lands bills that have \nbeen reported out unanimously by the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. FLAKE. I have no objection to the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, reserving the right to object, as the \nranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee is well aware, in July \nI told Secretary Kerry in a written letter that if the administration \nsent to the United Nations this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal \nbefore submitting it to the U.S. Congress, that the consequence would \nbe that each and every political appointee to the State Department \nwould be held. Secretary Kerry nonetheless decided to disregard the \ncontents of that letter, submitted it to the United Nations in \nderogation of U.S. sovereignty, and accordingly, I have been blocking \nthose political nominees.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Will the Senator yield for one moment?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Yes.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I think this request deals with the lands bills, not the \npolitical appointments. I just wanted to point that out. These are the \nbills that came out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee that \ndeal with designating certain lands. We will have a chance later on the \nnominations.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Well, reserving the right to object to that one, I would \nsimply say we were going to do both. I thought you were doing the first \none, but you are doing the other.\n  On that as well, in my view, there is far too much Federal land in \nthe United States that is under the control of the Federal Government. \nI was just yesterday in the State of Nevada, where some 84 percent of \nthe State of Nevada is controlled by the Federal Government. We do not \nneed the Federal Government becoming the largest landlord in the United \nStates. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. FLAKE. Yes, I so modify.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection was heard to the modification.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. CARDIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to concur in the House amendments to the Senate \namendment to H.R. 2029.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Joint \nExplanatory Statement for Division M--Intelligence Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2016 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nJOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT TO ACCOMPANY THE INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION \n                        ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016\n\n       The following consists of the joint explanatory statement \n     to accompany the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2016.\n       This joint explanatory statement reflects the status of \n     negotiations and disposition of issues reached between the \n     House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the \n     Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (hereinafter, ``the \n     Agreement''). The joint explanatory statement shall have the \n     same effect with respect to the implementation of this Act as \n     if it were a joint explanatory statement of a committee of \n     conference.\n       The joint explanatory statement comprises three parts: an \n     overview of the application of the annex to accompany this \n     statement; unclassified congressional direction; and a \n     section-by-section analysis of the legislative text.\n\n              Part I: Application of the Classified Annex\n\n       The classified nature of U.S. intelligence activities \n     prevents the congressional intelligence committees from \n     publicly disclosing many details concerning the conclusions \n     and recommendations of the Agreement. Therefore, a classified \n     Schedule of Authorizations and a classified annex have been \n     prepared to describe in detail the scope and intent of the \n     congressional intelligence committees' actions. The Agreement \n     authorizes the Intelligence Community to obligate and expend \n     funds not altered or modified by the classified Schedule of \n     Authorizations as requested in the President's budget, \n     subject to modification under applicable reprogramming \n     procedures.\n       The classified annex is the result of negotiations between \n     the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the \n     Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. It reconciles the \n     differences between the committees' respective versions of \n     the bill for the National Intelligence Program (NIP) and the \n     Homeland Security Intelligence Program for Fiscal Year 2016. \n     The Agreement also makes recommendations for the Military \n     Intelligence Program (MIP), and the Information Systems \n     Security Program, consistent with the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, and provides certain \n     direction for these two programs.\n       The Agreement supersedes the classified annexes to the \n     reports accompanying H.R. 4127, as passed by the House on \n     December 1, 2015, H.R. 2596, as passed by the House on June \n     16, 2015, and S. 1705, as reported by the Senate Select \n     Committee on Intelligence on July 7, 2015. All references to \n     the House-passed and Senate-reported annexes are solely to \n     identify the heritage of specific provisions.\n       The classified Schedule of Authorizations is incorporated \n     into the bill pursuant to Section 102. It has the status of \n     law. The classified annex supplements and adds detail to \n     clarify the authorization levels found in the bill and the \n     classified Schedule of Authorizations. The classified annex \n     shall have the same legal force as the report to accompany \n     the bill.\n\n          Part II: Select Unclassified Congressional Direction\n\n     Enhancing Geographic and Demographic Diversity\n       The Agreement directs the Office of the Director for \n     National Intelligence (ODNI) to conduct an awareness, \n     outreach, and recruitment program to rural, under-represented \n     colleges and universities that are not part of the IC Centers \n     of Academic Excellence (IC CAE) program. Further, the \n     Agreement directs that ODNI shall increase and formally track \n     the number of competitive candidates for IC employment or \n     internships who studied at IC CAE schools and other \n     scholarship programs supported by the IC.\n       Additionally, the Agreement directs that ODNI, acting \n     through the Executive Agent for the IC CAE program, the IC \n     Chief Human Capital Officer, and the Chief, Office of IC \n     Equal Opportunity & Diversity, as appropriate, shall:\n       1. Add a criterion to the IC CAE selection process that \n     applicants must be part of a consortium or actively \n     collaborate with under-resourced schools in their area;\n       2. Work with CAE schools to reach out to rural and under-\n     resourced schools, including by inviting such schools to \n     participate in the annual IC CAE colloquium and IC \n     recruitment events;\n       3. Increase and formally track the number of competitive IC \n     internship candidates from IC CAE schools, starting with \n     Fiscal Year 2016 IC summer internships, and provide a report, \n     within 180 days of the enactment of this Act, on its plan to \n     do so;\n       4. Develop metrics to ascertain whether IC CAE, the Pat \n     Roberts Intelligence Scholars Program, the Louis Stokes \n     Educational Scholarship Program, and the Intelligence Officer \n     Training Program reach a diverse demographic and serve as \n     feeders to the IC workforce;\n       5. Include in the annual report on minority hiring and \n     retention a breakdown of the students participating in these \n     programs who serve as IC interns, applied for full-time IC \n     employment, received offers of employment, and entered on \n     duty in the IC;\n       6. Conduct a feasibility study with necessary funding \n     levels regarding how the IC CAE could be better tailored to \n     serve under-resourced schools, and provide such study to the \n     congressional intelligence committees within 180 days of the \n     enactment of this Act;\n       7. Publicize all IC elements' recruitment activities, \n     including the new Applicant Gateway and the IC Virtual Career \n     Fair, to rural schools, Historically Black Colleges and \n     Universities, and other minority-serving institutions that \n     have been contacted by IC recruiters;\n       8. Contact new groups with the objective of expanding the \n     IC Heritage Community Liaison Council; and\n       9. Ensure that IC elements add such activities listed above \n     that may be appropriate to their recruitment plans for Fiscal \n     Year 2016.\n       ODNI shall provide an interim update to the congressional \n     intelligence committees on its efforts within 90 days of the \n     enactment of this Act and include final results in its annual \n     report on minority hiring and retention.\n\n[[Page S8845]]\n\n  \n\n     Analytic Duplication & Improving Customer Impact\n       The congressional intelligence committees are concerned \n     about potential duplication in finished analytic products. \n     Specifically, the congressional intelligence committees are \n     concerned that contemporaneous publication of substantially \n     similar intelligence products fosters confusion among \n     intelligence customers (including those in Congress), impedes \n     analytic coherence across the IC, and wastes time and effort. \n     The congressional intelligence committees value competitive \n     analysis, but believe there is room to reduce duplicative \n     analytic activity and improve customer impact.\n       Therefore, the Agreement directs ODNI to pilot a repeatable \n     methodology to evaluate potential duplication in finished \n     intelligence analytic products and to report the findings to \n     the congressional intelligence committees within 60 days of \n     the enactment of this Act. In addition, the Agreement directs \n     ODNI to report to the congressional intelligence committees \n     within 180 days of enactment of this Act on how it will \n     revise analytic practice, tradecraft, and standards to ensure \n     customers can clearly identify how products that are produced \n     contemporaneously and cover similar topics differ from one \n     another in their methodological, informational, or temporal \n     aspects, and the significance of those differences. This \n     report is not intended to cover operationally urgent analysis \n     or current intelligence.\n     Countering Violent Extremism and the Islamic State of Iraq \n         and the Levant\n       The Agreement directs ODNI, within 180 days of enactment of \n     this Act and in consultation with appropriate interagency \n     partners, to brief the congressional intelligence committees \n     on how intelligence agencies are supporting both (1) the \n     Administration's Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) program \n     first detailed in the 2011 White House strategy Empowering \n     Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United \n     States, which was expanded following the January 2015 White \n     House Summit on Countering Violent Extremism, and (2) the \n     Administration's Strategy to Counter the Islamic State of \n     Iraq and the Levant, which was announced in September 2014.\n     Analytic Health Reports\n       The Agreement directs the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) \n     to provide Analytic Health Reports to the congressional \n     intelligence committees on a quarterly basis, including an \n     update on the specific effect of analytic modernization on \n     the health of the Defense Intelligence Analysis Program \n     (DIAP) and its ability to reduce analytic risk.\n     All-Source Analysis Standards\n       The Agreement directs DIA to conduct a comprehensive \n     evaluation of the Defense Intelligence Enterprise's all-\n     source analysis capability and production in Fiscal Year \n     2015. The evaluation should assess the analytic output of \n     both NIP and MW funded all-source analysts, separately and \n     collectively, and apply the following four criteria \n     identified in the ODNI Strategic Evaluation Report for all-\n     source analysis: 1) integrated, 2) objective, 3) timely, and \n     4) value-added. The results of this evaluation shall be \n     included as part of the Fiscal Year 2017 congressional budget \n     justification book.\n     Terrorism Investigations\n       The Agreement directs the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     (FBI) to submit to the congressional intelligence committees, \n     within 180 days of enactment of this Act, a report detailing \n     how FBI has allocated resources between domestic and foreign \n     terrorist threats based on numbers of investigations over the \n     past 5 years. The report should be submitted in unclassified \n     form but may include a classified annex.\n     Investigations of Minors Involved in Radicalization\n       The Agreement directs the FBI to provide a briefing to the \n     congressional intelligence committees within 180 days of \n     enactment of this Act on investigations in which minors are \n     encouraged to turn away from violent extremism rather than \n     take actions that would lead to Federal terrorism \n     indictments. This briefing should place these rates in the \n     context of all investigations of minors for violent extremist \n     activity and should describe any FBI engagement with minors' \n     families, law enforcement, or other individuals or groups \n     connected to the minor during or after investigations.\n       Furthermore, the Agreement directs the FBI to include how \n     often undercover agents pursue investigations based on a \n     location of interest related to violent extremist activity \n     compared to investigations of an individual or group believed \n     to be engaged in such activity. Included should be the number \n     of locations of interest associated with a religious group or \n     entity. This briefing also should include trend analysis \n     covering the last five years describing violent extremist \n     activity in the U.S.\n     Declassification Review of Video of the 2012 Benghazi \n         Terrorist Attacks\n       Numerous investigations have been conducted regarding the \n     2012 terrorist attack against U.S. facilities in Benghazi. \n     The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence produced one of \n     the first declassified Congressional reports and continues to \n     believe that the public should have access to information \n     about the attacks, so long as it does not jeopardize \n     intelligence sources and methods.\n       The closed circuit television videos from the Temporary \n     Mission Facility (TMF) captured some of the activity that \n     took place at the State Department facility on September 11, \n     2012, and their release would contribute to the public's \n     understanding of the event without compromising sources or \n     methods.\n       Therefore, the Agreement directs the Director of National \n     Intelligence, or the appropriate federal official, to conduct \n     a declassification review and to facilitate the release to \n     the public of the declassified closed circuit television \n     videos of the September 11, 2012, terrorist attack on the TMF \n     in Benghazi, Libya, consistent with the protection of sources \n     and methods, not later than 120 days after the enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n Part III: Section-by-Section Analysis and Explanation of Legislative \n                                  Text\n\n       The following is a section-by-section analysis and \n     explanation of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2016.\n\n                    Title I--Intelligence Activities\n\n     Section 101. Authorization of appropriations\n       Section 101 lists the United States Government departments, \n     agencies, and other elements for which the Act authorizes \n     appropriations for intelligence and intelligence-related \n     activities for Fiscal Year 2016.\n     Section 102. Classified Schedule of Authorizations\n       Section 102 provides that the details of the amounts \n     authorized to be appropriated for intelligence and \n     intelligence-related activities and the applicable personnel \n     levels by program for Fiscal Year 2016 are contained in the \n     classified Schedule of Authorizations and that the classified \n     Schedule of Authorizations shall be made available to the \n     Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives and to the President.\n     Section 103. Personnel ceiling adjustments\n       Section 103 is intended to provide additional flexibility \n     to the Director of National Intelligence in managing the \n     civilian personnel of the Intelligence Community. Section 103 \n     provides that the Director may authorize employment of \n     civilian personnel in Fiscal Year 2016 in excess of the \n     number of authorized positions by an amount not exceeding \n     three percent of the total limit applicable to each \n     Intelligence Community element under Section 102. The \n     Director may do so only if necessary to the performance of \n     important intelligence functions.\n     Section 104. Intelligence Community Management Account\n       Section 104 authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence \n     Community Management Account (ICMA) of the Director of \n     National Intelligence and sets the authorized personnel \n     levels for the elements within the ICMA for Fiscal Year 2016.\n     Section 105. Clarification regarding authority for flexible \n         personnel management among elements of intelligence \n         community\n       Section 105 clarifies that certain Intelligence Community \n     elements may make hiring decisions based on the excepted \n     service designation.\n\n Title II--Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System\n\n     Section 201. Authorization of appropriations\n       Section 201 authorizes appropriations in the amount of \n     $514,000,000 for Fiscal Year 2016 for the Central \n     Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund.\n\n                     Title III--General Provisions\n\n     Section 301. Increase in employee compensation and benefits \n         authorized by law\n       Section 301 provides that funds authorized to be \n     appropriated by the Act for salary, pay, retirement, and \n     other benefits for federal employees may be increased by such \n     additional or supplemental amounts as may be necessary for \n     increases in compensation or benefits authorized by law.\n     Section 302. Restriction on conduct of intelligence \n         activities\n       Section 302 provides that the authorization of \n     appropriations by the Act shall not be deemed to constitute \n     authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity that \n     is not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of \n     the United States.\n     Section 303. Provision of information and assistance to \n         Inspector General of the Intelligence Community\n       Section 303 amends the National Security Act of 1947 to \n     clarify the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community's \n     authority to seek information and assistance from federal, \n     state, and local agencies, or units thereof.\n     Section 304. Inclusion of Inspector General of Intelligence \n         Community in Council of Inspectors General on Integrity \n         and Efficiency\n       Section 304 amends Section 11(b)(1)(B) of the Inspector \n     General Act of 1978 to reflect the correct name of the Office \n     of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community. The \n     section also clarifies that the Inspector General of the \n     Intelligence Community is a member of the Council of the \n     Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency.\n     Section 305.

This proposal would have no \n     substantive effect.\n     Section 403. Analytic Objectivity Review\n       The Office of the Director of National Intelligence's \n     Analytic Integrity and Standards (AIS) office was established \n     in response to the requirement in the Intelligence Reform and \n     Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA) for the designation \n     of an entity responsible for ensuring that the Intelligence \n     Community's finished intelligence products are timely, \n     objective, independent of political considerations, based \n     upon all sources of available intelligence, and demonstrative \n     of the standards of proper analytic tradecraft.\n       Consistent with responsibilities prescribed under IRTPA, \n     Section 403 requires the AIS Chief to conduct a review of \n     finished intelligence products produced by the CIA to assess \n     whether the reorganization of the Agency, announced publicly \n     on March 6, 2015, has resulted in any loss of analytic \n     objectivity. The report is due no later than March 6, 2017.\n\n\n       Subtitle B--Central Intelligence Agency and Other Elements\n\n     Section 411.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Joint \nExplanatory Statement for Division N--Cybersecurity Act of 2015 be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT TO ACCOMPANY THE CYBERSECURITY ACT OF 2015\n\n       The following consists of the joint explanatory statement \n     to accompany the Cybersecurity Act of 2015.\n       This joint explanatory statement reflects the status of \n     negotiations and disposition of issues reached between the \n     Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the House Permanent \n     Select Committee on Intelligence, the Senate Committee on \n     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and the House \n     Committee on Homeland Security. The joint explanatory \n     statement shall have the same effect with respect to the \n     implementation of this Act as if it were a joint explanatory \n     statement of a committee of conference.\n       The joint explanatory statement comprises an overview of \n     the bill's background and objectives, and a section-by-\n     section analysis of the legislative text.\n\n              Part I: Background and Need for Legislation\n\n       Cybersecurity threats continue to affect our nation's \n     security and its economy, as losses to consumers, businesses, \n     and the government from cyber attacks, penetrations, and \n     disruptions total billions of dollars. This legislation is \n     designed to create a voluntary cybersecurity information \n     sharing process that will encourage public and private sector \n     entities to share cyber threat information, without legal \n     barriers and the threat of unfounded litigation--while \n     protecting private information. This in turn should foster \n     greater cooperation and collaboration in the face of growing \n     cybersecurity threats to national and economic security.\n       This legislation also includes provisions to improve \n     Federal network and information system security, provide \n     assessments on the Federal cybersecurity workforce, and \n     provide reporting and strategies on cybersecurity industry-\n     related and criminal-related matters. The increased \n     information sharing enabled by this bill is a critical step \n     toward improving cybersecurity in America.\n\n  Part II: Section-by-Section Analysis and Explanation of Legislative \n                                  Text\n\n       The following is a section-by-section analysis and \n     explanation of the Cybersecurity Act of 2015.\n\n               Title I--Cybersecurity Information Sharing\n\n     Section 101. Short title.\n       Section 101 states that Title I may be cited as the \n     ``Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015.''\n     Section 102. Definitions.\n       Section 102 defines for purposes of this title key terms \n     such as ``cybersecurity purpose,'' ``cybersecurity threat,'' \n     ``cyber threat indicator,'' ``defensive measure,'' and \n     ``monitor.'' The definition of ``cybersecurity purpose'' is \n     meant to include a broad range of\n\n[[Page S8848]]\n\n     activities taken to protect information and information \n     systems from cybersecurity threats. The authorizations under \n     this Act are tied to conduct undertaken for a ``cybersecurity \n     purpose,'' which both clarifies their scope and ensures that \n     the authorizations cover activities that can be performed in \n     conjunction with one another. For instance, a private entity \n     conducting monitoring activities to determine whether it \n     should use an authorized ``defensive measure'' would be \n     monitoring for a ``cybersecurity purpose.'' Significantly, \n     the authorization for ``defensive measures'' does not include \n     activities that are generally considered ``offensive'' in \n     nature, such as unauthorized access of, or execution of \n     computer code on, another entity's information systems, such \n     as ``hacking back'' activities, or any actions that would \n     substantially harm another private entity's information \n     systems, such as violations of section 1030, of title 18, \n     United States Code.\n     Section 103. Sharing of information by the Federal \n         Government.\n       Section 103 requires the Director of National Intelligence, \n     the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Defense, \n     and the Attorney General to jointly develop and issue \n     procedures for the timely sharing of classified and \n     unclassified cyber threat indicators and defensive measures \n     (hereinafter referenced collectively in this joint \n     explanatory statement as, ``cyber threat information'') with \n     relevant entities.\n       These procedures must also ensure the Federal Government \n     maintains: a real-time sharing capability; a process for \n     notifying entities that have received cyber threat \n     information in error; protections against unauthorized \n     access; and procedures to review and remove, prior to sharing \n     cyber threat information, any information not directly \n     related to a cybersecurity threat known at the time of \n     sharing to be personal information of a specific individual \n     or that identifies a specific individual, or to implement a \n     technical capability to do the same. These procedures must be \n     developed in consultation with appropriate Federal entities, \n     including the Small Business Administration and the National \n     Laboratories.\n     Section 104. Authorizations for preventing, detecting, \n         analyzing, and mitigating cybersecurity threats.\n       Section 104 authorizes private entities to monitor their \n     information systems, operate defensive measures, and share \n     and receive cyber threat information. Private entities must, \n     prior to sharing cyber threat information, review and remove \n     any information not directly related to a cybersecurity \n     threat known at the time of sharing to be personal \n     information of a specific individual or that identifies a \n     specific individual, or to implement and utilize a technical \n     capability to do the same.\n       Section 104 permits non-Federal entities to use cyber \n     threat information for cybersecurity purposes, to monitor, or \n     to operate defensive measures on their information systems or \n     on those of another entity (upon written consent). Cyber \n     threat information shared by an entity with a State, tribal, \n     or local department or agency may be used for the purpose of \n     preventing, investigating, or prosecuting any of the offenses \n     described in Section 105, below. Cyber threat information is \n     exempt from disclosure under any State, tribal, local, or \n     freedom of information or similar law.\n       Section 104 further provides that two or more private \n     entities are not in violation of antitrust laws for \n     exchanging or providing cyber threat information, or for \n     assisting with the prevention, investigation, or mitigation \n     of a cybersecurity threat.\n     Section 105. Sharing of cyber threat indicators and defensive \n         measures with the Federal Government.\n       Section 105 directs the Attorney General and Secretary of \n     Homeland Security to jointly develop policies and procedures \n     to govern how the Federal Government shares information about \n     cyber threats, including via an automated real-time process \n     that allows for information systems to exchange identified \n     cyber threat information without manual efforts, subject to \n     limited exceptions that must be agreed upon in advance. \n     Section 105 also directs the Attorney General and Secretary \n     of Homeland Security, in coordination with heads of \n     appropriate Federal entities and in consultation with certain \n     privacy officials and relevant private entities, to jointly \n     issue and make publicly available final privacy and civil \n     liberties guidelines for Federal entity-based cyber \n     information sharing.\n       Section 105 directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, in \n     coordination with heads of appropriate Federal entities, to \n     develop, implement, and certify the capability and process \n     through which the Federal Government receives cyber threat \n     information shared by a non-Federal entity with the Federal \n     Government. This section also provides the President with the \n     authority to designate an appropriate Federal entity, other \n     than the Department of Defense (including the National \n     Security Agency), to develop and implement an additional \n     capability and process following a certification and \n     explanation to Congress, as described in this section. The \n     capability and process at the Department of Homeland \n     Security, or at any additional appropriate Federal entity \n     designated by the President, does not prohibit otherwise \n     lawful disclosures of information related to criminal \n     activities, Federal investigations, or statutorily or \n     contractually required disclosures. However, this section \n     does not preclude the Department of Defense, including the \n     National Security Agency from assisting in the development \n     and implementation of a capability and process established \n     consistent with this title. It also shall not be read to \n     preclude any department or agency from requesting technical \n     assistance or staffing a request for technical assistance.\n       Section 105 further provides that cyber threat information \n     shared with the Federal Government does not waive any \n     privilege or protection, may be deemed proprietary \n     information by the originating entity, and is exempt from \n     certain disclosure laws. Cyber threat information may be used \n     by the Federal government for: cybersecurity purposes; \n     identifying a cybersecurity threat or vulnerability; \n     responding to, preventing, or mitigating a specific threat of \n     death, a specific threat of serious bodily harm, or a \n     specific threat of serious economic harm, including a \n     terrorist act or a use of a weapon of mass destruction; \n     responding to, investigating, prosecuting, preventing, or \n     mitigating a serious threat to a minor; or preventing, \n     investigating, disrupting, or prosecuting an offense \n     arising out of certain cyber-related criminal activities.\n       Finally, Section 105 provides that cyber threat information \n     shared with the Federal Government shall not be used by any \n     Federal, State, tribal, or local government to regulate non-\n     Federal entities' lawful activities.\n     Section 106. Protection from liability.\n       Section 106 provides liability protection for private \n     entities that monitor, share, or receive cyber threat \n     information in accordance with Title I, notwithstanding any \n     other provision of Federal, State, local, or tribal law. \n     Section 106 further clarifies that nothing in Title I creates \n     a duty to share cyber threat information or a duty to warn or \n     act based on receiving cyber threat information. At the same \n     time, nothing in Title I broadens, narrows, or otherwise \n     affects any existing duties that might be imposed by other \n     law; Title I also does not limit any common law or statutory \n     defenses.\n     Section 107. Oversight of Government activities.\n       Section 107 requires reports and recommendations on \n     implementation, compliance, and privacy assessments by agency \n     heads, Inspectors General, and the Comptroller General of the \n     United States, to ensure that cyber threat information is \n     properly received, handled, and shared by the Federal \n     Government.\n     Section 108. Construction and preemption.\n       Section 108 contains Title I construction provisions \n     regarding lawful disclosures; whistleblower protections; \n     protection of sources and methods; relationship to other \n     laws; prohibited conduct, such as anti-competitive \n     activities; information sharing relationships; preservation \n     of contractual rights and obligations; anti-tasking \n     restrictions, including conditions on cyber threat \n     information sharing; information use and retention; Federal \n     preemption of State laws that restrict or regulate Title I \n     activities, excluding those concerning the use of authorized \n     law enforcement practices and procedures; regulatory \n     authorities; the Secretary of Defense's authorities to \n     conduct certain cyber operations; and Constitutional \n     protections in criminal prosecutions.\n     Section 109. Report on cybersecurity threats.\n       Section 109 requires the Director of National Intelligence, \n     with the heads of other appropriate Intelligence Community \n     elements, to submit a report to the congressional \n     intelligence committees on cybersecurity threats, including \n     cyber attacks, theft, and data breaches.\n     Section 110. Exception to limitation on authority of \n         Secretary of Deftnse to disseminate certain information.\n       Section 110 clarifies that, notwithstanding Section \n     393(c)(3) of title 10, United States Code, the Secretary of \n     Defense may authorize the sharing of cyber threat indicators \n     and defensive measures pursuant to the policies, procedures, \n     and guidelines developed or issued under this title.\n     Section 111. Effective period.\n       Section 111 establishes Title I and the amendments therein \n     are effective during the period beginning on the date of \n     enactment of this Act and ending on September 30, 2025. The \n     provisions of Title I will remain in effect however, for \n     action authorized by Title I or information obtained pursuant \n     to action authorized by Title I, prior to September 30, 2025.\n\n              Title II--National Cybersecurity Advancement\n\n\n   SUBTITLE A--NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY AND COMMUNICATIONS INTEGRATION \n                                 CENTER\n\n     Section 201.

Definitions.\n       Section 202 defines for purposes of Title II, Subtitle A, \n     the terms ``appropriate congressional committees,'' \n     ``cybersecurity risk,'' ``incident,'' ``cyber threat \n     indicator,'' ``defensive measure,'' ``Department,'' and \n     ``Secretary.''\n     Section 203. Information sharing structure and processes.\n       Section 203 enhances the functions of the Department of \n     Homeland Security's National Cybersecurity and Communications\n\n[[Page S8849]]\n\n     Integration Center, established in section 227 of the \n     Homeland Security Act of 2002 (redesignated by this Act). It \n     designates the Center as a Federal civilian interface for \n     multi-directional and cross-sector information sharing \n     related to cybersecurity risks, incidents, analysis and \n     warnings for Federal and non-Federal entities, including the \n     implementation of Title I of this Act. This section requires \n     the Center to engage with international partners; conduct \n     information sharing with Federal and non-Federal entities; \n     participate in national exercises; and assess and evaluate \n     consequence, vulnerability and threat information regarding \n     cyber incidents to public safety communications. \n     Additionally, this section requires the Center to collaborate \n     with state and local governments on cybersecurity risks and \n     incidents. The Center will comply with all policies, \n     regulations, and laws that protect the privacy and civil \n     liberties of United States persons, including by working with \n     the Privacy Officer to ensure the Center follows the privacy \n     policies and procedures established by title I of this Act.\n       Section 203 requires the Department of Homeland Security, \n     in coordination with industry and other stakeholders, to \n     develop an automated capability for the timely sharing of \n     cyber threat indicators and defensive measures. It is \n     critical for the Department to develop an automated system \n     and supporting processes for the Center to disseminate cyber \n     threat indicators and defensive measures in a timely manner.\n       This section permits the Center to enter into voluntary \n     information sharing relationships with any consenting non-\n     Federal entity for the sharing of cyber threat indicators, \n     defensive measures, and information for cybersecurity \n     purposes. This section is intended to provide the Department \n     of Homeland Security additional options to enter into \n     streamlined voluntary information sharing agreements. This \n     section allows the Center to utilize standard and negotiated \n     agreements as the types of agreements that non-Federal \n     entities may enter into with the Center. However, it makes \n     clear that agreements are not limited to just these types, \n     and preexisting agreements between the Center and the non-\n     Federal entity will be in compliance with this section.\n       Section 203 requires the Director of the Center to report \n     directly to the Secretary for significant cybersecurity risks \n     and incidents. This section requires the Secretary to submit \n     to Congress a report on the range of efforts underway to \n     bolster cybersecurity collaboration with international \n     partners. Section 203 allows the Secretary to develop and \n     adhere to Department policies and procedures for coordinating \n     vulnerability disclosures.\n     Section 204. Information sharing and analysis organizations.\n       Section 204 amends Section 212 of the Homeland Security Act \n     to clarify the functions of Information Sharing and Analysis \n     Organizations (ISAOs) to include cybersecurity risk and \n     incident information beyond that pertaining to critical \n     infrastructure. ISAOs, including Information Sharing and \n     Analysis Centers (ISAOs) have an important role to play in \n     facilitating information sharing going forward and has \n     clarified their functions as defined in the Homeland Security \n     Act.\n     Section 205. National response framework.\n       Section 205 amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to \n     require the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, \n     with proper coordination, to regularly update the Cyber \n     Incident Annex to the National Response Framework of the \n     Department of Homeland Security.\n     Section 206. Report on reducing cybersecurity risks in DHS \n         data centers.\n       Section 206 requires the Secretary of the Department of \n     Homeland Security to submit a report to Congress not later \n     than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act on \n     the feasibility of using compartmentalization between systems \n     to create conditions conducive to reduced cybersecurity risks \n     in data centers.\n     Section 207. Assessment.\n       Section 207 requires the Comptroller General of the United \n     States not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of \n     this Act to submit a report on the implementation of Title \n     II, including increases in the sharing of cyber threat \n     indicators at the National Cybersecurity and Communications \n     Integration Center and throughout the United States.\n     Section 208. Multiple simultaneous cyber incidents at \n         critical infrastructure.\n       Section 208 requires the appropriate Department of Homeland \n     Security Under Secretary to draft and submit to Congress not \n     later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act a \n     report on the feasibility of producing a risk-informed plan \n     to address the risks of multiple simultaneous cyber incidents \n     affecting critical infrastructure as well as cascade effects.\n     Section 209. Report on cybersecurity vulnerabilities of \n         United States ports.\n       Section 209 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security not \n     later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act \n     to submit to Congress a report on the vulnerability of United \n     States ports to cybersecurity incidents, as well as potential \n     mitigations.\n     Section 210. Prohibition on new regulatory authority.\n       Section 210 clarifies that the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security does not gain any additional regulatory authorities \n     in this subtitle.\n     Section 211. Termination of reporting requirements.\n       Section 211 adds a 7-year sunset on the reporting \n     requirements in Title II, Subtitle A.\n\n\n             SUBTITLE B--FEDERAL CYBERSECURITY ENHANCEMENT\n\n     Section 221. Short title.\n       Section 221 establishes that Title II, Subtitle B may be \n     cited as the ``Federal Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of \n     2015''.\n     Section 222. Definitions.\n       Section 222 defines for purposes of Title II, Subtitle B, \n     the terms ``agency,'' ``agency information system,'' \n     ``appropriate congressional committees,'' ``cybersecurity \n     risk,'' ``information system,'' ``Director,'' ``intelligence \n     community,'' ``national security system,'' and ``Secretary.''\n     Section 223. Improved Federal network security.\n       Section 223 amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 by \n     amending Section 228, as redesignated, to require an \n     intrusion assessment plan for Federal agencies and adding a \n     Section 230 to authorize a federal intrusion detection and \n     prevention capabilities'' for Federal agencies.\n       Section 230 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as added \n     by Section 223(a) of the bill, authorizes the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security to employ the Department's intrusion \n     detection and intrusion prevention capabilities, \n     operationally implemented under the ``EINSTEIN'' programs, to \n     scan agencies' network traffic for malicious activity and \n     block it. The Secretary and agencies with sensitive data are \n     expected to confer regarding the sensitivity of, and \n     statutory protections otherwise applicable to, information on \n     agency information systems. The Secretary is expected to \n     ensure that the policies and procedures developed under \n     section 230 appropriately restrict and limit Department \n     access, use, retention, and handling of such information to \n     protect the privacy and confidentiality of such information, \n     including ensuring that the Department protects such \n     sensitive data from disclosure, and trains appropriate staff \n     accordingly.\n       Section 223(b) mandates that agencies deploy and adopt \n     those capabilities within one year for all network traffic \n     traveling to or from each information system owned or \n     operated by the agency, or two months after the capabilities \n     are first made available to the agency, whichever is later. \n     The subsection also requires that agencies adopt improvements \n     added to the intrusion detection and prevention capabilities \n     six months after they are made available. Improvements is \n     intended to be read broadly to describe expansion of the \n     capabilities, new systems, and added technologies, for \n     example: non-signature based detection systems such as \n     heuristic- and behavior-based detection, new countermeasures \n     to block malicious traffic beyond e-mail filtering and Domain \n     Name System (DNS)-sinkholing, and scanning techniques that \n     allow scanning of encrypted traffic.\n     Section 224. Advanced internal defenses.\n       Section 224 directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to \n     add advanced network security tools to the Continuous \n     Diagnostics and Mitigation program; develop and implement a \n     plan to ensure agency use of advanced network security tools; \n     and, with the Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget, prioritize advanced security tools and update metrics \n     used to measure security under the Federal Information \n     Security Management Act of 2002.\n     Section 225. Federal cybersecurity requirements.\n       Section 225 adds a statutory requirement for the head of \n     each agency not later than 1 year after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act to implement several standards on their \n     networks to include identification of sensitive and mission \n     critical data, use of encryption, and multi-factor \n     authentication.\n     Section 226. Assessment; reports.\n       Section 226 includes a requirement for a Government \n     Accountability Office study to be conducted on the \n     effectiveness of this approach and strategy. It also requires \n     reports from the Department of Homeland Security, Federal \n     Chief Information Officer, and the Office of Management and \n     Budget. Required reporting includes an annual report from the \n     Department of Homeland Security on the effectiveness and \n     privacy controls of the intrusion detection and prevention \n     capabilities; information on adoption of the intrusion \n     detection and capabilities at agencies in the Office of \n     Management and Budget's annual Federal Information Security \n     Management Act report; an assessment by the Federal Chief \n     Information Officer within two years of enactment as to \n     continued value of the intrusion detection and prevention \n     capabilities; and a Government Accountability report in three \n     years on the effectiveness of Federal agencies' approach to \n     securing agency information systems.\n     Section 227. Termination.\n       Section 227 creates a 7-year sunset for the authorization \n     of the intrusion detection and prevention capabilities in \n     Section 230 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as added by \n     Section 223(a).\n     Section 228. Identification of information systems relating \n         to national security.\n       Section 228 requires the Director of National Intelligence \n     and the Director of the Office of Management, in coordination \n     with\n\n[[Page S8850]]\n\n     other agencies, not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act to identify unclassified information \n     systems that could reveal classified information, and submit \n     a report assessing the risks associated with a breach of such \n     systems and the costs and impact to designate such systems as \n     national security systems.\n     Section 229. Direction to agencies.\n       Section 229 authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     to issue an emergency directive to the head of an agency to \n     take any lawful action with respect to the operation of an \n     information system for the purpose of protecting such system \n     from an information security threat. In situations in which \n     the Secretary has determined there is an imminent threat to \n     an agency, the Secretary may authorize the use of intrusion \n     detection and prevention capabilities in accordance with \n     established procedures, including notice to the affected \n     agency.\n\n         Title III--Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment\n\n     Section 301. Short title.\n       Section 301 establishes Title III may be cited as the \n     ``Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2015''.\n     Section 302.

Madam President, the bill we are considering today \ncontains a provision in section 305 providing for some tax relief for \nrefiners whose costs will increase as a result of the repeal of the ban \non oil exports. This provision permits refiners to modify the \ncalculation of production activities income to lessen the impact of \nhigh transportation costs in bringing crude oil to their refineries. \nThe provision permits adjusting such activities income for properly \nallocable transportation costs. Many times transportation costs are \nembedded within an invoice and not broken out as a separate line item, \nsuch as included in the delivered price of crude. These are clearly \ntransportation costs intended to be taken into account for purposes of \nthis section.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, in Section 303 of the House amendment No. \n1 to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2029, the text of the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act, 2016, the section 48 Investment Tax Credit, 26 \nU.S.C. section 48, is extended for 5 years, beginning on January 1, \n2017, and phased down to 26 percent in 2020 and 22 percent in 2021. \nSection 303 inadvertently only extends the credit for solar energy \ntechnologies, rather than all of the technologies currently eligible to \nreceive the credit.\n  The intention of the agreement that I reached with the majority \nleader was to extend the section 48 Investment Tax Credit for all of \nthe eligible technologies for 5 years and to treat each technology \neligible for a 30 percent credit the same with respect to a phase down \nin the years 2020 and 2021. The permanent 10 percent credit for \neligible technologies under section 48 will remain in place.\n  The majority leader and I hope to address this early next year in an \nappropriate legislative vehicle.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, for several weeks, negotiations have \nbeen ongoing on a multitude of controversial provisions relating to the \nomnibus. While those debates were raging in different parts of the \nCapitol, work on the Defense appropriations bill continued quietly and \nefficiently.\n  I believe many Americans would be surprised to know about the \nexemplary level of bipartisanship that went into crafting this \nlegislation, which provides the funding to take care of the women and \nmen serving our country in uniform.\n  This bill provides for the pay and benefits of each member of the \nArmed Forces, equips them with the tools they need, and develops the \nnext generation of technology to improve our national security.\n  Neither the chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, \nSenator Cochran, nor I got everything we wanted out of this bill. Tough \ndecisions had to be made.\n  Chairman Cochran supported a number of my suggestions for the bill, \nwe worked together on others, and we disagreed on a few. The end result \nis a\n\n[[Page S8851]]\n\ngood bill that meets the needs of our national security.\n  The Defense appropriations bill provides all the needed resources for \nongoing military operations, including the funds requested by the \nPresident to carry out anti-ISIL operations in Syria and Iraq.\n  It adds $1.2 billion to the request to account for maintaining a \nlarger presence in Afghanistan through 2016. And because the situation \nin Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq is so fluid, it includes additional OCO \nreprogramming authority--a total of $4.5 billion--to respond to \nunexpected events.\n  We also maintain robust funding for intelligence collection on \ntraditional and nontraditional threats to this country, so that our \nNation can continue to be a step ahead of threats to Americans and our \nallies.\n  The DOD has a long history of scientific innovation for the purpose \nof keeping our troops safe and providing an edge over our adversaries. \nWe also know that millions of Americans who have never served in \nuniform often benefit from these defense breakthroughs. This bill \nprovides a total of $1.94 billion for DOD medical research programs, \nwhich is 5 percent real growth over last year's funding level.\n  The medical research funding in this bill is directed toward \ncompetition, whether it is the $667 million in core research funding, \nthe $278 million in the Peer-Reviewed Medical Research Program, the \n$120 million for breast cancer research, or the variety of other \nresearch programs provided in the legislation.\n  I have heard criticism that medical research doesn't belong in a \ndefense bill.\n  Defense medical research is relatively small--NIH research funding is \n15 times larger--but DOD has made important breakthroughs that help \nservicemembers, their families, and all Americans.\n  As one example, Army researchers have developed E75, a vaccine that \ncuts in half the chance that breast cancer will return. Women around \nthe country benefited from that breakthrough, including those in \nuniform and those in military families seeking care at DOD hospitals.\n  The bill also provides $2.3 billion for nonmedical basic research, a \n$220 million increase over the President's request. These funds help \nexpand our knowledge of the universe in a variety of disciplines and \nmay eventually lead to the next technology breakthrough that will \nenrich our lives.\n  The bill includes $487 million for U.S.-Israeli cooperative missile \ndefense programs, fully funding the request from the Government of \nIsrael.\n  We provide for a strong stand against Russian aggression in Europe. \nThe European Reassurance Initiative, which increases U.S. troop \npresence and training in more than a dozen countries, is fully funded. \nAn additional $250 million is provided for lethal and nonlethal aid to \nthe Ukraine security services. The bill also includes $412 million to \nfully fund upgrades to the Army's Stryker fleet because of the threat \nfrom Russia.\n  However, the agreement takes a more cautious view of DOD's program to \ntrain the Syrian opposition. It is one of many programs for which the \nDepartment can request funds by reprogramming from the Counterterrorism \nPartnerships Fund. This process improves congressional oversight as \nwell as places the onus on DOD to justify further expenses for the \nSyrian training program.\n  The bill includes a long list of increases to defense programs that \nwere underfunded in the President's request. These programs are \nessential to maintaining the military advantage against our opponents \nand also support a strong and stable defense industrial base.\n  Some of the highlights include: $1 billion for an additional DDG-51 \ndestroyer, 12 additional F-18 aircraft, 11 additional F-35 Joint Strike \nFighters, $300 million for the Navy's UCLASS drone, sufficient funding \nto keep the A-10 operating for another year, and $1 billion for the \nNational Guard and Reserve Equipment Account.\n  Finally, the bill includes a provision to guarantee competition for \nthe launch of DOD satellites. I have studied the history of DOD's space \nlaunch programs, and it is a testament to how poor oversight leads to \ntaxpayers being stuck with an expensive bill.\n  In the mid-2000s, United Launch Alliance gained a monopoly on \nsatellite launches. Over a few short years, the cost of its rockets \nescalated by 65 percent. Just this year, SpaceX was certified to \ncompete against ULA. These competitions have barely begun, and already \nwe are seeing large savings in launch costs. But provisions in the \nDefense Authorization Act are threatening to create a new launch \nmonopoly, this time with SpaceX in charge.\n  The issue is that ULA uses a Russian rocket engine, and a new \nAmerican-made engine will not be ready to compete until 2022. During \nthat time, DOD wants to compete 37 launches, but under Defense \nauthorization bills, ULA is only allowed to win four of those \ncontracts.\n  We all want to eliminate reliance on Russian engines. This bill adds \n$144 million to make a new U.S.-built rocket a reality as soon as \npossible.\n  I must remind Senators that NASA and NOAA are not restricted from \nusing Russian engines for its satellites. Why should we agree to a \ndouble standard--a looming monopoly for national security space \nlaunches but full and open competition for scientific missions?\n  The provision in this bill simply guarantees that the Air Force for \nthe next year will live under the same rules as NASA and NOAA, while a \nnew American-made rocket is developed and will hopefully be ready in \n2022.\n  This large and complex bill amounts to half of the discretionary \nbudget of the United States. It is essential to our national security, \nand this bill improves on DOD's budget proposals in many ways.\n  Once again, I would like to thank my friend, Chairman Cochran, for \nhis steady hand in moving this legislation forward in a constructive \nand bipartisan manner. The Defense Subcommittee has a long history of \nstrong partnerships, and I am pleased that this tradition carries on \ntoday.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, hard-working Americans deserve more than \nliving paycheck to paycheck, worrying about having to choose between \npaying an electric bill or putting healthy food on the table. This \nappropriations law ends a year of continuing budget uncertainty and \nextends tax credits for millions of hard-working families. We have kept \nout harmful riders that would have undermined everything from Wall \nStreet reform to clean air and water laws. There are many steps forward \nin this bill for Vermonters and all Americans, but we need stronger \nsteps. We need to carry this into the new year and strengthen it, to \nhelp lift the middle class and to protect the most vulnerable among us.\n  We need much more progress in creating well-paying jobs in rural \nareas like Vermont, not just in the Nation's urban centers. We need to \ndo more to protect Social Security and Medicare and other programs in \nthe safety net. We need to do more to make college affordable for \nstudents and families.\n  This bill will let Congress begin the new year with focusing on \nAmerica's middle class, taking stronger steps to help working families. \nBy standing together, Senate Democrats have made it possible to cancel \nthe harmful sequester and to lift caps to make investments possible \nthat will make a difference in communities across Vermont--from cleanup \nefforts on Lake Champlain, to ramping up our fight against opioid \naddiction, to equipping our police officers with lifesaving bulletproof \nvests.\n  This omnibus spending bill is good news for my home State of Vermont, \ntoo. It includes important funds for the EPA's Lake Champlain \nGeographic Program, which will be critical as Vermont and the EPA take \non ambitious new work and regulations to address water quality and \nphosphorus levels in Lake Champlain. As much as Vermonters and millions \nof visitors to our State enjoy Lake Champlain, we know that business as \nusual simply will not cut it. We need serious action, measurable work \non the ground, and strong Federal resources in order to make real \nprogress to clean up Lake Champlain. That is why I made supporting the \nEPA's geographic programs a top priority for fiscal year 2016. That \nthis final bill maintains the strong Federal investments that were made \nlast year reflects a real partnership among Federal, State, and local \npartners.\n\n[[Page S8852]]\n\n  The omnibus makes essential investments to help States and local \nmunicipalities fight the scourge of opioid and heroin addiction, which \ncontinues to devastate too many communities. Vermont has been a \nnational leader in calling attention to this problem and bringing \ntogether communities to find solutions. This spending package includes \na number of programs that will continue to support those efforts. We \nknow that it will require strong Federal support to join State and \nlocal efforts to address this heroin crisis. In particular, this \nomnibus package includes funding for the Anti-Heroin Task Force Program \nthat began last year to provide support to State law enforcement \nefforts like those of the Vermont Drug Task Force in dismantling supply \nchains trafficking heroin into our States.\n  Because we know that enforcement alone cannot solve this problem, \nthis bill also includes increased funding for grants to expand \nmedication assisted treatment programs, and funding to distribute \nlifesaving naloxone to prevent overdoses. It offers continued support \nfor drug court programs that prevent individuals suffering from \naddiction from needlessly entering our criminal justice system and \ninstead helps set them on a path towards treatment and recovery. I am \nproud to support for funding these critical programs that provide a \nlifeline to communities struggling to eliminate this opioid crisis.\n  This omnibus bill will grow jobs in Vermont and across the country. \nWhen I walk down the street in Montpelier or talk to people at the \ngrocery store in Waterbury, I hear too many stories from Vermonters who \nare working two, even three jobs to make ends meet. Congress needs to \ndo more to spur job growth, and I believe this bill will make a \nmeasurable impact.\n  The heart and soul of Vermont's economy are our small businesses. In \nfact, over 90 percent of the employers in Vermont are small businesses, \nemploying more than half of all Vermonters that work in the private \nsector. So naturally, the Small Business Administration, SBA, and the \nprograms it supports are critically important to ensuring that Vermont \nbusinesses have access to the capital they need to expand. Year after \nyear, we see all sectors of the Vermont economy utilizing SBA programs \nfrom manufacturing, to agriculture, clean energy, and even craft \nbrewing. Vermont Precision Tools in Swanton, which manufactures high-\nquality burs for the medical device industry, is one such example. \nPete's Greens, a certified organic vegetable farm that has been a \nleader in Vermont's agricultural renaissance, is another. This past \nyear, the SBA had its highest level of lending in Vermont, backing more \nthan $53 million in loans. This omnibus bill will ensure that \nVermonters have access to just as much capital in 2016.\n  Another critical source of capital for Vermont's businesses has been \nmade possible through the Treasury Department's Community Development \nFinancial Institutions Fund, CDFI. Community Capital of Vermont is one \nof our State's organizations that have leveraged CDFI funds and the \nSBA's microloan program to help neighborhood businesses--such as Barrio \nBakery in the Old North End of Burlington, Patchwork Farm Bakery in \nHardwick, Liberty Chocolates in Montpelier, and Bent Hill Brewery in \nRandolph. This year we were able to increase funding for the CDFI \nprogram, while also increasing access to healthy food and expanding \nwork in rural areas.\n  Vermont is a northern border State, and the connection we share with \nour Canadian neighbors is an important one for our cultural and \neconomic identity. Senators from neighboring States know well that some \ncommunities have experienced unique economic challenges, and that is \nwhy we worked together to create the Northern Border Regional \nCommission, NBRC. I appreciate their support and joining with me to \nincrease the NBRC budget to $7.5 million for the coming year. In the \nshort time the commission has existed, it has helped companies like \nSuperior Technical Ceramics in St. Albans develop a plan to increase \ntheir exports; the Vermont Sustainable Jobs Fund is helping grow \nVermont's wood products sector; an industrial park in Franklin County \nhas received funds for improvements to entice Canadian companies to \nexpand in the United States; and--a jewel of the Northeast Kingdom--\nWilloughby Lake, will have increased amenities resulting in more travel \nand tourism.\n  As a result of the Bipartisan Budget Act Congress approved in \nOctober, critical funding was restored to the HOME program, which helps \nStates and communities preserve existing and produce new units of \naffordable housing. The Senate-passed Transportation, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment bill decimated the HOME program, providing a paltry $66 \nmillion. Because of the Bipartisan Budget Act, in fiscal year 2016, the \nHOME program will receive $950 million--an increase of $50 million over \n2015 funding--which will help every State, including Vermont, address \ncritical housing needs.\n  The National Institutes of Health, the Nation's leading medical \nresearch hub, will receive a $2 billion increase in funding, which will \nbenefit research institutions like the University of Vermont.\n  The bill continues to support community health centers that will be \nfunded at just over $5 billion next year. In Vermont alone, 11 \nfederally qualified community health centers with 56 delivery sites \nprovided care over the past 2 years to nearly 200,000 patients. These \nhealth centers employ over 900 people.\n  The omnibus reauthorizes for 3 years the Land and Water Conservation \nFund, and provides needed funding to support it. Early next year, I \nhope Congress will redouble its efforts to ensure that this critical \nconservation program--which supports projects in every State, in every \ncorner of our country--receives permanent authorization and full \nfunding--all at no expense to the taxpayer.\n  Important, too, is that this omnibus rejects efforts by industry \ngiants to block Vermont's Act 120, which requires the labeling of \ngenetically engineered foods. Vermonters support their law, because \nthey believe--as do I--that consumers have the right to know what is in \nthe food they are eating. An omnibus spending bill is no place to make \nnational policy that undermines carefully crafted laws at the state \nlevel.\n  As ranking member of the Department of State and Foreign Operations \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I want to thank Chairman Lindsey Graham, \nChairwoman Kay Granger, and Ranking Member Nita Lowey for the way they \nworked with me and my staff to reach agreement on the State and foreign \noperations title of this omnibus bill. Their expertise was invaluable \nin producing a bill that provides funding for important diplomatic, \ndevelopment, security, and humanitarian priorities of the United States \nand that reflect our Nation's values.\n  Division K of the omnibus, for the Department of State and foreign \noperations, provides a total of $52.7 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority. This funding helps protect U.S. personnel, including our \ndiplomats, working overseas; funds programs to combat trafficking in \npersons, wildlife poaching, and drug smuggling; provides historic \nlevels of funding to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and other \ndiseases that threaten hundreds of millions of people around the world; \nsupports key allies in countering ISIL and other terrorist \norganizations; provides funds to promote renewable energy and protect \nthe environment; and funds relief programs for refugees and other \nvictims of conflict and natural disasters. These are just a few \nexamples. Division K also includes important provisions to ensure \ntransparency, combat corruption, and prevent assistance to and \nencourage accountability for those who would misuse U.S. assistance by \nviolating human rights or engaging in corruption or other financial \ncrimes.\n  I am particularly pleased that the bill includes increased funding \nfor agent orange remediation and health and disability programs in \nVietnam; the Leahy War Victims Fund to assist innocent victims of war, \nclear unexploded bombs in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world; \nand educational and cultural exchange programs including the amount \nrequested for the Fulbright exchange program. In addition, authority is \nprovided to help threatened scholars around the world find academic \ninstitutions where they can continue their work in safety.\n  The bill also supports programs that directly benefit Vermonters, \nincluding the amount requested for the Peace\n\n[[Page S8853]]\n\nCorps and funding above the amount requested for the Great Lakes \nFishery Commission to support additional sea lamprey control in the \nGreat Lakes and the Lake Champlain Basin.\n  I am disappointed that a provision I authored, which was included in \nthe Senate bill, to enable the U.S. to provide technical assistance to \nsupport investigations, apprehensions, and prosecutions of those who \ncommit genocide and other crimes against humanity, was not included. \nThere are also some things that I wish were not in this bill, including \na provision carried from last year that would weaken limits on carbon \nemissions from projects financed by the Export-Import Bank and Overseas \nPrivate Investment Corporation. No bill is perfect, and we will \nundoubtedly revisit these and other issues next year.\n  I have heard from many Vermonters concerned that controversial policy \nprovisions were to be included in this final spending bill. While I am \ngrateful this final bill does not include many of the poison pill \npolicy riders included in the House and Senate passed bills--measures \nthat would have eroded health care services, repealed Dodd-Frank, and \nthreatened key environmental protections, among other issues--I am \nconcerned that it includes a giveaway to Big Oil by lifting the \ndecades-long ban on crude oil exports. While I understand that, in \nexchange for lifting the ban, the omnibus is free of several proposed \npolicy riders that would undermine Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act \nregulations and extends several environmental and renewable energy tax \nmeasures, I share the concerns of many environmentalists that lifting \nthis ban will result in increased oil development and we could see \nhigher gasoline prices in New England.\n  I am disappointed that the omnibus includes two policy riders that \nwill further wear away transparency and accountability in our campaign \nfinance system. These provisions will only promote the spending of dark \nmoney in Federal elections and further erode the trust of the American \npeople in their political system.\n  I am also disappointed that the omnibus is being used to jam cyber \nsecurity information sharing legislation through Congress. This is not \nthe way to pass major legislation, particularly one that threatens to \nsignificantly harm Americans' privacy rights. This new version of the \ncyber security information sharing bill--which was negotiated behind \nclosed doors by leaders of the Senate and House Intelligence \nCommittees--rolls back a number of significant consumer and privacy \nprotections that were included in the Senate-passed bill and over which \nthe Judiciary Committee has primary jurisdiction, including language \nthat could affect the scope of liability protections and that would \nexpand Federal preemption of State FOIA and transparency laws. These \nchanges are dangerous and unnecessary. Congress should have been given \nan opportunity to study, debate, and vote on a bill of this magnitude \nunder regular order--not choose between this bill and a government \nshutdown. I hope that, when the Senate returns next year, we can \nconsider legislation to mitigate the potential harm of this \nlegislation.\n  Of course, with this omnibus spending bill, the Senate will consider \nthe Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes, PATH, Act. Last year, in the \nclosing days of Congress, I opposed a 1-year, retroactive extension of \nexpiring tax credits, not because I do not support those credits, but \nbecause our small businesses, middle-class families, and entrepreneurs \nneed more certainty. The PATH Act provides that in some instances \nthrough 2016 and in other instances with permanency.\n  I am pleased that the PATH Act extends permanently the earned income \ntax credit, EITC, and the child tax credit, CTC. These credits have \nhelped Vermont families recover from the recession. Vermont was one of \nthe first States in the nation to supplement federal EITC dollars. In \n2013, low-income families in Vermont received an estimated $2,400 in \nState and Federal tax credits that year. For the many families who \nqualify for these programs, these credits provide a significant \nincrease in take-home pay. This not only has the potential to lift \nfamilies out of poverty, it also motivates many to return to the \nworkforce. While I would have preferred that these extensions be paired \nwith an indexing proposal, extending permanency to them is welcomed \nnews for millions of American families.\n  The PATH Act also supports small businesses by encouraging hiring, \npromoting investment in low-income areas, promoting domestic renewable \nenergy development, and encouraging research and development. I am \ngrateful that the bill includes a permanently extension of the \ncharitable deduction for contributions of food inventory. I have long \nchampioned this deduction. It helps organizations like the Vermont Food \nBank and encourages donors to support food shelfs across the country.\n  Finally, I am deeply disappointed that, despite bipartisan, bicameral \nagreement, needed reforms to the EB-5 regional center program were not \nincluded in this final bill. On Tuesday evening, just hours before the \nbill became public, congressional leaders inexplicably decided to \nextend the EB-5 program without any reform. The program was given a \nfree pass despite broad, bipartisan agreement that it is in urgent need \nof an overhaul. Time and again, concerns have been raised about the \nregional center program's susceptibility to fraud, its lack of \noversight and transparency, and the rampant abuse of its incentives to \ninvest in underserved communities--undermining a core premise of the \nprogram. Homeland Security Secretary Johnson, the Government \nAccountability Office, and the Department of Homeland Security Office \nof Inspector General have all raised concerns.\n  While the program's flaws are obvious to anyone paying attention, the \nnecessary fixes are as well. I have long worked to improve the regional \ncenter program, and my EB-5 amendment to the Senate's comprehensive \nimmigration reform bill in the last Congress was unanimously approved \nin the Judiciary Committee. This Congress, I authored far-reaching \nreforms with Chairman Grassley and House Judiciary Chairman Goodlatte \nand Ranking Member Conyers. We had the support of by far the largest \ntrade association representing the EB-5 industry, as well as the civil \nrights community. We pushed hard to include our reforms in the omnibus, \nbut some congressional leaders inexcusably rejected these vital \nreforms.\n  We have a comprehensive, bipartisan reform bill that the chairmen and \nranking members of both the House and Senate Judiciary Committees \nsupport. These reforms would address the many troubles that plague this \nprogram, including increasing oversight and transparency, protecting \ninvestors, and promoting investment and job growth in underserved \ncommunities as Congress always intended. We cannot again squander this \nopportunity. We should act on our bill when we return in January to \nensure integrity and to demand ongoing oversight of the program.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the bill before us today represents a \ncolossal addition to our Nation's debt, which currently stands at $18.4 \ntrillion. Earlier this year, the Budget Committee worked hard to \ndevelop a budget plan that would balance in the next 10 years by saving \nmoney, cutting costs, and examining inefficient programs and \nprovisions. It was not easy to find the cuts necessary to achieve the \ngoals laid out in that proposal. But the tax extenders bill costs are a \nlarge step away from getting our Nation back on a sound fiscal footing \nand accomplishing the objectives laid out in the budget plan.\n  When the Joint Committee on Taxation, JCT, scored the bill, they \nfound that in just the next year, it will add $157 billion to the debt, \nand that cost will swell to $622 billion over the next 10 years. The \ngovernment will have to borrow this money; we do not have it to spend. \nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, CRFB, headed by Maya \nMacGuiness, took an independent look at these tax provisions. According \nto the CRFB, the United States will have to pay an additional $130 \nbillion in interest charges over the next 10 years on the money \nborrowed to finance this legislation. Maya's organization makes one \nmore important point that many here in Congress have not sufficiently \nconsidered. The $622 billion advertised cost will balloon even further \nto $2 trillion over the next\n\n[[Page S8854]]\n\ntwo decades. Certainly, many of the provisions in this package are \ngood, but President Obama and Congress need to recognize there are \nlimits.\n  The bill also extends costly tax credits that are scored rightly by \nthe Congressional Budget Office as support payments, not tax \ndeductions; and allows tax credits, earned income tax credits, for \nillegal aliens favored by President Obama's Executive amnesty and the \nadditional income tax credit, which allows billions to go to illegal \naliens. These provisions are unwise and need serious reform before \nextending.\n  There are indeed some good provisions in this bill. Businesses across \nthe nation will benefit by the research and development and section 179 \nbonus depreciation tax credits being made permanent. Many businesses in \nmy State rely on the credits and making them permanent provides \nconsistency for better planning. But the $611 billion cost in new \nexpenditures and lost revenues is huge. This Congress has to know that \na $2 trillion addition to the debt over the next 20 years is simply too \nmuch. This is a step away not towards fiscal responsibility.\n  It is these kinds of rationalizations that can cause a country to go \nbroke. For perspective, Congress struggled mightily to find $77 billion \nabove the gas tax to pay for the 5-year highway bill. This tax package \nis so huge it will make the highway bill costs look insignificant.\n  Colleagues, we cannot be in denial about how much this bill costs. We \nall have a strong desire for tax cuts and tax reform. I have supported \nsuch bills many times in the past, but this bill has little reform and \ngreat cost. I am disappointed that I cannot support this bill.\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I want to speak today about the Omnibus \nappropriations and tax bill. First, I want to applaud my colleagues who \nhave worked tirelessly towards this deal for over a year now. Our \nleadership and the leaders of our Appropriations, Finance, and Budget \nCommittees have been setting the stage for this action and I want to \nthank them.\n  This bill, H.R. 2029, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, \naddresses many priorities that I have been fighting for since joining \nthe Senate in 2013. It comes on the heels of the Bipartisan Budget Act \nwe passed in October of this year, which addressed for 2 years the \narbitrary budget caps set by sequestration and implements the first \nyear of that agreement.\n  First enacted as part of the Bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011, \nthese arbitrary budget caps have been hurting our national defense and \ndomestic priorities since sequestration went into effect in 2013 by \narbitrarily forcing critical agencies such as the Department of Defense \nto set strategy and policy based on artificial caps. As a former mayor \nand Governor I have a lot of experience with budgets and \ndecisionmaking. I understand using budgets gimmicks to set policy is \nthe opposite of what we should be doing. It is a strategy that is \nunsustainable and must be addressed if we are to properly manage our \nfinances.\n  In 2013, on the heels of the devastating government shutdown, \nCongress passed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 to reduce \nuncertainty, adjust the budget caps to reflect current needs, and put \nthe idea of another government shutdown behind us. That deal was a \nbipartisan compromise, heralded by Members from both sides of the \naisle. We learned from that exercise that both parties can come \ntogether to give budget certainty to families and businesses.\n  This year, we faced the prospect of another harmful episode of \nsequestration whereby Congress's priority setting was once again to be \ndetermined by the budget law passed in 2011. Once again, lawmakers came \ntogether, and we passed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, another 2-\nyear bill which set appropriate spending targets and gave appropriators \ntime to write full appropriations bills for the remainder of this \nfiscal year, thereby avoiding the risk of shutdowns or fiscal cliffs at \nthe end of the year.\n  Because of all that activity, we find ourselves here today with this \nbill. Within this bill there is a lot of good: strong funding for \nDefense Department priorities like shipbuilding and the Ohio-class \nreplacement; strong funding for educational programs like Head Start, \nPreschool Development Grants, and Teacher Quality Partnership Grants; \nstrong funding for State Department embassy security training programs; \nstrong funding for military construction projects around Virginia; \nstrong commitments for the environment such as the American Battlefield \nProtection Act, Chesapeake Bay Program, and the Army Corps programs in \nNorfolk; strong funding for the National Park Service and for NASA's \nprograms at Wallops Island; and strong funding for Plan Central \nAmerica.\n  This bill also includes critically important programs on the revenue \nside. Three critical low- and middle-income tax programs--the child tax \ncredit, earned income tax credit, and American opportunity tax credit--\nhave been made permanent in this bill, so has the research and \ndevelopment tax credit, along with an expansion in this credit for \nstartups championed by Senator Coons that I have cosponsored. Also made \npermanent are tax programs for teachers, for conservation, and for \nmilitary families. We have made other programs last for another 5 \nyears. And others will be extended for 2 years, a step forward for \nthese programs we have been extending for only 1 year at a time.\n  This package also contains energy policy that will advance our \nnational goal of generating energy cleaner tomorrow than today, while \nensuring that our short-term need for fossil fuels is met by American \nsupplies and developed by American workers. The deal lifts the 40-year \nold ban on export of U.S. crude oil, which will create American jobs. \nThe deal extends wind and solar tax incentives for 5 years.\n  The deal also hikes funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund \nby 50 percent this year, which will support open space preservation \nefforts around the country and in Virginia at Rappahannock River Valley \nNational Wildlife Refuge, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson \nNational Forests, the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historical \nTrail, and elsewhere. Finally, it includes assistance for U.S. oil \nrefineries, while stopping virtually all policy riders seeking to \nundermine critical air and water pollution laws.\n  This bill is by no means perfect. In particular, while I agree with \nmany of the tax provisions included in this bill, a must-pass \ngovernment funding bill is not the place to have the important tax \npolicy debates facing this country. By passing this bill with so many \ntax provisions with little debate, we put off a broader agreement on \ncomprehensive tax reform. I do agree with many aspects of this tax \ndeal. But by taking this action now, we leave other critical tax policy \ndecisions on the table with no debate on how we as a body should \nprioritize these issues.\n  And I am struck by the irony that all year long we debated how to \nprovide sequester relief of about $100 billion for our national \nsecurity and for education and health and research funding that will \nimprove our economy. Those policies needed offsets. But this tax \npackage will increase the deficit by nearly $700 billion, and there has \nnot been discussion of offsetting this cost. That seems to me to be a \nbad precedent and an unfair distinction. In an era dominated by \nconversations about our national debt and deficits, we should do better \nto seek ways address these changes in a fiscally responsible way.\n  In the end, I choose to support this bill. The good in this \nlegislation and the need for our Federal agencies to be able to plan \nand set the priorities of this country makes support the right \ndecision. And the bipartisan character of the agreement will hopefully \nencourage more such cooperation.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, the cyber security bill included in the \nomnibus is a first step towards improving our Nation's dangerously \ninadequate defenses against cyber attacks. I know that the chairman and \nvice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee worked hard to \nensure that a cyber security bill passed this year.\n  Unfortunately, however, the American people and economy will remain \nvulnerable to a catastrophic cyber attack against our critical \ninfrastructure even after this bill becomes law.\n  Critical infrastructure refers to entities that are vital to the \nsafety, health, and economic well-being of the American people, such as \nthe major utilities that run the Nation's electric grid, the\n\n[[Page S8855]]\n\nnational air transportation system that moves passengers and cargo \nsafely from one location to another, and the elements of the financial \nsector that ensure the $14 trillion in payments made every day are \nsecurely routed through the banking system.\n  The Senate-passed cyber bill included an important provision I \nauthored with the support of Senators Mikulski, Coats, Reed, Warner, \nHeinrich, King, Hirono, and Wyden that would have required the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the appropriate \nFederal agencies, to undertake an assessment of the fewer than 65 \ncritical infrastructure entities at greatest risk of causing \ncatastrophic harm if they were the targets of a successful cyber \nattack.\n  By ``catastrophic harm,'' the Department of Homeland Security means a \nsingle cyber attack that would likely result in 2,500 deaths, $50 \nbillion in economic damage, or a severe degradation of our national \nsecurity. In other words, if one of these entities upon which we depend \neach day were attacked, the results would be devastating.\n  Following the assessment, the provision then required a report to \nCongress describing the steps that could be taken to lessen the \nvulnerability of these entities and to decrease the risk of \ncatastrophic harm resulting from such a cyber attack against our \ncritical infrastructure.\n  Inexplicably, this provision, which was supported by a majority of \nthe members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, was eliminated in the \nnegotiations between the leaders of the House and Senate Intelligence \nCommittees.\n  I am told that this important provision was dropped because of \nopposition from certain industry groups that claimed that the current \ninvestment and regulatory structure is sufficient to protect our \ncritical infrastructure; yet our provision explicitly included existing \nregulators in the assessment process and required no new mandates. \nCompromise language that would have made this even clearer was also \nrejected.\n  Our provision appropriately distinguished between the vast majority \nof businesses, such as a retail store or a chain of small ice cream \nshops, and the fewer than 65 critical infrastructure entities that \ncould debilitate the U.S. economy or our way of life if attacked; yet \nthe final version of the cyber bill treats these very different \nentities in exactly the same way.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a November 30, 2015, letter sent from a \nmajority of the Senators on the Senate Intelligence Committee to the \nchairmen and vice chairmen of the House and Senate Intelligence \nCommittees that corrects the Record on what this provision does and why \nit is necessary be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  These fewer than 65 entities warrant our special attention because \nthere is ample evidence, both classified and unclassified, that \ndemonstrates the threat facing critical infrastructure and the \ndeficiencies in the cyber security capability to defend them.\n  The Director of National Intelligence, Jim Clapper, has testified \nthat the greatest threat facing our country is in cyber space. He has \nstated before the Armed Services Committee that the number one cyber \nchallenge that concerns him the most is an attack on our Nation's \ncritical infrastructure.\n  His assessment is backed up by several intrusions into the industrial \ncontrols of critical infrastructure. Since 2009, the Wall Street \nJournal has published reports regarding efforts by foreign adversaries, \nsuch as China, Russia, and Iran, to leave behind software on American \ncritical infrastructure and to disrupt U.S. banks through cyber \nintrusions.\n  Multiple natural gas pipeline companies were the target of a \nsophisticated cyber intrusion campaign beginning in December 2011, and \nSaudi Arabia's oil company, Aramco, was subject to a destructive cyber \nattack in 2012.\n  When I asked Admiral Rogers, the Director of the National Security \nAgency with responsibility for cyber space, how prepared our country \nwas for a cyber attack against our critical infrastructure in a hearing \nthis summer, he replied that we are at a ``5 or 6.''\n  Last month, the Deputy Director of the NSA, Richard Ledgett, was \nasked during a CNN interview if foreign actors already have the \ncapability of shutting down key U.S. infrastructure, such as the \nfinancial sector, energy, transportation, and air traffic control. His \nresponse? ``Absolutely.''\n  When it comes to cyber security, ignorance is not bliss. The least we \nshould do is to ask DHS and the appropriate Federal agencies to \ndescribe what more could be done to prevent a catastrophic cyber attack \non critical infrastructure that could cause thousands of deaths and/or \na devastating blow to our economy or national defense.\n  Congress has missed an opportunity to improve our Nation's cyber \npreparedness by refusing to even ask DHS or the appropriate Federal \nagencies to understand and identify what more could be done to prevent \na catastrophic cyber attack on the fewer than 65 critical \ninfrastructure entities.\n  A cyber attack on our critical infrastructure is not a matter of \n``if,'' but a matter of ``when.'' We are at September 10 levels in \nterms of cyber preparedness--a sentiment expressed by former Secretary \nof Defense Leon Panetta in 2012 and in the 9/11 Commission's 10th \nanniversary report released last year.\n  We cannot afford to wait for a ``cyber 9/11'' before protecting our \ncritical infrastructure. By rejecting this provision, this Congress has \nelected to take just such a risk.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 30, 2015.\n     Hon. Richard Burr,\n     Chairman, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Washington \n         DC.\n     Hon. Michael T. McCaul,\n     House Committee on Homeland Security,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Devin Nunes,\n     House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein\n     Vice Chairman, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,\n     House Committee on Homeland Security,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Adam B. Schiff,\n     House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Burr, Vice Chairman Feinstein, Chairman \n     McCaul, Ranking Member Thompson, Chairman Nunes, and Ranking \n     Member Schiff: We strongly support the enactment of a \n     voluntary cybersecurity information sharing bill, which will \n     promote better communication between the private sector and \n     the federal government on cyber threats and vulnerabilities. \n     For 99 percent of businesses, the voluntary information \n     sharing framework established in law should be sufficient to \n     avoid catastrophic harm.\n       It would be a mistake, however, to treat the country's most \n     critical infrastructure, upon which our people and our \n     economy depend, the same way as a retail business, such as a \n     chain of small ice cream shops. That is why Section 407 of S. \n     754, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) \n     appropriately distinguishes between the vast majority of \n     businesses and those entities already designated by the \n     federal government as critical infrastructure at greatest \n     risk. Unless Section 407 of S. 754, the Cybersecurity \n     Information Sharing Act (CISA) is retained in the final \n     cybersecurity bill, these very different entities will be \n     treated exactly the same way under this legislation.\n       Critical infrastructure refers to entities that are vital \n     to the safety, health, and economic wellbeing of the American \n     people, such as the major utilities that run the nation's \n     electrical grid. Section 407, however, only applies to the \n     fewer than 65 entities that have already been designated by \n     the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as the critical \n     infrastructure entities where a cyber attack would likely \n     result in catastrophic harm. By catastrophic harm, DHS means \n     a single cyber attack that would likely result in 2,500 \n     deaths, $50 billion in economic damage, or a severe \n     degradation of our national security.\n       Given these devastating consequences, we urge you to retain \n     Section 407 of CISA. Ample evidence, both classified and \n     unclassified, testifies to the threat facing critical \n     infrastructure and the deficiencies in the cybersecurity \n     capability to defend them. Since 2009, the Wall Street \n     Journal has published reports regarding efforts by foreign \n     adversaries, such as China, Russia, and Iran, to leave behind \n     software on American critical infrastructure or to disrupt \n     U.S. banks through cyber intrusions. Multiple natural gas \n     pipeline companies were the target of a sophisticated cyber \n     intrusion campaign beginning in December 2011, and Saudi \n     Arabia's oil company, Aramco, was subject to a destructive \n     cyber attack in 2012.\n       Admiral Mike Rogers, the Director of the National Security \n     Agency, has said publicly\n\n[[Page S8856]]\n\n     that ``We have . . . observed intrusions into industrial \n     control systems . . . what concerns us is that . . . \n     capability can be used by nation-states, groups or \n     individuals to take down the capability of the control \n     systems.''\n       At a recent Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on \n     cybersecurity, the Director of National Intelligence was \n     asked what one cyber challenge concerned him the most. He \n     testified that it was a large-scale cyber attack against the \n     United States' infrastructure. At a subsequent open hearing \n     of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Senator \n     Collins asked Admiral Mike Rogers how prepared our country \n     was for such an attack against our critical infrastructure. \n     His answer, on a scale of 1-10, was that we are at a ``5 or \n     6''. That is a failing grade that we cannot ignore.\n       Section 407 has been mischaracterized in correspondence we \n     have received, so we would also like to clarify some key \n     facts about it. First, Section 407 is not counter to the \n     overall voluntary nature of CISA, and it does not impose new \n     incident reporting requirements on the fewer than 65 covered \n     entities. Of course, many critical infrastructure entities, \n     such as those in the electrical sector, are already subject \n     to mandatory incident reporting to their federal regulators.\n       Section 407 simply requires DHS to undertake an assessment \n     of the critical infrastructure that it has identified where a \n     single catastrophic cyber attack could cause deaths and \n     devastation and then report to Congress what actions could be \n     taken to lessen their vulnerability and to decrease the risk \n     of catastrophic harm resulting from such an attack.\n       Despite claims to the contrary, Section 407 is also \n     consistent with existing government authority, regulations, \n     and programs. The text of the provision clearly states that \n     the report and strategy required by DHS must be produced ``in \n     conjunction with the appropriate agency head . . .'' \n     Appropriate agency head means the head of the existing \n     sector-specific agency for such an entity or the existing \n     federal regulator for that entity.\n       Section 407 will also likely reduce, rather than increase, \n     the existing liability risk for the critical infrastructure \n     entities that have already been identified as being at \n     greatest risk of cyber attack. Liability risk is incurred \n     when an entity actually fails to mitigate cyber \n     vulnerabilities that they should have known about and \n     addressed. Rather than increasing this risk, Section 407 \n     seeks to share the burden of defending critical \n     infrastructure against the most sophisticated cyber attacks \n     by requiring the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct an \n     assessment of the cybersecurity of only the fewer than 65 \n     entities. Following this assessment, Section 407 would \n     require the Secretary to develop a strategy to mitigate the \n     risk of catastrophic effects. The least we should do is to \n     ask DHS and the appropriate federal agencies to describe what \n     more could be done to prevent a catastrophic cyber attack on \n     critical infrastructure that could cause thousands of deaths \n     and/or a devastating blow to our economy or national defense.\n       Finally, we urge you to review the list of entities that \n     are, in fact, covered by Section 407. Ironically, many of the \n     trade associations who oppose this provision do not represent \n     a single entity that would be covered by this amendment \n     because none of their members has been designated as critical \n     infrastructure at greatest risk. The list of entities and the \n     classified intelligence regarding the threats to critical \n     infrastructure have been provided to your respective \n     committees.\n       If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to \n     contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n     Susan M. Collins.\n     Daniel Coats.\n     Martin Heinrich.\n     Mazie K. Hirono.\n     Barbara A. Mikulski.\n     Mark R. Warner.\n     Angus S. King, Jr.\n     Jack Reed.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise today to speak on the fiscal \nyear 2016 Omnibus appropriations bill. I want to highlight the \nTransportation and Housing and Urban Development division of the bill, \nwhich is critically important to meeting the housing needs of low-\nincome, disabled, and older Americans, to shelter the homeless, and to \nboost our economy and create jobs through much needed infrastructure \ninvestments in our roads, bridges, railroads, transit systems, and \nairports.\n  Let me begin by thanking Chairman Cochran and Vice Chairwoman \nMikulski for their leadership in advancing these appropriations bills.\n  I also want to acknowledge Senator Jack Reed, the ranking member of \nthe subcommittee, who worked closely with me in our negotiations with \nthe House.\n  I would be remiss if I did not also acknowledge the tireless efforts \nstaff have put into this bill throughout the entire process. My staff: \nHeideh Shahmoradi, Ken Altman, Jason Woolwine, Rajat Mathur, Lydia \nCollins, and Gus Maples have made enormous contributions.\n  I also want to thank Dabney Hegg, Rachel Milberg, Christina Monroe, \nand Jordan Stone on Senator Reed's staff.\n  This bill represents priorities from Members on both sides of the \naisle in both Chambers. Through considerable negotiation and \ncompromise, we have crafted a bipartisan bill that targets limited \nresources to meet our most essential transportation and housing needs \nwhile ensuring effective oversight of these important programs.\n  The bill makes important investments, supporting millions of jobs and \neconomic development. It invests in our Nation's transportation \ninfrastructure by continuing to provide $500 million for the TIGER \nProgram. This highly competitive program creates jobs and supports \neconomic growth in every one of our home States.\n  The bill provides increased funding for our Nation's highway, \ntransit, and safety programs, consistent with the recently enacted \nhighway authorization bill, the FAST Act. State DOTs are also provided \nwith the flexibility to repurpose approximately $2 billion in old, \nunused congressionally directed spending and direct it toward \ninfrastructure projects that are of higher priority today within the \nsame geographic location of the original designation.\n  Turning to air travel, the aviation investments will continue to \nmodernize our nation's air traffic system and help to keep rural \ncommunities connected to the transportation network. It will ease \nfuture congestion and help reduce delays for travelers in U.S. \nairspace. The bill provides funding for FAA programs at 99.97 percent \nof the budget request to ensure FAA's operations and safety workforce \nare fully funded, which includes 14,500 air traffic controllers and \nmore than 25,000 engineers, maintenance technicians, safety inspectors, \nand operational support personnel.\n  In addition to aviation safety, the bill provides $50 million in rail \nsafety grants in response to the devastating rail accidents in recent \nyears. These grants will support infrastructure improvements and safety \ntechnology, including positive train control.\n  There are also several provisions to enhance truck safety on our \nNation's highways. For example, the bill requires the Department of \nTransportation to publish a proposed rule on speed governors, which \nlimits the speed at which these trucks can operate. The Department \ncontinues to delay this rulemaking, which was initially petitioned by \nthe industry itself. It is time to get this important safety rule \ncompleted and implemented.\n  The bill also protects critical housing programs by preserving \nexisting rental assistance for vulnerable families and individuals, \nincluding our seniors, and strengthens the Federal response to the \nproblem of youth homelessness. Sufficient funding is provided to keep \npace with the rising cost of housing vulnerable families, ensuring that \nmore than 4.7 million individuals and families currently receiving \nassistance will not have to worry about losing their housing. Without \nthis assistance, many of these families might otherwise become \nhomeless.\n  Youth homelessness is especially troubling and warrants more \nattention. Reflecting this concern, our bill provides $42.5 million to \nexpand efforts to reduce youth homelessness. These efforts build on our \nsuccess in reducing veterans homelessness, which has been reduced by 36 \npercent since 2010. This bill continues that effort by providing an \nadditional 8,000 vouchers for our homeless veterans despite the \nadministration's failure to request funding for this critically \nimportant program.\n  To support local development, we provide $3 billion for the Community \nDevelopment Block Grants Program. This is an extremely popular program \nwith the States and communities because it allows them to tailor the \nFederal funds to support local economic and job creation projects.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to speak about this legislation, and I \nurge my colleagues to support final passage of the omnibus.\n\n\n                       Section 702 in Division O\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, today I wish to discuss section 702 in \ndivision O of the Omnibus appropriations bill. It is a provision that \nwould prohibit the Treasury Department\n\n[[Page S8857]]\n\nfrom selling, transferring or otherwise disposing of the senior \npreferred shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for 2 years.\n  In 2008, Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Federal Housing Finance \nAgency Director James Lockhart placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into \nconservatorship and created an agreement that gave the Treasury \nDepartment senior preferred shares in both entities. Since that time, \nthe GSEs helped stabilize the housing market by ensuring that families \nhad access to 30-year fixed-rate mortgages at reasonable rates and \nlenders had access to a functioning secondary market. While the \ngovernment was initially forced to inject $188 billion into shoring up \nthese two agencies, it has since collected $241 billion. Taxpayers have \nthus earned $53 billion during the conservatorship.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question? \nI am concerned that someone could read the provision as limiting a \nfuture administration's authority to end the conservatorship after the \n2-year prohibition absent congressional action. Does the provision \nprohibit a future administration from taking any action after January \n1, 2018, if it is in the best interest of the housing market, taxpayers \nor the broader economy?\n  Mr. BROWN. I will say to my colleague from New York that it does not. \nThat is not the effect of the language. Any number of decisions could \nbe made after that date, when a new Congress and a new President will \nbe in place. Nor does this provision have any effect on the court cases \nand settlements currently underway challenging the validity of the \nthird amendment. As the Senator from Tennessee said yesterday, ``this \nlegislation does not prejudice'' any of those cases.\n  Mr. REID. I associate myself with the comments of the Senator from \nOhio, Mr. Brown. If it turns out to be in the best interest of \nborrowers, the economy or to protect taxpayers, the next administration \ncould elect to end the conservatorship on January 2, 2018. This is the \nview of the Treasury Department as well. I would like to submit a \nletter written to me on this issue that states that the provision binds \nthe Treasury only until January 1, 2018, and has no effect after that.\n  The agreement for this language to be included in the omnibus was \nthat the prohibition would sunset after 2 years and not create a \nperpetual conservatorship. As then-Secretary Paulson described, \nconservatorship was meant to be a ``time out'' not an indefinite state \nof being.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Treasury letter be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of the remarks by Senator \nBrown.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I thank the Majority Leader. The FHFA and \nTreasury Department could have placed the GSEs into receivership if the \nintent was to liquidate them. The purpose of a conservatorship is to \npreserve and conserve the assets of the entities in conservatorship \nuntil they are in a safe and solvent condition as determined by their \nregulator.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 17, 2015.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: In response to your request for our view, \n     the Treasury Department interprets the language of Section \n     702 of Division O of the Military Construction and Veterans \n     Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016, to \n     mean that subsection (b) imposes a prohibition that is \n     binding until January 1, 2018. It would not be binding after \n     that date.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Anne Wall,\n                      Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs.\n\n\n                                Title IX\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am joined by Senator Thune, the \nchair of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, to \ndiscuss title IX--National Oceans and Coastal Security, of Division O \nof the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. The legislation on which \nthis title was based, the National Oceans and Coastal Security Act, S. \n2025, is a bill I introduced earlier this year, which was referred to \nthe Senate Commerce Committee. I appreciate the assistance Senator \nThune and his committee staff have provided on this legislation.\n  The National Oceans and Coastal Security Act establishes a fund to \nsupport research, conservation, and restoration projects on our coasts \nand in our oceans and Great Lakes. The National Fish and Wildlife \nFoundation and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration--two \norganizations with significant expertise in ocean, coastal, and Great \nLakes issues, as well as managing grants--will coordinate the grant \nprograms supported by the fund.\n  I thank Senator Thune for joining me today to help clarify this \nimportant legislation.\n  As you know, our coastal communities and marine economies depend upon \nhealthy oceans and Great Lakes. The projects supported by this fund \nwill provide the science and on-the-ground action that will help ensure \na healthy environment and vibrant economy for generations to come.\n  Any money appropriated or otherwise made available to the fund will \nbe used to ``support programs and activities intended to better \nunderstand and utilize ocean and coastal resources and coastal \ninfrastructure, including baseline scientific research, ocean \nobserving, and other programs and activities.''\n  Funds may not be used for litigation or advocacy, or the creation of \nnational marine monuments, marine protected areas, marine spatial \nplans, or a National Ocean Policy. It is the intent of the authors that \nno grants be provided through this fund for the creation or federal \nimplementation of any of these programs or policies. With specific \nregard to the National Ocean Policy, its creation has already occurred \nby Executive order, and its implementation is the responsibility of the \nNational Ocean Council. It is the expectation of the authors that no \nfunds would be used to support the activities of the National Ocean \nCouncil.\n  Mr. THUNE. Thank you, Senator Whitehouse, for inviting me to join you \ntoday to discuss the National Oceans and Coastal Security Act. I know \nthe creation of an ocean fund has been a longstanding priority of \nyours.\n  I share Senator Whitehouse's understanding of the eligible uses for \nmoney granted from the fund. It is also worth noting that the National \nFish and Wildlife Foundation, a congressionally chartered nonprofit \norganization, is explicitly prohibited in its authorizing legislation \nfrom providing grants that support litigation or advocacy.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you for making that important point. I would \nlike to further highlight that the legislation authorizes two grant \nprograms. The first would direct funding to coastal States, Indian \ntribes, and U.S. territories. The other would create a national \ncompetitive grant program open to States, local governments, and Indian \ntribes, as well as associations, nongovernmental organizations, public-\nprivate partnerships, and academic institutions to support oceans and \ncoastal research and restoration efforts.\n  Mr. THUNE. Thank you for that clarification.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have a cloture motion at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     concur in the House amendments to the Senate amendment to \n     H.R. 2029, an act making appropriations for military \n     construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related \n     agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and \n     for other purposes.\n         Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, Thom Tillis, Bob Corker, \n           Richard Burr, Lisa Murkowski, Roger F.

I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum \nunder rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There is 2 minutes of debate on this motion.\n\n[[Page S8858]]\n\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield back the time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     concur in the House amendments to the Senate amendment to \n     H.R. 2029, an act making appropriations for military \n     construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related \n     agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and \n     for other purposes.\n         Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, Thom Tillis, Bob Corker, \n           Richard Burr, Lisa Murkowski, Roger F.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to concur in the House amendments to the Senate amendment to \nH.R. 2029 shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of \napplicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections \nof that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of the House \nmessage to accompany H.R. 2029, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes of debate on the motion.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, all I am asking for in raising this \npoint of order--the tax extender legislation will reduce revenues below \nthe fiscal year 2016 budget agreement and would violate section 311. \nAll I am asking for is to separate the votes. If you are proud and you \nwant to vote for the extender, please do so. Voting no on this \nseparates it, so you will have a vote on the extenders and a vote on \nthe omnibus bill. Go home and explain it. There are good things in \nboth. But give us a chance--basically, those who don't agree--and do \nnot take the cowardly way out by putting them all into one. That is all \nwe are doing.\n  If Tom Brokaw writes his new book after ``The Greatest Generation,'' \nwe are going to be the worst generation by saddling this debt on our \nchildren and grandchildren. What we are doing here is something \nunconscionable--2,200 pages all wrapped into one.\n  All I am asking for is a ``no'' vote so we can separate it, go home, \nand explain it. I think we owe that to the people.\n  We are at 16 percent now. We can't go much lower, but we are trying, \nI know\n\n[[Page S8859]]\n\nthat. So I appreciate that very much. I encourage a ``no'' vote on \nthis. We will separate the two, vote them up or down, go home and \nexplain them, and be proud of what we are doing in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, colleagues, this bipartisan package is \nthe biggest tax cut for working families and the biggest anti-poverty \nplan Congress has moved forward in decades, and it is the biggest \nbipartisan tax agreement in 15 years.\n  All together, 50 million Americans are going to benefit from the \nchild tax credit and the expanded earned-income tax credit because they \nare made permanent. And on a permanent basis, students will be able to \ncount on the American opportunity tax credit to cover up to $10,000 of \na 4-year college education. That is a lot of money they won't have to \nborrow.\n  This also includes a permanent tax break for research and \ndevelopment, which for the first time will be available on a widespread \nbasis to help small businesses and startups pay wages--a booster shot \nfor the innovation economy in America. There will be permanent small \nbusiness expensing that is going to help our employers invest and grow.\n  To just wrap up, it will include permanent small business expensing \nto help many employers invest and grow and create new highways and \nhigh-skilled jobs for our people. I believe, finally, this clears the \ndeck for us to move to comprehensive bipartisan tax reform because it \nprovides the breathing room Congress needs to throw the broken Tax Code \ninto the trash can and get bipartisan tax reform.\n  So I urge my colleagues to waive the budget point of order, give \nmillions of families across this country the predictability and \ncertainty they need on their taxes, and put this Congress on a path \ntoward achieving bipartisan comprehensive tax reform in the days ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 1321, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1321) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act to prohibit the manufacture and introduction or \n     delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of rinse-\n     off cosmetics containing intentionally-added plastic \n     microbeads.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, across the country, many State and \nlocal governments, including counties in New York, have moved to ban \nproducts that contain plastic microbeads.\n  Because of their leadership and because of the advocacy from \nscientists and others who have shown us the damage that microbeads can \ndo, Congress came together to unanimously ban plastic microbeads from \nrinse-off cosmetic products.\n  This is a great bill, and it shows that we can pass smart \nenvironmental legislation here in Washington.\n  Plastic microbeads are the tiny pieces of plastic that we often see \nin toothpaste, hand lotion, or various other personal care products.\n  When we brush our teeth and wash our face, most of us don't consider \nthese acts to be harmful in any way.\n  But plastic microbeads are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, which \nmeans they are too small to be captured by the filtration systems in \nour water treatment centers.\n  So these plastic microbeads end up leaching into our lakes, our \nrivers, our streams, our bays, and even our drinking water supplies.\n  It might be surprising that a piece of plastic so small can cause \nsuch outsized damage.\n  But we have heard from a wide range of constituents and business \ngroups that all recognize the damage, and all recommended that Congress \nact to remove plastic microbeads from the marketplace.\n  We have heard it from the fishing industry, from the tourism \nindustry, from the culinary industry. Even the cosmetics industry is \nsupportive of this ban. Many cosmetics companies have already \nvoluntarily stopped using microbeads themselves.\n  When tiny plastic microbeads get into the water, they attract \npollutants that are already in the water, and they concentrate these \npollutants to potentially dangerous levels.\n  Fish don't know what microbeads are, so they eat them and end up \ningesting all of the pollutants stuck on the microbeads.\n  This disrupts the food chain, it contaminates huge portions of the \nwildlife population, and it hurts our commercial and recreational \nfishing industries, because they can't sell--and we can't eat--fish \nthat are filled with toxic plastic.\n  Many of our counties, cities, and States took the lead on this issue, \nand they should be commended for that. But local action isn't enough to \nsolve a nationwide problem like this--not when so many communities in \ndifferent States are connected by the same bodies of water--because no \none is immune when our waterways are contaminated.\n  Congress had a responsibility to act--to stop the flow of microbeads \ninto our waterways.\n  And today we are doing our job in passing this Federal ban on these \nproducts.\n  The Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015 will prohibit the manufacture \nof rinse-off cosmetic products containing plastic microbeads starting \nin 2017 and will ensure that they are off retail shelves by 2018.\n  And while this bill preempts States from regulating rinse-off \nproducts containing plastic microbeads differently from the Federal \nban, individual States will still have the ability to restrict \nmicrobeads in other types of products.\n  Additionally, the preemption language in this bill restricts their \nmanufacture and distribution in interstate commerce and should not \nprevent States or local governments from regulating how microbeads are \ndisposed of under laws such as the Clean Water Act.\n  States can also co-enforce the Federal ban by enacting identical \nlaws.\n  This is a great bipartisan bill. And it is a smart step forward, as \nwe look for new ways to protect our environment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1321) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8861-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8861-S8865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ELECTRIFY AFRICA ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Res. 339) congratulating the University of \n     Iowa College of Law for 150 years of outstanding service to \n     the State of Iowa, the United States, and the world.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their \ncommendation of the 150th anniversary of the University of Iowa College \nof Law. This makes it the first law school west of the Mississippi to \nreach that milestone.\n  In the past 150 years, the college of law has served the people of \nIowa, the Nation, and the world, and I am pleased, along with my \ncolleague Senator Ernst, that the resolution congratulates the college \nof law on its accomplishments.\n  I have been honored to attend some of the events celebrating Iowa Law \nthis past year, and the law school should be proud of its vast history \nof achievement. It is the oldest law school west of the Mississippi \nRiver, and it has produced generations of attorneys who have been \ndedicated to improving and enhancing the practice of law in Iowa and \nthroughout the Nation. Currently, Iowa Law has over 10,000 living \nalumnae who practice in Iowa and around the world.\n  Iowa was the first State to admit a woman to the practice of law. \nIowa Law followed this tradition when in 1873 it graduated what is \nbelieved to be the first female law student in the United States, Mary \nHickey. Iowa Law's second female law student, Mary Haddock, was the \nfirst woman admitted to the practice of law before the district and \ncircuit courts of the United States.\n  Iowa Law was one of the first law schools to grant a degree to an \nAfrican-American student when Alexander Clark, Jr., graduated in 1879--\ndecades before other law schools allowed the enrollment of non-White \nstudents. Iowa Law has always been at the forefront of the legal field, \nparticularly when it comes to diversity.\n  Iowa Law has consistently ranked as one of the top 10 public law \nschools in the country and is currently ranked the 22nd best law school \nin the Nation.\n  Throughout the years, Iowa Law has maintained its commitment to the \nlegal community and encourages students to participate in a variety of \nprograms that better Iowa. For example, Iowa Law recently partnered \nwith the Iowa State Bar Association to start a program that trains and \nrecruits law students to work in rural and smalltown practices, \nproviding better access to legal services in these communities. Iowa \nLaw offers several clinic programs that focus on helping the\n\n[[Page S8866]]\n\ncitizens of Iowa and has several programs to encourage students to \nprovide pro bono legal services.\n  For the past 150 years, Iowa Law has produced lawyers who embody the \nmotto of the State of Iowa, which is ``Our liberties we prize and our \nrights we will maintain.''\n  I congratulate the Iowa College of Law on its many achievements, and \nI am grateful for its continued dedication and commitment to the State \nof Iowa.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Before we adjourn, Mr. President, I want to say a few \nwords of thanks.\n  I would like to thank the members of the Secretary of the Senate's \noffice, which houses everyone from the parliamentarians, to members of \nthe disbursing office, to the clerks, historians, curators, librarians, \nand many other offices and individuals who keep the history and dignity \nof this institution alive.\n  I would like to thank the Sergeant At Arms's office and the many \nhundreds of individuals who do everything from keeping us safe to \nsetting up rooms for meetings.\n  I also thank the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, which works \ndaily to preserve this complex, which is more than just a collection of \nbuildings, it is a living part of our Nation's history.\n  I thank the Capitol Police, who are prepared to put their lives on \nthe line every day to protect everyone who works in and visits the \nCapitol. We are grateful for everything they do.\n  There are so many others to thank, from the committees and their \nstaffs, to the doorkeepers, to the legal counsel's office and the \npages. I know I am going to forget many individuals who deserve our \nthanks. Please know we are thankful for your service and your \ndedication.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of the young people who serve in \nthe Chamber as Senate pages be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                            REPUBLICAN PAGES\n\n       Emma Rose James, Anna Linda Byrd, Anna Carmack, Herbert \n     Coleman Martinson, Elaina Joy Urban, Ben M.

Their counsel is invaluable, and their dedication is without \nequal.\n  Here on the floor, Laura Dove and her Republican Cloakroom staff have \na tough job making things function every single day. Gary Myrick has a \ntough job on the Democratic side as well. They deserve recognition from \nboth sides of the aisle for what they do.\n  I particularly would like to thank my chief of staff, Sharon \nSoderstrom, for her remarkable work ethic and her obvious talent. She \nhas an impressive team behind her. There are so many I can name, but \nthen we would be here all day, so let me say something they already \nknow. I am certainly thankful for what Sharon and her whole team do \nevery single day.\n  I know the Democratic leader feels the same way about his chief, Drew \nWillison, and the members of his staff.\n  Let me acknowledge his kind words yesterday as well. We both have \ndifficult jobs, and, in my view, the Senators can have strong political \ndisagreements without personal animosity always accompanying it. I \nthink many of the 99 other Members of this body agree with that \nsentiment. We can disagree, as we often say, without being \ndisagreeable. That is how this institution is supposed to function, \nafter all.\n  I thank Senators for their service to this institution. We signed up \nfor a rather challenging job. We often have different ideas about what \nserving our constituents means, but, as we have proved so often this \nyear, we can still come together to accomplish important things for our \ncountry on education, transportation, and so many issues, just as we \nsaw again a few minutes ago with passage of a significant cyber \nsecurity measure, long-overdue improvements to the Visa Waiver Program, \ntax relief for families and small businesses, and other important \nmatters.\n  I thanked the chairman of the Finance Committee the other day for his \nimpressive work on the tax side of that legislation. Senator Hatch has \nbeen an invaluable ally working those issues.\n  Passage of the visa waiver reform and cyber security legislation are \nboth notable accomplishments for our country, and neither would have \nbeen possible without the continued hard work of the chairman of the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Ron Johnson. I \nwould like to express sincere gratitude to the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, Richard Burr, for his work on cyber security \ntoo.\n  I know there are many others to thank--the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and the leadership and members of all the \ncommittees who worked many long hours recently in particular.\n  I apologize to those I haven't been able to mention, but I want to \nthank them and to say simply this: I wish you a merry Christmas and a \nhappy new year, and happy holidays to everyone. See you in 2016. Rest \nup because we still have a lot of work to do for the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8866-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8866-S8867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OMNIBUS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, now that the votes have concluded and we \nhave successfully passed our legislation granting tax relief to \nmillions of Americans, I want to take a few minutes to express my \ngratitude.\n  This has been a very long and sometimes difficult process, but it has \nat almost every step been bipartisan and cooperative. I also think the \nresults speak for themselves. This legislation, the PATH Act, will help \nfamilies and job creators and grow our economy. This legislation will \nallow businesses and run-of-the-mill taxpayers to more effectively plan \nfor their future. This legislation will pave the way for comprehensive \ntax reform, and this legislation will relieve the pressure we face \nevery year on tax extenders and end the cliff-or-crisis mentality that \nsurrounds much of our tax policy. It is, quite simply, a win for good \ngovernment--the last of many we have enjoyed in what has been a very \nproductive year here in the Senate.\n  I am pleased to have had the opportunity to work on this important \nbill and am even more pleased to see it finally passed through both the \nHouse and the Senate. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle who worked to make this possible, who set aside partisanship \nand allowed both parties to realize their top priorities in this \nlegislation without seeing it as a loss to their side.\n  Here in the Senate, I, of course, want to thank Senator Wyden, who \nhas been an effective and valuable partner in all of our efforts on the \nFinance Committee this year.\n  I really need to thank all of the members of the Finance Committee \nand their staffs who worked extraordinarily hard on the tax extenders \nissue throughout this entire year.\n  I also thank our distinguished majority leader, who recognized the \nopportunity to get another big accomplishment through the Senate this \nyear and pushed to help us get the substance of the bill in place, and \nhe worked tirelessly to get it across the goal line.\n  Thanks also to our majority whip for leading another successful \neffort to secure the vote and shore up support within our conference.\n\n[[Page S8867]]\n\n  I also thank our distinguished minority leader as well. Although he \nand I are friends, we are quite often in disagreement on issues before \nthe Senate. But in this effort, we were able to find a lot of common \nground, and he worked hard to get us where we needed to be and was \nextremely effective in leading his conference.\n  Over on the other side of the Capitol, I need to thank the chairman \nof the Ways and Means Committee, Kevin Brady. Chairman Brady is pretty \nnew to his position, but he worked as a seasoned veteran in putting \nthis bill together. He is, quite simply, an exceptional and excellent \nlegislator.\n  I thank Speaker Ryan for his work on this as well. He and I have \nworked well together over the past year and enjoyed a lot of victories. \nThis is one of the biggest and most consequential, and I think he would \nagree.\n  I also need to pay tribute to our staffs who put in so much time and \neffort to get this endeavor off the ground and to see it through to the \nfinish. On both sides of the aisle, there have been a lot of late \nnights, early mornings, and neglected families during these final \nweeks. I really can't thank them enough.\n  On my Finance Committee staff, I need to thank our tax team, led as \nalways by the indefatigable Mark Prater, my chief tax counsel and \ndeputy staff director. We all know and love Mark here in the Senate, \nand this bill, like every major tax bill over the last quarter century, \nhas his fingerprints all over it. I need to thank my tax counsel, Jim \nLyons, for spearheading yet another tax extenders effort, along with \nthe rest of the Republican tax team: Preston Rutledge, Jeff Wrase, Tony \nCoughlan, Eric Oman, Christopher Hanna, Nick Wyatt, and Sam Beaver.\n  I also need to thank Jay Khosla, my policy director and chief health \ncounsel for his work on the health care issues we address in this bill \nand for his overall leadership in this process. Also on the health \nside, I want to thank Katie Simeon, one of the best health staffers on \nCapitol Hill. I also want to express particular thanks to Chris \nCampbell--he is my incomparable staff director--for shepherding another \nhigh-profile effort and major success for the Senate Finance Committee.\n  I want to thank other members of my senior team, including Julia \nLawless, Aaron Fobes, and Bryan Hickman for their work in the press and \ncommunications outreach and, of course, in building coalitions. I \nreally do have the best committee staff in Congress, a statement I make \nwithout reservation. But with all due respect to my colleagues and \ntheir staffs, I have to make that statement.\n  On Ranking Member Wyden's staff, I need to thank his tax team, \nparticularly Todd Metcalf, who led the efforts for the other side and \nwas a key liaison with the White House on these issues. Thanks also to \nthe rest of the Democratic tax team: Tiffany Smith, Ryan Abraham, Chris \nArneson, Robert Andres, Kara Getz, Adam Carasso, and Todd Wooten. I \nalso want to than Ranking Member Wyden's health team.\n  From Majority Leader McConnell's office, I want to thank Sharon \nSoderstrom, Hazen Marshall, Brendan Dunn, Scott Raab, Don Stewart, and \nAntonia Ferrier for all they did to help put this bill together, to \nnegotiate the package, and to shore up enough votes to get it done. \nThanks also to Monica Popp and Jane Lee from the majority whip's \noffice. From Minority Leader Reid's office, I want to thank Drew \nWillison, Ellen Doneski, and Kate Leone.\n  Over on the House side, I want to thank Chairman Brady's tax team, \nled by George Callas, and Dave Stewart for their work on this \nlegislation. From Speaker Ryan's staff, I want to thank Austin Smythe \nand Dave Hoppe.\n  Of course, no tax effort is ever completed without the vital \nassistance offered by the staff at the Joint Committee on Taxation. I \nwant to thank JCT's chief of staff, Tom Barthold, and all of his great \nstaff for the long hours they put in to make this sure this bill was \nput together right.\n  Finally, I want to acknowledge the help we got from the Senate \nlegislative counsel's office, particularly from Mark McGunagle, Vince \nGaiani, Allison Otto, and Jim Fransen. Thanks to all of them as well.\n  As you can see, it took a lot of people to put this bill together and \nget it passed. I am sure I have not mentioned everyone who played a \nrole. Once again, I am very pleased to have been a part of this huge \neffort that we have been in a rush to get to this point at the end of \nthe year. I think we all have a chance to reflect on the implications \nof what we have been able to do. We will all recognize the truly \nhistoric nature of this very important piece of tax legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8867-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8867-S8869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PUERTO RICO\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Now, Mr. President, before the Senate adjourns for the \nyear, I want to speak once again on Puerto Rico's financial and \neconomic challenges. Yesterday, we heard frustration from a number of \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle about the fact that the end-\nof-the-year legislative vehicles did not include any changes in \nbankruptcy law to make Puerto Rico eligible for chapter 9 and to allow \nthose to protections to be retroactively applied to its debts.\n  Sadly, we also heard a number of misrepresentations, false claims, \nand statements that effectively impugn Republican motives as we are \nworking to address the Puerto Rican challenges. Boiling it all down, \nsome of my friends on the other side of the aisle argued that \nRepublicans are somehow holding up retroactive chapter 9 eligibility \nfor Puerto Rico in order to protect interests of ``hedge funds''--of \nall things. To back that claim, loose numbers, apparently drawn from \nsome kind of random number generator were put forward, claiming that \nhedge funds hold maybe anywhere between 15 to perhaps 50 percent of \nPuerto Rico's outstanding debt of over $73 billion.\n  Conveniently, they did not go into great lengths to define the term \n``hedge funds,'' making it pretty easy to throw numbers around without \na clear link to any real discernable facts. Nonetheless, even if so-\ncalled hedge funds held 50 percent of Puerto Rico's debt, the remaining \n50 percent is held by others, including millions of retirees and near-\nretirees spread across our country and in Puerto Rico itself. That \nincludes mom-and-pop investors in Florida, the State of Washington, \nConnecticut, Illinois, Utah, and every other State, and in Puerto Rico \nitself.\n  Of course, those complicating facts do not seem to matter to some of \nmy friends who claim that anyone not in favor of immediately chapter 9 \neligibility for Puerto Rico must be a shill for hedge funds. That is \ntotal bull.\n  They should tell that to the retiree who, once bankruptcy proceedings \nresult in reduced payments on bonds issued with the understanding and \nexpectation that current law would apply to debt being issued, would \nwake up to the news that their nest egg had suddenly taken a hit. Of \ncourse, those middle-class investors, the millions that aren't wealthy \nventure capitalists, would likely not be aware that their modest \nportfolio took that hit because some Senators have lumped them into \nsome vaguely defined category of rich fat cats who don't deserve the \nprotections of the law.\n  If we are going to have the debate about these issues, we are going \nto need to specify exactly what we are talking about, not only with \nregard to who will actually be impacted by the proposed bankruptcy \nchange, but also about what the change would actually do. Yesterday, \nmany of my friends on the other side suggested here on the floor that \nRepublicans are simply denying tools to Puerto Rico that are currently \navailable to municipalities in all 50 States. However, that is a \nmisrepresentation. My colleagues are not simply demanding that Puerto \nRico be given access to chapter 9 restructuring authority for fresh \ndebt offerings. They want that authority, plus an additional allowance \nfor Puerto Rico to retroactively apply chapter 9 to debts already \nissued. That is for debts issued under current conditions that \nexplicitly do not allow for application of chapter 9, which lenders \ntook into account when formulating the terms of their contracts with \nPuerto Rico.\n  Our friends want to change the rules after that fact--or those facts. \nThat is not, in the words of one of my colleagues, ``the very same \ntools that are available to municipalities in all 50 States.'' That is \na post-hoc change to lending conditions which carry far more serious \nrule-of-law implications\n\n[[Page S8868]]\n\nthan my friends want to acknowledge. No matter, they say; those pesky \nrule-of-law concerns are almost irrelevant.\n  Lenders, according to my colleagues, knew perfectly well that rules \nof the lending transaction can be changed by the Federal Government \nafter the fact. Lenders, they say, know that the Federal Government can \nstep in and expropriate wealth and change conditions of an agreement \nafter expectations have been formed and the conditions of the \ntransactions have been agreed upon.\n  Well, the Federal Government can do many things, I suppose. But that \ndoes not ensure that what it does is good policy, nor does it mean that \nanyone entering into any contract should build into the terms and \nexpectation that Congress, simply because it can, will step in and \nchange the rules midstream. Yet my friends on the other side have \ncasually and even flippantly suggested that all of Puerto Rico's \ncreditors knew, or at least should have known, that the laws governing \ntheir debt transactions are subject to change at any time.\n  In any event, who cares? After all, according to my friends, we are \nonly talking about a bunch of rich hedge fund managers.\n  I think every Senator here representing every State in the Union \nshould care. If it is what the majority wants, we can go ahead and cast \naside expectations on credits already issued. But we should then, at \nthe very least, be willing to consider that such actions will alter \nexpectations of creditors moving forward.\n  That could easily mean higher costs of borrowing to every \nmunicipality in every State of the Union, and in every territory. These \nare not itty-bitty things. That would include Puerto Rico, Utah, \nFlorida, the State of Washington, New Jersey, Connecticut, Illinois, \nand all of the rest. Even with all of these obvious yet unaddressed \nconsiderations, my friends yesterday decried that chapter 9 authority \nwas not being granted to Puerto Rico this week.\n  Yet in discussions I have had with Democrats in Congress and with \nadministration officials, chapter 9 is not even what they really want, \nnor is it applicable. What they really want and what they have made \nclear to me is something far broader, which would not only give \nmunicipalities in Puerto Rico access to chapter 9, but also a brand new \nbankruptcy authority created out of whole cloth, which encompasses all \nof Puerto Rico's $73 billion or more of debt and includes pension \nobligations of well over $40 billion.\n  These are serious problems. You cannot flippantly think they are \nsolved just by passing a law. That is not chapter 9, by the way; it is \nall new bankruptcy authority. That new authority, which is not what \nDemocratic Senators talked about on the floor yesterday, also includes \n``general obligation'' debt of Puerto Rico, which enjoys special \nprotection under Puerto Rico's own constitution, which is apparently of \nlittle consequence to my friends' agenda.\n  The question I have is, If we are going to get in the business of \nignoring rule-of-law issues and creating fresh new bankruptcy law and \nprovisions for a U.S. territory--which does not have that, neither do \nthe other territories--why would not heavily indebted States start to \nbelieve that we should do exactly the same for them? More importantly, \nwhy would creditors not start to believe that as well?\n  These moral hazard problems do not seem to be an issue for my \nfriends, which, in my view, is both disappointing and reflective of \nsome fundamental misunderstandings of the working of expectations in \ncredit markets. Let's be clear: I share the frustration of my dear \nfriends on the other side of the aisle when it comes to Puerto Rico but \nprobably for different reasons. I have been working to find ways to \naddress Puerto Rico's challenges throughout the year, not just in the \npast couple of weeks. We have been working to do so in a bipartisan \nway. I have come to the floor and committed on the record to working in \ngood faith with my colleagues toward finding a solution. I am working \nand will continue to do so.\n  Today, I am somewhat frustrated. Since August of this year, many \nothers and I have been asking for audit financial statements from the \nGovernment of Puerto Rico. Despite assurances that we would receive \nthem, we have not. We have been repeatedly told, and were reminded \nyesterday, that there is or will be a humanitarian crisis in Puerto \nRico because of indebtedness and a health system in crisis.\n  Yet, despite my numerous inquiries, I have heard little from health \nofficials in the administration. What I have heard is that the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services seems to be gathering data, \nanalyzing the facts, and may be ready to make some administrative \nchanges in a year or two--maybe. In the face of what we are told is a \nhumanitarian crisis, you would think that health officials would have \nat least had an urgent meeting or two with relevant committees of \njurisdiction here in Congress. Unfortunately, to my knowledge--and I am \nthat relevant chairman here in the Senate--there has been no such \noutreach.\n  Similarly, you would think that those in Congress and the \nadministration who are putting forward proposals to grant more health \nfunding for Puerto Rico would acknowledge the costs of their proposals, \nparticularly given the numerous inquiries I have made in that regard. \nYou would also think they would let us know upfront whether they want \nto offset any of those costs, and if they do, how they plan to do so.\n  I have asked, but I have gotten no response. I have also asked \nadministration officials how much is needed for health system relief \nand what they have in mind when they say it should be provided in a \n``fiscally responsible'' way. I have not gotten an answer.\n  I worry that parties, including the Government of Puerto Rico, have \nnot made sufficient efforts to arrive at a negotiated debt \nrestructuring with creditors, despite encouragement from me and others \nto get to work. Throughout the year, I have offered to work with anyone \nwho wants to help the people of Puerto Rico to find a solution. I have \nworked productively and will continue to do so with administration \nofficials.\n  I have had constructive meetings with many Puerto Ricans, including \nthe current Governor and others. I have had gracious visits and offers \nof productive collaboration from interested House Members, including \nRepresentatives Velazquez, Serrano, Gutierrez, and Pierluisi. I want \nthat to continue. Many of us are intent on persevering and continuing \nto arrive at solutions.\n  Even with incomplete information on Puerto Rico's finances and the \nreluctance of administration health officials to engage, I have joined \nwith Senators Murkowski and Grassley to put forward tools, funding, and \ntax relief to help to begin to address what we know about Puerto Rico's \nchallenges.\n  Our bill provides tax relief to workers, tools--but no mandates--to \nhelp put pensions on a sustainable path, and oversight and assistance \nin budgeting, transparent accounting, planning, and attainment of \nfiscal sustainability. All told, our bill puts forward more than $7 \nbillion of relief without costing Federal personal taxpayers a dime. \nLet me repeat that--more than $7 billion of relief.\n\n  In the interest of bipartisanship, the bill was put forward without \nprovocation of sensitivities of my friends on the other side of the \naisle concerning things such as labor laws, shipping laws, and the \nlike. Nonetheless, the bill was not included in the end-of-year \nlegislative vehicles that we voted on today, just as the Democrats' \nsuper chapter 9 proposal was not included.\n  Yet if you listened to some of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle yesterday, you probably walked away with the notion that my \nRepublican colleagues and I are simply shilling for a bunch of hedge \nfund speculators. You probably thought we were holding up a simple and \nfair application of tools that everyone else has to adjust and \nrestructure debt that will not cost the Federal Government anything. \nYou were probably also surprised to learn that Republicans don't even \nrealize that Puerto Ricans are American citizens. I am not making that \nup. One of my colleagues actually said that. We all know those claims \nwere--to be more blunt than I typically like to be--a bunch of baloney.\n  Speaking for myself, I can only say that if I am shilling for anyone \non this issue, it is for the people of Puerto Rico and not for \nspeculators, hedge funds, unions or standing in political\n\n[[Page S8869]]\n\npolls. I am not preventing access to tools everyone else has because \nthat is not even what my colleagues are asking for. Not only do I \nrealize that Puerto Ricans are American citizens, I believe the people \nof Puerto Rico are valuable and cherished fellow Americans, not \npolitical pawns.\n  In closing, while others may wish to engage in political dart-\nthrowing exercises, I am not interested, and I believe it is a \ndisservice to the people of Puerto Rico, who deserve our continued \nefforts. I intend to continue working with anyone who wants to work \nwith me to arrive at tools, support, and assistance that will help the \npeople of Puerto Rico--not particular politicians or interest groups \nhere or on the island. My goal, and the goal of anyone who wants to \nkeep working with me or join me anew, is simple: help the people of \nPuerto Rico and help get Puerto Rico on a path to fiscal \nsustainability, economic growth and stability, and greater efficiency \nin government.\n  We can do it. I am dedicated to doing it, and we have given them the \nbenefits so they can carry this over until the end of February, maybe \ninto March, while we try to work on what it really should be, a very \ngood resolution of these problems. In the meantime, I hope Puerto Rico \nwill get us their financials--their audited financials. That would be \nof great help to us. We have given some time here now because it was \nimpossible to put together a major bill on this matter and have \neverybody support it. So we have given time, we think we can get this \ndone, and I intend to get it done one way or another the best we \npossibly can so Puerto Rico isn't just helped, it will be helped to go \ninto the future, and Puerto Ricans who have had to leave that territory \nfor jobs will want to return and be members of the citizenry of Puerto \nRico again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue).

Mr. President, while Senator Hatch is still on the floor, \nI thank and congratulate him on his work with regard to the tax \nprovisions we just voted on. I am a proud member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee. Senator Wyden and Senator Hatch, working together in the \nbest tradition of the Senate, were able to bring out an incredibly \nimportant bill that will add predictability to our Tax Code and to \nprovide, I think, the right incentives for growth.\n  I thank the Senator for the work, and I am proud to serve on the \nFinance Committee.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield for a comment.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I am pleased to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator. He is one of the really good people \nin this body. I am so grateful he is on the Senate Finance Committee. \nWe have a lot of good people in this body, but the Senator from \nMaryland is one of my favorite people. He works hard, he is very \narticulate, he is very intelligent, and although he is too liberal for \nme, he works hand-in-glove with the rest of us on the committee to make \nthings work. Frankly, if I were from Maryland, I would probably be as \nliberal as he is. All I can say is that he is a great man to work with, \nhe is a great man in the Senate, and I happen to care a great deal for \nhim.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Once again, I thank my friend from Utah. We share a lot \nof the same objectives for a strong nation and moving our country \nforward. I think that is reflected in the bill we just voted on, the \nOmnibus appropriations bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8869-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF TOWSON UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN.

I must \nadmit I have a direct interest in Towson. My mother graduated from \nTowson University. My wife Myrna graduated from Towson University, and \nMyrna today is the chair of the board of visitors of Towson University.\n  It is a great institution. It started as the primary institution for \neducating our teachers and now has expanded to be one of the great \nuniversities in our State, attracting students from the entire \nuniversity in a variety of programs.\n  We are very proud of its 150-year history and we know it has a very \nbright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8869-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8869-S8871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OMNIBUS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to talk for a few minutes about the \nOmnibus appropriations bill and tax bills that we just passed. I am \nvery proud to have supported it. We have finally passed a budget for \nthis year, giving predictability to our agencies and providing \npredictability for those who depend upon the government as a partner or \nfor services.\n  The alternative would have been another continuing resolution, which \nfreezes in last year's priorities at last year's level. Now we have \nelevated appropriations with this year's priorities. The other \nalternative could have been sequestration, which is mindless, across-\nthe-board cuts, saying that every priority in government is the same--\nwhen it is not.\n  We have avoided the worst consequence, that is, a government shutdown \nthat we have seen happen in the past. So we should be very pleased the \npolitical system has worked and we have been able to pass a full-year \nappropriations bill with current priorities at a reasonable level.\n  I am also pleased we were able to pass the tax legislation Chairman \nHatch talked about. The alternative to that would have been another \nshort-term extension of the expiring tax provisions. We saw last year \nthat we did that with 2 weeks remaining in the year, and it expired on \nDecember 31, 2 weeks later. Now we have given--many of the permanent \nprovisions give long-term predictability, and we have even approved the \ntax provisions to make them more efficient. That is good news.\n  Then we have acted on many important issues from dealing with the \nextension of benefits to the first responders, to the attack on our \ncountry on September 11, to the extension of reform of the IMF--\nInternational Monetary Fund--to authorizing some very important \nprograms, including the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a 3-year \nauthorization that provides $450 million in this year, $144 million \nabove current appropriations. That is all good news, and we list many \nmore important accomplishments in this important legislation.\n  I must tell you there are some disappointments. One of the major \ndisappointments is that we didn't follow regular order. It would have \nbeen much better to pass each of the appropriations bills, to have the \ntax bill considered as an independent bill, and have these other \nissues--and to have done it in an orderly way rather than looking at it \nDecember 18. So I would hope that in the future we will return to \nregular order, where we have, I think, a better chance of improving \nlegislation with participation from all Members.\n  Secondly, I was very disappointed that included in this legislation \nwas the lifting of the ban on oil exports, energy exports. The reason I \nam so upset about that is I think that should have been a separate \nissue. It should have been taken up in consideration with the energy \npolicies of America, our environmental policies of America, our \nenvironmental policies, the economic impact, and the security impact. \nWe should have had a chance to debate that issue as a separate issue. \nIt is far too important to our energy security and our energy policy in \nthis country.\n  Another concern I have--and let me point this out--I supported the \npackage. I supported the tax provisions. The tax provisions will be \nscored as losing $680 billion over the next 10 years. I think that is \nsomewhat misleading. I am going to be perfectly blunt about it. If you \ntake out existing policy--this is the current policy in our Tax Code--\nthat actually costs us about 10 percent of that $680 billion, but that \nis still a substantial amount of money. I think it would have been far \nbetter to deal with these issues in a long-term budget agreement that \ndealt with the revenue needs of our country, dealt with our \ndiscretionary spending targets moving forward, as well as mandatory \nspending. That is what we should do rather than taking this up in \npiecemeal and now making it a little more difficult\n\n[[Page S8870]]\n\nbecause the revenue projections are going to be less than they were \nbefore.\n  On the Omnibus Appropriations Act, on the Democratic side, I thank my \ncolleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski. What a great job she did on \nour side; Thad Cochran on the Republican side. Senator Mikulski is my \nseat mate. She is my colleague from Maryland. We are so proud that we \nhave given you one of the great leaders in the Senate, and that was \ndemonstrated on the Omnibus appropriations bill that we voted on just a \nlittle while ago.\n  From my State of Maryland, we are particularly pleased that so many \nof the military installations and Federal agencies that are in our \nState will get the resources--the predictable resources--to carry out \ntheir very important mission. We are proud of the role Maryland plays \nin our national defense with military installations such as from Fort \nMeade to Fort Detrick, from Aberdeen Proving Ground to Patuxent River, \nAndrews to Indian Head, Walter Reed naval. We have major facilities \nlocated in our State and now they will have a predictable budget to \ncarry out their critically important mission of national defense.\n  On the civilian side, we have many important agencies located in our \nState that now will have the resources they need in order to carry out \ntheir mission. I could mention so many, but if I might, the Census \nBureau will get a $282 million increase in their budget to start \nplanning for the next census. NIH will get a $2 billion increase. That \nis the largest increase they have received since 2003. The work they do \nis lifesaving. The appropriations bill will save lives in the United \nStates and around the world and will create jobs because, as we know, \nthe basic research done at NIH is so critically important to our \neconomic growth.\n  I am pleased that in Woodlawn, in Baltimore, the Social Security \nAdministration will get $150 million for badly needed renovations of \ntheir facilities. That is important for them to carry out their \ncritical role of providing the administration of the Social Security \nAct for our seniors, for our disabled, and for those who depend upon \nthe Social Security Administration.\n  There are so many areas I could talk about. The victims of domestic \nviolence will receive the resources they need to carry out our \ncommitment of the law we passed. There are certain challenges we have \nin our community. The heroin epidemic is affecting every State in our \ncountry, and this appropriations act will provide resources to deal \nwith that. I am particularly pleased that in dealing with drug issues, \nthe high-intensity drug-trafficking area, the Baltimore-Washington \ncorridor will receive the resources they need in order to deal with the \nchallenges.\n  Our Nation's infrastructure benefits from this legislation. I am \nparticularly pleased that Metro in the Washington area will receive the \nnext installment of the $150 million that is a part of the $1.5 billion \ncommitment, legislation I authored with the help of our regional \ncolleagues. That commitment will stand firm.\n  We know the Washington metropolitan transit system is the Nation's \ntransit system, and so many of our Federal workers depend upon it in \norder to be able to get to work. Amtrak, $1.4 billion, is critically \nimportant to the entire country. We are particularly dependent upon \nAmtrak in the Northeast. The Baltimore Harbor will receive significant \nsupport. Those are jobs maintaining our harbor. Poplar Island, which is \none of the environmentally friendly dredge sites, will get $26.5 \nmillion.\n  I have spoken on the floor many times to talk about the Chesapeake \nBay and the Federal partnership with the Chesapeake Bay. I was in the \nState legislature when we started their program, and $73 million is \ngoing to be directly appropriated as the Federal portion for the \nChesapeake Bay Program. There are additional funds, such as $2.2 \nmillion, for the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail.\n  There is $1.97 million for Chesapeake Bay oyster recovery, $2 million \nfor the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network. So there are \nresources here that carry out the Federal Government's commitment. \nEvery President in recent times has acknowledged that the Chesapeake \nBay is a national treasure, the largest estuary in our hemisphere, and \nthese funds will help live up to the commitment.\n  I am particularly pleased that under agriculture, the Regional \nConservation Partnership Program that we started last year under the \nleadership of Senator Stabenow is funded. The Chesapeake Bay region \nwill receive funds under that program to help in our efforts for \npreserving the Chesapeake Bay.\n  In the western part of my State, the Appalachian Regional Commission \nis critically important for economic growth. They receive an additional \n$56 million of funds. To me, that is extremely important for the \ndevelopment in the rural part of my State in western Maryland.\n  During the passage of the Affordable Care Act, I authored and was \npleased to see that we established a National Institute on Minority \nHealth and Health Disparities at NIH. It acknowledged the fact that we \nhave not done historically everything we need to do to deal with the \ndisparities in our health care system. This year we are appropriating \nan additional $9 million to the Institute. I think that continues our \ncommitment to make sure that we deal with all Americans' health needs.\n  Last year, I brought before the Congress a request that we do \nsomething to deal with the Holocaust survivors who are still alive and \nin the United States. They are at a very delicate age and very fearful \nof being institutionalized. This budget provides $2.5 million to deal \nwith that vulnerable population.\n  I have been a strong supporter of--and at one time I chaired--the \nMaryland Legal Services Corporation. I have been urging us to try to \nstop falling behind in our commitment for the Legal Services \nCorporation. More and more people are being denied access to our legal \nsystem because of the failure of Congress to appropriate adequate \nfunds. I am very pleased that in this budget an extra $10 million is \nappropriated to the Legal Services Corporation.\n  I think my colleagues are aware of the challenges we have had in \nBaltimore. I am very pleased that the Obama administration, through its \nagencies, has made resources available to Baltimore and other urban \ncenters to deal with opportunity for all communities and to restore the \nconfidence between law enforcement and community. This budget moves \nforward on those commitments--from body cameras for police to helping \nlaw enforcement deal with ending racial profiling, to the Byrne grant \nfunds--and over $476 million is available. And community and youth \nopportunities are in this budget as well. The Byrne grant was one-half \nbillion dollars. As to community youth opportunities, this is a budget \nthat will help us deal with the problems in our urban centers.\n  I have taken the floor on several occasions to talk about our Federal \nworkforce and how our Federal workforce has made incredible sacrifices \nduring these tough budget years. Although they didn't cause the \ndeficit, they have been called upon over and over to contribute by \nbeing denied pay raises, by being asked to pay more for their pension, \nby being asked to carry on more responsibilities with less personnel.\n  This budget is a reprieve from the past budgets. There is no punitive \naction against our Federal workforce, and I am pleased for that. It \nprovides a modest pay adjustment of 1.3 percent. It provides protection \non the data breach that occurred under the cyber attack that affected \nour Federal workforce--protection for 10 years with a $5 million \nprotection. That is within this budget act as well. And we give them \nmore resources and more personnel to support and carry out their \nmission.\n  On the national security front, I have already talked about the \nsupport for our military installations. I am particularly pleased that \nthe FBI will receive a $390 million downpayment on a consolidated \nfacility. The FBI today is located in 30 different facilities, and \ntheir main headquarters, the Hoover Building, is not adequate to meet \nthe challenges they have today. All of us have expressed our concern \nabout homeland security, about homegrown radicalization of our \npopulation. The FBI needs the facilities in order to keep the homeland \nsafe and keep us safe. This is a $390 million downpayment on a fully \nconsolidated facility for the FBI.\n\n[[Page S8871]]\n\n  A few weeks ago I wrote a letter with 27 of our colleagues to our \nleadership, urging them that this Omnibus appropriations bill should \nnot be the place for so-called policy riders. I heard Senator Mikulski \ntalk about it during her comments. We were concerned that we were \ntrying to legislate on an appropriation bill without the authorizing \ncommittees doing the work they are supposed to do. I am very pleased \nthat most of these riders were excluded. So we are not going to be \ntalking about potentially damaging provisions that could have been \nincluded in here--from restricting Planned Parenthood to affecting the \nclean water of this Nation, to affecting the ability of America to \nrespond to the challenges of climate change, to dealing with protection \nof our workforce through labor laws, to public safety with restrictions \nthat could have been put on gun safety legislation, to dealing with our \nrefugees. All those areas and many more were subject to policy riders \nthat could have been included in this omnibus budget but were not.\n  On the tax front, I have already thanked Senator Wyden and Senator \nHatch. I am very pleased that we were able to do some very important \nthings in the tax provisions. We got renewable fuels for wind and solar \nextended and improved, particularly for solar. I think this will make a \nhuge difference. But let me just quote from the Bloomberg New Energy \nFinance, or BNEF, report.\n\n       In the short term, the deal will speed up the shift from \n     fossil fuels more than the global climate deal struck this \n     month in Paris, and more than [the] Clean Power Plan that \n     regulates coal plants. . . . This is exactly the sort of \n     bridge the industry needed. The costs of installing wind and \n     solar power have dropped precipitously. . . . By the time the \n     new tax credit expires, solar and wind will be the cheapest \n     forms of new electricity in many States across the U.S.\n\n  So these are significant. Am I satisfied? No. I would like to see \nthem stronger, particularly wind. I thought wind could have been \nstronger. But I think we have made significant progress in dealing with \nrenewables, which is what we have to do from the point of energy \nsecurity, as well as our environment and as well as our economy. Having \na more diversified energy portfolio and being more energy secure will \nhelp our environment, will help our economy, and will help our national \nsecurity.\n  On the tax side, I was very pleased that we were able to make \npermanent several of the tax provisions that are critically important \nto families in the United States. We were able to make the child tax \ncredit permanent, the earned-income tax credit permanent, and the \nAmerican opportunity tax credit for higher education costs permanent.\n  Transit parity. Transit parity is where those--particularly Federal \nworkers--who use the transit system to come to work don't bring their \ncars. We subsidize greatly the parking lots and the ability of people \nto bring cars to work. When they take transit, they are helping us, and \nwe have now made permanent the full limit on deductibility of the \ntransit benefits. So that is a major step forward. I am very pleased \nthat we were able to make that permanent. I thank Senator Schumer who \ntook the lead on that, and I was proud to work with him on that.\n  The low-income housing tax credit improvements that allow it to be \nmore effective in its use were made permanent. Conservation needs were \nmade permanent, and the S corporation improvements, which help small \nbusinesses, were made permanent. There is a lot here that we don't have \nto worry about this next December or two Decembers from now or even \nfive Decembers from now, saying: Gee, are they going to expire?\n  Now, we do have some success from 5-year reauthorizations. That does \ngive us predictability and allows us to move forward. The new markets \ntax credits are extended for 5 years. The new market tax credits have \nbeen critically important for development in my State of Maryland. I \ncould take you to East Baltimore where you see redevelopment occurring. \nThe new markets tax credits are responsible for that. I could take you \nto Maryland, close to here, in Prince George's County and Montgomery \nCounty, and to the work they are doing there. So these are very \nimportant tools that help create jobs, and we now have more \npredictability.\n  Then we have the 2-year extenders, including the energy efficiency \nthat I led the effort on.\n  So the bottom line is we now have much greater predictability.\n  Let me comment just very briefly as the ranking member on the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee. I am certainly pleased, when we look at \nthe budget that has been brought forward and passed now, for our \nforeign development assistance. I am pleased that we have the support \nfor Israel included in this package and the economic aid for Ukraine.\n  As to refugee assistance, one of the great humanitarian crises of our \ntime, funds are in here for the United States to work with our \ninternational partners to provide for refugee assistance.\n  There are many anti-corruption initiatives. There is $2.5 billion in \nthis budget for good governance and to advance human rights globally--a \nhigh priority of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, working with \nSenator Corker. The two of us are working very closely together to make \nit clear that we won't tolerate corruption and that we will continue to \nwork as countries develop good governance and respect for human rights.\n  As I said earlier, on the overall plan there are a couple issues in \nthis budget that I am very disappointed about. One is the Visa Waiver \nProgram, the discriminatory provisions against dual citizens. I don't \nthink it has anything to do with safety. I don't think we are safer \nbecause we are going to make dual citizens go through a separate \nprocess. And it will cause, I think, actions by our allies that will be \ncounterproductive to Americans and could have some unintended \nconsequences. That shouldn't have been in this legislation.\n  I also think the restrictions on the closing of Guantanamo Bay are \nmisguided. Guantanamo Bay should have been closed a long time ago, and \nI regret that those restrictions are continuing in place.\n  The bottom line is that I am very proud that we passed the omnibus \nbill. I supported it enthusiastically. I think it represents a \ncompromise of the political balance of our Nation. We have resolved \nmany policy challenges. We provided predictability to our agencies and \npredictability to policies that help private investment and our economy \ngrow. It advances a cleaner environment, security of our homeland, \neducation and welfare of our citizens, Americans' ability to compete \nglobally.\n  It deserves our support, and I am glad to see that it was passed. \nShortly, it will be signed by the President and will be the law of this \nland.\n  I note there are other colleagues here. So let me just very briefly \nask to speak on a different issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8871-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8871-S8872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, earlier today I took the floor. Senator \nCruz was here, and he raised an objection to a unanimous consent \nrequest that I had not yet made. I am not going to make that unanimous \nconsent request, but I am going to mention, as the ranking member of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee--and our Presiding Officer is \none of the distinguished members of the committee--that there are 14 \nnominations that have been approved by the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, some a long time ago, by unanimous vote. These are not \ncontroversial nominations. Each of the individuals is well qualified \nfor the position. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, under the \nleadership of Senator Corker, reported these nominations out in a very \ntimely way. Each of those in their own position is critically important \nto our national security. Having a confirmed ambassador in a country is \ncritically important to our national security. Having the No. 4 person \nat the State Department confirmed is critically important in \nnegotiating security issues.\n  It is our responsibility to take these nominees up and to act on them \nand to confirm them so that we can have confirmed positions.\n  I will just mention a few. As I said, I had given notice that I would \nask unanimous consent, and Senator Cruz indicated that he would object \nand actually came to the floor to object. But we have to get this done. \nThe reason we are not voting has nothing to do\n\n[[Page S8872]]\n\nwith these individuals--nothing, not one thing. These are qualified \npeople. They are being held up for reasons unrelated to their important \nresponsibilities to our country.\n  Thomas Shannon, a career person, to the position of Under Secretary \nof State for Political Affairs. This is the point person who negotiates \nglobally.\n  Brian Egan to the position of State Department Legal Adviser. We all \nhave questions on a lot of the legal issues on foreign policy, and yet \nwe won't confirm a career person who has given his career to public \nservice.\n  David Robinson to the positions of Assistant Secretary of State for \nConflict and Stabilization Operations and Coordinator for \nReconstruction and Stabilization. This is a person who we need to deal \nwith a lot of the human rights issues.\n  John Estrada to the post of U.S. Ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago. \nDrug trafficking--we need a confirmed ambassador. For months and months \nand months they have been on the calendar and no action.\n  Azita Raji to be Ambassador to Sweden and Samuel Heins to be \nAmbassador to Norway, our Scandinavian friends.\n  I was at the State Department this week for the holiday reception \nwith the heads of missions that are stationed in \nWashington. Ambassadors from other countries came up to me and said: \nWill we get a confirmed ambassador? It is affecting America's security \nand reputation, and we need to have confirmed ambassadors. Norway has \ngone 2 years without a confirmed ambassador. We have a person who is \neminently qualified. There is no objection to Samuel Heins being \nconfirmed. Yet we can't get a vet on the floor of the Senate because an \nindividual Senator is objecting. That is wrong. We have a \nresponsibility to act.\n\n  David McKean to be Ambassador of Luxembourg, Cassandra Butts to be \nAmbassador to the Bahamas--that is eight of the total number who are \nbeing held that I mentioned. As I said, I intended to make the \nunanimous consent requests. Senator Cruz has already come to the floor \nto object. I regret that.\n  I urge my colleagues to work out their problems, but do it in a \ntimely way and don't hold America hostage, because that is what you are \ndoing by not confirming these appointments. You are not holding the \nObama administration hostage; you are holding America hostage. Who is \nhurt by not having a confirmed ambassador in Norway? There are \nAmericans who get hurt who depend upon our relationship with Norway. \nThere is a diaspora in the United States that is affected by not having \na confirmed ambassador to Norway or to Sweden or to the other countries \nthat we have not been able to get a confirmed ambassador.\n  I urge my colleagues who have problems to enjoy the holiday, get some \nrest, and come back here ready to vote because I think that is what we \nwere elected to do. I urge my colleagues to allow us, when we come back \nin January, to have votes on these very qualified people who are \nserving our country and are prepared to serve our country in a more \nsignificant way.\n  Mr. President, I wish all my colleagues a very happy holiday season.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to speak for a moment about a \ngreat man and a wonderful friend of mine. His name is Ray Pfeifer, and \nhe is an incredible leader and an inspiration to many, myself included.\n  Ray was a New York City firefighter for 27 years and 220 days, by his \ncount. He called it the best job in the world, and he said he was proud \nto put on the uniform. But Ray had to retire last September--years \nbefore he wanted to--because he has cancer. His cancer has spread \nthroughout his body--to his ribs, his leg, and now to his brain.\n  We know that cancer can strike randomly, sometimes with nothing to \nblame, but there is nothing random about Ray Pfeifer's cancer. Ray now \nhas cancer because he was a first responder at Ground Zero, because he \nwas one of thousands who rushed to help after we were attacked on 9/11. \nHe served in Engine 40, Ladder 35, in the 9th Battalion, and most of \nthe members of his battalion were killed on 9/11. Ray spent months on \nthe pile searching for his friends. He wouldn't leave. He spent months \ndigging for bodies in the rubble. He spent months there, breathing in \nhorrible, toxic air that hung over Ground Zero like a deadly mist.\n  Many Members of the Senate would actually recognize Ray because he \nhas been down here so many times--dozens of times--working the Halls of \nCongress, asking Senators to do the right thing and support the 9/11 \nbill. He was a strong, smiling man in uniform, traveling in his \nwheelchair from office to office, with contagious optimism and \nunmatched grace. Ray Pfeifer has never wavered. He has never been \ndeterred. He has never even given up his efforts to pass the 9/11 \nhealth program. But you must know, Ray was never doing this for \nhimself; he was doing it so other first responders didn't have to.\n  Ray wanted to be here today to see this bill passed because he had \nworked so long and so hard, but last week Ray had to go back to the \nhospital because his cancer had spread to his brain. Ray is physically \nin New York right now, but Ray's indomitable spirit is with us in the \nCapitol. His strength is with us. His unmistakable grace is with us.\n  Ray, I know you are listening. We never ever could have gotten this \ndone without you. You did it. But I must tell you, Ray, this speech \nisn't for you; this speech is for your wife Caryn and your son Terrance \nand your daughter Taylor.\n  Terrance was actually sworn in as a New York City firefighter earlier \nthis year, just like his dad. This speech is for them because they \nshared you with all of us. This speech is for all the responders who \nfought for all these years so that our 9/11 heroes could have the \nhealth care for the rest of their lives.\n  The city of New York and the United States of America owe Ray and his \nfamily a debt of gratitude that can never truly be paid. Ray is the \nembodiment of everything we strive to be as Americans: selfless, kind, \nbrave, optimistic, someone who fights for what is right and never gives \nin.\n  Ray, I know you are a fighter, and I know you will get through this. \nYou have the prayers of more people than you know, and may God bless \nyou and your family. I look forward to celebrating this hard-fought \nvictory in person with you soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8872-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8872-S8874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FRANK R. LAUTENBERG CHEMICAL SAFETY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ACT\n\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, last night was a historic moment in the \nSenate. After years and years of negotiations and collaboration, after \nworking with stakeholders across the country, we made tremendous \nprogress toward historic, bipartisan environmental reform. The Frank R. \nLautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act passed the Senate \non a unanimous voice vote, with 60 bipartisan cosponsors and with \noverwhelming support. This is a great milestone.\n  First, I want to thank Senator Vitter. Senator Vitter and I \nintroduced this legislation for one basic reason: to fix our Nation's \nbroken chemical safety law. I remember that over 2 years ago we had a \nvery quiet dinner, and we walked away from that dinner saying: We are \ngoing to form a team, and we are going to get this done. It was after \nFrank Lautenberg had passed away, and Senator Vitter is a man of his \nword. We stuck to it, and we are making significant historic progress. \nI thank him for that.\n  There were times when the bill was stalled from even getting \nintroduced, and Senators like Tom Carper stepped in and helped us get \nback on track. I thank Senator Carper for that. His early leadership as \nan original cosponsor of this bill got us off on the much needed right \nfoot. Other moderates joined in, and we had some momentum building up.\n  This has been a long road to get here today. I thank Chairman Inhofe \nfor his calm, steady leadership, and Senator Merkley, Senator Booker, \nSenator Whitehouse, Senator Markey, Senator Coons, Senator Durbin, and \nmany others. They all helped move this forward and all helped make this \na better bill.\n  I also thank Bonnie Lautenberg. Senator Lautenberg fought hard for \nTSCA\n\n[[Page S8873]]\n\nreform. I was proud to take up that fight, and I am grateful to Bonnie, \nwho has helped us every step of the way. She has been an incredible \nadvocate in terms of interacting with Senators and their staff to push \nthe crucial message forward on TSCA reform, and it was the message her \nhusband Frank Lautenberg would repeat every day when I saw him in \ncommittee. He said: Are we doing the right thing for our children and \nour grandchildren? He really believed TSCA reform would save more lives \nthan anything he had ever done in his life. He had a very rich life and \nlived to be almost 90 years old.\n  I wish to also recognize the great advocates for reform. A lot of \nthis was grassroots people standing up and saying that we haven't done \nwhat we need to do for the American people, for our families, and for \nour children on chemical safety. There are too many to mention all of \nthem, but the Bipartisan Policy Center stood up and helped out; the \nEnvironmental Defense Fund--Fred Krupp, their leader, played a crucial \nrole; the National Wildlife Federation; March of Dimes; North America's \nBuilding Trades Unions; the International Association of Machinists and \nAerospace Workers; Moms Clean Air Force; the Physicians Committee for \nResponsible Medicine; the Humane Society, and so many others. All of \nthese groups taken together represent over 30 million Americans. They \nall support the Lautenberg act. They pushed Congress to act, and they \nkept pushing until we did that.\n  Many thousands of Americans have worked for chemical safety reform \nover the last four decades.\n  Thank you for not giving up.\n  They understand that we need a national solution to our broken \nchemical safety law.\n  The Toxic Substances Control Act was enacted in 1976--nearly 40 years \nago. It was supposed to protect American families, but it doesn't. Over \nfour decades, the EPA has been able to restrict just five chemicals and \nit has prevented only four chemicals from going to market. That is out \nof tens of thousands of chemicals.\n  Everyday Americans go to the grocery store or the hardware store, and \nthey believe the chemicals in the products they buy have been tested \nand are safe, but that is not true because TSCA is broken. This is \nabout health and safety. This is about our children and grandchildren. \nThis is about people like Dominique Browning, who works with Moms Clean \nAir Force and worries about her kids and the toys and products they use \nevery day. She herself survived kidney cancer. When she asked her \ndoctor what caused her kidney cancer, he said: ``It's one of those \nenvironmental ones. Who knows? We're full of chemicals.'' That was her \ndoctor talking to her when she got kidney cancer. This is about people \nlike Lisa Huguenin. Lisa is a Ph.D. scientist and has done work on \nchemical exposure at Princeton and Rutgers and at the State and Federal \nlevels. She is a mother first. Her 13-year-old son Harrison was born \nwith autism and autoimmune deficiencies. Five years ago, Lisa testified \nbefore Senator Lautenberg's subcommittee on the need for reform. She is \neager to see TSCA reform signed into law.\n  That is why we are here--to fix this broken system. Now we are close \nto the finish line for the first time in almost 40 years.\n  In 2009 the Obama administration laid out six essential principles \nfor TSCA reform. The bill we passed last night meets all six of those \nprinciples, and I will go through each one individually.\n\n  Principle No. 1, chemicals should be reviewed against safety \nstandards that are based on sound science and reflect risk-based \ncriteria protective of human health and the environment.\n  Our bill requires the EPA to assess chemicals based only on the \nhealth and safety information, not on the cost. That was a significant \nchange we made, and many of the Senators I talked about earlier helped \nus to get that done.\n  Principle No. 2, manufacturers should provide EPA with the necessary \ninformation to conclude that new and existing chemicals are safe and do \nnot endanger public health or the environment.\n  Our bill gives EPA new authorities to develop testing data and \nrequires a finding of safety before new chemicals--as many as 1,500 a \nyear--enter the market. The finding on safety needs to be done not like \nit is done today but before they enter the marketplace.\n  Principle No. 3, risk management decisions should take into account \nsensitive subpopulations, cost, availability of substitutes, and other \nrelevant considerations.\n  Our bill specifically requires the protection of vulnerable \npopulations and lists examples of vulnerable populations, such as \ninfants, the elderly, pregnant women, workers, and others.\n  Principle No. 4, manufacturers and EPA should assess and act on \npriority chemicals, both existing and new, in a timely manner.\n  Our bill requires the EPA to systematically review all the chemicals \nin commerce, prioritizing the chemicals of most concern first, and it \nsets aggressive, judicially enforceable deadlines for EPA decisions.\n  Principle No. 5, green chemistry should be encouraged and provisions \nassuring transparency and public access to information should be \nstrengthened.\n  Our bill includes a section on sustainable chemistry and also makes \nmore information about chemicals available by limiting industry's \nability to claim information as confidential, and it gives States and \nhealth professionals access to confidential information to protect the \npublic.\n  Principle No. 6, EPA should be given a sustained source of funding \nfor implementation.\n  Our bill gives EPA sustained sources of funding and ensures that the \nEPA's priorities are not overwhelmed by private interests to ensure \nthat the program we implement is a risk-based system. Additionally, the \nbill allows EPA to develop cost-effective final regulations but without \nthe high procedural hurdles in the underlying statute, strikes an \nappropriate balance between Federal and State action, gives States the \nright to coenforce Federal standards. This will give a State's attorney \ngeneral the ability to move when the Federal Government may not be \nmoving, and it leaves State civil actions alone and gives no special \nadvantage to either side in litigation.\n  We are on the verge of historic reform, decades in the making and \ndecades overdue. TSCA is the last of the environmental laws from the \n1960s and 1970s left to be updated. Some days you might not think we \ncould pass a major environmental law in Congress, but we have proven \nthat wrong and we have a very strong bill.\n  Our bill finally gives the EPA the authority it needs to set clear \nguidance for the EPA to evaluate new and existing chemicals and to \nprotect the American people. That is why support for this bill was so \nstrong and continued to build--from environmental, conservation, good \ngovernment, industry, and health and labor groups.\n  We will be working to reconcile the bill with the House legislation. \nThis is historic reform. The old TSCA will be obsolete. We will have a \ncop on the beat and will finally be able to protect our kids from toxic \nchemicals.\n  I wish to again thank Senator Vitter. I am proud to work with him on \nthis bill. We may have disagreed many times on other issues, and the \nnegotiations were sometimes difficult, but we stayed at the table, \nlistened to all sides, and looked for solutions instead of roadblocks, \nand I thank Senator Vitter for that.\n  I also want to again thank the many colleagues who worked with us to \nensure that we have the best possible bill. At every step of the way, \nwe had Senators from both sides of the aisle step forward, make \nsuggestions, join the bill, cosponsor, and helped to move us forward.\n  It wouldn't be right to finish this afternoon without mentioning the \nstaff. The staff in the Senate do an incredible job in terms of getting \nfocused on the issues, learning about them in depth, working with each \nother, and many times moving roadblocks out of the way.\n  We had a number of staff members who worked on this legislation. \nDimitri Karakitsos worked for Senator Vitter when Senator Vitter was \nchairman and he now works for Chairman Inhofe. Dimitri has been amazing \nin terms of his staff ability and his understanding. We really \nappreciate all of his help.\n  I wish to also thank Chairman Inhofe's staff director, Ryan Jackson;\n\n[[Page S8874]]\n\nZak Baig, with Senator Vitter; Colin Peppard, with Senator Carper; \nAdrian Deveny, with Senator Merkley; Emily Enderle, with Senator \nWhitehouse; Adam Zipkin, with Senator Cory Booker; Michal Freedhoff, \nwith Senator Markey; Jasmine Hunt, with Senator Durbin; and Lisa \nHummon-Jones, with Senator Coons.\n  I have mentioned the great work that Jonathan Black, a member of my \nstaff, has done, but we have also had incredible work by my legislative \ndirector, Andrew Wallace, and all of my staff at various points. This \nlegislation has been a heavy burden, and my staff worked hard to get \nthis legislation completed. I truly appreciate the hard work they have \ndone, including my chief of staff and everybody in the office.\n  We also had the opportunity to consult with and ask for help from the \nSenate legislative counsel. They worked to turn around text quickly at \ncrucial points, and that makes all the difference in the world--to have \ntext, get it looked at, get the changes made, and get back to the \nindividuals who are involved.\n  Michelle Johnson-Weider played a key role, as did Deanna Edwards. I \nam sure there were others over there who also helped us out. This is \nnot a definitive list. There were also many others.\n  I wish to conclude by thanking, again, our bipartisan partners. \nSenator Vitter and I have been working on this for years. We took it up \nafter Senator Lautenberg passed away. Senator Vitter was on the \ncommittee as the ranking member and the chairman--and back and forth--\nand then Senator Inhofe took over.\n  I remember when we had a meeting with Senator Inhofe, and he took a \nreal interest in this legislation. He has incredible calm, steady \njudgment in terms of pulling together what needs to happen to get a \nbill done in this sometimes hyperpartisan atmosphere. As chairman, he \nwas always willing to listen to the people on the committee, off the \ncommittee, and pull people together to help them find common ground on \nthis bill.\n  With that, we look forward to working with our House colleagues. Many \nof us served in the House. We served with House Members Fred Upton, \nFrank Pallone, John Shimkus, and Representative Tonko. These are some \nof the key people who will be working on this in the House, and we look \nforward to working with them and their staff and each other to \nreconcile these bills.\n  The House has some very good ideas in its bill. We have been a little \nmore expansive and covered more areas, and I hope they will work with \nus on that. We look forward to working with them and putting the two \nbills together and then getting this passed early next year.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN.

Mr. President, I want to say just a few words this \nafternoon on the vote that was taken on the Senate floor this morning. \nI will certainly admit that this was a difficult vote for me. This \n2,200-page, $1.8 trillion spending and tax reform bill certainly does \ncontain provisions that I have advocated for and will continue to press \nfor to benefit different Alaskan groups, small businesses, the energy \nsector, and others. However, voting in favor of such a massive and \nconsequential piece of legislation without having the opportunity to \nfully understand or fully vet both its positive and negative \nimplications for Alaska and our Nation or to offer amendments is \nsomething I could not do in good conscience.\n  Leader McConnell, majority whip Senator Cornyn, and so many other \nleaders in the Senate have worked hard in terms of this process over \nthe past year. You heard a number of Senators come to the floor to talk \nabout what clearly has been a very productive Senate under their \nleadership, and I want to commend them for their leadership. I \nappreciate their leadership. I know that in terms of the budget they \ntried to get this body to the right place, meaning we actually passed a \nbudget for the first time in many years. We passed 12 appropriations \nbills--again, for appropriations, the first time in many years--but as \nthe bills came to the Senate floor, they were halted, unfortunately, \nblocked, filibustered. I remember debating not once, not twice, but \nthree times when the other side filibustered the Defense appropriations \nbill. This Senator still does not understand what was behind all of \nthat, still is not 100 percent sure why the appropriations and funding \nprocess was halted in this body. Then we saw the smash-up the last week \nwhen everything came together at the end of the year.\n  I am not sure what the motivation was to do this, but I do know this: \nThe way in which we fund our Federal Government--in this case, 72 hours \nto read a 2,200-page, $1.8 trillion, ``take it or leave it'' bill, \nnegotiated by just a few Members of Congress and the White House--is a \nbroken process, and it is not worthy of our great Nation, nor the \npeople we represent. I also believe it is a principal reason why we \nhave seen an explosion of trillions of dollars in debt that imperils \nour Nation's fiscal stability and certainly imperils our children's \nfuture.\n  Back home in Alaska, we are currently debating through a transparent, \nopen, and contentious process how to best address our State's \nsignificant fiscal challenges. We have big fiscal challenges just like \nthis government does. In my view, the Federal Government should be \ndoing the same. The bill we voted on today and the process that \nproduced it demonstrates that we are not.\n  Going forward, I certainly want to continue to work with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle and the leadership on both sides \nof the aisle to continue to work to improve this process because the \npeople we represent deserve much better than what just transpired.\n  Obviously there has been a lot of talk about the omnibus bill in the \nlast couple days on the floor, but I just wanted to say a few words. \nSometimes it takes a reminder from home, a reminder from what is going \non back home to ground us and to remind us of what is really important \nin our lives, like family and friends and life itself.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8874-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8874-S8875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SEARCH FOR CASEY GRAHAM\n\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I would like to talk briefly about an \neffort that is going on in Alaska right now to try to recover one of \nour own, Casey Graham--an Alaskan Native, a patriot, 24 years old, the \nson of Steven and Lucy Graham.\n  He is 24 years old, the son of Steven and Lucy Graham and brother of \nCheryl, Michelle, Megan, and Pauline. He is a veteran who served in the \nMarines and was deployed to serve his country in Afghanistan. He is a \nyoung man in the prime of his life.\n  Casey has been described as smart, hard-working, extremely \nintelligent, and a shining light for his community, his State, and his \ncountry. He lived in Anchorage but was from McGrath, AK. That is about \n200 miles from Anchorage on the Upper Kuskokwim River.\n  About a week ago he was visiting family when he decided to do what \nmost Alaskans do in the winter--go out on a snow machine ride. It is \nthought that he was on the ice on the river and hit open water. His \nsnow machine and his helmet have been found, but not Casey.\n  As I speak, the community of McGrath is banding together for the \nrecovery effort. It is a small town--only about 350 people live there--\nbut it is a town with a huge heart. The community has dropped \neverything. Every day, dozens--as many as 50 Alaskans have gone out to \nwhere they think Casey was on the ice to bring him home. Remember, in \nAlaska it is cold right now. From December 10 when the search began \nuntil now, temperatures have ranged from about 22 degrees below zero to \na high of about 16 above zero. There is a heated tent on the ice where \nvolunteers go to warm up and eat lunch before they go back out \nsearching. They eat moose stew mostly and, of course, a lot of salmon. \nThe community is emptying their freezers and making sure all the \nvolunteers are fed.\n  In the true spirit of Alaska, in the true spirit of Christmas, so \nmany companies and individuals across the great\n\n[[Page S8875]]\n\nState of Alaska are donating goods, services, airline miles, freight \nservices, food, hand and foot warmers, first-aid kits, cold-weather \ngear--you name it. Everybody is pitching in to help. It is something \nthat this body and this country should be particularly proud of.\n  Although I am not surprised by it, Casey's marine brothers have flown \nin from thousands of miles away, all across the country, to help in the \nsearch. They served with him in Afghanistan, and they have now come to \nAlaska from Texas, Pennsylvania, California, and as far away from \nAlaska as New York. There are 11 now and more on the way. In the \nMarines, we don't leave our brothers and sisters behind, and these \nmarines are living up to that ethos.\n  I am asking for the thoughts and prayers of this body and Americans--\nany Americans all across this country who are watching--on this effort. \nI am asking that we pray to bring Casey home.\n  Semper fi to him, his father, his sisters, and to those proud marines \nwho are making sure he makes it home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Republican leader and I are both long-\ntime appropriators. I love the Appropriations Committee. But over time, \nthe appropriations process has broken down.\n  There are differing opinions about the causes of the breakdown. \nOpinions typically vary depending on whether Senators serve in the \nmajority or minority. But there is a bipartisan consensus that we can \nand must do better. I hope that in the coming session, both sides can \nwork together to restore the appropriations process to what it once \nwas--a thoroughly bipartisan process focused on governing, not a \npartisan process focused on scoring political points.\n  The need for bipartisanship should be obvious. After all, during the \nnext session, we will continue to be a divided government. Republicans \nwill be in charge of the legislative branch, and President Obama will \ncontinue to control the administration. Neither side can force the \nother to accept its preferred process or its preferred outcomes. The \nonly way to make this work is for both sides to work together \nthroughout the year and to make the compromises needed to get \nappropriations bills not just passed but signed into law.\n  Among other things, this means that both parties will have to be part \nof the decisionmaking process from the beginning, at both the committee \nand leadership levels. This doesn't just mean developing individual \nbills in a bipartisan way. It means reaching bipartisan agreements on \nthe sequencing and packaging of legislation, so that one party's \npriorities are not pursued at the expense of the other's priorities.\n  True bipartisanship also requires both parties to resist the \ntemptation to pursue poison pill riders that appeal to their own \nsupporters but that are so strongly opposed by the other party that \ntheir inclusion in appropriations bills would grind the process to a \nhalt. No doubt there will be many opportunities next year for both \nsides to score political points. But the appropriations process is not \nthe place for that. And I hope Members in both parties will agree that \nit is more important to fund the government than to play politics.\n  I am convinced that if we can restore the appropriations process to \none based on bipartisan cooperation at every stage, all Senators will \nbenefit. It will give Members in both parties a meaningful opportunity \nfor input, and it will avoid the need for invoking cloture on motions \nto proceed to appropriations bills. With some luck, it also will allow \nus to complete our work next year without a lameduck session and \nwithout another end of year crisis. And that is something everyone \nshould be able to agree on.\n  In today's polarized environment, that may seem like wishful \nthinking. But there is no reason we can't make it happen. We should \nbuild upon the momentum created by adoption of the Bipartisan Budget \nAct of 2015, which the Senate passed with a 64-to-35 vote on October \n30. And the key is really quite simple--genuine bipartisan cooperation \nat every step of the process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8875-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8875-S8876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF HERMANDAD MEXICANA TRANSNACIONAL, \n                                  ORG.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 10th anniversary of \nHermandad Mexicana Transnacional, Org.\n  Since it was established in 2005, Hermandad Mexicana Transnacional \nhas been a strong advocate for the Latino community in southern Nevada. \nIn working to fulfill its mission of promoting family unity and \ncommunity empowerment, the organization ensures that Latinos in Nevada \nhave the legal, social, educational, and economic support they need to \nthrive, regardless of their immigration status.\n  Hermandad Mexicana Transnacional provides the Latino community with \nessential immigration services including assistance with navigating the \nimmigration system to become naturalized U.S. citizens; applying for \nthe Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA, program; renewing \nwork permits and legal permanent resident cards; and filing U-Visa and \nViolence Against Women Act petitions.\n  Hermandad Mexicana Transnacional has formed important partnerships \nwith other entities to enhance the resources it provides. These \nresources include supportive services for victims of violence and free \ntax preparation services, voter registration assistance for newly \nnaturalized U.S. citizens, and attorney consultation services for \nimmigration cases at no cost to the client. Furthermore, Hermandad \nMexicana Transnacional offers a variety of literacy and education \ncourses for English language learners through its adult education \nprogram. These courses include elementary and middle\n\n[[Page S8876]]\n\nschool education classes and a preparation course for Spanish-speaking \nstudents to obtain a General Education diploma.\n  I applaud Hermandad Mexicana Transnacional for 10 years of dedicated \nservice to the Latino community in southern Nevada. Hermandad Mexicana \nTransnacional is the only organization of its kind in the Silver State, \nand its work is truly appreciated and admired. I also commend the \ndistinguished leadership of Hermandad Mexicana Transnacional, \nparticularly Ms. Luz Marin Mosquera, Ms. Dora Lopez, and Ms. Kathia \nPereira. Under their direction, Hermandad Mexicana Transnacional has \nassisted more than 45,000 people in southern Nevada with a variety of \nimmigration-related issues. This includes 4,000 people who are now U.S. \ncitizens and 5,300 people who are now DACA beneficiaries.\n  I wish Hermandad Mexicana Transnacional continued success as the \norganization continues its meaningful work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8876-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT NOTIFICATION REQUEST\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I am taking this opportunity to notice my \nobjection to the Senate proceeding to the nomination of Janine Anne \nDavidson of Virginia to be Under Secretary of the Navy. My concern is \nnot with Ms. Davidson's nomination, per se, but with a larger matter \nconcerning the Navy and its policies and practices with regard to \nretaliation against whistleblowers.\n  On October 21, 2015, the Washington Post reported that the Navy plans \nto promote RDML Brian L. Losey, even though the Department of Defense \nOffice of Inspector General, OIG, has found on multiple occasions that \nhe retaliated against perceived whistleblowers in response to \nwhistleblower complaints and, in some cases, simply the belief that \nsuch complaints had been made. According to the article, the OIG has \nreported that Rear Admiral Losey went so far as to make a list of \nsuspected whistleblowers and intentionally target them for discipline, \ndemotion, and internal investigation. In several instances, the OIG \nrecommended personnel action be taken against Rear Admiral Losey for \nthese actions. However, the Navy appears poised to ignore those \nfindings and promote Rear Admiral Losey.\n  On November 13, 2015, I joined with seven other Senators, both \nDemocrats and Republicans, in a request to Jon T. Rymer, the inspector \ngeneral for the Department of Defense, for the OIG investigation \nreports related to Rear Admiral Losey's conduct. Those reports were \nprovided to me and to the other Senators signing the November 13 letter \njust 3 days ago, on December 15, 2015, in redacted form.\n  Until I have had an opportunity to thoroughly review the inspector \ngeneral's findings related to Rear Admiral Losey and until I have \nreceived assurances from the Navy that it will address those findings \nspecifically and has policies in place to sanction retaliation against \nwhistleblowers more broadly, I will object to the Senate proceeding \nwith the Davidson nomination.\n  (At the request of Mr. Lee, the following statement was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8876-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mr. RUBIO.

Mr. President, we wish to speak today about the Arizona \nStatehood and Enabling Act Amendments of 1999 concerning the investment \nallocation and distribution of revenues in the State of Arizona's \npermanent land endowment trust fund. This fund consists of moneys \nderived from the sale of State trust land that was conveyed to the \nState of Arizona on admission to the Union in 1912. The State of \nArizona was granted approximately 10.9 million acres of land at \nstatehood and today holds in trust over 9 million acres. Every year, \nrevenues generated from trust land uses must be deposited in the fund \nand used solely for the benefit of beneficiaries specified in the \nConstitution of the State of Arizona, predominately Arizona's K-12 \npublic schools.\n  The Arizona Statehood and Enabling Act Amendments of 1999 repealed \nstrict investment and distribution limitations imposed on the fund by \nthe Congress in the State's enabling act. It also granted the voters of \nthe State of Arizona the authority to adjust distributions to the fund \nbeneficiaries. To accomplish that objective, Congress specifically \namended section 28 of the Arizona Enabling Act of 1910 to read, \n``Distributions from the trust funds shall be made as provided in \narticle 10, Section 7 of the Constitution of the state of Arizona.''\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimate, which was included in the \nHouse of Representatives Committee report, indicated that ``[e]nactment \nof this bill would give Arizona state officials greater flexibility in \ninvesting and distributing the assets of the state's permanent funds.''\n  My understanding is that this reference to the Constitution of the \nState of Arizona, in section 28 of the enabling act, authorizes the \nvoters of the State of Arizona to amend their constitution to authorize \ndifferent distributions than those in place in 1999, including \ndistributions that may pay out more funds to the beneficiaries. I ask \nthe senior Senator from Alaska: Would she agree?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I want to thank the senior Senator from Arizona for \nhis question. I am familiar with the enabling act's requirements that \nfunds are held in trust for certain beneficiaries, including K-12 \npublic schools, and that distributions are made from Arizona's \npermanent land endowment trust fund.\n  The 1910 Arizona Enabling Act specified the level of education-\nfunding distributions that must be made from the State land trust fund. \nIn 1999, Congress amended the 1910 act, eliminating the distribution \nrequirement and providing that such distributions be made as provided \nfor in the Arizona Constitution, specifically article 10, section 7. \nThus, as I understand it, so long as changes to the education-funding \ndistributions are accomplished by amendments to article 10, section 7 \nof the Arizona Constitution, and the funds are used for the \nbeneficiaries of the enabling act, the changes to funding distribution \namounts from the State land trust are proper.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank Senator Murkowski for her answer. I have one \nfurther question. I believe, should the voters of the State of Arizona \nchange the amounts distributed to the fund beneficiaries by amending \narticle 10, section 7 of the Arizona Constitution, that the consent of \nCongress is not required prior to the change taking effect. Would the \nSenator agree?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Senator McCain, because Congress specified that \ndistributions may be made as determined\n\n[[Page S8877]]\n\nin article 10, section 7, of the Arizona Constitution, I share his view \nthat Congress need not provide consent.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Alaska for her response.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8877-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CHILD NICOTINE POISONING PREVENTION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Ms. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I wish to engage in a colloquy with \nmy colleague from Florida to speak briefly about the Senate's recent \npassage of S. 142, the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act of 2015, \nwhich was introduced by Senator Nelson and which I cosponsored, along \nwith many of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  Liquid nicotine is very dangerous: even a small amount on the skin is \nenough to make a small child very ill. A 15-milliliter bottle, like \nthose sold in stores and online--often without any verification that \nthe buyer is not a minor--contains enough liquid nicotine to kill four \nchildren. This substance is marketed in bright colors and sweet \nflavors, so it is no surprise that it finds its way into the hands of \nour children. In 2014 alone, the American Association of Poison Control \nCenters reported over 1,500 liquid nicotine exposures. These exposures \nresulted in many serious injuries and at least one tragic death of a \nchild in New York.\n  Mr. NELSON. I agree with my colleague from Washington--we cannot \nstand by and allow this harm to continue. The U.S. Government requires \nchild-resistant packaging on other products, including over-the-counter \nmedications and cleaning supplies. These rules have prevented countless \ninjuries and deaths, and this important legislation will ensure we have \nthe same protections in place when it comes liquid nicotine.\n  Ms. MURRAY. That is why my colleague, the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and I, as ranking \nmember of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, urge \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission, CPSC, to act swiftly to \nimplement S. 142.\n  At the same time, we note that Congress is aware that the Food and \nDrug Administration has indicated a commitment to addressing the \nimportant public health issue of protecting children from the dangers \nof liquid nicotine. The agency's proposed tobacco deeming rule when \nfinalized will extend FDA's tobacco authorities to products like e-\ncigarettes not marketed for therapeutic purposes and liquid nicotine.\n  Mr. NELSON. Like my colleague, I urge FDA to act as quickly as \npossible to address this important public health issue as soon as they \nhave jurisdiction over these products, and we understand they intend to \ndo so. On July 1, 2015, FDA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rule \nMaking, ANPRM, titled, ``Nicotine Exposure Warnings and Child-Resistant \nPackaging for Liquid Nicotine, Nicotine-Containing E-Liquid(s), and \nOther Tobacco Products; Request for Comments.''\n  This ANPRM sought comments, data, and research results that will \ninform future regulatory action. As the regulating agency of these \nproducts, FDA must use all of its regulatory tools to protect children \nfrom the harms of e-cigarettes and liquid nicotine, including the \nregulation of liquid nicotine packaging.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Murray and our colleagues at \nthe FDA and at the CPSC on this important issue. Together, we can \nensure that every measure is taken to prevent more harm to our children \nfrom these dangerous products.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8877-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FAA COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleague from Arizona, \nSenator McCain, in a colloquy regarding an aviation noise concern of \nparticular interest to his constituents in the Phoenix area.\n  During the floor debates on the transportation and housing \nappropriations bills in both the House and the Senate, there were a \nnumber of amendments adopted related to the Federal Aviation \nAdministration's air traffic procedures and, in particular, the noise \nthat FAA-approved flight patterns create in communities. The Senator \nfrom Arizona offered an amendment dealing with this issue, which I was \nhappy to accept during the abbreviated consideration of the THUD bill \non the Senate floor.\n  As a result, the omnibus includes bill language requiring the Federal \nAviation Administration to update its ``community involvement manual'' \nrelated to new air traffic procedures in order to improve public \noutreach and community involvement. The FAA is directed to complete and \nimplement a plan which enhances community involvement and proactively \naddresses concerns associated with performance-based navigation \nprojects.\n  I know this is an important issue for you, Senator McCain, and I \nappreciate you joining me on the floor today so that we can send a \nclear message to the FAA about the importance of involving your \nconstituents.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Maine for \nher consideration. I wish to provide further detail on the provision \nincluded in the omnibus requiring the Federal Aviation Administration \nto improve community involvement policies and address concerns stemming \nfrom changes associated with performance based navigation projects, \nincluding what we expect the FAA to do to provide relief for impacted \ncommunities, and what that means for the people of Arizona.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Maine for acknowledging that community \noutreach on the part of the FAA to date has been lacking, and that \nefforts underway at the FAA to update their community involvement \npractices have not been sufficient. I look forward to working with her \nto continue to accomplish the intent of the language I introduced which \nwas adopted by unanimous consent earlier this year during Senate \nconsideration of the transportation and housing appropriations bills.\n  Since September 2014, residents in Arizona around the Phoenix Sky \nHarbor Airport have had their daily lives impacted by changes to \nflights paths made without formal notification to the airport or \ncommunity engagement before the changes were implemented. The intent \nthe language included in the omnibus is to improve outreach to the \ncommunity and airport, providing an opportunity for notification and \nconsultation with the operator of an affected airport and the community \nbefore making future flight path decisions.\n  Furthermore, for changes that have already been implemented, as is \nthe case in Phoenix, the Administrator shall review those decisions to \ngrant a categorical exclusion under Section 213(c) of the FAA \nModernization and Reform Act of 2012 to implement procedures in which \nthe changed procedure has had a significant effect on the human \nenvironment in the community in which the airport is located, if the \nairport can demonstrate that the implementation has had such an effect. \nIf this review indicates that the flight path changes have had such an \nimpact, the FAA shall consult with the operator of the airport to \nidentify measures to mitigate the effect of the procedure on the human \nenvironment, including considering the use of alternative flight paths.\n  This would not impede the efforts to modernize our Nation's airspace \nthrough NextGen or substantially undermine efficiencies and safety \nimprovements realized through those efforts. It does create a long-\nawaited, much-needed opportunity for residents around Phoenix Sky \nHarbor International Airport negatively impacted by flight noise to \nhave their voices heard by the FAA.\n  Ms. COLLINS. To be clear, the FAA should be ensuring that local \ncommunities have a voice when decisions that affect them directly are \nbeing made by the agency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8877-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8877-S8878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREQUIRED STATE PREEMPTION PROVISION IN THE FRANK R. LAUTENBERG CHEMICAL \n                    SAFETY FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ACT\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today, with my colleagues Senator Cory \nBooker and Senator Jeff Merkley, I wish to discuss the Frank R. \nLautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, S. 697. Some \nopponents claim it creates a regulatory void that will prohibit States \nfrom creating or enforcing State policies while EPA assesses chemicals \nfor safety. We opposed the bill as introduced because that was the \ncase. Since then, we\n\n[[Page S8878]]\n\nworked together with Senators Udall, Vitter, and Inhofe to restore the \nability of States to protect their citizens while EPA is assessing \nchemicals by substantially shrinking the interim period of time where \npreemption occurs and by creating a straightforward waiver process.\n  Mr. BOOKER. The provision requires EPA to allow States to regulate \nhazardous chemicals while EPA assesses a chemical for safety if the \nproposed state regulation meets three basic criteria: A, consistent \nwith the dormant commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution, compliance \nwith the proposed regulation will not unduly burden interstate commerce \nin the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, or use of a \nchemical substance; B, compliance with the proposed regulation would \nnot cause a violation of any applicable Federal law, rule, or order; \nand C, the State or political subdivision of a State has a concern \nabout the chemical substance or use of the chemical substance based in \npeer-reviewed science.\n  Given the importance of this provision and the role EPA will play in \nreviewing waiver applications, we asked EPA for its interpretation. EPA \nagrees that States will be exempted from preemption by meeting three \ncriteria. The following are the relevant excerpts from EPA's response:\n  Based on the bill reported on June 18, 2015, S. Rep. 114-67, the \nfollowing is a summary of how EPA understands the Frank R. Lautenberg \nChemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, FRL21, would operate with \nrespect to the preemption of state law.\n  Required waivers under section 18(f)(2). These would be State \nrequests for an exemption from preemption under section 18(b). EPA must \ngrant this kind of waiver request if the State law for which waiver is \nsought would not unduly burden interstate commerce; the State law for \nwhich waiver is sought would not cause a violation of Federal law; and \nthe State has a concern about the chemical substance or use of the \nchemical substance based in peer-reviewed science.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Each of these standards has a constitutional foundation. \nThe first reflects the restraints of the dormant commerce clause. The \nsecond reflects the Constitution's supremacy clause. The third \ncorresponds to the scientific factual predicate required to meet \nscrutiny under the due process clause, as not ``arbitrary and \ncapricious.''\n  Restoring the ability for States to protect their citizens while EPA \nassesses the safety of chemicals was one of the primary goals of our \nwork to improve this bill and that has been accomplished under section \n18(f)(2) of S. 697, as reported by the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. We believe this does, within the limits imposed by the \nConstitution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8878-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING CORPORAL ANDREW A. AIMESBURY\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to honor the \nservice and sacrifice of Army CPL Andrew Aimesbury, who died last week \nfrom wounds sustained during squad live-fire training at Fort Stewart, \nGA. He was a proud son of New Hampshire, and I join with other Granite \nStaters in extending my deep condolences to his father, Carl Aimesbury, \nof Somersworth; his mother, Karen Kelsey, of Dover; and his sister, \nAbigail Aimesbury, also of Dover.\n  Corporal Aimesbury served courageously in Afghanistan and was highly \nrespected as a warrior and team leader with an elite Ranger unit. His \nbattalion commander praised his ``caring nature'' and called him ``an \nexceptional Ranger leader and an extraordinary man.''\n  It is deeply moving to read a post on Facebook by his father, Carl \nAimesbury. Mr. Aimesbury wrote: ``Wednesday December 9th the world lost \nthe best son, brother, cousin, grandson, person that I was so \nprivileged to call my son. He was an Army Ranger and so proud to serve \nhis country. My heart is broken but I am so thankful for the time I had \nwith him. I love you Andrew.'' As we honor Andrew, let us remember that \nit is not only our warriors who serve and sacrifice but also their \nfamily members and loved ones.\n  Corporal Aimesbury represented the very best in our Nation. After \ngraduation from Dover High School in Dover, NH, he enlisted in the Army \nand trained as an infantryman at Fort Benning, GA. He went on to \ncomplete the Ranger Assessment and Selection Program as well as the \nhighly demanding Army Ranger Course and was assigned to Company D, 1st \nBattalion, 75th Ranger Regiment.\n  Soldiers typically flinch from the term ``hero.'' But make no \nmistake, Andrew Aimesbury answered the call of duty, served our Nation \nin time of war, and was prepared to--and did--make the ultimate \nsacrifice. If that is not heroism, I don't know what is.\n  There is an inscription at Arlington National Cemetery that pretty \nmuch says it all: ``Not for fame or reward, nor lured by ambition or \ngoaded by necessity, but in simple obedience to duty.''\n  I join with people in New Hampshire and across the United States in \nhonoring the ``simple obedience to duty'' of this brave fallen soldier, \nCPL Andrew Aimesbury.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8878-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO CHERYL S.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor Ms. Cheryl S. \nCromwell who will retire on January 3, 2016, after over 42 years of \nservice to our Nation and the United States Air Force as a civilian \nairman.\n  Ms. Cromwell began her civil service career in 1973 as a clerk in the \nOffice of Programs and Resources for the U.S. Department of the Air \nForce. In 1974, Ms. Cromwell moved to the Air Force legislative liaison \noffice under the Secretary of the Air Force where she would serve for \nthe rest of her distinguished career. She worked in the Air Force \nSenate liaison office in the Russell Senate Office Building, but spent \nthe majority of her time in the Air Force congressional inquiry office \nin the Pentagon.\n  During her many years in the congressional inquiry division, Ms. \nCromwell provided responses to over 50,000 inquiries on behalf of \nconstituents and formed a strong working relationship with many on \ncongressional staffs. It is not surprising that staff frequently \nrequested that Cheryl personally work their most important and \ndifficult cases.\n  It is my honor to join many of Ms. Cromwell's co-workers, family, and \nfriends in congratulating her on her well-deserved retirement after \nover 42 years of dedicated Federal service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8878-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8878-S8879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO AIKO LANE\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I would like my colleagues to join me in \nthanking Aiko Lane, a Brookings fellow from the Department of Defense, \nfor her service to the Senate and to wish her well as she returns to \nthe Pentagon.\n  Before Aiko joined my office she was a policy adviser in the office \nof the Secretary of Defense focusing on countering weapons of mass \ndestruction. She has also served as the Japan country director where \nshe represented the Department of Defense on issues related to the \nU.S.-Japan alliance, including coordinating the U.S. response to \nJapan's 2011 devastating Tohoku earthquake and tsunami.\n  Prior to her work on Japan, Aiko was the Afghanistan country director \nwhere she was responsible for engaging with international partners and \nallies on military support for the U.S. and NATO-led efforts in \nAfghanistan.\n  Aiko, who received her undergraduate degree from Northwestern and a \nmaster's degree from Columbia, has been an important member of my \nforeign policy team over the last year, focusing much of her time and \nenergy on my work as ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations \nSubcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific and International Cybersecurity \nPolicy. Aiko's expertise in matters pertaining to East Asia and the \nPacific and her solid advice and thoughtful analysis of all regional \nmatters have been critical to me. Moreover, Aiko's hard work enabled \nthe subcommittee to hold five hearings this year on matters ranging \nfrom democratic transitions in Southeast Asia to the North Korean \nnuclear threat.\n  There is no question that the United States is fortunate to have \npeople like Aiko representing Americans both at\n\n[[Page S8879]]\n\nhome and abroad. We here in the Senate will miss Aiko's extensive \nknowledge and extraordinary work ethic as she returns to the Department \nof Defense. I also want to take this opportunity to thank Aiko's \nhusband, Haru, and their children, Callea and Kent, for sharing her \nwith us this past year. The Senate schedule isn't always the most \n``family friendly'' but Aiko has been able to juggle the competing \ndemands masterfully. I urge my colleagues to join me in thanking Aiko \nLane for her outstanding service to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8879-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RECOGNIZING THE 240TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NAVY CHAPLAIN CORPS\n\n  Mr. LANKFORD.

They have seen the worst, but still provide \nhope for something greater. Over the course of their ministry, 16 Navy \nchaplains have given the ultimate sacrifice. Additionally, two \nchaplains have been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for their \ndevoted service.\n  After over a decade of conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan, chaplains \ntoday continue to bring support and hope to those affected by war. \nProtecting and advancing the religious liberty of both chaplains and \nservicemembers is essential to preserve our honored heritage.\n  On the 240th anniversary of the Navy Chaplain Corps, we recognize \ntheir dedication and devotion, their service to a cause greater than \nthemselves, and their selfless sacrifice for our nation. We also \nrecognize the importance of protecting their right and the right of \nevery servicemember to practice their religious beliefs.\n  On this day, we recognize all Navy chaplains who have answered the \ncall to serve where it matters, when it matters, with what matters \nsince 1775.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8879-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO BOB FORD\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

Bob is a valued, longtime member of my \nstaff and dear friend.\n  In September of 2002, Bob joined my staff as the State director for \nbusiness, economic, and rural development. Bob, originally from the \nSunny Slope area of Canyon County, brought to the position a profound \nknowledge of rural and economic development shaped by his service as \nthe State manager of rural development for the Idaho Department of \nCommerce, where he worked for 17 years in various capacities.\n  To say that Bob assisted me in a number of issue areas is an \nunderstatement. He has worked on far too many efforts to count. In \naddition to his work on rural and economic development issues, he has \nworked on initiatives related to housing, labor, trade, veterans, \nenergy, banking, budget, taxes, immigration, water resources, \ntransportation, and much more.\n  Highlights of his contributions as a member of my staff include his \nsuccessful work to stop the transfer of the terminal approach control \nradar, known as TRACON, from the Boise airport. Bob spent countless \nhours working with affected parties to build an overwhelming \njustification for retaining TRACON at the Boise airport. He also worked \nheavily on trying to restore a key Amtrak corridor between the Midwest, \nthe Intermountain States, and the Pacific Northwest.\n  As a fellow veteran, Bob has utilized his shared understanding of \nserving our Nation to connect with Idaho's veterans community and help \nimprove veterans' access to quality services. He has attentively and \nefficiently administered the presenting of the Spirit of Freedom Award, \nwhich is an annual award to veterans and volunteers to recognize their \ngreat contributions to our armed services and veterans.\n  Bob is pragmatic and witty. He brings his calm, commonsense approach \nto any task, and I will miss his logical counsel and good humor. Bob is \nso widely admired that there has been no shortage of Idahoans who have \nshared fond memories of times they have worked with Bob over the years \nand the achievements he has made for the people of our great State.\n  Bob, you have done ``not bad for a kid who grew up on a farm in Sunny \nSlope on the banks of the Snake River.'' I hope that retirement will \nprovide much-deserved time fishing, and that I will still get to \nbenefit from your wise assistance from time to time. Thank you for your \noutstanding, committed service. Congratulations on your retirement.

It gives me great pleasure to recognize his \nachievement in being selected to lead an organization that does so much \nfor our Nation's military community.\n  Mr. Courneya enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1972 and served his \ncountry for nearly a quarter century. Throughout his military career, \nhe received numerous assignments across the country, where he served in \nCalifornia, Nevada, North Carolina, Hawaii, and Pennsylvania. He also \nserved overseas in Japan and Bolivia. Before retiring in 1996, he \nachieved the rank of master gunnery sergeant. Mr. Courneya's service is \ninvaluable to our country, and I am grateful for the sacrifices he made \nfor our freedoms.\n  The FRA is a congressionally chartered military and veterans service \norganization that serves active members and veterans of the U.S. Navy, \nMarine Corps, and Coast Guard. In his new role, Mr. Courneya will work \nto strengthen the organization and increase national recognition of the \nwork being done by the FRA on behalf of our Nation's heroes. He will \nalso serve as an advocate for the issues important to sea service \nmembers and their families.\n  Mr. Courneya has been a member of the FRA since 1982 and is currently \na member of the FRA Branch 274 in Reno. Throughout his service to this \norganization, he has held numerous important roles on the local, \nregional, and national levels, including serving as both the \nassociation's west coast regional president from 2004 to 2006 and \nnational vice president from 2012 to 2013.\n  I am grateful for Mr. Courneya's many contributions to sea service \nmembers and veterans throughout our Nation and State. His actions \nrepresent only the greatest of Nevada's values and place him among the \noutstanding men and women who have valiantly defended our Nation. I \nwould also like to recognize his wife, Helen, who was selected as the \nnational president of the auxiliary. Our State is fortunate to have \nrole models such as Mr. and Mrs. Courneya serving Nevada's brave.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I recognize \nCongress has a responsibility not only to honor the brave individuals \nwho serve our Nation, but also to ensure they are cared for when they \nreturn home. I remain committed to upholding this promise for veterans \nin our State and across the country. I am grateful to have Nevadans \nlike Mr. Courneya working towards a common goal: fighting to ensure the \nneeds of our military community are met.\n  Mr. Courneya has demonstrated professionalism, commitment to \nexcellence, and dedication to the highest standards of the U.S. Marine \nCorps. I extend my greatest gratitude for his service to defending our \nfreedom and his work on behalf of the FRA. I am humbled and honored by \nhis service and am proud to call him a fellow Nevadan.

This award is truly prestigious and attained by only the most \ninfluential educators across the country.\n  JAG is a nonprofit organization that is focused on improving the \neducational outcome of America's youth\n\n[[Page S8880]]\n\nto ensure they are equipped to succeed in higher education and the \nworkforce. The Nevada chapter of this State-based national organization \nhas been a driving force to help integrate the JAG program into 19 \nschools in the Clark County School District, assisting the needs of \nmore than 700 students in 37 schools across the State. Mr. Skorkowsky \nplayed a significant role in implementing this program after a \nsuccessful pilot trial at several schools across our State.\n  Over 25 years ago, Mr. Skorkowsky began working as an educator for \nthe Clark County School District. Throughout his tenure, he has served \nas a teacher, assistant principal, principal, academic manager, deputy \nsuperintendent, and now as superintendent. Mr. Skorkowsky spearheaded \nthe idea that drives the nation's fifth largest school district: \n``Every student in every classroom, without exceptions, without \nexcuses.'' During his time as superintendent, Mr. Skorkowsky has upheld \nthis philosophy, implementing strategies to improve the academic \nexperience for every student who attends a Clark County School. \nSouthern Nevada is fortunate to have someone of such great experience \nworking on behalf of the future of Nevada's youth.\n  As a father of four children who attended Nevada's public schools and \nas the husband of a teacher, I understand the important role that \neducators play in enriching the lives of Nevada's students. Ensuring \nthat America's youth are prepared to compete in the 21st century is \ncritical for the future of our country. Mr. Skorkowsky has worked \ntirelessly to help prepare students across southern Nevada to be career \nand college ready, and I am grateful to have him serving as an ally to \nfuture generations of Nevadans.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in thanking Mr. \nSkorkowsky for his dedication to enriching the lives of Nevada's \nstudents and in congratulating him on receiving this award. I wish him \nwell as he continues creating success for all students who enter the \nClark County School District.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8880-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING GLEE S.

Mr. President, on November 16, Kansas lost one of \nits greatest citizens when Glee Smith, Jr., passed away at age 94. \nToday, I pay tribute to Glee and celebrate his life, his legacy, and \nhis service to our State and Nation.\n  Glee was born and raised in 1921 in Rozel--a rural central Kansas \ntown with a population of 156. After high school, like so many members \nof our ``greatest generation,'' Glee served our Nation during World War \nII as a first lieutenant in the Army Air Corps.\n  After the war, he returned to further his education at the University \nof Kansas, where he earned a bachelor's degree in journalism in 1943 \nand a juris doctorate in 1947. During this time, Glee married Gerry \nBuhler, his wife of more than 70 years. Together, they moved southwest \nto Larned, where Glee partnered with Maurice Wildgen to found the \nWildgen & Smith Law Firm. Within 2 years of establishing his law \npractice, Glee was elected to his first position of public service as \nPawnee County attorney and later to the Larned Board of Education, on \nwhich he served for 12 years.\n  These two roles provided the bedrock for Glee's work on behalf of \nKansans and instilled a deep respect for the rule of law and commitment \nto education. He was a 67-year member of the Kansas Bar Association--20 \nof which were spent as a member of the Board of Governors. In addition, \nPresident Gerald Ford appointed Glee to the First Board of Directors of \nthe National Legal Services Corporation, which he served on from 1975 \nto 1979. He also served on the Kansas Board of Regents for 8 years, \nincluding 2 as chairman. These are just a few of the many other causes \nthat Glee took part in and often ended up leading. Many remember Glee's \nleadership from his 16 years in the Kansas State Senate, during which \nhe served as Judiciary Committee chairman, Ways and Means Committee \nchairman and president of the senate for his final 8 years.\n  The comments left on Glee's obituary in the Lawrence Journal-World do \nservice to the impression that he left on those around him:\n  ``Glee was a great person and a true gentleman[.] He was a great \nperson to work with in governmental affairs and socially as well.''\n  ``[I] loved his stories of how Ger[ry] and he met and that he loved \nher from the moment he saw her!!! Their love and devotion have been \ninspiring . . . It was an honor to get to know him.''\n  ``There will always be an empty seat at First Presbyterian Church \nwhere Glee sat beside his beloved Gerry. He was a stately gentleman and \na truly gentle man. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him.''\n  ``One of the rewards of serving on the Kansas 4-H Foundation was \nserving alongside people like Glee. Leadership, Vision, Wisdom, Caring, \nFriend--a few words that describe Glee Smith.''\n  ``Although his impact was great in his efforts on behalf of the State \nof Kansas and KU, it was most significant in all the lives he touched \nalong the way.''\n  Glee Smith taught through his actions that true satisfaction in life \ncomes from service to others. This is the legacy we should all hope to \nleave behind for the next generation.\n  I always believe what happens in the nation's capital is important, \nbut the truth is that we change the world one person at a time. While \nour work in the Senate matters, much more is accomplished by a person \nlike Glee. I would ask my Senate colleagues to join me in extending our \nsympathies to Glee's wife; three children, Sid, Stephen, and Susan; \nthree grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren as they begin this \nnew year in the absence of their loved one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8880-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8880-S8881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             REMEMBERING MAJOR GENERAL WILL HILL TANKERSLEY\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to MG \nWill Hill Tankersley, a patriot and friend. General Tankersley died \nSaturday, November 28, 2015, at the age of 87. General Tankersley \nexemplified the attributes of service, loyalty, and, perhaps most \nprecious to him, duty. He leaves behind an adoring family, generations \nof friends and admirers, and a legacy that will persist long after his \npassing.\n  He was born February 28, 1928, to a family with deep roots in \nAlabama. In fact, his grandfather settled around what would become \nMontgomery in 1815, 4 years before Alabama achieved statehood. When \nonly a boy, his father, Felix Marcus Tully, passed away, leaving him in \nthe care of his mother, ``Miss Corrie'' Melton Hill. His paternal \ngrandfather, Judge Will Hill, became a father-figure to young Will \nHill, ensuring his mother and her young family were provided for and \nthat Will Hill and his brothers received an education.\n  Despite facing these difficult odds, Will Hill attended the Citadel \nand Marion Military Institute before gaining acceptance to West Point, \nfrom which he graduated in 1950. Soon after graduation, before his \nclass had even gone through basic training, he was sent into combat in \nKorea, serving six campaigns as a combat infantryman. For his service, \nhe was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, Bronze Star, and Combat \nInfantry Badge.\n  The West Point Class of 1950 has the tragic distinction of suffering \nthrough some of the heaviest wartime losses in the history of the \nacademy; he was one of only six of his classmates in his regiment not \nkilled, wounded, or captured. In fact, at the age of 23, then-\nLieutenant Tankersley had the unfortunate distinction of being the \noldest living infantry lieutenant in the 19th Infantry Regiment.\n  It was in 1953 while stationed at Fort Benning that he met Theda \nClark Ball, also of Montgomery, whom he soon married. She was the love \nof his life, and her special place in his heart remained after her \ndeath in 2013, after almost 60 years of marriage.\n  Once leaving the regular Army, Will Hill returned to Montgomery and \njoined the investment bank Sterne Agee & Leach. His 45 years at Sterne \nAgee saw him rise to the top of the organization, becoming a vice \npresident, board member, senior vice president, chairman of the \nexecutive committee of the board of directors, president of the \ncompany, and finally the vice chairman emeritus for life. He retired in \nOctober of 2003.\n  General Tankersley's dedication to principle and sense of civic duty \nto his city, State, and country are well known.\n\n[[Page S8881]]\n\n  Among his many distinctions are Montgomery Citizen of the Year for \n1992; two terms as chairman of the Montgomery Chamber of Commerce; \nchairman of the Montgomery Area Committee of 100; chairman of Auburn \nUniversity College of Business Advisory Counsel; the distinguished \nalumnus from Auburn University College of Business; and Marion Military \nInstitute Alumnus of the Year.\n  General Tankersley also served on the board of visitors of the Air \nUniversity at Maxwell Air Force Base; as president of the Montgomery \nRotary Club; a member of the board of directors for the Montgomery \nAcademy; a member of the board of directors for the Tukabatchee Area \nCounsel Boy Scouts of America; senior warden of St. John's Episcopal \nChurch--having served 5 years on its vestry; one of eight directors of \nthe Governor's Management Improvement Program for Alabama; and chairman \nof the Education Committee on Community Government.\n  After Active Duty, Will Hill remained in the U.S. Army Reserve, \neventually rising to the rank of major general. He served as the \ncivilian aide to the Secretary of the Army for the State of Alabama; \nwas nominated as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs \nby President Ford, serving 3 years; was appointed during the George \nH.W. Bush administration as chairman of the Reserve Forces Policy \nBoard, principal adviser to the Secretary of Defense on matters \nconcerning the National Guard and Reserves; and was appointed in 2001 \nby George W. Bush as one of 11 commissioners on the American Battle \nMonuments Commission.\n  General Tankersley is survived by three children: his daughter, \nTheda, and sons Will Hill, Jr., and David.\n  I mentioned earlier the high value General Tankersely placed on the \nconcept of duty and of meeting the requirements imposed upon those \nbound to it. He not only lived a life bound by this code but \nproselytized its virtues to others. In 1995, when I was attorney \ngeneral of Alabama, he sent me a framed quotation of General Lee, still \nin my office today, which reads ``Duty is the sublimest word in the \nEnglish Language.'' Accompanying this gift was an encouraging note \nserving as both a call to arms and an offer of his services reading in \npart:\n\n       In the event you ever feel the urge to let bygones be \n     bygones, to overlook the transgressions of those in public \n     office who have violated the law, abused the public trust, \n     and brought dishonor on Alabama and hurt its image or to \n     believe these miscreants did not know what they were doing \n     and shouldn't be prosecuted--call me, night or day, and I'll \n     come to where you are and remind you of General Lee's words.\n       The Philistines are all around us and they are many and we \n     are few; we must keep the faith and do our duty if government \n     of, by and for the people is to exist in our state.\n\n  General Tankersley represented the best of Alabama and her values. He \nwas a true patriot and a man of great character. He will be greatly \nmissed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8881-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8881-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8881-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:27 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2029) making \nappropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n2016, and for other purposes, with amendments, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate.\n  The message also announced that the House agrees to the amendment of \nthe Senate to the bill (H.R. 3594) to extend temporarily the Federal \nPerkins Loan program, and for other purposes.\n\n\n               Enrolled Bills and Joint Resolution Signed\n\n  At 11:41 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills and joint resolution:\n\n       H.R. 3594.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \ncarry out certain major medical facility projects for which \nappropriations are being made for fiscal year 2016; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I speak today regarding the \nintroduction of a bill, cosponsored by Senators Boxer and Cardin, to \nprovide the Department of Veterans Affairs with the authority to \nobligate and expend appropriated funds in order to begin construction \non critical projects in California, Kentucky, Maryland, and Washington. \nThis is time-sensitive legislation, and I am working with my colleague \nand friend Chairman Isakson to move the bill by unanimous consent as \nsoon as a final fiscal year 2016 funding measure is enacted.\n  Last month, the Senate passed the fiscal year 2016 Military \nConstruction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations \nAct, which provided $822,800,000 for major construction projects at \nthese Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. This bill passed without a \nsingle vote cast against it.\n  However, the Department of Veterans Affairs cannot spend the money \nappropriated for fiscal year 2016 and begin construction on these \nprojects because it lacks a separate authorization, which is required \nby law.\n  The legislation I am introducing today simply provides the \nauthorization, as required by law, to allow the Department to move \nforward its fiscal year 2016 projects.\n  The fiscal year 2016 projects include critical, time-sensitive \nseismic safety corrections to structures in San Francisco, West Los \nAngeles, Long Beach, and American Lake. These buildings, which include \nhealth care facilities, veteran housing, and a community living center, \nare at an exceptionally high risk of collapse or suffering severe \ndamage during an earthquake.\n  If a major earthquake struck in proximity to one of these medical \ncenters while it was in use by veterans and the department's employees, \nthere could be numerous injuries and deaths.\n  The U.S. Geological Survey estimates there is a greater than 99 \npercent chance that a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake will strike \nCalifornia in the next 30 years.\n  It is important to note that even less severe earthquakes can cause \ndamage to seismically unsafe buildings that result in injuries and \ndeaths. The California Governor's Office of Emergency Services believes \nthat the damage to seismically unfit buildings caused by the magnitude \n6.0 earthquake that hit Napa, California on August 24, 2014, at 3:20 \na.m., would likely have resulted in many more deaths and injuries if it \nhad struck during business hours when these structures were in use. As \nit was, the earthquake caused over 200 injuries and one fatality.\n  In fact, the U.S. Geological Survey estimates that a 6.0 magnitude \nearthquake hits California every 1.2 years on average. This is a \nterrifying figure, and it is why I strongly believe that Congress must \nenact this legislation without delay.\n  This is not a hypothetical situation. In 1971, the devastating San \nFernando 6.6 magnitude earthquake struck and caused a total of 58 \ndeaths. The older, deficient buildings at the San Fernando VA medical \ncenter were demolished, killing 30 patients and 10 staff. The \ndestruction on the Federal Government's VA campus was responsible for \nthe majority of all deaths reported in this earthquake. Had the Federal \nbuildings been structurally sound, there is a likelihood that many of \nthese deaths could have been prevented. If there are any Senators in \nthis body who might want to delay moving the fiscal year 2016 \nconstruction authorizations, I urge them to think long and hard about \nthis tragic event.\n  In 2015, Congress did not authorize the Department's major \nconstruction projects until this past September; 10 months after funds \nwere appropriated by Congress in the fiscal year 2015 Omnibus. I \nbelieve it would be a huge disserve to our veterans to allow such a \nlengthy delay to occur again.\n  More hearings and delays are unnecessary to determine whether the \nSenate should pass this legislation. The Senate Appropriations \nCommittee held hearings with the Department on these projects as it \nreviewed the President's fiscal year 2016 budget request. The Senate \nCommittee marked up and reported the Military Construction, Veterans \nAffairs, and Related Agencies appropriations bill in a bipartisan \nfashion. The Senate voted in a unanimous fashion to pass this bill just \nlast month.\n  I also understand there are concerns about the effectiveness of the \nDepartment's construction process, but the Senate's appropriations bill \nalso included important provisions requiring the Department to work \nclosely with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on improving the \nmanagement controls for its next major construction projects.\n  I want to reiterate that without a separate authorization, the \nDepartment cannot start this vital work to protect our veterans and \nfederal employees.\n  This is exactly why Americans believe that the Federal Government \ndoes not work. How does Congress explain this unnecessary delay to \nveterans who go to medical appointments in the buildings at risk of \ncollapse or major damage? There is no reason to delay authorizing these \nprojects when the money has already been appropriated.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in quickly approving this legislation \nso that the fiscal year 2016 construction projects can move forward. \nCongress must act before the next earthquake strikes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8885-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8885-S8886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 338--CONGRATULATING TOWSON UNIVERSITY ON THE 150TH \n             ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Ms. Mikulski) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

in \n     violation of the laws of any State, or the United States,'';\n       Whereas the President, with the assistance of the Secretary \n     of State and the Ambassador at Large for War Crimes Issues, \n     is obligated under section 2113(b) of the ADVANCE Democracy \n     Act of 2007 (22 U.S.C. 8213(b)) to ``collect information \n     regarding incidents that may constitute crimes against \n     humanity, genocide, slavery, or other violations of \n     international humanitarian law'' and ``shall consider what \n     actions can be taken to ensure that any government of a \n     country or the leaders or senior officials of such government \n     who are responsible for crimes against humanity, genocide, \n     slavery, or other violations of international humanitarian \n     law identified [pursuant to such collection of information] \n     are brought to account for such crimes in an appropriately \n     constituted tribunal'';\n       Whereas Article I of the Convention and the law of nations \n     confirm that government authorities are obligated to prevent \n     and punish acts constituting genocide, crimes against \n     humanity, and war crimes;\n       Whereas, on July 10, 2015, Pope Francis, Supreme Pontiff of \n     the Catholic Church, declared that the pattern of crimes \n     committed by ISIS and its affiliates against Christians are \n     part of a ``third world war, waged piecemeal, which we are \n     now experiencing,'' and that ``a form of genocide is taking \n     place, and it must end'';\n       Whereas the 2011 Presidential Study Directive on Mass \n     Atrocities declares, ``Preventing mass atrocities and \n     genocide is a core national security interest and a core \n     moral responsibility of the United States. . . [and that] our \n     options are never limited to either sending in the military \n     or standing by and doing nothing. . . The actions that can be \n     taken are many--they range from economic to diplomatic \n     interventions, and from non-combat military actions to \n     outright intervention.'';\n       Whereas, on August 7, 2014, President Barak Obama \n     authorized military action to stop ISIS' advance in northern \n     Iraq, and ``to prevent a potential act of genocide'' against \n     Yazidis stranded on Mount Sinjar;\n       Whereas, on August 7, 2014, Secretary of State John Kerry, \n     stated that ISIS' ``campaign of terror against the innocent, \n     including Yezedi and Christian minorities, and its grotesque \n     and targeted acts of violence bear all the warning signs and \n     hallmarks of genocide'';\n       Whereas, on March 27, 2015, the Office of the United \n     Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that its \n     mission to Iraq had ``gathered reliable information about \n     acts of violence perpetrated against civilians because of \n     their affiliation or perceived affiliation to an ethnic or \n     religious group,'' that the ``[e]thnic and religious groups \n     targeted by ISIL include Yezidis, Christians, Turkmen, Sabea-\n     Mandeans, Kaka'e, Kurds and Shia,'' and stated, ``It is \n     reasonable to conclude, in the light of the information \n     gathered overall, that some of\n\n[[Page S8888]]\n\n     those incidents may constitute genocide. Other incidents may \n     amount to crimes against humanity or war crimes.'';\n       Whereas the United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom (USCIRF) has ``called on the U.S. \n     government to designate the Christian, Yazidi, Shi'a, \n     Turkmen, and Shabak communities of Iraq and Syria as victims \n     of genocide by ISIL'' and USCIRF Chairman Robert P. George \n     has observed that ``ISIL's intent to destroy religious groups \n     that do not subscribe to its extremist ideology in the areas \n     of Iraq and Syria that it controls, or seeks to control, is \n     evident in, not only its barbarous acts, but also its own \n     propaganda''; and\n       Whereas members of the International Association of \n     Genocide Scholars, in their Appeal to Congress of September \n     9, 2015, stated, ``ISIS's mass murders of Chaldean, Assyrian, \n     Melkite Greek, and Coptic Christians, Yazidis, Shi'a Muslims, \n     Sunni Kurds and other religious groups meet even the \n     strictest definition of genocide.'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) finds that ISIS, its affiliated organizations, and \n     supporters are parts of an expanding, worldwide criminal \n     network, the members of which have pledged allegiance to its \n     leaders, support its actions, act in concert with them, claim \n     credit for targeted killings, and are ``fully aware that \n     [their] participation'' and support will ``assist [in] the \n     commission'' of its crimes;\n       (2) finds that ISIS and its affiliated organizations \n     maintain sophisticated publishing and social media networks \n     that seek to attract others to join their efforts and seek to \n     incite the murder of Christians, Shia and Sunni Muslims, \n     Jews, and any religious believers who refuse to convert to \n     their Wahhabi-Salafist jihadist ideology;\n       (3) declares that ISIS and its leaders should be charged \n     with genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes;\n       (4) calls upon on the Attorney General to investigate and \n     prosecute any United States citizens or residents alleged to \n     be perpetrators of or complicit in these crimes and to report \n     back to Congress regarding what steps are being taken to \n     investigate and prosecute those involved;\n       (5) calls upon the Secretary of the Treasury to investigate \n     and sanction any person, organization, business, or financial \n     institution alleged to be perpetrators of or complicit in \n     these crimes, and to report back to Congress regarding what \n     additional authority, if any, is needed to disrupt ISIS \n     financial support networks;\n       (6) calls upon the President to authorize the Secretary of \n     State, the Under Secretary of State for Democracy and Global \n     Affairs, and the Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues to \n     cooperate in the collection of forensic evidence of crimes \n     against humanity, genocide, war crimes, slavery, or other \n     violations of international humanitarian law;\n       (7) calls on the President, the Secretary of State, and the \n     United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations, \n     working through the United Nations Security Council and its \n     member states as appropriate, to accelerate the \n     implementation of an immediate, coordinated, and sustained \n     response to provide humanitarian assistance, protect \n     civilians, build resilience, and help reestablish livelihoods \n     for displaced and persecuted persons in their communities of \n     origin;\n       (8) calls upon the contracting parties to the United \n     Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \n     Crime of Genocide, signed at Paris December 9, 1948, and \n     other international agreements forbidding war crimes and \n     crimes against humanity, to join with the United States in an \n     effort to investigate, arrest, and prosecute individual and \n     organizational perpetrators responsible for these crimes;\n       (9) calls upon the United Nations Secretary-General to urge \n     all United Nations member states to cooperate in an \n     international effort to investigate, try, and prosecute all \n     cases in which prosecutors can prove that the accused have \n     committed crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide;\n       (10) makes an urgent appeal to the Cooperation Council for \n     the Arab States of the Gulf to collaborate on the \n     establishment and operation of domestic, regional, and hybrid \n     international tribunals with jurisdiction to punish the \n     individuals and organizations responsible for or complicit in \n     actions that constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity, \n     and genocide;

which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 341\n\n       Whereas carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that \n     is produced whenever any fuel, such as natural gas, propane, \n     gasoline, oil, kerosene, wood, or charcoal, is burned;\n       Whereas devices that produce carbon monoxide include cars, \n     boats, gasoline engines, stoves, and heating systems, and \n     carbon monoxide produced from these sources can build up in \n     enclosed or semi-enclosed spaces;\n       Whereas carbon monoxide is often referred to as the \n     ``silent killer'' because it is colorless, odorless, \n     tasteless, and nonirritating, and ignoring early stages of \n     carbon monoxide poisoning may cause unconsciousness and \n     continual exposure to danger;\n       Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, each year in the United States, carbon monoxide \n     poisoning kills more than 400 individuals and sends \n     approximately 20,000 individuals to emergency rooms;\n       Whereas when people breathe in carbon monoxide, the \n     poisonous gas enters the bloodstream and prevents adequate \n     intake of oxygen, which can damage tissues and result in \n     death;\n       Whereas individuals older than the age of 65, given common \n     preexisting medical conditions, are particularly vulnerable \n     to carbon monoxide poisoning;\n       Whereas for most individuals who suffer from carbon \n     monoxide poisoning, the early signs of exposure to low \n     concentrations of carbon monoxide include mild headaches and \n     breathlessness after moderate exercise;\n       Whereas sustained or increased exposure to carbon monoxide \n     can lead to flu-like symptoms, including severe headaches, \n     dizziness, tiredness, nausea, confusion, irritability, and \n     impaired judgment, memory, and coordination;\n       Whereas breathing in low concentrations of carbon monoxide \n     can cause long-term health damage, even after exposure to the \n     gas ends;\n       Whereas most cases of carbon monoxide exposure occur during \n     the winter months of December, January, and February when oil \n     and gas heaters are more heavily in use;\n       Whereas on January 5, 1996, the Burt family of Kimball, \n     Minnesota, was poisoned by carbon monoxide from a \n     malfunctioning furnace in the home of the Burt family, \n     resulting in--\n       (1) the deaths of 15-month-old Zachary Todd Burt and 4-\n     year-old Nicholas Todd Burt; and\n       (2) the hospitalization of Ryan Todd Burt;\n       Whereas Cheryl Burt, the mother of Zachary, Nicholas, and \n     Ryan Burt, has worked to educate the public about the dangers \n     of carbon monoxide poisoning, including by testifying in \n     December 2009 before the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation of the Senate;\n       Whereas Cheryl Burt has advocated for the Nicholas and \n     Zachary Burt Memorial Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention \n     Act, which would establish a Federal grant program for State \n     and tribal carbon monoxide poisoning prevention activities;\n       Whereas on January 17, 2009, Amanda J. Hansen, a junior and \n     member of the swim team at West Seneca West High School, in \n     West Seneca, New York, passed away from carbon monoxide \n     poisoning while sleeping near a faulty basement boiler during \n     a sleepover party;\n       Whereas Amanda J. Hansen loved Spanish, was a member of the \n     Spanish Honor Society at West Seneca West High School, and \n     wanted to eventually teach Spanish;\n       Whereas Amanda J. Hansen hoped to attend college at the \n     University of North Carolina;\n       Whereas responding to tragedy, Ken and Kim Hansen \n     established the Amanda Hansen Foundation to honor their \n     daughter by raising money for a scholarship fund and \n     spreading awareness about the dangers of carbon monoxide and \n     the importance of taking safety measures, such as using \n     carbon monoxide detectors in residences;\n       Whereas the Amanda Hansen Foundation works with lawmakers \n     and local communities to educate the public on the dangers of \n     carbon monoxide poisoning;\n       Whereas the Amanda Hansen Foundation raises money to \n     purchase carbon monoxide detectors for individuals who cannot \n     afford the detectors and has given away 17,000 carbon \n     monoxide detectors;\n       Whereas the Amanda Hansen Foundation and Ken and Kim Hansen \n     through their work with the Foundation collaborate with other \n     national organizations to ensure that carbon monoxide \n     detectors are as ubiquitous as possible;\n       Whereas the Hansen family fought in 2010 for the passage of \n     ``Amanda's Law'', a law that mandates the installation of \n     carbon monoxide detectors in new and existing residences with \n     fuel-burning appliances and the replacement of carbon \n     monoxide detectors every 5 years;\n       Whereas the Amanda Hansen Foundation has paid to replace \n     furnaces in the Buffalo, New York area with furnaces that are \n     safer and more energy efficient; and\n       Whereas in memory of their daughter, the Hansen family has \n     worked tirelessly to make New York and the rest of the United \n     States a safer place: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates January 2016 as \n     ``National Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Awareness Month''.\n\n[[Page S8889]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/18/senate-section/article/S8889-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 342--CONGRATULATING THE WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL TEAM OF \n    WHEELING JESUIT UNIVERSITY ON WINNING THE DIVISION II NATIONAL \n                              CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mrs. CAPITO (for herself and Mr. Manchin) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
