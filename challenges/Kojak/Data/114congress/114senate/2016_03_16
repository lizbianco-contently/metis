Mr. President, in just a few minutes President Obama will \nofficially announce his nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court. In \nconsidering a nomination to the highest Court in the Nation, the \nPresident has said he would adhere to three important principles: \nFirst, the nominee must possess impeccable credentials. That means an \noutstanding education, critical judicial experience, and an expert \nunderstanding of the law. Second, the nominee should have a keen \nawareness of the judiciary's role. That means understanding the Court's \nconstitutional place in our government, and its limitations; third, and \nfinally, life experience. A qualified Supreme Court Justice is someone \nwith an understanding of the realities that Americans face each and \nevery day.\n  I have no doubt how hard this must have been for the President. I \nhave no doubt President Obama's nominee will possess these important \nattributes just outlined. Once President Obama has done his \nconstitutional duty and announced publicly this nominee, it will then \nfall upon the Senate to provide its advice and consent. For 100 years \nwe have had these hearings in public, going back to during Justice \nBrandeis' hearing.\n  The Republican leader has made it clear that he and his caucus have \nno intention of considering the nominee. It is hard to comprehend but \nthat is what he said, and it appears at this stage, basically, all \nRepublicans have fallen in line with this. I hope President Obama's \nnomination of an exceptionally qualified and consensus nominee will \npersuade Senate Republicans to change course. I do hope they will do \ntheir constitutional duty and give President Obama's nominee a meeting, \na hearing, and a vote. He is doing his job this morning. Republicans \nshould do theirs this morning too.\n  Mr. President, will the Presiding Officer announce the business of \nthe day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/senate-section/article/S1515-9", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1515-S1516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to express my disappointment that \nwe have not yet been able to come to an agreement on the issue of GMO \nlabeling. Senator Roberts and I have a long history of friendship and \nof working together. We have both worked very hard to come to an \nagreement on an extremely difficult and emotional issue. I thank him \nfor his continual work, and I am forever the optimist that we will get \nthere, even though we are not there yet. We have continued to work, and \nmy team and I have continued to work, to find common ground, all the \nway until very late last night. If we at this point do not proceed but \ncan have some more time, I believe it is possible for us to come \ntogether in a bipartisan solution.\n  While this debate has been difficult, there are some important areas \nwhere Senator Roberts and I agree. For instance, Senator Roberts and I \nagree that the science has shown us that biotechnology is safe.\n  In fact, leading health organizations like the American Medical \nAssociation, the National Academy of Sciences, the FDA, and the World \nHealth Organization all say there is no evidence that GMOs aren't safe. \nWe agree that biotechnology is an important tool for farmers and \nranchers, particularly as we tackle the challenges of climate change--\nwhich, by the way, science also tells us is real. I believe in science, \nand I would love if we would all come together around the science on \nboth of these issues.\n  We have to tackle the need to feed a growing, hungry world. We agree \nthat a 50-State patchwork of labeling laws is not a workable long-term \nsolution. In fact, I don't know any Member on any side of this issue in \nthe Senate who doesn't agree with that, that we have to have a national \napproach, not 50 different States. But we also know, as we have \nfrequently debated States' rights, the importance of States making \ndecisions, that when we preempt States, whether it is on fuel \nefficiency standards for automobiles or whether it is on food labeling, \nthe approach has always been to go from 50 different States doing 50 \ndifferent things to having a national standard and a national approach. \nAs it was with CAFE standards, in which I was very involved, it is \nimportant that it work from an industry standpoint. I know it can be \ndone, and it is our job to get to that point.\n  We also recognize, though, that a growing number of American \nconsumers want to know more about the food they eat, and they have the \nright to know. They have the right to know what is in their food.\n  I was very proud of the fact that we came together on the last farm \nbill to recognize all parts of agriculture. The fastest growing part of \nagriculture is the organic sector. We gave more opportunities to \nsupport the organic sector, the local food movement.\n  People should have choices in deciding what food they eat, how it is \ngrown, how it is processed, and that is something we have said in \nnational policy that we support through our agricultural policies. \nUnfortunately, the Senate is poised to vote on a bill that I do not \nsupport, that does not fully answer this demand from consumers. \nConsumers want information about the food they eat, it is as simple as \nthat. In fact, the bill continues the status quo on providing \ninformation to consumers. It lists a number of things, many of which \nare already being done, 1-800 numbers and so on. Look at the back of \nthe pack; it lists things, but they are things that are already being \ndone--not all but many, enough--and then says: We will keep the status \nquo nationally, but we will preempt the States and citizens around the \ncountry from taking individual action. I don't support that. That is \nnot good enough. It doesn't reflect what we do when we are talking \nabout Federal policy. That is one reason I think the approach put \nforward in the bill is the wrong path.\n  Unfortunately, we have seen a lot of emotion around this issue on \nboth sides--a lot of emotion. Frankly, there is a lot of confusion \nabout GMOs and their safety, which is why I think this approach is the \nwrong approach. We should be telling the story, as should farmers, of \nbiotechnology and the importance that it plays in our food production \nand in food security. We should not be taking action that further \nappears to stop consumers from getting the information they want and \nfeeds into the idea that there is something wrong, that there is a \nreason to hide, because there is not. We should embrace this \nopportunity to share with the public what is in our food, talk about \nit, why we use these crops, why they are deemed safe.\n  That is why, during the last several months of negotiations with \nChairman Roberts, I offered several proposals that would shed light on \nthis issue and do it in a way that is eminently workable for those \ninvolved in the food industry. While those proposals were not \nultimately accepted, I still believe we need and can achieve a policy \nthat creates a uniform national system of disclosure for the use of GMO \ningredients and do it in a way that has common sense and works for \neverybody. The national disclosure system needs to provide real options \nfor disclosing information about GMOs that work for both consumers and \nfood companies.\n  I believe we must create a system that provides certainty as well to \nour food companies and all of our companies--national, organic, \ntraditional companies. Everyone knows that a 50-State system with 50 \ndifferent definitions, 50 different laws, and 50 different ways to do \npackaging doesn't work, so we all have a need to come together and to \nfix this. I also believe that a system must work for all companies--\nvery small companies, medium-sized companies, and large companies as \nwell.\n  I believe we must not harm the important work being done by our \norganic producers. Again, we made great strides in the farm bill, and \nwe need to keep the choices that are in the marketplace now available \nto consumers and not pass something that will infringe on any of the \nchoices consumers have.\n  I am disappointed that we have not yet been able to come to a clear \nconsensus on the issue of GMO labeling. I know this issue is \ncontentious. As I said, it is very emotional on all sides. As far as I \nam concerned, it is time for us to come together on a thoughtful, \ncommonsense approach that is best for consumers, for farmers, for \nfamilies, and for our country.\n  We have the most successful agricultural system, food economy in the \nworld. We are the envy of the world. We want to make sure that whatever \nwe do, we maintain that position. But part of who we are in America is \na country that believes in people's right to know information and be \nable to make their own individual choices. I believe there is a way to \ndo that, to make sure we continue to have the strongest, most vibrant, \nmost successful and robust agricultural economy and food economy in the \nworld--we are literally feeding the world--and at the same time be able \nto provide basic information that American consumers are asking to have \nprovided.\n  I will not be supporting Senator Roberts' amendment. I think this may \nbe\n\n[[Page S1517]]\n\nthe first time in the years we have worked together--both with me as \nchair and now with him as chair--that we have not come to the floor \nunited. It is not for lack of trying. We have been working very hard, \nand there are differences, but I believe that if we have the \nopportunity to keep working, we will be able to get to that spot where \nwe can come together.\n  As I urge colleagues to oppose this proposal and moving forward on \ncloture without having an agreement, I also commit to continue working \nto get there because we have to take action to solve this problem and \nit has to be done in a bipartisan way. That is how we get things done, \nand I am committed to continuing to work with our chairman and with \nMembers on both sides of the aisle so we can do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise this morning to discuss an issue \nthat is pretty near and dear to my heart and I think to the hearts of \nmany throughout the State of Alaska, and that is--I will call it an \naberration, an aberration in the fish world. What I am talking about is \ngenetically engineered salmon, GE salmon.\n  We just heard from the ranking member on the Senate Committee on \nAgriculture. I appreciate the work she has done, along with the Senator \nfrom Kansas, to try to forge a path forward as it relates to GMO, but \nwhen we are talking about genetically engineered salmon, let me make it \nvery clear that we are talking about two very distinct and different \nissues here. This is separate from the larger GMO debate.\n  Genetically engineered animals are not crops, and GE salmon is a \ngenetically engineered animal. This is something that is entirely new. \nThis is a new species. This is a new species that will potentially be \nintroduced into our markets, into our homes, and quite possibly, \ncontrary to what any environmental analysis claims, enters into our \necosystem.\n  When we are talking about the GMO, the broader GMO debate here on the \nfloor, keep in mind that when I stand up, when the other Senator from \nAlaska stands up, when Alaskans stand up to talk about genetically \nengineered salmon, we are talking about an entirely different issue.\n  I get pretty wound up about this issue. I just came from a meeting of \nabout 20 young Alaskans from around the State.\n  I said: I am sorry, I have to leave because I have to go to the floor \nto speak to this issue that is so important to us in Alaska. Do you all \nknow what genetically engineered salmon is?\n  They said: Yeah. It is kind of that fake fish.\n  It is Frankenfish, is what we call it because it is so unnatural. It \nis so unnatural that it is something that, as Alaskans, we need to \nstand up and defend against.\n  I grew up in the State of Alaska. I was born there. I know well that \nescaping from pens occurs in hatcheries, and it can occur in facilities \nwhere fish are grown. I also well know the immense value of our \nfisheries and the potential for havoc that something like this \nFrankenfish could wreak upon our wild sustainable stocks.\n  I am standing here this morning saying that I will not be supporting \ncloture on this bill, as it is an issue which is too important to so \nmany and has not yet been adequately addressed. I have attempted to \nwork with the chairman and the committee to offer sensible and what we \nbelieve are reasonable fixes, but there is no solution as of yet.\n  I am standing today demanding, asking that the voices of Alaskans, \nwho have stood with me in solidarity on this issue, be heard because we \nwill not accept that genetically engineered salmon or Frankenfish--\nwhatever it is you want to call it--we will not accept that it will be \nallowed to be sold without clear labeling because I don't want to make \nany mistakes; I don't want to find that what I have served my family is \na genetically engineered fish, and I use ``fish'' lightly.\n  We talk about Frankenfish and some people kind of snicker nervously, \nbut it is not a joke to Alaskans. This new species could pose a serious \nthreat to the livelihoods of Alaskan fishermen, and I will stand to \nsupport the livelihood of Alaskan fishermen. Alaska's fisheries are \nworld-renowned for their high quality and for their sustainability. The \nAlaska seafood industry supports more than 63,000 direct jobs and \ncontributes over $4.6 billion to the State's economy. Nearly one in \nseven Alaskans is employed in the commercial seafood industry.\n  That is how my boys put themselves through college--working in the \ncommercial fishing industry. We know about fish. For generations, my \nfamily has been involved in one way, shape, or form with the fishing \nbusiness.\n  Salmon is a major part of Alaska's seafood economy, and commercial \nfishermen around the State harvested more than 265 million salmon this \npast season, including chinook, sockeye, coho, chum, pinks--all wild.\n  As we all know, wild salmon is loaded with all of the good things in \nit that God has placed there: tremendous health benefits, lean protein, \nsource of omega-3s, B-6, B-12, Niacin--everything good, all in that \nnatural wild package.\n  More than 1.5 million people wrote to the FDA opposing approval of \ngenetically engineered salmon. So you have a groundswell of support \naround the country--this is not just from Alaskans weighing in. People \nare saying: No, we don't think this should be approved.\n  The FDA went ahead anyway. Then you have a growing number of grocery \nstores--Safeway, Kroger, Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, and Target--that \nhave all announced they are not going to sell this. They are not going \nto sell this genetically engineered species in their stores.\n  Yet, despite this immense opposition, in November of last year, the \nFDA approved AquaBounty Technologies' application for its genetically \nengineered AquAdvantage salmon. So for those of you who are not fully \ninformed on what this genetically engineered fish is--how it comes \nabout--GE salmon start from a transgenic Atlantic salmon egg. This is \nan ocean pout. It is a type of an eel. As you can see, it doesn't look \nanything like a salmon, even if you don't know your salmon very well. \nThis is a bottom-dwelling ocean pout eel.\n  They take a slice of DNA from this, a slice of DNA from a magnificent \nChinook salmon, and splice it into an Atlantic salmon egg. That egg is \nmeant to produce a fish that will grow to full size twice as fast as a \nnormal Atlantic salmon. So this is the push here--to push Mother \nNature, which creates a perfectly beautiful fabulous salmon, and to \ntake a slice of DNA here and a slice of DNA there and put it in an \nAtlantic salmon, which is a farmed fish, and grow it so that it grows \ntwice as fast as a normal fish, but growing it in penned condition, \ntheoretically, so that there is no way for escape. But are we \nguaranteed that there is no way for escape? I don't know. Show me that.\n  But what we have here, I think, is a fair question as to whether or \nnot this GE salmon can even be called a salmon. So the FDA signed off \non this last November. But they made no mandatory labeling requirement. \nInstead, they said: Labels can be voluntary. So, in other words, if you \nwant to say that this piece of fish that is in front of you in the \ngrocery store is genetically engineered--or not real--you can \nvoluntarily put that on your label. Nobody is going to do that. Nobody \nis going to voluntarily say this is genetically engineered.\n  So what we have done--what I have done--is to fight to secure a \nmandatory labeling requirement both before approval of AquaBounty's \napplication and since its approval. So we have been working hard on \nthis issue. We have made some significant headway. But what we are \ndealing with on the floor right now--this legislation--would wipe that \nwork clean, instead of using legislative tools at our disposal to \neffectively and precisely amend this legislation in order to address \nthe issue of GE salmon.\n  So what we did is that we got some language in the Omnibus \nappropriations bill that requires the FDA not to allow the introduction \nof any food that contains GE salmon until it publishes final labeling \nguidelines that inform consumers of that content. So what this did is \nthat this kind of forced the FDA to issue an import alert, which \neffectively bans all imports of genetically engineered salmon for 1 \nyear.\n  But it also directs the FDA to spend funds--significant funds--of no \nless than $150,000 to develop labeling guidelines and to implement a \nprogram to\n\n[[Page S1518]]\n\ndisclose to consumers whether salmon offered for sale to consumers is \ngenetically engineered.\n  Again, what we want to be able to do is to let consumers know whether \nthis fish is genetically engineered or not. So we thought that was a \npretty clear labeling mandate to the FDA. But the FDA then later came \nback to us and said they felt that there was still clarifying \nlegislation that we needed to do. So I have worked with Senator \nSullivan, my colleague from Alaska, as well as Senators Cantwell, \nMerkley, and Heinrich, and we introduced S. 738, which is the \nGenetically Engineered Salmon Risk Reduction Act.\n  We also introduced a separate piece of legislation to respond to the \nFDA's November approval. We introduced S. 2640, the Genetically \nEngineered Salmon Labeling Act. What that bill would do is kind of to \nbuild on last year's omnibus provisions and would require labeling of \ngenetically engineered salmon through language that I received through \ntechnical assistance working with the FDA on this.\n  Additionally, we would mandate a third-party scientific review of the \nFDA's environmental assessment of AquAdvantage salmon and the effects \nthat these GE salmon would have on wild stocks and ecosystems, which, \nin my opinion--and I think, in the opinion of many others--were \ninsufficiently addressed during the FDA's environmental assessment.\n\n  So we have been working with the FDA on this, to develop this \nlanguage to mandate labeling. The FDA has been cooperative at this \npoint working on this issue. That really is a significant step forward.\n  But it required me to do something that maybe others are perhaps a \nlittle more active on--to place a hold on a nominee. I placed a hold on \nthe FDA Commissioner, Dr. Robert Califf. This is not something that I \ndo lightly. I have not placed a hold on a nominee before. I don't take \nthis action lightly. But it was necessary. It was necessary to bring to \nthe attention of the FDA the significance of this issue and the \nseriousness of what we were dealing with.\n  So we got FDA to the table. We have been working with them. They have \nbeen listening. They have been helpful. We are so close to resolving \nthis. Now we are on the floor with GMO legislation. Again, as I said at \nthe outset, GMO is different than what we are dealing with in this \ngenetically engineered species, a new species designed for human \nconsumption here.\n  My concern is that with the GMO bill before us now, it really does \nthreaten the good progress we have made at this point in time. It is \nnot just the progress that the Alaska delegation made but really the \nwork of so many Alaskans, the bipartisan hard-working efforts of so \nmany around the country who share the same concerns.\n  I think we have offered some pretty sensible solutions. I will \ncontinue to offer them. I will continue my efforts to work with the \nchairman, for whom I have great respect. Know that, while it is not \nopposition to the overall bill or its underpinnings, where my concern \nremains is mistakenly allowing genetically engineered salmon into our \nhomes, mislabeled as salmon.\n  This is something that we will continue to raise awareness on and \nraise the issue until we have finally and fully resolved it.\n\n\n                         Iditarod Sled Dog Race\n\n  Mr. President, if I still have a few minutes more this morning, I \nwould like to switch topics and speak about the last great race--the \nlast great race in Alaska and really around the world, which is the \nIditarod sled dog race, a 1,049-mile race from south central Alaska to \nNome, AK, where man-and-dog teams are up against Mother Nature, \nimprobably one of the most incredible human and animal endeavors that \nare out there.\n  Yesterday, we saw the conclusion. We greeted the front runner to the \n44th Iditarod sled dog race. So for 44 years now, it is an amazing race \nfrom Willow to Nome. Again, when you think about man and dog out on the \nice, out in the raw wilderness for 1,000 miles, this race has been \ndescribed as the equivalent of an attempt at Mount Everest.\n  When you think about all that is Alaska and the open spaces, the \nindependent people, and just man against nature or woman against \nnature, it is really the Iditarod that epitomizes so much of it. It \ndemands not only the most out of our athletes but mental conditioning \nas well. It requires exceptional endurance, courage, and sound judgment \nas you navigate these amazing places. But it is not just the men or \nwomen who are the physical athletes. It is not just their judgment that \nguides this race. It is that of the teams--the dogs themselves.\n  When you think about the amazing teamwork that goes on between a \nmusher and his or her animals--the communication and the will to go \n1,000-plus miles in extraordinary conditions--it really is something \nthat just stirs the greatest imagination. We have had Iditarods where \nteams have literally buried into the wind coming at them at 50 miles an \nhour and 30 below, in the dark, attacked by moose on the trail, losing \nthe trail, with accidents, disasters.\n  I was going to say it is like a reality TV show. Only it is not a \nreality TV show. It is what Alaskans and many around the world engage \nin. The mushers themselves are remarkable. I could stand here on the \nfloor and talk all morning about them, but I won't.\n  I will highlight just a few of them. DeeDee Jonrowe, is a longtime \nfriend of mine. She ran her 34th Iditarod this year--talk about bravery \nand perseverance. This is a woman who the year before last lost her \nfather. This summer she and her husband lost everything they owned in a \nwildfire out in Willow, AK. The only thing that was saved were her \ndogs.\n  But she lost her sleds, her harnesses, her home, her everything. \nThen, just shortly after, she lost her mother. Her comment to me was \nthis: I am going to go back on the trail so that I can just focus. That \nis one tough woman.\n  Brent Sass is a guy who captured the lead for much of the race. He is \none of these guys who came to Alaska to be a homesteader, a wilderness \nguy. He was champion of the Yukon Quest. He rescued mushers along the \nway--an amazing guy. He was actually in front position last year and \nwas disqualified because he had an iPod and was listening to music.\n  Along the trail, there are no electronic devices. There are pretty \ntough rules in the Iditarod. Can you imagine being out on a 1,000-mile \ntrail with nobody else, and no device, no electronics for you?\n  Jeff King is an amazing guy, whose grit and determination has been at \nthe forefront of this race and so many others--a multiple winner. But \nhe was involved with a horribly tragic accident when a snow machiner, a \ndrunk individual, literally attacked his team, killed one of his dogs \nand injured a couple of others.\n  It was extraordinarily difficult to handle that challenge--the \nemotion of losing a dog but also just the real tragedy and calamity of \nan accident like that. Jeff has finished the race in the top 10, which \nis remarkable.\n  Another remarkable feat, though, is Aly Zirkle, who finished third, \nand was also subject to an extreme scare by this same snow machiner--a \nhorribly tragic side to this year's Iditarod. But there was the fact \nthat Aly, one tough lady, came in third and persevered all the way, \njust getting her head into the game.\n  There are so many stories about these amazing men and women, but the \nwinner of this year's Iditarod is a young man named Dallas Seavey, 29 \nyears old. He crossed the finish line into Nome at 9:30 p.m. last \nnight. Dallas finished in 8 days 11 hours 20 minutes 16 seconds. This \nis his fourth overall win, and his third consecutive win. He is only \none victory away from matching the ``king'' of the Iditarod, five-time \nchampion Rick Swenson.\n  Guess who was No. 2 in the Iditarod, trailing Dallas by about 45 \nminutes. It was his dad. Father and son finished No. 1 and No. 2 in the \nIditarod. What other sport can you think of where you have a father and \nson competing against one another and coming in first and second? You \nhave to go back a ways to come up with an answer to that. It was \nabsolutely an amazing story and Alaskans watched it play out.\n  I had an opportunity to visit with the father of Mitch Seavey and the \ngrandfather of Dallas Seavey. I asked: Dan, who do you predict is going \nto win the Iditarod this year? His response was: I don't care as long \nas it is a Seavey. He was right and certainly got his wish. Alaskans \nare proud of the men and\n\n[[Page S1519]]\n\nwomen who take on these extraordinary challenges, capture the attention \nand the fascination of the world with their feats of physical and \nmental endurance. The men and women of the 44th Iditarod race are to be \ncommended and congratulated.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I wish to express my opposition \nto the legislation introduced by Senator Roberts to preempt State \nlabeling laws for genetically modified organisms, also known as GMOs.\n  The Mellman Group released a poll last year that found that 89 \npercent of Americans support mandatory labeling of GMOs. The calls and \nletters I receive from California constituents confirm widespread \nsupport for this policy. Since 2015, I have received more than 90,000 \nletters and emails from constituents who want a mandatory labeling \nstandard. Since the beginning of this year, my office has received \nnearly 2,000 calls in favor of mandatory labeling.\n  Clearly, the public wants their food to be labeled in a consistent \nand transparent manner. However, Senator Roberts' proposal would \npreempt voter-passed mandatory GMO labeling laws in Connecticut, Maine, \nand Vermont. Overriding these State laws would be a step backward for \nconsumer knowledge.\n  I recognize that the food industry cannot comply with 50 different \nState labeling laws. That is why I have cosponsored legislation \nintroduced by Senator Jeff Merkley to create a consistent, transparent \nFederal standard on how to label foods that contain GMO ingredients. \nThis legislation would require food producers to add a statement or \nsymbol after the ingredient list to state that the product contains GMO \ningredients. Companies would be given four options to meet the \nrequirement.\n  In contrast, Senator Roberts' bill makes it more difficult for \nconsumers to find out what is in their food. It requires the Department \nof Agriculture to create new, voluntary labeling guidance, despite the \nfact that the Food and Drug Administration already created voluntary \nguidance.\n  Furthermore, Senator Roberts' bill allows a confusing array of \noptions for disclosure beyond labeling. This includes 1-800 numbers, \nWeb sites, smartphone applications, and social media posts.\n  In my view, the only fair and consistent way to label food is on the \npackage in a clear, straightforward, and consistent manner. Consumers \ndo not have time to scan barcodes on food packages or to call 1-800 \nnumbers. Consumers want the information they need to make the best \nchoices for them and their families readily available on packaging. And \nI believe they deserve to have that information.\n  I want to make it clear that I recognize that the Federal Government \nand scientists agree that GMO products are safe. I also realize that \nCalifornia farmers may need to rely on genetic engineering to address \nchallenges such as climate change and disease. But I do not understand \nwhy industry is so opposed to informing consumers of how their food was \nproduced. The industry says it should only be required to label foods \nwhen there is a human health reason to do so.\n  However, the Federal Government has always had labeling requirements \nfor food that aren't due to a human health reason. These requirements \nexist because they allow consumers to make informed choices in the \nmarketplace. For example, the Federal Government requires juice that \nwas made from concentrate to be labeled ``made from concentrate.'' The \nFederal Government requires foods processed with irradiation to be \nlabeled as such. The Federal Government has a specific labeling \nrequirement for what constitutes ground beef based on what parts of a \ncow is used, the fat content, and how it is processed.\n  During this election season, many Americans have expressed a view \nthat Washington is out of touch with the rest of the country. So I want \nto ask, does Washington really want to overrule consumers who want GMO \nlabeling? Does Congress know better than the majority of American \nconsumers?\n  In my view, we should trust consumers and make sure they have the \ninformation they want on the food they buy. As such, I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose Senator Roberts' preemption legislation. Instead, \nI ask my colleagues to engage in a meaningful discussion for how we can \ncreate a mandatory standard that is flexible for industry but gives \nconsumers the information they want.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I wish to start off my remarks with \nregard to the bill that is before us. There is an article from The Hill \nnewspaper, and it is quoting Julie Borlaug, who is the granddaughter of \nNorman Borlaug, a University of Minnesota graduate who helped to spark \nthe green revolution in agriculture technology that is credited with \nsaving more than 1 billion people from dying of hunger.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from The Hill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From The Hill, Mar. 16, 2016]\n\nSafe, Proven Biotechnology Deserves Non-Stigmatizing National Labeling \n                                Standard\n\n                           (By Julie Borlaug)\n\n       Global hunger is one of the most pressing challenges of the \n     21st century and the problem will only get worse if the U.S. \n     Senate fails to take action and prevent a costly state-by-\n     state patchwork of labeling mandates for food containing \n     genetically modified organisms (GMOs).\n       In a Senate Agriculture Committee mark-up last week, Sen. \n     Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) correctly noted that ``science is an \n     essential piece of the puzzle in addressing food \n     insecurity.'' The senator also praised the legacy of my \n     grandfather, Dr. Norman Borlaug, a University of Minnesota \n     graduate who helped spark the green revolution in \n     agricultural technology that is credited with saving more \n     than 1 billion people from dying of hunger.\n       I am glad to see my grandfather's work praised. And, as an \n     associate director for the Borlaug Institute for \n     International Agriculture, I want to see his work, and the \n     work of his fellow agricultural scientists, protected. That \n     means ensuring that innovations in agricultural biotechnology \n     aren't sent to the dustbin of history, leaving future \n     generations asking why good solutions were abandoned.\n       It really comes down to a simple label. In July, Vermont is \n     set to become the first state to begin enforcing a GMO \n     labeling mandate. The impacts will be felt on store shelves \n     and in science labs around this country. Make no mistake--\n     these state labeling efforts are not about a so-called `right \n     to know' but are about enabling activists to drive GMOs out \n     of the marketplace. Leaders in the labeling movement \n     acknowledge this, with one saying ``If we have it labeled, \n     then we can organize people not to buy it.''\n       These dangerous efforts undermine the critical importance \n     of biotechnology and the role it plays in feeding the world. \n     With the help of modern science and GMOs, farmers now have \n     the ability to produce crops that better withstand droughts \n     and require fewer pesticides. They can adapt genetic codes to \n     acclimate to new environments, and ensure that crops grow \n     well despite inhospitable climates.\n       You cannot be anti-hunger and be anti-GMO. GMOs not only \n     make farming more sustainable, they directly impact national \n     and global food security at a time when warming temperatures \n     and rising populations mean that those living in poverty will \n     face increasingly unstable supplies of food.\n       The safety of GMOs is as clear as their benefits. Every \n     major scientific organization that has examined this issue \n     has concluded that they are safe as any other food. Those \n     denying their safety are denying the science.\n       By allowing state-mandated on package labeling of GMO \n     foods, Congress would be turning its back on decades of \n     advancements in biotechnology and allowing a small group of \n     activists to deny millions of people the tools that will \n     prevent starvation and death. We cannot allow that to happen.\n       Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) \n     has put forward a bipartisan proposal that would establish \n     national standards for food made with genetically-engineered \n     ingredients. The Biotech Labeling Solutions Act would prevent \n     a costly state-by-state patchwork of labeling mandates. It \n     would also help ensure that providing greater information \n     could go hand-in-hand with providing greater education at a \n     national level about the safety and importance of GMO crops. \n     The Senate Agriculture Committee supported moving his bill to \n     the full Senate by a 14-6 bipartisan vote.\n       Now, we need senators of both parties to come together to \n     support this common-sense approach.\n       Sixteen years ago, my grandfather wrote that the world \n     would soon have the agricultural technologies available to \n     feed the 8.3 billion people anticipated in the next quarter \n     of a century. The more pertinent question is whether farmers \n     and ranchers will be permitted to use these technologies.\n       The members of the Senate will decide that very question in \n     their votes on the Biotech Labeling Solutions Act. For the \n     sake of science and the world, the answer needs to be yes.\n\n[[Page S1520]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

The more pertinent question is whether farmers \n     and ranchers will be permitted to use these technologies.\n\n  I rise again to discuss my amendment numbered 3450 on biotechnology \nlabeling solutions. There has been a lot of discussion about this \namendment and this topic in general. That is a good thing. We should be \ntalking about our food, we should be talking about our farmers and \nproducers, and we should be talking about our consumers as well. It is \nimportant--extremely important--to have an honest discussion and an \nopen exchange with dialogue. After all, that is what we do in the \nSenate or at least that is what we are supposed to do. We are here to \ndiscuss difficult issues, craft compromised solutions, and finally vote \nin the best interest of our constituents. That is what we are doing \nhere today: exercising our responsibility to cast a vote for what is in \nthe best interest of those who sent us here.\n  Let's start with discussing difficult issues. The basic issue at hand \nis agriculture biotechnology labeling. If you have heard any of my \nprevious remarks, you have heard me say time and time and time again \nthat biotechnology products are safe, but you don't have to take my \nword for it. The Agriculture Committee held a hearing late last year \nwhere all three agencies in charge of reviewing biotechnology testified \nbefore our members. Over and over again the EPA, the FDA, and the USDA \ntold us that these products are safe--safe for the environment, safe \nfor other plants, and safe for our food supply. This is the gold \nstandard on what is safe with regard to agriculture biotechnology. Not \nonly are these products safe, but they also provide benefits to the \nentire value chain from producer to consumer. Through biotechnology, \nour farmers are able to grow more on less land using less water, less \nfuel, and less fertilizer, but the difficult issue we are debating \ntoday is about more than recognizing the fact that biotechnology is \nsafe. No, today our decision is about whether to prevent a wrecking \nball from hitting our entire food supply chain. The difficult issue for \nus to address is what to do about the patchwork of biotechnology \nlabeling laws that will soon wreak havoc on the flow of interstate \ncommerce, agriculture, and food products in every supermarket and every \ngrocery store up and down Main Street of every community in America. \nThat is what this is about. It is not about safety, it is not about \nhealth, and it is not about nutrition. It is all about marketing.\n  What we face today is a handful of States that have chosen to enact \nlabeling requirements on information that has nothing to do with \nhealth, safety, or nutrition. Unfortunately, the impact of these \ndecisions will be felt all across the country. Those decisions impact \nthe farmers in the fields who would be pressured to grow less efficient \ncrops so manufacturers could avoid these demonizing labels. Those \nlabeling laws will impact distributors who have to spend more money to \nsort different labels for different States. Those labeling laws will \nultimately impact consumers who will suffer from higher priced food. It \nwill cost $1,050 per year for an average family of four. That is right. \nIf we do nothing, it is not manufacturers that will pay the ultimate \nprice, it is the consumer.\n  A study released this year found that changes in the production or \nlabeling of most of the Nation's food supply for a single State would \nimpact citizens in each of our home States. The total annual increased \ncost of doing nothing today, such as not voting for cloture, could be \nas much as $82 billion every year. That is a pretty costly cloture \nvote. That is 1,050 bucks tacked onto each family's grocery bill, and \nthat is a direct hit to their pocketbooks. Let me repeat that. If we \nfail to act today--if we do not have cloture and get to this compromise \nbill--the cost to consumers would total as much as $82 billion a year \nor 1,050 bucks for hard-working American families. I don't think that \nis what my colleagues want. I don't think they want to be responsible \nfor that: a cloture vote with an $82 billion price tag? Come on.\n  This is the difficult issue we must address and the question is, How \ndo we fix it? That is why we have crafted a compromise solution and put \nit on the floor for debate and action. The amendment before us today \nstops this wrecking ball before any more damage can be done.\n\n  Two weeks ago, the Agriculture Committee passed a bill with a \nbipartisan vote of 14 to 6. I am very proud of that legislation. It \nstopped the State-by-State patchwork and provided a national voluntary \nstandard for biotechnology food products. For the first time, the \nFederal Government would set a science-based standard allowing \nconsumers to demand the marketplace provide more information. Consumers \nare growing more and more interested in their food, and that is a good \nthing. We, as consumers, should learn more about where our food comes \nfrom and what it takes to keep our food supply the safest, the most \nabundant, and the most affordable in the world. However, the role of \ngovernment in this space is to ensure that information regarding \nsafety, health, and nutritional value are expressed directly to \nconsumers, but the information in question today has nothing to do with \nsafety or health or nutrition, so the responsibility and opportunity to \ninform the consumers falls on the marketplace. If consumers want more \ninformation, they demand it by voting with their pocketbooks in the \naisles of the grocery store.\n  As our bipartisan bill has come to the floor, I have heard concerns \nthat this voluntary standard is not enough for our consumers. Yet again \nwe worked with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. The \nlegislation before us goes further than the committee-passed bill. This \nlegislation addresses concerns with a voluntary-only approach by \nproviding an incentive for the marketplace to provide consumers with \nmore information.\n  To my friends on this side of the aisle, this legislation allows the \nmarket to work. To my friends on that side of the aisle, if the \nmarketplace does not live up to their commitments, if information is \nnot made available to consumers, then this legislation holds the \nmarkets accountable by instituting a mandatory standard. It is not just \nany mandatory standard, it is a standard that provides the same options \nand mechanisms for compliance as outlined and stated publicly by our \nSecretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack.\n  Simply put, the legislation before us provides us an immediate and \ncomprehensive solution to the unworkable State-by-State patchwork \nlabeling laws. As chairman of the sometimes powerful Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, I believe this is a true compromise. Like any bill, it is \nnot perfect, and I know that, but to those who criticize this \nlegislation in one breath and say they want a compromise in the next \nbreath, I ask: Where is your plan? Where is your solution? We have \nheard the distinguished Senator from Oregon many times on this floor--\nnot a stranger to this floor--criticizing this compromise. I \nappreciate, and I am sure we all appreciate, his passion. I disagree \nwith his views, but I appreciate that he did put his plan into a bill \nand put it out for public debate. What I don't understand is why he \ndoesn't want to vote on it. Why would you put a bill out there and \ndecide not to vote on it? Why would you not vote for cloture so you can \nget to a vote on your bill? We could have voted on his legislation \ntoday. Yet when he was presented with the option to take a vote, he \ndeclined. I have read the press release where he described the \ncompromise as maintaining the status quo.\n  If the truth be known, this compromise achieves just the opposite. In \nfact, voting no today is the only way that maintains the status quo. \nVoting no today does nothing to stop the wrecking ball. Voting no today \nensures that the instability in the marketplace continues. Voting no \ntoday puts farmers and all of agriculture at risk. Voting no today \nnegatively impacts the\n\n[[Page S1521]]\n\ndaily lives of everybody in the food chain from the farmer who will be \nforced to plant fence row to fence row of a crop that is less efficient \nto the grain elevator that will have to adjust storage options to \nseparate the types of grain, to the manufacturer that will need \ndifferent labels for different States, to the distributor that will \nneed expanded storage for sorting, and to the retailer who may be \nunable to afford offering low-cost, private-label products, and, \nfinally, to the consumer who will be forced to pay for all this \nadditional cost to the tune of $82 billion.\n\n  Now we come to our final task as elected officials of this body \ntaking a vote. But before we do, we should all know that never before--\nnever before in my experience as chairman of the House Agriculture \nCommittee and chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee and all the \nyears I have had the privilege to serve on both committees--we have \nnever seen a bill in the Agricultural Committee with so much support, \nnever. Over 800 organizations all across the food and agriculture \nperspective have a stake in this bill. It is at the national and State \nand local levels. They all support the bill. The bill has the support \nof the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, the \nAmerican Farm Bureau, and many, many more.\n  Virtually every farm group is in town. I just talked to the American \nSoybean Association this past week. One farmer said: Hey, if I cannot \nhave agriculture biological crops with regard to increasing the yield \nthat I plant, what am I going to do? Am I going to plant fence row to \nfence row? Am I going to lose in this situation when farming income is \ndeclining and farm credit is getting tighter?\n  The fundamental role of the Agriculture Committee is to protect \nAmerican farmers and ranchers who provide a safe, abundant, and \naffordable food supply to a very troubled and hungry world. So I will \nbe voting yes to do just that, and I encourage my colleagues to do the \nsame. Voting no today means telling your constituents next week that \nyou are raising their grocery bill by over $1,000. Good luck with that.\n  It is a pretty simple vote. You are either for agriculture or you are \nnot.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, later this morning we continue to work \non whether to consider a food labeling bill here in the Senate. As a \ndad, I know this bill is about much more than just words or symbols or \na label. It is about the confidence we have in the food we eat and the \nfood we feed our children. As a Hoosier, I also know this bill is about \npreserving confidence in a long and proud Indiana tradition of growing \nthe food that feeds our communities and provides a safe and reliable \nfood supply for the world. Whether you are a parent or a farmer, a \nRepublican or a Democrat, our objectives in this debate should be the \nsame: to provide consumers with access to accurate information about \nthe food we eat and to do so in a way that does not mislead consumers \ninto falsely thinking their food is unsafe.\n  I believe strongly that consumers, our families, our kids, moms and \ndads, brothers and sisters deserve to feel confident in the food we \nfeed our families. I want to know how much sugar is in my ice cream and \nhow many calories are in that roast beef sandwich that I love so much. \nIt is clear from this debate that many Americans want to know even more \nabout where and how our food is produced. I believe we should have that \ninformation, and it should be easy to find.\n  It is also common sense. This information should be delivered in a \nway that is fair, that is objective, and that is based in sound \nscience. I have heard from many Hoosier farmers who are very concerned \nthat some labels or symbols on packages would amount, in consumers' \nminds, to warning labels and could send a misleading message that the \nsafe and healthy products our farmers grow--think of sweet corn in our \nfields--are somehow unhealthy or even dangerous.\n  This morning, my good friend, Senator Tom Carper from Delaware, and I \nfiled an amendment that builds off the framework of the proposal before \nus today. A framework I first suggested in the Agriculture Committee \nmarkup of this very bill. It creates a national voluntary bioengineered \nfood labeling standard. It stipulates that if food companies fail to \nmake sufficient information available, then a national food labeling \nstandard for bioengineering becomes mandatory.\n  Our amendment works for farmers, it works for manufacturers, and it \nworks for our families. It establishes ambitious goals for the \navailability of information related to bioengineering by requiring that \nafter 3 years, 80 percent of the food products covered by the \nlegislation would provide direct access to information. If the food \nindustry does not meet this threshold, then the labeling requirement \nbecomes mandatory.\n  Our amendment also requires clear and direct access to information on \nbioengineering. This could include explicit disclosures, such as \norganic or GMO-free, or voluntarily disclosing bioengineering on the \nbox. Or companies choosing to participate in the voluntary program \ncould use various electronic methods of disclosure, such as a Web site \nor a QR code in conjunction with a phone number that clearly indicates \nto consumers--to our families--where they can find more information and \nprovides direct access to that information. This is important because \nour shared goal is to provide direct access to information about the \ncontents of our food to everyone, whether you have access to the \nInternet or a smartphone or a regular phone. So let me repeat: Our \namendment allows for electronic disclosure to be used only in \nconjunction with a phone number, and both methods would have to provide \ndirect access to information on the product's contents.\n  Finally, our amendment preserves State consumer protection laws and \nremedies. States write laws to protect our citizens from mislabeled \nproducts and to provide for remedies in case of false or misleading \nstatements. Our amendment preserves those laws.\n  Consumers, our families, farmers, and food producers are looking to \nthe Senate for leadership. After months of discussion, we have been \nunable to agree yet on a proposal that gives consumers the information \nthey want in a responsible way, but the issue remains. This will be \nanother week of uncertainty for producers, for manufacturers, for our \nfamilies who do not have the information they want, and for the \nproducers and manufacturers I mentioned who don't know what is \nexpected.\n  I am going to continue to work on this issue with Senator Roberts and \nSenator Stabenow. I strongly encourage all my colleagues to consider \nthe ideas that Senator Carper and I have put forward and to try to work \nwith us to find a solution that works for America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I am rising to speak to this issue from a simple American citizen \npoint of view. The American citizen wants the right to know what is in \ntheir food. They want to know how many calories; they want to know what \nthe minerals and the vitamins are and what the ingredients are. It is a \nsimple standard because it is important to an individual to know what \nyou are putting in your mouth, what you are putting on the table for \nyour families and your children.\n  This is a principle that we have honored time and again on our \npackages. We proceeded to put on our packages whether fish is farm \nraised or wild caught because citizens wanted to know. It makes a \ndifference to them. It is their choice. It is their judgment. We put on \nour packages whether juice is from concentrate or is fresh because \ncitizens wanted to know. It is important to them. It is their right to \nknow.\n  We put the list of ingredients on the package in a simple format, not \nso that someone can spend an hour trying to research what is in it. No, \nwe have a simple 1-second test. You pick up the food off the counter, \nyou turn it over, you look at the list of ingredients and you say, this \nhas the vitamin C I wanted; this has the calories I wanted--the 1-\nsecond test.\n  That is what is at stake because the bill that is before us right now \nkills the 1-second test. It kills immediate access to information for \nconsumers. It says\n\n[[Page S1522]]\n\nwe are going to eviscerate States' rights to respond to this desire of \ncitizens to know what is in their food. This is a desire that stretches \nall across the United States, all genders, all ages, all parties. In \nfact, 9 out of 10 Americans say they want this simple information on \nthe package to meet this 1-second test just like calories.\n  Now here we are in this deeply divided Nation, this Nation in which \nwe see in this Presidential campaign extremes to the left and the right \nand everything in between, and we wonder what is happening. Isn't there \nanything we can agree on?\n  Well, the fascinating thing is that here is something we can agree \non: 80-plus percent in every category--Republicans, Democrats, \nIndependents--almost all of them near the 9-out-of-10 factor, women \nover 80 percent, men over 80 percent, young over 80 percent, old over \n80 percent. In other words, all of those are between 80 and 90 percent \nno matter who you are, where you are, what your gender is, or how old \nyou are. Nine out of ten Americans want to know what is in their food, \nand they want it easily accessible on the package.\n  My colleague talked about direct access to information. In this case, \n``direct access'' is somewhat of a term subject to interpretation \nbecause to the consumer, direct access is the 1-second test. I pick up \nthe package, I flip it over, 390 calories, thank you very much. Done. \nBut the term today is being used for indirect access.\n  Let's look at these different hall-of-mirrors proposals that are \nbeing put forward. OK. Sham No. 1 is the 800 number, an 800 number on \nthe package. What is the purpose of that 800 number? The package \ndoesn't say. There are 800 numbers on all kinds of packages. You call \nup the company and complain because there is contamination in your \nfrozen peas. What is the purpose of it? Is it so you can call the \ncompany and ask about new products coming out? Without any information \naround it, it is just a number. And citizens don't just go to a product \nand call a number. Why? Because they are busy. They are going down the \ngrocery store aisle. They have a supermarket cart. They have a child in \nthere. They want the 1-second test. They don't want to be told they \nhave to call a call center and get in a phone tree and press a bunch of \nbuttons, and then a message comes on and says: I am sorry, due to high \ncall volume, we will get to you in maybe 20 minutes, but stay on the \nline and we will play sweet music for you. And maybe--if you stay on \nthe line long enough--maybe it is not 20 minutes; maybe it is an hour. \nYou get someone in a call center overseas who is saying things in an \naccent you can't understand. Citizens hate that. And they hate pretend, \nfalse solutions. This does not mean direct access to information. This \nis direct: It is in my hand, 1 second. I see it. That is direct.\n  Now there is another idea. It is called a QR code, or quick response \ncode--quick response, computer code. Why is this on the package? No \nexplanation. So is putting something with no explanation on a package \nhelpful to consumers? No. Is it there so you can scan it when you check \nout to see what the price is? Is it there to find out about new \nproducts that are coming out from this company? Is it there because you \nmight possibly find out information about discounts? You have no idea. \nThere is no explanation. And when you use that code, you give up \npersonal information. So you have to have a phone. You have to have a \nsmartphone. You have to have a data plan. You have to give up your \nprivacy. And there is no explanation why you would even bother to go to \nit. That is completely misleading. That is why I call it the hall of \nmirrors. It is like you are at a circus. We have an 800 number, we have \na QR code, no real information, no direct access to information.\n\n  Let's be honest with the American public. Nine out of ten Americans \nwant this information presented in a simple format. A nationwide poll \nthat was done in November did a followup question: Would you prefer for \nit to be simply stated on the package or have a QR code? Again, 9 out \nof 10 said they wanted a direct statement on the package.\n  Look how much room this takes up. Isn't it a lot simpler just to put \na little symbol on there? That is all people want. They are not asking \nfor anything that takes up room or costs anything, just like it doesn't \ncost anything to put another ingredient on your package if you add it \nto your ingredient list. Labels are changed all the time.\n  I met with industry, and they said: Here are our top three \npriorities.\n  Priority No. 1 is, we want a single national standard so we don't \nhave conflicting State standards.\n  OK. That is understandable. We are on the verge of having that. In \nJuly we would have one State with a standard. There is nothing on the \nhorizon for two States. There are several States that have said: If a \nwhole bunch of States sign up, we will do something collectively. But \ncertainly we are not at risk in the months ahead of more than one State \nstandard, so there is no emergency here. But I agree with the \nunderlying principle that, indeed, when it comes to labels, a warehouse \nshouldn't have to worry about whether it is shipping product to one \nsubdivision of the State or another subdivision of the State or one \nState versus another State. So one standard is reasonable.\n  The second thing they said is, we don't want anything on the front of \nthe package because that might imply there is something wrong with the \nfood.\n  OK. Fair enough.\n  The third thing they said is, we don't want anything pejorative.\n  Fair enough. Have the FDA select a symbol to put on the package.\n  We could solve this whole debate immediately for those who want to \nput on a QR code and just say: Scan this code for GE ingredients in \nthis product. OK. Now the consumer gets the 1-second test. They look at \nit and see there are GE ingredients, and that is all they want to know. \nThey don't want to scan it and give up their privacy, and they don't \nwant to have to go to the Web site and look up the product, where \ninformation would probably be misleading anyway. So that is fair \nenough.\n  Now, there is a third idea that has been put forward, a third thing \nthat is supposed to count as answering customer inquiries, and that is \nin this bill--to put information on social media. This triples the size \nof the house of mirrors. A consumer goes to look at the product to see \nif it has a code. No. Does it have an 800 number? No. Oh, there is this \nsocial media thing. Well, we all know there are over 100 companies \ndoing different types of social media. We know the famous ones. We know \nFacebook and Instagram and Twitter. So where on their social media did \nthis company put that information? Well, now you really have to be a \ndetective. You could spend hundreds of hours trying to figure out the \nanswer to that.\n  So the 800 number is phony, the QR code is a scam, and this whole \nsocial media thing is a sham.\n  All citizens want is for us to be honest with them about the \ningredients. That is all they are asking for. It is not very much. \nScientific studies point to the benefits of some genetic engineering, \nand they point to problems that have arisen from some genetic \nengineering. It should be up to the citizen. The citizen has the right \nto know.\n  In this age where we are so divided, we have one thing in common, and \nthat is that 90 percent of our citizens--whether from the Presiding \nOfficer's State or any of the States represented by Senators in this \ndistinguished Hall, 90 percent of the citizens want a simple indication \non the package. So why today are so many Senators coming to this floor \nsaying they don't care about what their citizens feel? They don't care \nabout their citizens' rights, and they don't care about States' rights.\n  I have heard so many colleagues who are planning to vote for this \nsham and scam today come to this floor and talk about the beauty of \nStates as a laboratory for ideas. Well, now, here is Vermont. Vermont \nhas said: We will step up. We will be the laboratory. We will be the \nfirst standard and experiment in putting simple information on the \npackage.\n  Before we make any decision, the rest of the Nation gets the \nadvantage to observe that State laboratory and then to say: Is it \nworking or is it not working? Are there problems being created? How can \nit be improved? Do we want this as a model for the Nation for a single \nstandard, or do we say that we absolutely don't want it as a model for \nthe Nation?\n  Well, many of my colleagues here plan to crush the State laboratory. \nThey have given fancy speeches about\n\n[[Page S1523]]\n\nStates' rights, but they are coming down today to vote to crush States' \nrights to respond to a fundamental concern of their citizens.\n  I must say I like the idea of the State laboratory and to see what \none State does, but I also understand the underlying concern that in \nshort order there might be multiple States and conflicting standards, \nand that is not a functioning situation for interstate commerce.\n  So if we take away the right for a State to give the 1-second test \nfor direct information--1 second--turn over the package; there are 880 \ncalories. That is the test. Turn over the package. GE ingredients are \npresent. Thank you. That is the 1-second test. If we are going to crush \nthe ability of a State to respond to a fundamental concern of its \ncitizens, then we need to provide the same basic provision not in a \nscary fashion and not in a fashion that takes up space on the package, \nnot on the front of the package; one standard for the entire United \nStates, but it has to meet that test. That is all. It is a simple, fair \nexchange.\n  So today I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture because this \nbill is among the worst bills I have ever seen on the floor of the \nSenate. It is without good justification, without resolving the issue \nat hand, crushing States' rights, taking away citizens' right to know, \nand putting out three phony scam, sham alternatives. That is a very sad \nstate of affairs.\n  Another sad state of affairs is that this bill is on this floor \nhaving not gone through committee. We have heard a lot of pontificating \nabout good process in the Senate and how we were going to have good \nprocess, but here is a bill written entirely outside the halls of the \ncommittee, never considered in the committee, and here it is on the \nfloor. Such an important issue would merit substantial debate. Such an \nimportant issue would merit a full and free amendment process.\n  But two things happened immediately after this bill was introduced. \nThe first is that the majority leader immediately filed cloture; that \nis, to close debate. So before one word--not one word had been said on \nthis bill because no one was able to speak between the bill being put \non the floor and cloture. Oh, hey, I just filed the bill, and I am \nclosing debate. That is not a fair and open process. Then the tree was \nfilled, so no one can put an amendment forward. On such an important \nissue, that is not a situation that is acceptable.\n  Furthermore, this was deftly timed to occur simultaneously with the \nfive big primaries yesterday. So this is a moment where the American \npeople are paying attention to Florida, they are paying attention to \nIllinois, and they want to know what happened in Missouri. They want to \nknow what occurred in these five States. The press is paying attention \nto that. That is the one day of debate allowed before this cloture \nmotion is voted on.\n  So let's take this bill and put it in committee and actually have a \ncommittee process to consider it. Then bring it back to the floor with \nwhatever changes the committee makes, and hopefully the committee would \nhonor the fundamental right to know by consumers. Bring the bill back \nto the floor and have a full and open amendment process on something so \nimportant to citizens. But do not crush States' rights. Do not steal \nconsumers' right to know and try to do it in the dark of night while \nthe Nation is distracted by major primaries. It is wrong on policy, it \nis wrong on process, and it is an injustice to every citizen in our \nNation.\n  Here is the situation: The Nation is very cynical about this body. \nThis body here, they say, isn't responding to the concerns of the \nAmerican citizens. Is there any single bill that has been more an \nexample to justify that cynicism than this bill which is before us \nright now? When 9 out of 10 Americans say this is important to them, \nthe majority of this body says: We don't care. When 9 out of 10--or \nroughly that number--Democrats and Republicans and Independents all \nagree on something, this body says: We don't care. Isn't the cynicism \nof the American citizens justified?\n  Here is the thing: Our Nation was founded on a simple principle. That \nprinciple is embodied by three beautiful words in the beginning of our \nConstitution: ``We the People.'' Well, we the people want simple \ninformation on the package. So if we are here to honor that principle, \nwhy is this bill before us, I ask my colleagues. Why a bill that says \nthe interests of a few titans in crushing a State laboratory is more \nimportant than the views of 90 percent of Americans? And when those \nAmericans are asked, more than 7 out of 10 say this is very important \nto them, so this isn't one of those casual issues. Why is it so \nimportant? Because this is food they put in their mouths and on their \ntable, and even if they have no concerns about the GE product itself, \nthey feel they have a right to know.\n  So let's return to the principles on which this Nation was founded. \nLet's quit feeding the cynicism of citizens across this Nation who see \nthese powerful special interests doing the opposite of what citizens \nask for. Let's be a Chamber that honors our relationship with our \nconstituents, not one that tries to stomp out their rights. Let's not \nallow debate to close on this bill. Let's send it back to committee. \nLet's have a committee process. Let's have a floor debate in the \nfuture, with full and free amendments, on an issue so important to our \nStates and so important to our citizens.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am going to proceed on my leader \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the next Justice could fundamentally \nalter the direction of the Supreme Court and have a profound impact on \nour country, so of course--of course the American people should have a \nsay in the Court's direction.\n  It is a President's constitutional right to nominate a Supreme Court \nJustice, and it is the Senate's constitutional right to act as a check \non a President and withhold its consent.\n  As Chairman Grassley and I declared weeks ago and reiterated \npersonally to President Obama, the Senate will continue to observe the \nBiden rule so that the American people have a voice in this momentous \ndecision. The American people may well elect a President who decides to \nnominate Judge Garland for Senate consideration. The next President may \nalso nominate somebody very different. Either way, our view is this: \nGive the people a voice in filling this vacancy.\n  Let me remind colleagues of what Vice President Biden said when he \nwas chairman of the Judiciary Committee here in the Senate. Here is \nwhat he said:\n\n       It would be our pragmatic conclusion that once the \n     political season is underway, and it is, action on a Supreme \n     Court nomination must be put off until after the election \n     campaign is over. That is what is fair to the nominee and is \n     central to the process. Otherwise, it seems to me . . . we \n     will be in deep trouble as an institution.\n\n  Chairman Biden went on.\n\n       Others may fret that this approach would leave the Court \n     with only eight members for some time, but as I see it . . . \n     the cost of such a result--the need to reargue three or four \n     cases that will divide the Justices four to four--are quite \n     minor compared to the cost that a nominee, the President, the \n     Senate, and the Nation would have to pay for what would \n     assuredly be a bitter fight, no matter how good a person is \n     nominated by the President.\n\n  That was Chairman Joe Biden.\n  Consider that last part. Then-Senator Biden said that the cost to the \nNation would be too great no matter who the President nominates. \nPresident Obama and his allies may now try to pretend this disagreement \nis about a person, but as I just noted, his own Vice President made \nclear it is not. The Biden rule reminds us that the decision the Senate \nannounced weeks ago remains about a principle and not a person--about a \nprinciple and not a person.\n  It seems clear that President Obama made this nomination not with the \nintent of seeing the nominee confirmed but in order to politicize it \nfor purposes of the election--which is the type of thing then-Senate \nJudiciary Committee Chairman Biden was concerned about. It is the exact \nsame thing Chairman Biden was concerned about. The Biden rule \nunderlines that what the President has done with this nomination would \nbe unfair to any nominee, and, more importantly, the rule warns of the \ngreat costs the President's action could carry for our Nation.\n\n[[Page S1524]]\n\n  Americans are certain to hear a lot of rhetoric from the other side \nin the coming days, but here are the facts they should keep in mind. \nThe current Democratic leader said the Senate is not a rubberstamp, and \nhe noted that the Constitution does not require the Senate to give \nPresidential nominees a vote. That is the current Democratic leader. \nThe incoming Democratic leader did not even wait until the final year \nof George W. Bush's term to essentially tell the Senate not to consider \nany Supreme Court nominee the President sent. The Biden rule supports \nwhat the Senate is doing today, underlining that what we are talking \nabout is a principle and not a person.\n  So here is our view. Instead of spending more time debating an issue \nwhere we can't agree, let's keep working to address the issues where we \ncan. We just passed critical bipartisan legislation to help address the \nheroin and prescription opioid crisis in our country. Let's build on \nthat success. Let's keep working together to get our economy moving \nagain and to make our country safer, rather than endlessly debating an \nissue where we don't agree. As we continue working on issues like \nthese, the American people are perfectly capable of having their say on \nthis issue. So let's give them a voice. Let's let the American people \ndecide. The Senate will appropriately revisit the matter when it \nconsiders the qualifications of the nominee the next President \nnominates, whoever that might be.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     concur in the House amendment with an amendment to S. 764, a \n     bill to reauthorize and amend the National Sea Grant College \n     Program Act, and for other purposes.\n         Mitch McConnell, Mike Rounds, John Barrasso, Deb Fischer, \n           Tom Cotton, Roger F.

Madam President, I enter a motion to reconsider the \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as the world now knows, this morning \nPresident Obama nominated his choice to fill the vacant seat created by \nthe death of Justice Antonin Scalia. In doing so, the President \nexercised his unquestioned authority under the Constitution to nominate \nsomebody to this vacancy, but that same Constitution reserves to the \nU.S. Senate--and the U.S. Senate alone--the right to either grant or \nwithhold consent to that nominee. It is the same Constitution. They \ncan't argue that the President somehow has an unquestioned right to see \nhis nominee rubberstamped by the Senate and still show fidelity and \nhonor to the same Constitution that gives him that authority to make \nthat nomination.\n  At this time, I reaffirm my commitment to share with other members of \nour conference that the President--this President--will not fill this \nvacancy. The Senate will not confirm this nominee to this vacancy. In \nso doing, we will follow the same rule book that Democrats have \nadvocated for in the past. It can't be that one set of rules apply to a \nDemocratic President and a second set of rules apply when there is a \nRepublican President. This isn't just about speculating what Democrats \nmight do were the shoe on the other foot and we had a Republican \nPresident because they have told us what they would do--they have done \nthis since 1992--and in many ways they have kept their promise.\n  There is a lot at stake. Justice Scalia served for 30 years on the \nU.S. Supreme Court. The next Justice could well change the ideological \nmakeup and the balance of the Supreme Court for a generation to come \nand fundamentally reshape America as we know it.\n  At this critical juncture in our Nation's history, and particularly \nwith regard to the judiciary and the highest Court in the land, the \nAmerican people deserve a chance to have a say in the selection of the \nnext lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, and the only way to \nempower the American people and ensure they have that voice is for the \nnext President to fill the nomination created by this vacancy.\n  I have heard some people say that we had that election in 2012, when \nPresident Obama was elected, but I would say that you are half right. \nWe also had another election in 2014, where the American people gave \nRepublicans a majority in the U.S. Senate because they saw what \nhappened when this President didn't have any checks and balances. We \nsaw this during the beginning of his term of office when ObamaCare was \npassed by a purely partisan vote. We saw it when Dodd-Frank was \npassed--again, by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. So, in 2014, the \nAmerican people said to President Obama: We want an effective check on \nPresidential power--and that is what the American people got.\n  We can't just look at the one side of the equation--the President's \nauthority under the Constitution--and the fact that the President was \nreelected in 2012. We have to look at what happened in 2014 and the \nconstitutional prerogative of the U.S. Senate either to grant or to \nwithhold the confirmation.\n\n\n                           Our National Debt\n\n  Madam President, later today the Judiciary Committee will be holding \na hearing addressing America's impending fiscal crisis, including some \npotential solutions to help reverse the unsustainable course we are on. \nI know we don't hear very much about it here in Washington. This seems \nto be ``people walking by the graveyard,'' so to speak, regarding the \nfact that our national debt hit $19 trillion for the first time ever. \nThis means our debt climbed more than $1 trillion in a little over a \nyear. In fact, this is a shocking statistic that we will not read about \nin most of the mainstream media. The national debt has roughly \ndoubled--\n\n[[Page S1525]]\n\nroughly doubled--since President Obama took office a little over 7 \nyears ago.\n  The Congressional Budget Office projects that for the fiscal year \n2016, spending will reach $3.9 trillion, an increase of $232 billion \nfrom the previous year. I know that when we are talking about trillions \nand billions of dollars, it boggles the imagination. Most of us can't \neven conceive of numbers that large, but the fact is, when you borrow \nmoney, you have to pay it back at some point. Frankly, what I worry \nmost about is that my generation is not going to be the one to repay \nthe money we borrow. It is going to be the next generation. I know a \nlot of parents and grandparents worry about whether the American dream \nwill still be alive and available to the next generation and beyond. \nThis is a huge moral lapse on the part of the current generation, to \nnot pay our own debts and to not come up with a system or a framework \nby which to begin that process.\n  Rather than addressing this problem head on, government spending is \nset to remain high over the coming decade, even with the discretionary \nspending caps and sequester put in place by the Budget Control Act. \nInside the beltway, people talk a lot about sequester and the Budget \nControl Act, but that is only 30 percent of Federal spending. Seventy \npercent of Federal spending is on autopilot, growing in some cases by a \nrate of 70 percent or more a year. Not addressing this is \nirresponsible, it is dangerous, and it also limits the choices \navailable were our country to become embroiled in another fiscal crisis \nlike we saw in 2008.\n  If we ask our national security experts--former Chairman of the Joint \nChief of Staff ADM Mike Mullen said the No. 1 security threat to the \nUnited States was the debt. That shocked me a little bit when I heard \nhim say that, but what he meant--and I know it to be true--is that more \nand more of the tax dollars the Federal Government receives are going \nto be paid to the bondholders who own that debt--the Chinese and other \npeople around the world. We have to pay the interest on the debt if we \nare going to borrow the money, but more and more the spending decisions \nwill be taken out of the hands of the elected representatives of the \nAmerican people and simply be left up to the accountants who say: OK. \nYou have accrued this much debt. Here is the interest that needs to be \npaid on that debt to the bondholders, and there is not going to be \nenough money left over to protect the national security of the United \nStates of America.\n  We have already seen our military on a dangerous trajectory \npotentially leading to the smallest Army since World War II. We tried \nto deal with some of that just last fall to begin to reverse some of \nthis because frankly this was no longer a matter of just cutting \nsuperficial cuts. These were into the muscle and the bone of what makes \nup our national security structure, and we know what happened too. Our \nfriends on the other side said: If you want to spend more money to \nprotect this country with national security spending, then we are going \nto demand dollar-for-dollar more spending on nondefense, discretionary \nspending. That is why we ended up with the deal we ended up with.\n  I have found it very frustrating in my time in the Senate how many of \nour colleagues will talk about this issue, but I have to be honest, the \nones who frustrate me the most are the ones who will not talk about it \nat all, to even acknowledge the fact. We need to have a conversation, \nand more than that we need to have a commitment and we need to have a \ngoal when it comes to dealing with this national debt and runaway \nspending.\n  Our Democratic friends apparently share the same philosophy as the \ncurrent President to create a tax-and-spend agenda without considering \nthe long-term ramifications to job creation, the economy, not to \nmention our children and grandchildren. I am glad to say this side of \nthe aisle has tried to do what I described earlier, which is to take a \nresponsible position on embracing a policy which would help us to pay \ndown the debt, deal with this in a fiscally responsible way, and allow \nus to get our books back in good order.\n  We are going to take up this matter before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee today. We will be discussing reining in spending and making \nprogress on the debt, including an amendment to the United States \nConstitution that would require a balanced budget.\n  I can hear it now--because I have heard it before--some of our \ncolleagues across the aisle saying: Heaven forbid. We can't amend the \nConstitution. Well, we have done it 27 times. Now, we don't do it \nwilly-nilly. We don't do it for small things, but for something like \nthis, it may well be required. Frankly, this is one of the most \nimportant lessons of economics that all of us who have children have \ntried to teach our children, which is you don't spend money that you \ndon't have--well, I guess, unless you are the Federal Government and \nyou can print it or you can borrow it, but at some point the birds come \nhome to roost.\n  Of course, our commitment to commonsense spending goes far beyond \ntoday's hearing on the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. \nMany will recall that folks on this side of the aisle highlighted \ngimmicks in the discretionary budget process that only hide the real \ncost and don't actually reduce spending. There are a lot of shell games \nthat go on here in Washington, DC. I am glad our budget amendment last \nyear focused on bringing stunts like those to an end and placed a limit \non their use in the appropriations process.\n  Most recently, we used reconciliation through the budget process to \nkeep our promise to vote to repeal ObamaCare--a law that has been \nburdening American families and businesses with higher taxes and \nmandates, while failing to contain premiums and financial losses on the \nexchanges. But instead of offering solutions to our growing debt, many \nof our Democratic colleagues are content to sit back and criticize \nthose of us who are trying to come up with a solution to address this \nproblem: how to safeguard our Nation's fiscal health. They argue that a \nbalanced budget amendment isn't feasible or that certain government \nprograms are so essential that we have to up their funding at the \nexpense of the taxpayer, or they act as if the debt isn't a problem, or \nif it is a problem, that all they will do is raise taxes enough to try \nto balance the budget. You can't do that. You cannot raise taxes high \nenough on the American people to pay off $19 trillion in debt. Those \naren't solutions; those are talking points. They don't help the \nAmerican people make ends meet, and they don't help the U.S. Government \nlive within its means.\n  So I would like to ask, what are the Democratic solutions to our \nnational debt? We are going to ask that question this afternoon. We are \ngoing to have some expert witnesses offer a number of suggestions. Then \nwe are going to ask our friends across the aisle, what is your \nsolution? I hope we hear more than just crickets or criticism that what \nwe are proposing simply will not work.\n  I know my colleagues and I would welcome constructive input and \nserious, good-faith proposals to stem the burgeoning national debt, but \nuntil then, our friends across the aisle need to do more than sit on \ntheir hands or just whistle past the graveyard of this impending \nnational disaster.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of my \ndistinguished colleague from Texas. As usual, he is right on and one of \nthe great leaders on trying to balance the budget through a \nconstitutional amendment. I personally appreciate his efforts and his \nexpertise in doing that.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Madam President, on a different subject, I rise today to speak about \nthe need for the Senate to do its job regarding the Supreme Court \nvacancy created by the untimely death of Justice Antonin Scalia.\n  The Constitution gives to the President the power to nominate Supreme \nCourt Justices, and President Obama has exercised that power by \nnominating Judge Merrick Garland. The Constitution gives to the Senate \nthe power of advice and consent, and it is time for the Senate to do \nits job.\n  The sound bite ``do your job'' is catchy, quotable, and short enough \nto fit in very large letters on a large chart that Democratic Senators \nbring to this floor. Rarely, however, have so few words been so \nmisleading for so many.\n\n[[Page S1526]]\n\nThis cliche begs but does not answer the most important question: What \nis the Senate's job regarding the Scalia vacancy? When Democrats and \ntheir liberal allies say ``Do your job,'' they really mean ``Do as we \nsay now, not as we did then.'' Saying that would be more honest, but \nthen no one else would be persuaded by it. So they say that the \nConstitution provides the Senate's job description, requiring a prompt \nJudiciary Committee hearing and a timely floor vote. There may be a \nconstitution somewhere that says such a thing, but it is certainly not \nin our Constitution--the Constitution of the United States--that each \nof us has sworn an oath to support and defend.\n  In a way, I am not surprised that liberals would use a made-up, \nfictional constitution to pursue their political goal. After all, they \nfavor judges who do the same thing. From the time he was a Senator \nserving in this body, President Obama has said that judges decide cases \nbased on their personal empathy, core concerns, and vision of how the \nworld works. My goodness. If that were the case, any philosopher could \nbe a Supreme Court Justice. He has nominated men and women who believe \nthat judges may change the Constitution's meaning based on things such \nas cultural understandings and evolving social norms. Give me a break.\n  The kinds of judges liberals favor see unwritten things in our \nwritten Constitution. They discover things between the lines of our \nwritten charter that come not from those who drafted and ratified the \nConstitution, not from the American people, but from the judges' own \nimaginations.\n  If the Constitution we have--the one our fellow citizens can read--\nsuits them, then activist judges will use it. If not, then activist \njudges will make up a new constitution that is more useful to their \npurposes. America's Founders fashioned a system of government with \nbuilt-in limits, including a defined role for unelected judges. The \nSupreme Court observed in the famous case of Marbury v. Madison that \nthe Constitution is written down so that these limits will be neither \nmistaken nor forgotten and is intended to govern courts as much as \nlegislatures. The activist judges whom liberals favor reject those \nlimits. They look at written law such as the Constitution and statutes \nmerely as a starting point, as words without any real meaning. Their \noath to support and defend the Constitution is really an oath to \nsupport and defend themselves, since in the long run their constitution \nis one of their own making.\n  So I am hardly surprised that today Democrats and their leftwing \nallies turn to a fictional constitution when telling the Senate to do \nits job. That constitution, however, simply does not exist. The real \nConstitution leaves to the President and to the Senate the decision \nabout how to exercise their respective powers in the appointment \nprocess.\n  What is the Senate's job regarding the Scalia vacancy? The Senate's \njob is to determine the best way to exercise its advice and consent \npower under the circumstances we face today. Thankfully, we are not \nwithout guidance in deciding the best way to exercise our advice and \nconsent power regarding the Scalia vacancy. We can, for example, look \nat precedent.\n  It hardly takes a law degree to know that a precedent is more \nlegitimate if it is more similar to the situation before us. Comparing \napples and apples is more helpful than, say, comparing apples and \nrocks. That is just a matter of common sense.\n  Candidly, the fictional claims offered in recent days suggest that \nsome of the lawyers among us could benefit from even more common sense. \nOver the years, the Senate has considered nominations in different ways \nat different times, depending on the circumstances. Consider these \nprecedents with great bearing on the current circumstances: The Senate \nhas never confirmed a nominee to a Supreme Court vacancy that opened up \nthis late in a term-limited President's time in office. This is only \nthe third vacancy in nearly a century to occur after the American \npeople had already started voting in a Presidential election, and in \nthe previous two instances--in 1956 and 1968--the Senate did not \nconfirm a nominee until the following year. And the only time the \nSenate has ever confirmed a nominee to fill a Supreme Court vacancy \ncreated after voting began in a Presidential election year was in 1916, \nand that vacancy arose only because Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes \nresigned his seat on the Court to run against incumbent President \nWoodrow Wilson.\n  There is also another precedent that has received little attention \nbut is worth considering. President John Quincy Adams nominated John \nCrittenden to the Supreme Court in December 1828, after Andrew Jackson \nwon the Presidential election. The Senate, by voice vote, rejected an \namendment to a resolution regarding the Crittenden nomination that \nasserted it is the duty of the Senate to confirm or reject a \nPresident's nominees. In one of its reports on the confirmation \nprocess, the Congressional Research Service discussed this vote and \nconcluded: ``By this action, the early Senate declined to endorse the \nprinciple that proper practice required it to consider and proceed to a \nfinal vote on every nomination.''\n  I believe the precedents, such as they are, support the principle \nthat the Senate must decide for itself how to exercise its power of \nadvice and consent in each situation.\n  We have another source of guidance for how to exercise the advice and \nconsent power in the particular circumstances of the Scalia vacancy. In \n1992--another Presidential election year during divided government--\nthen-Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, now our Vice President, \naddressed this very issue. Senator Biden recommended that if a Supreme \nCourt vacancy occurred that year, the entire appointment process--both \nnomination and confirmation--should be deferred until the election \nseason was over. Here is what he said in a lengthy interview with the \nWashington Post:\n\n       If someone steps down, I would highly recommend the \n     president not name someone, not send a name up. If [the \n     president] did send someone up, I would ask the Senate to \n     seriously consider not having a hearing on that nominee.\n\n  Chairman Biden also explained the reasons for this recommendation. He \nsaid, for example, that an election-year nominee would be caught up in \na ``power struggle'' over control of the Supreme Court.\n  He was prescient.\n  In that interview, Chairman Biden also said:\n\n       Can you imagine dropping a nominee, after the . . . \n     decisions that are about to be made by the Supreme Court, \n     into that fight, into that cauldron in the middle of a \n     presidential year? . . . The environment within which such a \n     hearing would be held would be so supercharged and so prone \n     to be able to be distorted.\n\n  A week later, Chairman Biden addressed the Senate about the \nconfirmation process and further explained his recommendation for \ndeferring the appointment process should a Supreme Court vacancy occur. \nHe repeated his recommendation regarding how to handle a Supreme Court \nnomination occurring that year. Let me refer to this chart and read it:\n\n       President Bush should consider following the practice of a \n     majority of his predecessors and not--and not--name a nominee \n     until after the November election is completed. . . . [I]f \n     the President . . . presses an election-year nomination, the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee should seriously consider not \n     scheduling confirmation hearings on the nomination until \n     after the political campaign season is over.\n\n  Chairman Biden again explained the reasons for this recommendation. \nThe confirmation process had degraded in the wake of controversial \nnominations, and the Presidential campaign that year looked to be \nparticularly bitter. As a result, he said, partisan bickering and \npolitical posturing would overwhelm the serious evaluation required. In \naddition, the Presidential election season was already well underway, \nand different parties controlled the nomination and confirmation phases \nof the appointment process.\n  Chairman Biden could have been talking about 2016 instead of 1992. In \nfact, each of the factors leading to his recommendation for deferring \nthe appointment process in 1992 exists in the same or greater measure \ntoday.\n  Not a single Democrat objected to Chairman Biden's recommendation to \ndefer the appointment process. Not one. Not one Democrat. If what \nDemocrats say today is true--that the Constitution requires a prompt \nhearing and a timely floor vote for every nomination--surely someone, \nanyone would\n\n[[Page S1527]]\n\nhave said so in 1992. Not so. My colleagues will search the 1992 \nCongressional Record in vain for the slogan ``do your job.'' It appears \nthat a different Constitution was in force in 1992 because no \nDemocratic Senator or leftist organization insisted that the \nConstitution required a prompt hearing and timely floor vote. No one \nclaimed that the Senate would be shirking its constitutional duty by \nfollowing Chairman Biden's recommendation.\n  The first step in exercising our power of advice and consent \nregarding the Scalia vacancy then is to decide how best to do so in the \ncircumstances we face today. Precedent generally, and guidance from \npast Senate leaders specifically, counsel strongly in favor of \ndeferring the confirmation process until after the Presidential \nelection season is over. That is clearly the best course for the \nSenate, the judiciary, and, of course, the Nation. That conclusion is \nreinforced by another important factor: Elections have consequences. \nDemocrats and their leftwing allies also use that axiom but want people \nto believe that 2012 was the only election relevant to the Scalia \nvacancy. They want people to believe that because President Obama was \nreelected in 2012, he should be able to appoint whomever, whenever, and \nhowever he likes. That idea must appear in another provision of the \nDemocrats' fictional constitution because, once again, the real one \nsays no such thing.\n  The 2012 election did give the President the power to nominate, and \nhe can exercise that power however he chooses until his final minutes \nin office next January, and I will uphold that right. He has exercised \nthat power by nominating Judge Merrick Garland.\n  The 2012 election, however, was not the only one with consequences. \nThe 2014 election, for example, had tremendous significance for the \nSenate's power of advice and consent. The American people gave control \nof the Senate, and therefore control of the confirmation process, to \nRepublicans. Here, too, we may find some guidance from our friends on \nthe left in addressing this circumstance. President Ronald Reagan \nnominated Judge Robert Bork to the Supreme Court in 1987. This was 3 \nyears after his reelection and a year after the Senate majority changed \nhands.\n  Here is how the New York Times addressed the argument that elections \nhave consequences:\n\n       The President's supporters insist vehemently that, having \n     won the 1984 election, he has every right to try to change \n     the Court's direction. Yes, but the Democrats won the 1986 \n     election, regaining control of the Senate, and they have \n     every right to resist.\n\n  The same circumstances obviously exist today. By the way, no one \nshould waste time wondering if the New York Times has applied the same \nprinciple today. It, of course, hasn't.\n  In addition to 2012 and 2014, the 2016 election will have tremendous \nconsequences for the American people and the courts. It will give the \nAmerican people a unique opportunity to express their opinion about the \ndirection of the courts by electing the President who nominates and the \nSenate that gives advice and consent. Republicans and Democrats, \nconservatives and liberals, have very different views about the kind of \njudge that America needs. Justice Scalia represented a defined, modest \napproach to judging while, as I mentioned earlier, President Obama has \nadvocated an expansive and activist approach.\n  I have served on the Judiciary Committee longer than all but one \nSenator since the committee was created 200 years ago. One thing is \nclear to me: The conflict over judicial appointments is a conflict over \njudicial power. The two models of judicial power or judicial job \ndescriptions that I have described have radically different \nconsequences and implications for our Nation and our liberty.\n  The American people have expressed increasing concern about the \nSupreme Court's direction since President Obama was elected. Most \nAmericans, for example, believe that Supreme Court Justices decide \ncases based on their personal views and object to their doing so. With \nJustice Scalia's untimely passing, the American people now have a \nunique opportunity to have a voice in charting a path forward.\n  I cannot conclude today without addressing what is widely understood \nto be part of the President's strategy in nominating Judge Garland to \nthe Scalia vacancy. The Senate confirmed Judge Garland to the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals by a vote of 76 to 23 in 1997. This, I take it, is \nsupposed to suggest that the Senate should do likewise regarding Judge \nGarland's nomination to the Supreme Court.\n  So there is no mistake, I will say this as clearly as I can: The \nconfirmation process regarding the Scalia vacancy will be deferred \nuntil after the election season is over for the reasons I have \nexplained. That decision has nothing whatsoever to do with the identity \nof the nominee, and Republicans made our decision known weeks ago, \nbefore the President had chosen anyone.\n  I think highly of Judge Garland. But his nomination doesn't in any \nway change current circumstances. I remain convinced that the best way \nfor the Senate to do its job is to conduct the confirmation process \nafter this toxic Presidential election season is over. Doing so is the \nonly way to ensure fairness to the nominee and preserve the integrity \nof the Supreme Court.\n  I also want to emphasize that the considerations relevant to an \nindividual's nomination to one position do not necessarily lead to the \nsame conclusion regarding his nomination to another position, \nespecially the Supreme Court. Here, too, I want my colleagues to be \naware of guidance we can draw on from the past.\n  In 1990, then-Chairman Joseph Biden presided over the hearing on the \nnomination of Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \nCircuit. He said: ``[T]here is a fundamental distinction between what \nis required of and should be sought of a circuit court judge and a \ndistrict court judge and a Supreme Court Justice.'' He was right then, \nand he is right today.\n  Democratic Senators made the same point in 2005 when they sought to \ndistinguish their earlier support for John Roberts' appeals court \nnomination from their intention to oppose his Supreme Court nomination. \nMr. Schumer, our distinguished Senator from New York, for example, \ncalled it a whole new ball game. He said, ``you've got to start from \nscratch.'' Senator Leahy agreed, saying that the Supreme Court is \ndifferent from the lower courts. I couldn't agree more. Add this to the \nlist of standards that my Democratic colleagues have reversed now that \nthe partisan shoe is on the other foot. Senate Republicans have \nexplained repeatedly and in detail why the best way to exercise our \nadvice-and-consent power in this situation is to defer the confirmation \nprocess. That conclusion is completely unrelated to whether the \nPresident chooses a nominee, or if he does so, who that nominee is.\n  President Obama could have followed Vice President Biden's 1992 \nadvice and deferred a nomination to fill the Scalia vacancy. He chose \nnot to do so. For the reasons I have discussed--precedent, past \nguidance, and the consequences of elections--the Senate should follow \nthat advice and defer the confirmation process for the good of the \nSenate, the Judiciary, and the American people.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the vacancy on the \nU.S. Supreme Court in light of President Obama's announcement that he \nhas nominated Chief Judge Merrick Garland to replace Justice Scalia.\n  Replacing Justice Antonin Scalia, who was one of our Nation's \nstrongest defenders of our Constitution, will be difficult. For almost \n30 years, with his brilliant legal mind and animated character, he \nfiercely fought against judicial activism from the bench. He will be \ngreatly missed by not only his family and loved ones but by all \nAmericans who shared his core conservative values and beliefs.\n  Under the Constitution, the President shall nominate a replacement, \nas he did today, and the Senate has a constitutional role of advice and \nconsent.\n\n[[Page S1528]]\n\nThis is a constitutional responsibility that I take very seriously.\n  The decisions the Supreme Court makes often have long-lasting \nramifications that--with one-vote margins--can dramatically alter the \ncourse of our country. At a time when the current administration has \nstretched the limits of the law and attempted to circumvent Congress \nand the Federal court system, choosing the right candidate with the \naptitude for this lifetime appointment is as important as ever.\n  I have determined that my benchmark for the next Supreme Court \nJustice will be Justice Scalia himself. Scalia's strict interpretation \nof the Constitution and deference to States' rights set a gold standard \nby which his replacement should be measured.\n  As we all know, every Republican member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \nexpressing their firm belief that the people of the United States \ndeserve to have a voice in determining the next Supreme Court Justice. \nIn their letter, they wrote:\n\n       Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution is clear. The \n     President may nominate judges of the Supreme Court. But the \n     power to grant--or withhold--consent to such nominees rests \n     exclusively with the United States Senate.\n\n  As a result, the committee does not plan on holding any hearings \nrelated to this issue until after a new President has taken office. \nThis decision will allow the American people to have a voice in the \nnext Supreme Court Justice based upon who they elect as the President \nthis November.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have argued that the \nAmerican people did have a voice when they elected President Obama in \n2012, but that election was nearly 3\\1/2\\ years ago. Since that time, a \nlot has changed in our country, signaling a shift in America's views of \nour President and his philosophy of government. We don't need to look \nany further than the 2014 elections for proof. In the 2014 elections, \nthe Senate switched from Democratic-controlled to Republican-\ncontrolled. In fact, I am one of those Republican Senators who replaced \na Democrat in the last election. Many of us who ran were not supporting \nthe President's policies. In fact, we ran because we wanted to change \nthe direction the President was moving our country.\n  At the State level, in 2012, the last time President Obama was \nelected, there were 29 Republican Governors and 20 Democratic \nGovernors. In 2014, the number of Republican Governors rose from 29 to \n31, while the number of Democratic Governors decreased from 20 to 18. \nWe saw similar results in State legislative races across the country.\n  In 2012, Republicans held a majority in both chambers of 26 State \nlegislatures. In 2014, that number rose to 30. And if we take into \naccount the conservative-leaning but officially nonpartisan legislature \nof Nebraska, that number jumps even higher--to 31.\n  In 2012, Democrats held the majority of both chambers in 15 States. \nIn 2014, that number was reduced to 11.\n  So in the years since the President's last election, Republicans not \nonly held a strong majority in the House of Representatives, but they \ntook back control of the Senate and increased their numbers at the \nState level as well.\n  There is no doubt that there has been a clear shift in the minds of \nthe American people since President Obama's last election.\n  I believe, just as many of my colleagues do, that the Republican \nvictories of 2014 should be taken into consideration and, therefore, we \nshould wait to confirm the next Supreme Court Justice until after a new \nPresident takes office. Overwhelmingly, South Dakotans who have \ncontacted my office agree with this decision.\n  One gentleman from Lemmon, SD, wrote to me saying: ``Our country \nhangs in the balance as to what the future of this great country will \nlook like. . . . This decision is too crucial and the next Supreme \nCourt nominee should be nominated by the next President of the United \nStates.''\n  Another South Dakotan from Brandon noted: ``This is a rare \nopportunity for the American voter to actually have a voice in how the \nCourt will be structured for many years to come. Please help preserve \nthat opportunity for us all.''\n  In another example, a woman from Estelline wrote saying: ``Hearing of \nthe passing of Justice Scalia was heartbreaking news. I ask that you do \nyour part to allow the people to have a say in who the next Justice of \nthe Supreme Court will be.''\n  These are just a few examples of the numerous South Dakotans who have \ncontacted my office who agree that the American people have a voice in \nthe direction our country will take in the decades to come. As much as \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle would like to see the \nSenate confirm a nominee from our current President, the reality is \nthat when the tables are turned, they agree with our position. In fact, \nit was Vice President Joe Biden who, when he served as the chairman of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, said on this very floor in 1992: ``It \nis my view that if a President goes the way of Presidents Fillmore and \nJohnson and presses for an election-year nomination, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee should seriously consider not scheduling \nconfirmation hearings on the nomination until after the political \ncampaign season is over.''\n  It was minority leader Harry Reid who said in 2005: ``The duties of \nthe United States Senate are set forth in the Constitution of the \nUnited States. Nowhere in that document does it say the Senate has a \nduty to give presidential nominees a vote.''\n  And the Senate Democrats' next leader, Senator Schumer, said in 2007, \nclose to 2 years before President Bush's term ended: ``We should not \nconfirm any Bush nominee to the Supreme Court except in extraordinary \ncircumstances.''\n  Whoever is confirmed to fill the open seat on the Supreme Court will \nbe serving a lifetime appointment. Keeping in mind the current \npolitical makeup of the Court, the man or woman who will replace \nJustice Scalia has the potential to hold incredible influence over the \nideological direction of the Court for a generation to come.\n  It is critically important that the next Justice be committed to \nupholding the principles of the Constitution. We owe it to Justice \nScalia, our judicial system, and the Constitution to uphold the highest \nstandards when determining our next Supreme Court Justice. We also owe \nit to the American people to make certain that their voice is heard in \nthis election.\n  For these reasons, I agree with my colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee and in the Senate leadership that we should not hold hearings \non a Supreme Court nominee until after our new President takes office.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am once again on the floor for my 37th \nedition of ``Waste of the Week'' speech, where I disclose wasteful \nspending, fraud, and abuse of taxpayers' dollars. It seems it is never \nending because after 37 weeks I feel as if I am just scratching the \nsurface.\n  Last week, as some will remember, I talked about how the National \nScience Foundation spent $331,000 of hard-earned tax dollars by giving \na grant to researchers to study whether or not being ``hangry'' is a \nreal thing. Most people have not heard about the word ``hangry.'' Last \nweek I suppose people ran to the dictionary to see what the description \nwas. ``Hangry''--I think among the younger people--means that you are \nboth hungry and angry, and you are angrier than you normally would be \nin a situation because you are hungry.\n  I wasn't hungry last week when I was talking about ``hangry,'' but I \nwas angry. I was angry over the fact that $331,000 of taxpayers' money \nwas being used to offer a grant from the National Science Foundation to \nstudy whether this exists. They came up with this crazy situation of \ngiving voodoo dolls to husbands and wives. Every time a husband was \nangry with his wife, he would take a pin and stick it into the voodoo \ndoll or if she was angry with him, she would take a pin and stick it\n\n[[Page S1529]]\n\ninto the voodoo doll. I don't know who ended up with the most pins. \nProbably the wife had more pins in the voodoo doll than the husband \ndid. Nonetheless, then a glucose test was taken to see if they were \nactually a little short on glucose in the bloodstream, meaning they \nwere hungry. Well, the conclusion was that, yes, if you were hungry, \nyou tended to be a little more on edge, a little more testy.\n\n  That might have been a fun study to be engaged in just for laughs, \nbut this was paid for with taxpayer dollars. This was a grant issued by \nthe National Science Foundation. We tell people about the National \nScience Foundation, and they must think, oh, that is probably one of \nthe better government agencies.\n  So that was last week, and I wasn't sure that anything could top last \nweek. Because I was quoted as saying--who could make up stuff like \nthis? Do people sit around and say: Let's see if we can get a grant to \ndo some kind of research project that is nothing but crazy? The amazing \nthing is someone over at the National Science Foundation looked at this \nstudy and thought: Hey, this is a good idea. Let's give them a $331,000 \ngrant. And so we added it to the chart.\n  Now we are here this week, and I want to talk about something that is \nmaybe even scarier than sticking pins in voodoo dolls, and it is called \nthe Master Death File. This is not the name of a new novel on the New \nYork Time's best seller list. This is not the name of a new movie \ncoming out. The Master Death File is something, folks, you don't want \nto be on.\n  The Federal Government, by law--the Social Security Administration--\nhas to maintain the Master Death File. Obviously, those of us on Social \nSecurity or who are of Social Security age don't want to see our name \non that list. If your name is on that list, you are no longer eligible \nfor Social Security payments because it is a death list; you have died.\n  So as sinister as it sounds, it is probably necessary that we do \nthis--that we have at least some list that lets the Social Security \nAdministration know that it is time to stop sending Social Security \nchecks to dead people. The beneficiary or the recipient has died, and, \ntherefore, procedures are made so that the next check doesn't keep \nrolling out and rolling out and rolling out.\n  A lot of us here in the Senate get on different kinds of lists--voter \nrecords, awards for standing up for certain issues and policies that \npeople respect--and I have found myself on a number of those. One list \nI don't want to be on, but know that as a human being I am sort of \ncareening toward, is the Master Death File. So we thought, well, let's \ndig into this and see how it works. So we went to the Government \nAccountability Office and said: What about this Master Death File?\n  So we did some investigation on that. Out of that investigation came \nan example of one agency the General Accountability Office had \nexamined, and it is the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Department \nof Agriculture sends out checks--payments for conservation, disaster \nrelief and crop subsidies. Well, we found that between 2008 and 2012, \n$27.6 million in payments for conservation, disaster relief, and crop \nsubsidies were made to people who had died. What is more disturbing is \nthat many of those recipients had been dead for more than 2 years.\n  This is just one department out of all the hundreds of Federal \nagencies that issue checks for all kinds of different purposes. So it \nis important to have a Master Death File because what we want these \nagencies to do--in fact, they are obligated to do under the law--is to \ncheck the master death list to make sure the checks aren't going to \npeople who are on that list.\n  Obviously, with this one agency--the Department of Agriculture--one \nof two things happened: Either names did not get on that list, or names \nwere on the list, but they didn't check it. Either way, there is a \nresponsibility here for the Federal Government in handling taxpayer \ndollars to make sure that for those who are deceased, their names get \non the Master Death File--as scary as that is--and/or, if they are on \nthe list, they do not receive the payments.\n  In this digital age, it shouldn't be too hard to keep that Master \nDeath File updated. Every State has records that have to be kept--sent \nby the coroner or authorized by the hospital or whatever. There are a \nnumber of sources of finding out. Particularly in the digital age, it \nis pretty easy to enter a name when you get the certificate of death. \nYou enter the name, it goes onto the master death list, and it ought to \nbe relatively easy for agencies sending out checks to coordinate with \nthat by either pushing a button or going into an app or whatever and \nfinding out that John Jones or Bill Smith still qualifies for his \nSocial Security payments. That check ought to be pretty automatic.\n  Unfortunately, it isn't, particularly when you find people have been \nreceiving these checks even 2 years after they have died. So something \nis amiss here. It is not like in the old days, where you probably had \nto call Farmer Bob out in rural America and say: Do you know if Farmer \nJoe down the road is still living? Have you seen him in town lately? \nWhat is happening? Did you go to the funeral? We don't have to do all \nthat anymore. This stuff is all digitized and all very accessible.\n  So here we are with the Social Security Administration needing to do \nwhat it needs to do to make sure that list is kept up-to-date. And, as \nI say, none of us are anxious to get on that list. I see all the young \npages down here thinking: I have a long time to go. They are looking at \nthis aging Senator thinking: You are a lot closer to that list than we \nare. I hope they are not thinking that. Some of them are smiling. \nNonetheless, the agencies that are issuing the checks also have to do \ntheir job because, in a serious way, this is taking money from hard-\nworking taxpayers. It is hard-earned money taken from those who have to \npay the bills at the end of the week, who have to cover their mortgage \nand provide for the education of their children and who have to buy \nfood at the grocery store and gas at the gas pump. People are scraping \nby, and when they see this kind of thing or hear about this kind of \nthing, they are outraged.\n  We are seeing this being played out in the nomination process on both \nsides--the Republicans and the Democrats. People are frustrated with \nthe inefficiency and the ineffectiveness of the Federal Government in \nthe use of their tax dollars. So I am here to illustrate that--not to \nspur continued anger and outrage but to get people seriously focused on \nthe fact their dollars are not being wisely spent. They need to call \ntheir Congressmen and Senators, and they need to say: You need to do a \nbetter job of managing our money we are sending you to protect this \nNation, to provide for roads, bridges, health care, and so forth.\n  There are some essential things government needs to do, but surely it \ndoesn't need to put out $331,000 for a ``hanger'' study with voodoo \ndolls, and it doesn't need to waste $27.6 million of checks going to \npeople who are deceased and who are no longer eligible for receiving \nthat.\n  So we continue to add money to our total--another $27.6 million to \nour $157,619,142,953. These numbers get up there. So we are at \n$157,619,142,953, and we will be back next week with the next edition \nof ``Waste of the Week.''\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Methane Emissions\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, last week the Prime Minister of Canada \ncame for a visit. President Obama used that opportunity to take yet \nanother cheap shot at American energy producers. The administration has \nmade a deal with Canada to cut methane emissions from oil and gas \nproduction facilities.\n  They want tough new restrictions to cut emissions almost in half over \nthe next decade. The very same day, the Environmental Protection Agency \nsaid that it plans to come up with more regulations for methane.\n\n[[Page S1530]]\n\n  The Obama administration is already trying to limit the methane that \ngets released from new oil and gas wells as they get put into \nproduction. Now the administration wants to go back and impose those \nlimits on existing wells--ones that were built to actually comply with \nthe current rules on the books.\n  Here is what I find most interesting about this. This was an official \nstate visit by a foreign leader to the United States. It was the first \ntrip for the new Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau. So President \nObama decided that the most important thing the two countries could \ntalk about was methane--not Syria, not trying to stop radical Islamist \nterrorists, not dealing with ISIS, not the hostile regimes of North \nKorea, Iran, or Russia, not what we could do to actually help our \neconomies grow--no. Instead, President Obama chose to focus on methane.\n  Why is President Obama so fixated on this? Let me tell you. The \nPresident is bitter--bitter that the Supreme Court is blocking his \nClean Power Plan. He is pouting and he is pandering. He has gone after \ncoal, he has gone after oil, and now he is going after natural gas. It \nis a vendetta against American energy producers.\n  The President and other Democrats are pandering to radical \nenvironmental extremists and to their billionaire donors.\n  We all want to make sure that we have a clean environment. My goal is \nto make American energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can, and to \ndo it in ways that don't raise costs for American families. That is why \nthe people I talk with in Wyoming believe that this new regulation is \nthe wrong approach.\n  My local newspaper, the Casper Star Tribune, had a front-page article \nabout it on Friday. The headline was this: ``Cuts to methane emissions \nproposed.'' The article quotes John Robitaille. He is from the \nPetroleum Association of Wyoming. He says the Environmental Protection \nAgency ``has failed to recognize the economic burden placed on \nreplacing equipment on existing wells as opposed to new wells''--ones \nthat are still to be built.\n  John Robitaille may say ``failed to recognize.'' I say the \nadministration deliberately refuses to recognize--refuses. For \nWashington to come in and demand expensive new equipment for all of \nthese oil and gas wells would be a huge cost. It would drive up prices \nfor consumers, and it would mean that some of these wells wouldn't be \neconomically worthwhile anymore. The oil and gas would stay in the \nground where it does nothing to help power our economy or power our \ncountry.\n  States are already doing their part. States are trying to limit \nmethane leaks where they find a problem. Colorado has a leak detection \nand repair program that will help keep ozone and methane from escaping. \nWyoming, my home State, is looking for ways to get more up-to-date \nequipment on new wells as they get going.\n  So the States are already taking the lead, and they are already \ncoming up with solutions where they are needed. This is not a one-size-\nfits-all regulation coming from unelected, unaccountable Washington \nbureaucrats. But that is what we are having to deal with now in this \nadministration.\n  What we prefer are State solutions. What I just described are State \nsolutions that strike a commonsense balance between a strong economy \nand a very healthy environment. It is not just the States that are \ntaking action. Oil and gas producers also want to reduce how much \nmethane escapes from these wells.\n  When you think about it, producers would prefer to capture that gas \nand then to sell it so it can be used. That is why the industry reduced \nmethane emissions by 13 percent between 2008 and 2013. Over the same \nyears, U.S. shale gas production grew by 400 percent. So the industry \nactually cut emissions even while gas production went way up. This \nhappened because of the action that the producers in the States have \nalready been taking, not because of more regulations coming out of \nWashington, DC. Energy producers need the flexibility to tackle these \nemissions when and how it makes sense.\n  There are already too many rules on the books. The Bureau of Land \nManagement has another methane rule in the works. More duplicative \nregulations will just raise costs for Americans at a time when our \neconomy is weak and emissions actually are already dropping.\n  This new redtape could add hundreds of millions of dollars every year \nonto the cost of producing American red, white, and blue energy. If the \nObama administration really wants to reduce emissions from oil and gas \nwells, it should help the industry to capture this gas and to use it.\n  This was the subject of bipartisan legislation that Senator Heidi \nHeitkamp of North Dakota and I offered last month. It was an amendment \nto the energy legislation. Our bipartisan amendment would have \nexpedited the permit process for natural gas gathering lines--the lines \nthat gather this gas on the Federal land, on Indian land and then help \ntake it to market.\n  Gas gathering lines are essentially pipelines that collect \nunprocessed gas from oil and gas wells and then ship it to a processing \nplant. At the plant, different kinds of gases--methane, propane--are \nseparated from one another. They are then shipped out again to \nlocations where they can be sold and used by people.\n  That is what the producers want to do. The problem is that we don't \nhave enough of these pipelines now to gather up the gas and to send it \nto the processing plants. A lot of times there is only one option if \nyou don't have the gathering lines, and that is to flare or vent the \nexcess natural gas at the well. If there were more gathering lines, we \nwould have a lot less waste of energy. We would have a lot less of \nthese methane emissions that President Obama claims to be so worried \nabout. So Senator Heitkamp and I offered a better way to deal with the \nproblem, and 43 Democrats here in the Senate blocked our amendment.\n  At a hearing of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee last \nmonth, I actually asked Interior Secretary Jewell about the idea. Even \nshe had to concede that speeding up the permits was something that they \nshould be looking into.\n  This doesn't have to be a fight. We all agree there is too much of \nthis gas that has been vented or burned off at the oil and gas wells. \nRepublicans know it. Democrats know it. Energy producers know it. So \nwhy can't we agree to let the industry build the gathering lines to \nhelp them capture the gas where it makes sense and how it makes sense? \nWhy do we need more Washington regulations that impose higher costs?\n  America's energy producers have increased production while reducing \nemissions. They have provided what may be the only bright spot in our \neconomy over the past 7 years. We should be doing all that we can to \nhelp and to encourage them. We should be looking for voluntary, cost-\neffective ways to make sure that we can make American energy as clean \nas we can and as fast as we can without raising costs on American \nfamilies. The Obama administration is going in the wrong direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Kyle Ruckert\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my longest serving \nstaff member, my chief of staff, campaign manager, and close friend \nKyle Ruckert, who is departing the Senate at the end of this week to \nstart an exciting new career. Kyle was one of my very first hires when \nI was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1999. He \nstarted as my legislative director in the House under the wonderful \ntutelage of my first chief of staff, Marty Driesler. And I know Kyle \nand I are both indebted to Marty, who is now unfortunately deceased, \nfor getting us started on a wonderful footing in Congress. Then Kyle \nbecame my chief of staff upon Marty's retirement in 2002.\n  I guess I would sum up the bottom line in a very simple but important \nway: There has not been one moment during these 17 years when I have \nregretted placing my complete trust in\n\n[[Page S1531]]\n\nKyle to lead our office and serve the people of Louisiana--not one. \nFrom day one, Kyle set the office standard of service to constituents \nand set it as a top priority. He established offices throughout the \nState. One of his most memorable decisions instituted a mobile office \non wheels so that we could reach out to those hit hard by Hurricanes \nGustav and Ike in 2008--folks who could not otherwise reach our \npermanent offices. I say ``memorable'' because for the staffers who \nactually had to man and woman that vehicle, it was an adventurous ride.\n  Of course, Kyle's leadership style and commitment to service comes \nfrom his wonderful parents, and I take a moment to thank his parents, \nJohn and Ellen Ruckert, who are with us in the Gallery and whom I have \nalso come to know and respect.\n  I also think a big part of Kyle's commitment to serve others comes \nfrom his time at Jesuit High School in New Orleans, where the motto is \n``Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam''--``For the Greater Glory of God''--and where \nall students are expected to accept the challenge of becoming a ``man \nfor others'' as part of the Ignatius tradition. Kyle is probably one of \nthe best ambassadors for Jesuits, and he even played a role in my son \nJack going there. Go, Blue Jays.\n  In 2004, Kyle moved down to Louisiana to manage my first Senate \ncampaign. He quickly earned the respect of national political \nprognosticators on the campaign side who quite frankly belittled our \nchances from the beginning. Kyle reacted to the conventional wisdom \nthat we couldn't win a runoff against our so-called moderate Democratic \nopponent in a pretty straightforward way: He simply made sure we got \nmore than 50 percent of the vote in the open primary, so we never went \nto a runoff. Problem solved. Kyle's discipline and strategic thinking \nare largely to thank for that win, and after that he immediately \nreturned to manage our Senate office as chief of staff. Unfortunately, \nour first major test in the Senate was a tragic one. In 2005, Hurricane \nKatrina devastated Louisiana and was followed very shortly by Hurricane \nRita. Constituent service, always a top priority, took on an even \ngreater urgency and seriousness, and Kyle led our team to help, \nconsole, and serve all ``For the Greater Glory of God,'' acting as a \n``man for others.''\n\n  Kyle led our staff managing an effective operation, first and \nforemost, assisting constituents on the ground, and in Congress, \nhelping to put together emergency assistance legislation, making sure \npeople in real need received what they absolutely needed. This was one \nof the most chaotic times for all of us from Louisiana, but Kyle was \nalways calm and methodical, always steering the ship with a steady \nhand.\n  Kyle's leadership is contagious. His expectations are very high--be \nat work, get it over 100 percent, and get the job done. If that means \nworking at night and on weekends, he would expect that out of everyone \non the team and, unlike some other so-called leaders, he would be right \nthere leading the way in that regard. Our staff has become stronger \nbecause of that leadership by example and that contagious work ethic.\n  Besides his calm, disciplined, methodical leadership style, Kyle's \nstrongest attribute is his loyalty and trust he places in those he \nworks with. He always encourages staff to take chances, to be bold in \npushing new reforms, in negotiating amendment votes, in pushing \nimportant stories with the press. When staff would run ideas by him and \nask him what he thought, he would say: If you think it is the right \nthing to do, go for it. Just don't--bleep--it up.\n  His leadership was tested again on the campaign side in our 2010 \nreelection race, where again the political commentators largely bet \nagainst us, and again Kyle made sure they were wrong in a big way. We \nwon that race by 19 points. Since then I have had the real fortune of \nserving in leadership positions in the Senate, as the ranking \nRepublican in the EPW Committee in 2013 and 2014 and currently as chair \nof the Small Business Committee.\n  Aside from our many legislative accomplishments under Kyle's \nleadership, what I am perhaps most proud of is the close-knit team we \nbuilt together. We call it Team Vitter, and those are more than just \nwords in our office. We both look at our staff as an extension of our \nimmediate families. Certainly my wife Wendy and our kids and I \ndefinitely think of Kyle and his family as part of ours.\n  Kyle sets a gold standard for thinking of staff as family--for \ntreating them that way. Perhaps, in part, because he married another \none of my former staffers, Lynnel. Lynnel started working in my office \non the House side early on in 2002. She worked there until 2004 and \nalso joined that first winning Senate campaign. It is interesting, Kyle \nand Lynnel started dating secretly, not telling anyone in the office--\ncertainly not me. I think they were first discovered when my first \nchief of staff, Marty Driesler, got a call from her daughter who had \nwitnessed them being weekend tourists in Philadelphia together. Of \ncourse, I was still kept in the dark for months after that, even though \nMarty discovered their courtship.\n  Lynnel, too, always stressed constituent service and is a brilliant \npolitical strategist. They truly were meant for each other in all sorts \nof ways. Lynnel has continued her extremely successful career, most \nrecently serving as chief of staff to House majority whip Steve \nScalise.\n  In 2005, Kyle and Lynnel got married, and since then our office has \nhad three other couples from Team Vitter get married. Perhaps there is \nmore to those late work nights than I had imagined originally.\n  Kyle and Lynnel and their two kids, Jack, who is now 9, and Mary \nKyle, who is now 6, are getting settled in Baton Rouge as part of a \nnew, exciting chapter of their lives. It is going to be fun. We are \ngoing to miss them, but it is going to be fun to see this new chapter \nfor Kyle and Lynnel and their family develop, especially when we get to \nsee Kyle, as a New Orleans native and an avid Tulane Green Wave alumn, \nhaving to start wearing purple and gold around Baton Rouge at the \nurging of their son Jack.\n  Who knows, maybe he will even develop a superstition before LSU \ngames. Something a lot of folks don't know about Kyle is he is \nincredibly superstitious--knock on wood. He will detour his Monday \nmorning drive in New Orleans to pass by the Superdome if the Saints won \non Sunday. He will sip the same type of bourbon for good luck or wear \nhis lucky green polo if we need a win in sports, politically, or \nanything in between.\n  I will tell a quick story related to that about his green polo. On \nelection day in 2004, Kyle was wearing a campaign T-shirt, but he \nwasn't going to be able to go to the polls that way to vote and do some \npoll watching, so he asked around the office if he could borrow a \ndifferent shirt. Mac Abrams, who is now Dean Heller's chief of staff--\nand who was a key staff member in my office in my campaign at the \ntime--loaned him his green polo. Well, we won that race big, and Kyle \nhasn't returned the green polo yet. He wears it every election day, \nalthough we are not sure if it is superstition or also because he is so \ndarn cheap.\n  While Kyle will now be living in Louisiana, his impact will remain \nstrong in our work and our office and our culture. He will be able to \nsee it in legislation which helps Louisiana and the country, in \nthousands and thousands of constituents whom he and our team \neffectively reached out to, and in the great example he set for so many \nstaffers and interns and others on our team.\n  So let me end really where I began, by paying him the highest \ncompliment possible, repeating that there hasn't been one moment in \nthese great 17 years where I regretted placing my complete trust in \nKyle Ruckert to lead our team, to lead our office, to help lead us in \nserving the people of Louisiana--not one.\n  Kyle, thank you for your service to Louisiana, for the countless \nhours you have spent helping me, for the fun memories and laughs we \nhave shared, and most importantly for your friendship. You truly are \npart of my family. I have the greatest confidence that you will \ncontinue on ``Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam''--``For the Greater Glory of \nGod''--truly a ``man for others.''\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1532]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may address \nthe Senate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona\n\n\n                    Imprisonment of Nadiya Savchenko\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it has been 2 years since Nadiya \nSavchenko, the first female military pilot in post-Soviet Ukraine and \nan Iraq war veteran, was abducted from Ukrainian territory by pro-\nRussian separatists and smuggled across the border to Russia where she \nfaces false charges and illegal imprisonment.\n  She is accused by Russia of having directed artillery fire that \nkilled two Russian state television journalists in Eastern Ukraine in \nJune of 2014 and then illegally crossing into Russian territory without \nproper paperwork. This is despite clear evidence provided by her \nlawyers that she was captured by separatists before this incident \noccurred and then hauled across the border in handcuffs with a sack \nover her head.\n  Following her capture, Nadiya has reportedly endured interrogations, \nsolitary confinement, and was subjected to a psychiatric evaluation at \nthe infamous Russian Serbsky Institute, where Soviet authorities were \nonce known to torture political dissidents. Further media reports \nsuggest that she is gravely ill and near death.\n  There are international laws that govern treatment of prisoners of \nwar, but Russia continues to deny it is fighting a war in Ukraine and \nis therefore treating Nadiya as a common criminal. While there are also \ninternational laws that govern the treatment of common criminals, \nRussia has shown as much regard for those laws as for Ukraine's \nsovereignty or the rights of Russians such as Boris Nemtsov.\n  This is a picture of Nadiya standing trial in a cage. From her prison \ncell in Russia, Nadiya said:\n\n       If I am found guilty, I will not appeal. I want the entire \n     democratic world to understand that Russia is a Third World \n     country with a totalitarian regime and a petty tyrant for a \n     dictator and it spits on international law and human rights.\n\n  In her last appearance in court, Ms. Savchenko said:\n\n       The trial proves the guilt of Russian authorities; they are \n     to blame for seizing Ukrainian lands, capturing Crimea and \n     starting a war in the Donbass region. They are to blame for \n     trying to establish--through their foul undeclared wars all \n     over the world--a totalitarian regime dominated by Russia.\n\n  She ended her court appearance by saying:\n\n       Russia will return me to Ukraine yet. Whether I am dead or \n     alive, it will return me.\n\n  Nadiya's captivity represents just the latest example of Russia's \nbrazen aggression and disregard for the independence and territorial \nintegrity of Ukraine.\n  Last summer another brave Ukrainian and film director from Crimea, \nOleg Sentsov, faced a similar fate. A Russian court sentenced Mr. \nSentsov to 20 years in prison based on charges that he was planning a \nterrorist attack against Russian forces after the peninsula was annexed \nby Russia. Despite strong evidence that Mr. Sentsov was innocent and \ndespite international condemnation of his case, he remains in a Russian \nprison serving out his 20-year sentence. As Mr. Sentsov said in remarks \nfollowing his sentence: ``A court of occupiers can never be just.''\n  Nadiya is just one of President Putin's countless victims. Her show \ntrial--a throwback to the Stalinist Soviet era--is intended not to \nestablish innocence or guilt, but to punish dissent, evoke fear, and \nremind citizens of what happens to people who dare defy the former KGB \nofficer, Vladimir Putin.\n  Her trial illustrates just how far President Putin is willing to go \nto humiliate Ukraine for its pursuit of freedom and punish Ukrainians \nfor refusing to accept its illegal occupation. It is just one more way \nthat Putin is trying to bully free peoples and free nations into \nsubmission. He is sending the message that anyone who dares to \nchallenge him will end up in a cage just like her--or worse.\n  Putin's efforts are failing. The Ukrainian people have shown that \nthey will not be intimidated, they will not be silenced, and they will \nnot give into fear. They have shown that they will continue to fight \nfor a free and democratic future for Ukraine with or without the \ninternational support they need and deserve.\n  One of the more shameful chapters in American history will be the \nfact that we still refuse to give Ukrainians defensive weapons with \nwhich to defend themselves. This President has made a lot of grievous \nerrors, but it is outrageous, as we watch Ukrainians slaughtered by \nRussian tanks, that we will not even give them the weapons to defend \nthemselves.\n  The Ukrainian Government has urged Moscow to release Nadiya in \naccordance with the Minsk II agreement that provides for the release of \nall illegally held persons. International leaders have echoed this \ncall, but her illegal imprisonment continues. It is time to move past \nmeaningless condemnations and expressions of concern and respond to \nPutin's shameful and blatant breach of international law by \nsanctioning--I emphasize sanctioning--those responsible for the \nkidnapping and illegal, unjust imprisonment of Ms. Savchenko, as well \nas the officials involved in the fabrication of false charges against \nher.\n  A clear message must be sent to Moscow: Release Nadiya or face \nsanctions. Release her or face sanctions.\n  The United States has a critical role to play in the preservation of \nfreedom and democracy throughout the world, and it is a role that we \nsuppress at our own peril. I know this is not a popular cause in the \nUnited States right now, but nothing will relieve us of the \nresponsibility to stand up for those whose fundamental human rights are \nbeing violated and to defend the values that America and our allies \nhave sacrificed so much to preserve.\n  How we respond to each and every attempt by Putin to suppress \ndemocracy and freedom will have far-reaching repercussions. The United \nStates and the entire international community must respond to this \nlatest outrage in a way that demonstrates the inevitability of the \nvalues which Nadiya so clearly represents. Nadiya's fight--and that of \nall Ukrainians who rose up peacefully against tyranny in their quest \nfor freedom--must also be the world's fight. We must continue to show \nPutin that he cannot halt the march to freedom and democracy. The \nUkrainian people--and the Russian people, too--deserve no less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Cuba\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, as the President prepares to go to Cuba, \nI rise in memory of all of those Cuban dissidents who have given their \nlives in the hope that Cuba one day would be free from the yoke of the \nCastro regime. It is that freedom I had hoped President Obama was \nreferencing when he said:\n\n       What I've said to the Cuban government is--if we're seeing \n     more progress in the liberty and freedom and possibilities of \n     ordinary Cubans, I'd love to use a visit as a way of \n     highlighting that progress. . . . If we're going backwards, \n     then there's not much reason for me to be there.\n\n  But that is obviously not the case, which is why the Boston Globe's \nheadline on February 25 says it all: ``Obama Breaks Pledge, Will Visit \nCuba Despite Worsening Human Rights.'' Instead of having the free \nworld's leader honor Latin America's only dictatorship with a visit, he \ncould have visited one of 150 countries that he has not visited, \nincluding several in Latin America that are democracies.\n  The President has negotiated a deal with the Castros--and I \nunderstand his desire to make this his legacy issue--but there is still \na fundamental issue of freedom and democracy at stake that goes to the \nunderlying atmosphere in Cuba and whether or not the Cuban people will \nstill be repressed and still be imprisoned or will they benefit from \nthe President's legacy or will it be the Castro regime that reaps those \nbenefits?\n\n[[Page S1533]]\n\n  Unless the Castros are compelled to change their dictatorship--the \nway they govern the island and the way they exploit its people--the \nanswer to this won't be much different than the last 50-some-odd years. \nThe Castro regime will be the beneficiary.\n  At the very least, the President's first stops should be meetings \nwith internationally recognized dissidents: U.S. Presidential Medal of \nFreedom winner Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet and the European Union's Sakharov \nprize recipients Guillermo Farinas and Rosa Maria Paya, in respect for \nher murdered father, Oswaldo Paya, who was leading the Varela Project, \nadvocating for civil liberties, and collecting thousands of signatures \npetitioning the Castro regime for democratic change--as permitted, by \nthe way, under the Cuban Constitution. So threatening was his peaceful \npetition drive that he was assassinated by Castro security agents.\n  The President should meet with Berta Soler at her home, in her \nneighborhood, with the Ladies in White, and with dissidents and \ndemocracy advocates in Havana. That should be the front-page photograph \nwe see next week. Only then will the message that the United States \nwill not give in or give up on our commitment to a free and democratic \nCuba be clear to the world and to the Cuban people.\n  To leave a truly honorable mark in history would mean the President \nleaving Castro's cordoned-off tourist zone and seeking Berta Soler and \nher Ladies in White at their headquarters in the Lawton neighborhood of \nHavana, where poverty, Castro-style--not opportunity, not freedom, not \ndemocracy but poverty created by a Stalinist state--is the umbrella \nunder which they live.\n  The President should witness their bravery, listen to their stories, \nfeel their despair, see the fear under which they live, and stand up \nwith them and for them. If he did, he could learn of the story of \nAliuska Gomez, one of the Ladies in White, who was arrested this past \nSunday for marching peacefully.\n  Basically, the Ladies in White dress in white as a form of a symbol. \nThey march with a gladiolus to church every Sunday in protest for their \nsons and husbands who are arrested simply for their political dissent, \nand they are beaten savagely--savagely.\n  The President could learn of the story of Aliuska Gomez, one of the \nLadies in White, who was arrested this past Sunday for marching \npeacefully. I am reading from an article in Diario de Cuba where she \ntold her story:\n\n       ``We were subjected to a lot of violence today,'' said \n     Aliuska Gomez. ``Many of us were dragged and beaten,'' she \n     added, pointing out that this has taken place only one week \n     before President Obama's visit. Aliuska related how she was \n     taken to a police station in Marianao where she was forcibly \n     undressed by several uniformed officers in plain view of some \n     males. . . . ''After they had taken away all of my \n     belongings,'' she said, ``they told me to strip naked, and I \n     refused, so they threw me down on the floor and took off all \n     of my clothing, right in front of two men, and they dragged \n     me completely naked into a jail cell.'' Aliuska was then \n     handcuffed and thrown on the cell's floor naked and left \n     alone.\n\n  Or how about the young Cuban dissident who met with Ben Rhodes and \nwas arrested in Havana. This is from a report dated March 14:\n\n       Yesterday the Castro regime arrested Carlos Amel Oliva, \n     head of the youth wing of the Cuban Patriotic Union, a major \n     dissident organization. He is being accused of antisocial \n     behavior. On Friday, Amel Oliva had participated in a meeting \n     in Miami with Ben Rhodes, President Obama's Deputy National \n     Security Advisor. He returned to Havana on Sunday.\n\n  I guess that is what Raul Castro thinks and does to those who meet \nwith the President's Deputy National Security Advisor.\n  Notwithstanding their true stories and the stories of thousands like \nthem, the President first announced sweeping changes to America's \nstrategic approach to the Castro regime in December 2014. In broad \nstrokes, we learned of the forthcoming reestablishment of diplomatic \nrelations--an exchange of symbols, with the American flag flying over a \nU.S. Embassy in Havana and the Cuban flag flying over a Cuban Embassy \nin Washington. We learned about the process by which Cuba's designation \nas a state sponsor of terrorism would be lifted. We learned about the \nforthcoming transformative effects of a unilateral easing of sanctions \nto increase travel, commerce, and currency.\n  But for those of us who understand this regime, we cautioned for \nnuance and urged against those broad strokes. We asked that the \nadministration at least require the Castros to reciprocate with certain \nconcessions of their own, which would be as good for U.S. national \ninterests as for the Cuban people and for U.S.-Cuba relations.\n  For example, before the President ever traveled to Burma--a country \nwith notorious human rights abuses and with which this administration \nbegan to engage--the United States first demanded and received action \nby the Burmese to address their human rights record. To be sure, the \nBurmese Government agreed to meet nearly a dozen benchmarks--a dozen \nbenchmarks--as a part of this action-for-action engagement, including \ngranting the Red Cross access to prisons, establishing a U.N. High \nCommissioner for Human Rights office, release of political prisoners, \nconclusion of a cease-fire in Kachin State, and ensuring international \naccess to conflict areas.\n  We asked, as the President's Cuban policy unfolded, that they push \nfor changes that put Cubans in control of their own future, their \npolitical process, economic opportunities, civil society, and \ngovernance. We didn't get a single one.\n  We asked for changes that would honor America's legacy as a champion \nfor human rights. We didn't get those either.\n  We suggested changes that would ultimately bring Cuba into the \ncommunity of nations, contributing to, rather than detracting from, the \noverall prosperity of the hemisphere. And there were none.\n  Most importantly, we asked that they remember that it is a lack of \nresources, not a change of heart, that slowed the Castros' adventurism \nand instability-inducing support for those who would pose threats to \nour national interests within the Western Hemisphere.\n  In essence, we were thinking strategically. Instead, we traded \nstrategy for tactics. Leading Cuban human rights and democracy \nactivists have criticized U.S. policies--those languishing inside of \nCuba who risk their lives and their liberty every day.\n  The simple truth is that deals with the Devil require the Devil to \ndeal. Opening channels of communications controlled by the regime means \nnothing unless we are going to communicate our values. It means nothing \nif we do not champion the material changes the Cuban people seek. It \nmeans nothing if we do not speak the language the Castros understand--\nthat the Communist revolution has failed miserably and it is time to \nlet the Cuban people decide their future.\n  The Castros know it, but it is the antiquated hallmark of the \nrevolution and the iron-fisted rule that came from it that keeps them \nin power. We talk about being in the past. Well, that is in the past, \nbut no one challenges that past. Until that power is truly challenged, \nwe can expect to witness the further weakening of our leverage on \nbehalf of democracy and human rights.\n  In the meantime, the regime is already moving forward, already \nbreathing new life into its existing repressive state systems. Cubans \nare being beaten, arrested, and otherwise muzzled at higher rates--\nhigher rates--than ever before. The Cuban Commission for Human Rights, \nwhich is within Cuba, has documented 1,141 political arrests by the \nCastro regime in Cuba during the short month of February 2016. In \nJanuary 2016 the commission documented 1,447 political arrests. As \nsuch, these 2,588 political arrests in the first 2\\1/2\\ months of this \nyear represent the highest tally to begin a year in decades. This is \nwhat happens when President Obama first announces he will not visit \nCuba until there are tangible improvements in the respect for human \nrights, and then he crosses his own red lines--nearly 2,600 arrests in \n2\\1/2\\ months, and these are only political arrests that have been \nthoroughly documented. Many more are suspected.\n\n  U.S. fugitives and members of foreign terrorist organizations, such \nas Joanne Chesimard, the convicted killer of New Jersey State Trooper \nWerner Foerster, or Charlie Hill, who killed New Mexico State Trooper \nRobert Rosenbloom, still enjoy safe harbor on the island. Not a penny \nof the $6 billion in outstanding\n\n[[Page S1534]]\n\nclaims by American citizens and businesses for properties confiscated \nby the Castros has been repaid.\n  Unrelenting censorship and oppression of Cuban journalists continues \nunscathed, and the Cuban path to liberty doesn't even include the U.S. \nEmbassy.\n  So what do we learn? We learn that, despite the Obama \nadministration's engagement with the Castro dictatorship and increased \ntravel to the island, repression on the island is rising exponentially. \nWhy? Because the Castro regime, one of the most astute observers of the \nAmerican political system, is rushing to take advantage of the \npermissive environment created by the President's hunger for legacy and \nthe relaxation of restrictions. But legacy is not more important than \nlives.\n  For years we have heard how an improvement in U.S.-Cuba relations, an \neasing of sanctions, and an increase in travel to the island would \nbenefit the Cuban people--a benefit not realized despite the visits and \ninvestments of millions of Europeans, Canadians, Mexicans, and South \nAmericans. There is not one iota of better life or greater democracy \nfor the Cuban people. These assumptions are wrong. And since December \n17, 2014, the President has engaged the regime, offering unilateral \nconcessions that the Castros are more than happy to accept. If that is \nnot enough for us to at least question our Cuba policy, we are now \nfacing an unfolding Cuban migration crisis.\n  The United States is faced with the largest migration of Cuban \nimmigrants since the rafters of 1994. The number of Cubans entering the \nUnited States in 2015 was nearly twice that of 2014--some 51,000--and \ntens of thousands more are desperately trying to make the journey via \nSouth and Central America. I ask: Why would Cubans flee if the promise \nof a better life in Cuba is just on the horizon? When President Obama \ntook office, those numbers were less than 7,000 annually--51,000.\n  We hear that ``self-employment,'' such as it is in Cuba, is growing. \nBut the number of ``self-employed'' workers in Cuba has actually \ndecreased. The Cuban government today is licensing 10,000 fewer ``self-\nemployed'' workers than it did in 2014. In contrast, Castro's military \nmonopolies are expanding at record pace. Even the limited spaces in \nwhich ``self-employed'' workers previously operated are being squeezed \nas the Cuban military expands its control of the island's travel, \nretail, and financial sectors of the economy.\n  While speaking recently to a business gathering in Washington, here \nin the Nation's Capital, President Obama argued how he believes this \nnew policy is ``creating the environment in which a generational change \nand transition will take place in [Cuba].'' But the key question is, A \n``generational change and transition'' toward what and by whom?\n  Cuban democracy leader, Antonio Rodiles, has concisely expressed this \nconcern. He said ``legitimizing the [Castro] regime is the path \ncontrary to a transition.''\n  CNN has revealed that the Cuban delegation in the secret talks that \nbegan in mid-2013 with U.S. officials in Ottawa, Toronto, and Rome, and \nwhich led to the December 17 policy announcement, were headed by \nColonel Alejandro Castro Espin. Colonel Castro Espin is the 49-year-old \nson of Cuban dictator Raul Castro.\n  In both face-to-face meetings between President Obama and Raul Castro \nthis year--first at April's Summit of the Americas in Panama City and \njust recently at the United Nation's General Assembly in New York--\nAlejandro was seated, with a wide grin, next to his father. Alejandro \nholds the rank of colonel in Cuba's Ministry of the Interior, with his \nhand on the pulse and trigger of the island's intelligence services and \nrepressive ordinances. It is no secret that Raul Castro is grooming \nAlejandro for a position of power.\n  Sadly, his role as interlocutor with the Obama administration seeks \nto further their goal of an intrafamily generational transition within \nthe Castro clan, similar to the Assads in Syria and the Kims in North \nKorea. And we know how well those have worked out.\n  To give an idea of how Colonel Alejandro Castro views the United \nStates, he has described its leaders as ``those who seek to subjugate \nhumanity to satisfy their interests and hegemonic goals.'' This is who \nis being readied to be the next leader of Cuba, with whom we have been \nnegotiating.\n  Of course, it also takes money to run a totalitarian dictatorship, \nwhich is why Raul Castro named his son-in-law, General Luis Alberto \nRodriguez Lopez Callejas, as head of GAESA, which stands for Grupo de \nAdministracion Empresarial S.A., or translated, Business Administrative \nGroup.\n  GAESA is the holding company of Cuba's Ministry of the Revolutionary \nArmed Forces, Cuba's military. It is the dominant driving force of the \nisland's economy. Established in the 1990s by Raul Castro, it controls \ntourism companies, ranging from the very profitable Gaviota S.A., which \nruns Cuba's hotels, restaurants, car rentals, and nightclubs, to TRD \nCaribe S.A., which runs the island's retail stores. GAESA controls \nvirtually all economic transactions in Cuba.\n  According to Hotels Magazine, a leading industry publication, GAESA--\nthrough its subsidiaries--is by far the largest regional hotel \nconglomerate in Latin America. It controls more hotel rooms than the \nWalt Disney Company.\n  As McClatchy News explained a few years back:\n\n       Tourists who sleep in some of Cuba's hotels, drive rental \n     cars, fill up their gas tanks, and even those riding in taxis \n     have something in common: They are contributing to the \n     [Cuban] Revolutionary Armed Forces' bottom line.\n\n  In essence, Cuba's military and its repressive system.\n  GAESA became this business powerhouse, thanks to the millions of \nCanadians and European tourists that have and continue to visit Cuba \neach year. The Cuban military-owned tourism company, Gaviota Tourism \nGroup S.A., averaged 12 percent growth in 2015 and expects to double \nits hotel business this year.\n  These tourists have done absolutely nothing to promote freedom and \ndemocracy in Cuba. To the contrary, they have directly financed a \nsystem of control and repression over the Cuban people, all while \nenjoying cigars by Cuban workers paid in worthless pesos and having a \nCuba Libre, which is an oxymoron, on the beaches Varadero. Yet, despite \nthe clear evidence, President Obama wants American tourists to now \ndouble GAESA's bonanza and, through GAESA, strengthen the regime.\n  An insightful report by Bloomberg Business also explained:\n\n       [Raul's son-in-law, General Rodriguez] is the gatekeeper \n     for most foreign investors, requiring them to do business \n     with his organization if they wish to set up shop on the \n     island. If and when the U.S. finally removes its half-century \n     embargo on Cuba, it will be this man who decides which \n     investors get the best deals.\n\n  Again, he is part of the Cuban military. So this is not about people \nto people. This is about us helping the very entities that help fund \nthe Cuban military and security agencies. In other words, all of the \ntalking points about how lifting the embargo and tourism restrictions \nwould somehow benefit the Cuban people are empty and misleading \nrhetoric.\n  In addition, Internet ``connectivity ranking'' has dropped in Cuba. \nThe International Telecommunication Union's ``Measuring the Information \nSociety Report'' for 2015, the most reliable source of data and \nanalysis on global access to information and communication, dropped \nCuba's ranking to 129, down from 119. Cuba fares much worse than some \nof the world's most infamous suppressors, including Syria, Iran, China, \nand Venezuela--worse.\n  In Cuba, religious freedom violations have also increased. According \nto the London-based NGO, Christian Solidarity Worldwide, last year, \n2,000 churches in Cuba were declared illegal and 100 were designated \nfor demolition by the Castro regime. Altogether, they documented 2,300 \nseparate violations of religious freedom in 2015, compared to 220 in \n2014--2,300 versus 220. So religious oppression is on the rise. And if \nthat is not enough, Castro reneged on the release of political \nprisoners and visits by international monitors. Most of the 53 \npolitical prisoners released in the months prior and after the \nPresident's December 2014 announcement have since been rearrested on \nmultiple occasions. Five have been handed new long-term prison \nsentences. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch noted in its new 2016 report \nthat ``Cuba has yet to allow visits to the island by the International \nCommittee of the Red Cross or by the United Nations human\n\n[[Page S1535]]\n\nrights monitors, as stipulated in the December 2014 agreement with the \nUnited States.''\n  These were the conditions that prompted Congress, over the course of \nour long history with Cuba, to pass successive laws to build on--not \ndetract from--Executive orders that created the embargo. So I stand \nwith thousands of Cuba's civil society leaders, dissidents, journalists \nand everyday men and women who long for the day when the freedom we \nenjoy in our great country extends to theirs. As long as I have a \nvoice, they will have an ally to speak truth to power against this \ndictatorship and against any effort to legitimize it or reward it.\n  We must realize the nature of the Castro regime will not be altered \nby capitulating on our demands for basic human and civil rights. If the \nUnited States is to give away its leverage, it should be in exchange \nfor one thing, and one thing only: a true transition in Cuba.\n  Finally, as for the latest announcements from the administration, I \nstand against any rollback of the statutory provisions that codify Cuba \nsanctions. We learned this week that the administration has cleared the \nway for individual travel to Cuba outside the auspices of a group or \norganization, and that is tourism, plain and simple.\n  We learned this week that the administration has cleared the way for \nCubans--athletes, artists, performers, and others--to earn salaries in \nthe United States, which, in and of itself would be a good thing, \nexcept that, unfortunately, much if not all of those salaries will go \nback to the regime, as they must pay the regime most of what they make \nabroad.\n  We learned that Americans may purchase Cuban-origin products and \nservices in third countries--cigars, alcohol, and basic products \nproduced by a system of slave labor that funnels proceeds to one place: \nthe regime's pockets.\n  When it comes to banking and financial services, we will now permit \nthe U.S. financial system to facilitate the flow of these and other \nproceeds directly to the regime. The administration will allow the \nCuban Government, which profits from the sale of intelligence--as when \nthey had our Hellfire missile--to export Cuban-origin software to the \nUnited States. Never mind that the Cuban Government aggressively \nmonitors the Internet activity of Cuban dissidents and sensors users on \nthe island. And then we are going to permit direct shipping by Cuban \nvessels. These ``significant amendments'' to the Cuban Assets Control \nRegulations and the Export Administration Regulations, cornerstones of \nimplementation of United States sanctions against the Castro regime \nannounced on Tuesday, create new opportunities for abuse of permitted \ntravel. They authorize trade and commerce with Castro monopolies and \npermit the regime to use U.S. dollars to conduct its business. They are \nunilateral concessions, requiring no changes from the Castro regime to \nthe political and economic system under which the Castros exploit lives \nand labor of Cuban nationals.\n  In a meeting late last week, I warned officials at the Department of \nTreasury that these changes ``come up to the line and in some cases \ncross it,'' with respect to statutory authority. Their actions are \ninconsistent with existing statutes and incompatible with the intent of \nCongress as expressed through those statutes. I should know, as I was \none of the authors of the Libertad Act when I served in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  In my view, at the end of the day, this is a unilateral transfer of \nthe little remaining leverage that the administration hadn't given away \nprior to this week's announcement. With these steps, I believe Commerce \nand Treasury have set the stage for legal action against the \nadministration. Congress has authorized categories of travel to Cuba, \nbut none of these categories were tourism or commerce for commerce's \nsake with the regime. The President has said his Cuba policy ``helps \npromote the people's independence from Cuban authorities,'' but it is \nclear that it does not. Yet, this week, in what would seem to \ncontravene not only the letter but the spirit of the law, the \nadministration will reportedly allow the regime to use U.S. dollars in \ninternational financial transactions and a U.S. hotel company to \npartner with a Cuban military conglomerate run by the Castro family.\n\n  Let's be clear. It is not the Cuban people who are eager and willing \nto shuffle dollars through BNP Paribas, INB Group, or HSBC Bank; only \nthe regime is willing and eager to do so.\n  As for the reports that Starwood-Marriott is looking for an \narrangement with the regime, with the blessing of the administration, \nit would be an agreement with a subsidiary of GAESA, the Cuban military \nconglomerate run by Raul Castro's son-in-law, General Luis Alberto \nRodriguez Lopez-Callejas. So how does that help the Cuban people when \nyou are working and helping the regime? It would be an agreement to \nmanage a hotel for the Cuban military. Among those considered is \nHavana's swanky hotel Saratoga, which has been confiscated twice by the \nCastro regime--an agreement by which employees are also hired by the \nregime's state employment agency instead of directly by a company, in \nviolation of international labor laws.\n  So I ask, how does allowing U.S. companies to do business with the \nregime, let alone the Castro family itself, ``promote the Cuban \npeople's independence from the authorities,'' as the President has \nsaid?\n  This breathes new life into the Castro's repressive state systems, \nand that new life means one thing: The repressive system will continue \nwithout changes.\n  Next week, when we anticipate we will see a photograph of the \nPresident of the United States laughing and shaking hands with the only \ndictator in the Western Hemisphere, I will be thinking of Berta Soler \nof the Ladies in White and her fellow human rights and democracy \nadvocates. She testified before Congress last year and said: ``Our \ndemands are quite concrete; freedom for political prisoners, \nrecognition of civil society, the elimination of criminal dispositions \nthat penalize freedom of expression and association and the right of \nthe Cuban people to choose their future through free, multiparty \nelections.'' It is not an overwhelming ask. What American would be \nwilling to not have those basic fundamental freedoms?\n  What are we willing to do to impose on another country--to say: We \nwill deal with you even though you repress your people and deny them \nthose freedoms.\n  Those are the words of freedom Berta Soler spoke on her behalf and \nall of those who risk their lives and liberty every day inside of Cuba \nto create that possibility. That is the legacy we should work toward \nuntil the Cuban people are finally freed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Merrick Garland\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, early this morning I got a telephone call \nfrom a White House staffer who told me that the President was going to \nannounce his choice to fill the vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court \noccasioned by the passing of Antonin Scalia. This morning I was invited \nto the Rose Garden to witness that ceremony, and I thought it was one \nof the President's best deliveries of a message to the American people \nabout a critically important issue.\n  I applaud President Obama for his nomination of Chief Judge Merrick \nGarland to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. No one questions that Judge \nGarland is an outstanding attorney and has been an exceptional judge \nduring his 19 years on the DC Circuit Court. No one questions his \nqualifications and experience to serve with distinction on the Supreme \nCourt. I congratulate him, his wife Lynn, whom I just met, and his \ndaughters, Becky and Jessie, on this nomination.\n  Judge Garland is a proud son of Illinois. He is the grandson of \nimmigrants who fled anti-Semitic persecution. He was born in Chicago to \nparents who ran a small business and volunteered in their community. He \ngraduated at the top of his class from Niles West High School, received \nhis undergraduate law degree from Harvard, and clerked for the \nlegendary Judge Henry Friendly of the Second Circuit and Justice \nWilliam Brennan of the U.S. Supreme Court. He has an incredible legal \nresume. He served in the Justice Department and worked in private \npractice before he was nominated to the DC Circuit Court.\n  Today President Obama told the story of how Merrick Garland in the\n\n[[Page S1536]]\n\nU.S. Department of Justice was sent down after the Oklahoma City \nbombing to handle the prosecution and how he carefully, deftly, and \nprofessionally handled that prosecution in a way that it would stick \nand it wouldn't be overturned because of legal mistakes. He personally \nfelt an attachment and obligation to the victims and their families, \nand he carried with him the memorial service bulletin that was given \nout with the names of each one of the victims. He brought it with him \nto the courtroom each day. He is that kind of person--a prosecutor but \nwith empathy to the victims and a determination to make sure he \nfollowed the law. He did.\n  President Obama has fulfilled his constitutional responsibility, and \nnow the Senate must do the same. Article II, section 2, of the \nConstitution provides the requirement that the President shall appoint \na nominee to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court, and the \nPresident did that today.\n  That same section of the Constitution goes on to say that it is the \nresponsibility of the Senate--this Senate--to advise and consent to \nthat nominee. There is no requirement that we approve the President's \nnominee. He wants us to. I hope we do. But what it says is we have a \nresponsibility under the Constitution--the same Constitution we swore \nto uphold and defend.\n  So the President is using his authority and constitutional \nresponsibility by naming Merrick Garland. Now what will happen? The \nRepublican leadership in the Senate has said: End of story; we are not \ngoing to do anything. Some Senators have gone so far as to say they \nwill not even meet with this man, will not even meet with the \nPresident's nominee for the Supreme Court. In the history of the United \nStates of America, there has never--underline ``never''--been a \nsituation where the President sent a nominee to the Supreme Court to \nthe Senate and there was not a hearing. Never. And now the Republican \nmajority here has said: Ignore history. Ignore the Constitution. We are \nnot going to let this President fill this vacancy.\n  Their argument is this: Let the American people decide. There is an \nelection coming. It will be in November. Let them pick a President, who \nwill then choose that Supreme Court nominee.\n  Well, that is an interesting approach. It might make some sense had \nPresident Barack Obama been reelected in 2012 to a term of 3 years and \n2 months. He was reelected to a 4-year term by a 5 million-vote \nplurality. He is the President. And to argue that in his last year in \noffice, he should have no authority or power in the Constitution to \nexercise what is required of him is to ignore the obvious.\n  By what right do we, in the closing year of a Senator's term, vote on \nthe floor of the Senate if we are disqualified from making important \ndecisions in our last year in office in each term? It is a ludicrous \nposition, a ridiculous position. It is a position which I find \noffensive.\n  This system of government gives to the American people the last word \nabout who the President will be. There have been times when I have \napplauded that decision and times when I didn't. But if you are \nrespectful of this Constitution and this government, then you follow \nthe will of the people of this great Nation, and they made a decision \nby a plurality of 5 million votes that Barack Obama would have this \npower for 4 years, until January of 2017. So the President has sent \nthis name, and now it is up to the Senate.\n  The Judiciary Committee plays an important role in this decision, and \nI am honored to serve on it. In 2001, then-chairman of the committee \nPatrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, joined with Ranking Republican \nMember Orrin Hatch of Utah and they sent a letter to the Senate about \nthis issue of filling Supreme Court vacancies--a bipartisan letter, \nLeahy and Hatch. Here is what it said: We both recognize and have every \nintention of following the practices and precedents of the committee \nand the Senate when considering Supreme Court nominees.\n  We should hold a hearing without delay. If this letter was the case \n15 years ago and Senator Hatch, who was then the ranking Republican, \njoined with Senator Leahy, the Democratic chairman, what has changed? \nThe only thing that has changed is we have a President named Barack \nObama.\n  You see, in 1987 there was a vacancy on the Supreme Court. Ronald \nReagan was President. In 1988 he sent the name Anthony Kennedy to this \nChamber to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. The Senate at that time \nwas under the control of the Democrats. Ronald Reagan, a Republican \nPresident, sent his nominee to the Democratic Senate, and what \nhappened? Did they announce: We are not going to fill this; we will \nwait until after the election. No, no. The Democratic-controlled Senate \nheld a hearing for Anthony Kennedy, brought him up for a vote, and \npassed him unanimously to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. Now look at \nwhat we are facing--Republican colleagues who refuse to do their job \nunder the Constitution. For what reason? Obviously for political \nreasons.\n  My Republican colleagues say they are standing behind a principle \nthat the President should not get to name the Supreme Court Justice in \nhis final year. That principle has no history, no precedent, and is \nvirtually impossible to defend.\n  I would suggest a different principle to my Republican colleagues. \nSince Judge Merrick Garland is unquestionably qualified and you clearly \nwould vote to confirm him under the next President, why wait? Why not \nvote to confirm him under this President? Failing to fill this vacancy \non the Supreme Court means there will be over 1 year from the death of \nJustice Antonin Scalia until a successor is chosen. The only time in \nhistory when the Senate left a vacancy on the Supreme Court for that \nperiod of time--1 year or more--was during the Civil War when we were \nliterally at war with one another in the United States. If that is the \nonly time that ever happened, there is no excuse for us to let it \nhappen again at this moment in our history.\n  To my friends on the Republican side of the aisle, do your job. Fill \nthis vacancy. Meet your constitutional responsibility.\n\n\n                  For-Profit Colleges and Universities\n\n  Mr. President, on Friday the Department of Education released its \nlatest proposals for new regulations on borrower relief when a school \nengages in unfair, deceptive, or abusive conduct. The proposals will be \ndebated this week at the third negotiated rulemaking session as part of \nthe formal rulemaking process.\n  I want to speak about one of the issues addressed in the latest \nproposal from the Department of Education--the use of mandatory \narbitration in enrollment contracts by institutions of higher \neducation. These clauses, which for-profit colleges and universities \noften bury in fine print, prevent students from bringing suit against a \nschool in court as an individual and often as part of a class action. \nIt means, for example, that if a student applying to a school is \ndeceived and misled by that school as to the degree they will receive \nor the job they will qualify for, they can't bring a legal action in \ncourt against the school. Instead, the student is forced into a secret \nproceeding where the deck is stacked against him. It allows schools to \navoid accountability for their misconduct and prevents misconduct from \ncoming to the attention of Federal regulators.\n  While nearly unheard of in not-for-profit institutions--think about \npublic universities and private, not-for-profit colleges--mandatory \narbitration has now become virtually standard in for-profit colleges \nand is used by all of the majors, such as the University of Phoenix, \nITT Tech, and DeVry University, just to name a few. It was also used by \nCorinthian. Corinthian, another for-profit college, made sure that if \ntheir students signed up for a contract with the school, they signed \nthis arbitration clause which eliminated the student's day in court.\n  I was pleased when the Department, in its latest proposal for current \nrulemaking, included an option for banning the use of mandatory \narbitration by all institutions receiving Federal title IV dollars. I \nthank the Department for including it in its proposal.\n\n  I also want to take a moment to discuss ITT Tech. ITT Tech is another \nfor-profit college that is under scrutiny by Federal and State \nregulators. Last year the Department of Education found that the \ncompany, ITT, failed to meet its fiduciary duty to the Department and \nfailed to meet the standards\n\n[[Page S1537]]\n\nof administrative capability required of institutions under title IV, \nand they placed restrictions on ITT. The Department then required ITT \nTech to pay nearly $80 million to be kept in escrow to guard against \nthe potential collapse of this for-profit school. The company is under \ninvestigation by 18 State attorneys general related to deceptive \nmarketing. This is deceptive marketing of college students who are \nbeing misled into signing expensive tuition contracts with this school.\n  The New Mexico attorney general found that ITT Tech placed students \ninto loans without the knowledge of the students, falsely stated the \nnumber of credits a student had to take in order to push them into more \ndebt, failed to issue refunds of tuition and fees in compliance with \nFederal law, and a variety of other deceptive practices. If that wasn't \nenough, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is also suing the \ncompany for predatory lending.\n  This is the exploitation of college students. This is piling up debt.\n  We have to frequently remind ourselves of the basics. Ten percent of \nthe students in college are in for-profit colleges and universities. \nAmong those are the University of Phoenix, DeVry, Kaplan, and ITT Tech. \nOut of that 10 percent, 40 percent of all student loan defaults are \nfrom students in the for-profit colleges and universities.\n  How is it that 10 percent of the students in for-profit schools \naccount for 40 percent of all student loan defaults?\n  First, the students go too deep in debt. These for-profit schools are \nway too expensive. Second, when the students can't keep up with the \ndebt they are accumulating, they drop out, and when they drop out, it \nis the worst of both worlds. They don't even have a diploma from the \nfor-profit school, and they still have a debt. Third, if they hang \naround long enough and finish and get a diploma from these for-profit \nschools, they find out many times they are worthless. Forty percent of \nthe loan defaults are from students who attended for-profit colleges \nand universities. These schools are coercing students into high-cost \nloans with interest rates as high as 16 percent and more, and they \nmisrepresent future job prospects to them.\n  Finally, the Securities and Exchange Commission is suing the company, \nITT, and two of its executives, Kevin Modany, its CEO, and Daniel \nFitzpatrick, its CFO, personally for concealing the poor performance of \nprivate institutional student loans from investors.\n  Behind all of this scrutiny by Federal and State regulators are \nstudents who have been harmed irreparably. According to a recent \nBrookings study, ITT Tech students cumulatively owe more than $4.6 \nbillion in Federal student loans.\n  How much is being paid back on this cumulative debt? According to the \nstudy, negative 1 percent of the balance has been repaid in 2014. What \ndoes it mean? How can it be a negative number? Simple--the interest on \nthis accumulative debt is occurring faster than it can be paid off by \nthe students. Individual students often have no chance of paying back \nthis personal debt when they have taken out a loan and end up with a \nworthless degree from ITT Tech.\n  What responsibility do we have as a government when it comes to these \nschools that are deceiving students, dragging them into debt, and then \nwatching as they default? We have a major responsibility. For-profit \ncolleges and universities are the most heavily subsidized private \nbusinesses in America today. We have all heard the term ``crony \ncapitalism.'' It couldn't apply more aptly to for-profit colleges and \nuniversities. Most of their revenues don't come from students and \nfamilies--only indirectly. Most of their revenue comes through the \nFederal Treasury in the form of government loans that end up in the \npockets of the owners of these for-profit colleges and universities.\n  More than half the students who left ITT in 2009 are in default on \ntheir student loans 5 years later--half.\n  One former student of ITT Tech is Marcus Willis from Illinois. He was \naggressively recruited by ITT Tech with multiple phone calls each day. \nHe finally signed up for classes. He graduated in 2003 from ITT Tech \nand spent months unable to find a job. When talking about his debt, \nMarcus said:\n\n       It's too much to even keep track of. I will never, ever be \n     able to pay it back.\n\n  He said that he ``wouldn't wish ITT Tech on his worst enemy.''\n  Despite all the lawsuits, the scandal, and students like Marcus, \nJanuary was a big month for ITT Tech executives Kevin Modany and Daniel \nFitzpatrick. They both got big bonus checks. Modany received $515,000 \nand Fitzpatrick received $112,000. They can expect more. In 2014, Mr. \nModany was paid more than $3 million. These are the same two who the \nSEC says violated numerous Federal securities laws in a fraudulent \nscheme to hide information from investors. But ITT Tech's board looks \nthe other way. Instead of penalizing or dismissing them, they give them \na bonus. ITT Tech investors have a right to be outraged.\n  Current and former ITT Tech students are also outraged. The Federal \ntaxpayers should be outraged too. You see, ITT Tech receives 80 percent \nof its revenue from Federal student aid funds. Nearly $1 billion a year \ncomes from the Federal Treasury, and even more than that when you count \nthe money they take in from VA, GI bills, and the Department of Defense \ntuition assistance funding.\n  Recently, I sent a letter to ITT Tech's accreditor, the Accrediting \nCouncil for Independent Colleges and Schools, asking them what steps \nthey were going to take to respond to this company's misconduct and \nshaky financial situation. They responded last week that they have \nrequired ITT Tech to submit teach-out plans to ensure that students can \ncontinue their education at other institutions should the company fail. \nIncidentally, the other institutions are probably going to be more for-\nprofit schools. So they transfer the kids from one failing for-profit \nto another questionable for-profit college.\n  They also told me that they will assess ITT Tech's financial \nstability, education quality, and program integrity when they get \ntogether in April.\n  I encourage the council which accredited Corinthian, which is now out \nof business, to make sure they take a hard look at ITT Tech. The \nwriting is on the wall. There are reports that the University of Akron \nmay be interested in buying this questionable college. I will be \nwatching this development carefully to ensure that any potential \ntransaction is in the best interest of students, their families, and \ntaxpayers.\n\n\n                Mental Health on Campus Improvement Act\n\n  Mr. President, mental health conditions affect one out of five \nAmerican adults. Yet this disease continues to be stigmatized, \nundertreated, and reduced to second-class status when it comes to \ncertain health care benefits. Just like any other physical health \ndisease, mental health conditions require a dedicated treatment plan \nand support for full recovery.\n  I still remember years ago, when Paul Wellstone, who used to sit \nright back there, and Pete Domenici, who sat over there, were in the \nSenate. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, was a Democrat, and Pete Domenici \nof New Mexico was a Republican--what an unlikely pair. They came \ntogether because each of them had family experiences with mental \nhealth. What they tried to do--and successfully did--was to include in \nall of our health insurance plans coverage for mental health counseling \nas well as substance abuse treatment. It became standard. When we \npassed ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, it was built into health \ninsurance policies. I have heard Members stand here and say: I am \ngetting rid of ObamaCare. We are going to vote against it and make that \ngo away. When they say that, we need to ask them: Will the coverage for \nmental health conditions go away too? How about the coverage for \nsubstance abuse treatment, will that coverage go away too?\n  This change made a big difference. It was a huge step in the right \ndirection to expand access to mental counseling. We have to further \neliminate barriers to treatment.\n  Last week, the Senate passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery \nAct, authorizing several important programs to help people deal with \nmental health and substance abuse issues. I supported it because it was \na step in the right direction. We know that approximately 44 million \nAmericans experience some sort of brain health or mental illness issue \nduring the year,\n\n[[Page S1538]]\n\nand millions don't receive treatment or support. This need for mental \nhealth services is especially dire with one group of Americans.\n  How often in your life experience have you noticed a young man or \nwoman go off to college and for the first time ever manifest some \nserious mental health issues? I have seen it with frequency, and I know \nthat many schools struggle with it.\n  Studies have shown that one-half of all chronic mental illness begins \nby age 14 and three-fourths by age 24. College students can face stress \nin new academic surroundings and new social environments. Many of them \nare away from home for the first time, and mental health concerns start \nto manifest. Despite this, colleges and universities have limited \nresources to deal with it. The ratio of counselors to students far \nexceeds recommended levels, preventing colleges and universities from \nidentifying the most at-risk students.\n  Right now, we are seeing a huge disparity between reported mental \nhealth needs and services being provided. In one nationwide study, 57 \npercent of students reported having felt overwhelming anxiety, 35 \npercent felt so depressed it was difficult to function, and 48 percent \nfelt hopeless. Now, I remember some bad nights and bad mornings when \nfacing a tough test, but we are talking about young people who have \ngone beyond that. They are facing some serious personal challenges.\n  Only 10 percent of enrolled students seek any kind of counseling. \nThis means that too many are slipping through the cracks and too many \nare not receiving treatment for mental illness. This can have tragic \nresults.\n  While millions of Americans suffer from serious mental illness, a \nvery small statistical group engages in violence against themselves or \nothers. We have examples of what happens when someone dealing with \nmental illness becomes violent. There was a horrific tragedy in 2008 on \nthe campus of Northern Illinois University in DeKalb. Six people died \nin a school shooting as a result of someone suffering from mental \nillness. Their families were changed forever, and so was the campus.\n  Not all mental health emergencies grab national headlines. Suicide is \nthe second leading cause of death among Americans aged 15 to 34. We \ncan't ignore the silent suffering of millions of Americans, including \nmany young people. That is why I have joined with Senator Susan \nCollins, a Republican of Maine, and Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat \nof Colorado, to introduce bipartisan legislation to improve mental \nhealth services on college campuses, expanding outreach and counseling \nand tackling the mental health illness stigma. I am happy to partner \nwith Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky of Illinois in introducing this \nlegislation.\n  Our bill, the Mental Health on Campus Improvement Act, will support \ncolleges and universities by giving them resources to better support \nthe mental health needs of their students. It establishes a grant \nprogram to provide direct mental health services and outreach. Our bill \nwill also increase awareness and treatment by promoting peer support \ntraining and engagement with campus groups. It launches a national \neducation campaign to reduce the stigma, encourage identification of \nrisk, and enhance the conversation about mental health and seeking \nhelp.\n  This bill is sponsored by the American Foundation for Suicide \nPrevention, the American Psychology Association, the National Alliance \non Mental Illness of Chicago, and the American College Health \nAssociation, among others.\n  This morning this legislation was adopted by a voice vote as an \namendment to the Cassidy-Murphy Mental Health Reform Act in the HELP \nCommittee.\n  I thank Senators Collins and Bennet for their efforts to advance the \nbill. I also thank Senators Cassidy, Murphy, Murray, and Alexander for \nworking with us to ensure this important provision was included in the \nlarger bill.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this bipartisan \nmeasure. I also know there is a lot of interest in addressing barriers \nto treatment in Medicaid, known as the IMD exclusion, which is under \nthe Finance Committee's jurisdiction. I will continue to push a bill \nthat I cosponsored with Senator King of Maine, the Medicaid Care Act, \nwhich expands access to treatment and coverage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/senate-section/article/S1538-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, nearly a year ago when Muhammadu Buhari \nbecame the first Nigerian to defeat a sitting President through the \nballot box, I greeted the news with cautious optimism. For the most \npart, his message was and remains one that encourages greater \ncooperation between the United States and Nigeria to defeat Boko Haram \nand chart a brighter course for Africa's most populous nation.\n  Recent attacks by Boko Haram have served as a sobering reminder of \nthe challenges Nigeria continues to face, and I have supported every \ninitiative by the Obama administration to counter this scourge. Through \nmy role as ranking member on the Department of State and Foreign \nOperations Appropriations Subcommittee, I have also supported hundreds \nof millions of dollars in foreign aid for Nigeria annually, \nparticularly for public health activities.\n  But words and money only go so far. While President Buhari has taken \npositive steps to combat corruption and his government has shown more \ninterest than his predecessor in addressing the development challenges \nin the north, reports of human rights abuses by the Nigerian military \ncontinue to undermine the government's reputation and effectiveness. \nUnfortunately, this is nothing new. And although President Buhari has \ntaken some initial steps to reform the military, far more needs to be \ndone when it comes to accountability for such crimes.\n  I want to highlight an incident which, although tragic, provides an \nimportant opportunity for President Buhari to begin to reverse the long \nhistory of impunity within Nigeria's security forces. According to \ncredible reports, on December 12, 2015, a convoy that was transporting \nNigeria's chief of army staff was unable to bypass a gathering \norchestrated by the Islamic Movement of Nigeria in Zaria, and the \nensuing clashes resulted in as many as 300 civilians killed and many \nothers detained. According to information I have received, many of the \nbodies were quickly buried by soldiers without the permission of family \nmembers, making it difficult to determine the death toll, but also \nmaking it hard for victims' families to know who had been killed and \nwho had been taken into custody. The Kaduna State government \nsubsequently established a judicial commission of inquiry to \ninvestigate the incident, a positive first step, and it is expected to \ncomplete its work sometime this month.\n  Serious questions, however, have been raised about the impartiality \nof the commission. While I understand that the inquiry is being \nconducted at the state level, it has national implications. The fact \nthat President Buhari has said little about this situation--noting only \nthat it is ``a military affair''--is worrisome given the potential for \nwide-ranging implications and the commitments he made during his \ninaugural speech to ensure discipline for ``human rights violators in \nthe armed forces.''\n  I hope the Buhari administration fully supports the Kaduna State \ngovernment judicial commission of inquiry and takes whatever steps are \nnecessary to ensure it fulfills its responsibilities. The risks are \ngreat if the commission is deemed not to have been impartial and \nthorough in its review and if the findings are not publicly released \nand acted on, as appropriate. At\n\n[[Page S1539]]\n\nthe very least, a significant opportunity will have been missed to \ndemonstrate that the Government of Nigeria values and defends the rule \nof law, is committed to transparency, and seeks to make real progress \non issues of justice and accountability.\n  While this is an issue that Nigeria must tackle, I stand ready to \nsupport any assistance the United States can provide to help President \nBuhari strengthen Nigerian institutions of justice and combat impunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/senate-section/article/S1539-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               50TH ANNIVERSARY OF CASEY FAMILY PROGRAMS\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the board of \ntrustees, president and CEO William Bell, and the team at Casey Family \nPrograms as this organization celebrates its 50th anniversary this \nmonth. Casey Family Programs is the Nation's largest operating \nfoundation focused on safely reducing the need for foster care and \nbuilding Communities of Hope for children and families across America. \nIts goal is to influence long-lasting improvements in the safety and \nsuccess of children, families, and the communities where they live. I \nam also proud to say that Casey Family Programs is based in Seattle, \nWA.\n  March 15 is Casey's founders day. It is a time for the leaders to \nreflect on the foundation's creator, history, and its mission.\n  Jim Casey, the founder of United Parcel Service, saw a critical need \n50 years ago to ensure that our Nation's most vulnerable children had \nsafe and stable families who would provide the opportunities and \nsupport needed to succeed in life. As the eldest child when his father \npassed away, Jim felt responsible for taking care of his mother and \nthree siblings at the young age of 14. From a fledgling bicycle \nmessenger service that he started in 1907, he steadily grew his company \ninto the world's largest delivery and logistics company United Parcel \nServices, UPS, in 1919.\n  Jim Casey said in 1947, ``. . . all of us, if we are to accomplish \nanything worthwhile, will do it largely through the help and \ncooperation of the people work with.'' This sentiment led Jim Casey to \nmake a generous donation to create several foundations, including \ncreation of Casey Family Programs in 1966 to provide direct services to \nchildren and families.\n  Over the next 50 years, Casey Family Programs has grown to work with \nall 50 States and with Native American tribes. Although the foundation \nstarted with a specific focus on providing quality foster care, after \nconsiderable experience in direct services, Casey Family Programs \nrecognized that it could have greater impact on families and children \nby working to support long-lasting improvements across entire child \nwelfare systems and jurisdictions. Today the foundation provides \nstrategic consultation, technical assistance, data analysis, and \nindependent research and evaluation at no cost to all 50 States, as \nwell as county and tribal child welfare jurisdictions across the \nNation.\n  From 2009 to 2015, Casey Family Programs will have invested $45 \nmillion in Washington. It has supported the work of the child welfare \nsystem, courts, tribes, policymakers, and other organizations to build \ncommunities of hope that safely reduce the need for foster care and \nsupport strong, lifelong families for all children. Washington State \nhas two Casey field offices serving children and families in Seattle \nand Yakima.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Finance, which has oversight \nover the Federal foster care funding programs, I value the education \nand research provided by Casey Family Programs. I was proud to support \nthe Child and Family Services and Improvement and Innovation Act of \n2011, which renewed the ability of up to 30 States to seek Federal \nwaivers to explore better ways to service children and families in the \nchild welfare system. Since passage of the law, Casey Family Programs \nhas partnered with interested States to provide information, support, \nand research on ways to support States that sought waivers.\n  Washington State is one of the waiver States, and the Port Gamble \nS'Klallam Tribe in Washington is the only tribe in our country with a \nFederal waiver. Casey Family Programs is offering support, data, and \nregular meetings to help the waiver States implement their waivers and \nto provide information on the progress of the waivers. This information \nwill be valuable in my oversight work on Federal child welfare policy.\n  Jim Casey had a vision to help children and families, and the \nleadership of Casey Family Programs today is following his mission with \na nationwide strategy to safely reduce the number of youth in foster \ncare and to invest to build communities of hope. I want to congratulate \nthe foundation for 50 years of service, and I look forward to learning \nfrom Casey's reports and leaders to promote further progress in \nWashington State and across the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/senate-section/article/S1539-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               100TH ANNIVERSARY OF ROTARY CLUB OF FRESNO\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the 100th Anniversary of the Rotary Club of Fresno, an \norganization dedicated to public service in Central California.\n  On March 1, 1916, Fresno Rotary became the ninth chartered Rotary in \nthe State of California. The Rotary's first philanthropic project--\nplanting 1,000 olive trees along the Golden State Highway--marked the \nstart of a century of public engagement and community service. Since \nthen, the spirit of Fresno Rotary has left an unforgettable mark on \nsome of the community's most iconic local landmarks and organizations, \nincluding the Old Fresno Water Tower, Storyland and Playland at Roeding \nPark, the Boys & Girls Club, the Salvation Army, and numerous schools \nand hospitals.\n  The mission of Fresno Rotary goes far beyond the San Joaquin Valley. \nOver the years, the club has delivered thousands of wheelchairs and \nwater treatment devices to those in need in developing countries and \nhelped provide medical service to more than 100,000 residents living in \na rural Mexican village.\n  A hundred years after its founding, the Rotary Club of Fresno remains \na testament to the vision, commitment, and contributions of generations \nof service-minded Fresno citizens who want to make a positive \ndifference in the world. I want to express my sincere gratitude to the \nmembers and friends of Fresno Rotary for their dedicated service, and I \nam pleased to join in honoring this special anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/senate-section/article/S1539-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1539-S1540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING JERRY ENOMOTO\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the life of Jerry Enomoto, a devoted husband and beloved \nfriend who passed away on January 17, 2016, at the age of 89.\n  Jerry Enomoto was born and raised in San Francisco. In 1942, Jerry \nand his family were forcibly relocated to the Tule Lake Incarceration \nCamp as part of Executive Order 9066, one of the darkest chapters in \nour Nation's history. Despite being uprooted from Lowell College \nPreparatory High School, Jerry continued his studies and graduated as \nthe valedictorian of his class while still held at Tule Lake. Upon \nrelease, he proudly served in the U.S. Army and subsequently earned \nbachelor's and master's degrees from the University of California, \nBerkeley.\n  Jerry dedicated his career to public service, serving as the first \nAsian Pacific American prison warden and the first Asian Pacific \nAmerican to lead the California Department of Corrections. In 1994, \nJerry broke racial barriers yet again by becoming the first Asian \nPacific American appointed as a United States marshal.\n  Outside of work, Jerry was active in several civil rights \norganizations, twice serving as the national president of the Japanese \nAmerican Citizens League, JACL. In 1992, JACL presented Jerry with \ntheir highest award, Japanese American of the Biennium, recognizing his \nyears of advocacy and leadership. Jerry and his wife, Dorothy, always \nspoke out against injustice, and in 1999, they co-founded an annual \ndinner to promote civil rights and diversity in response to a series of \nhate crimes in their Sacramento community. Now in its 17th year, their \nannual Martin Luther King, Jr., Celebration Dinner has become a \nhighlight on the calendar for those who are committed to making \nSacramento a more equal, inclusive, and diverse community.\n\n[[Page S1540]]\n\n  Jerry was a true civic leader who lived a life of service and \npatriotism despite the prejudice he experienced in his own childhood. \nHis immense contributions to the State of California will never be \nforgotten, and I send my deepest condolences to his wife, Dorothy, and \ntheir loved ones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/senate-section/article/S1540-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING SYLVIA McLAUGHLIN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the life of Sylvia McLaughlin, an ardent environmental \nactivist; a caring and involved community member; a loving wife; and a \nproud mother and grandmother who passed away on January 19, 2016.\n  Sylvia McLaughlin was born in Denver, CO, on December 24, 1916. \nInspired by the surrounding Rocky Mountains, Sylvia was drawn to nature \nfrom an early age and participated in many outdoor sports, including \nskiing and mountain climbing. After receiving a bachelor's degree in \nFrench from Vassar College in 1939, she married Donald McLaughlin, and \nthe couple settled in Berkeley, CA, where she became engaged in the \ngrowing environmental movement.\n  In response to the city of Berkeley's plan to build on 2,000 acres of \nthe Bay's shoreline, Sylvia co-founded the Save San Francisco Bay \nAssociation in 1961, mobilizing thousands of residents in opposition to \nthe Berkeley proposal. Their efforts succeeded, and Save the Bay \nsubsequently championed a 1965 State law designating the San Francisco \nBay as a State-protected resource and establishing the Nation's first \ncoastal-zone management agency, the San Francisco Bay Conservation and \nDevelopment Commission, BCDC. These efforts prevented further \nunregulated shoreline development, helped preserve the health of the \nremarkable bay estuary as vital habitat for local wildlife, increased \npublic access along the shoreline, and helped set the stage for later \nbay and wetland restoration projects that protect this precious \necosystem.\n  In addition to her pioneering work with Save the Bay, Sylvia remained \nan environmental activist throughout her life. She served as a board \nmember for organizations, including the National Audubon Society, \nCitizens for East Shore Parks, Save the Redwoods League, the Trust for \nPublic Lands, Greenbelt Alliance, and East Bay Conservation Corps.\n  For more than half a century, Sylvia worked tirelessly to preserve \nthe natural resources of the Bay Area and all those who enjoy the \nbeautiful shoreline of San Francisco Bay owe her an enormous debt of \ngratitude. I send my deepest condolences to her children Jeanie \nShaterian and George McLaughlin; her stepson, Donald McLaughlin, Jr.; \nand her many grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/senate-section/article/S1540-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/senate-section/article/S1540-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/senate-section/article/S1540-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1540-S1541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     REPORT RELATIVE TO THE ISSUANCE OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO TAKE \n  ADDITIONAL STEPS WITH RESPECT TO THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY ORIGINALLY \n  DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13466 OF JUNE 26, 2008 WITH RESPECT TO \n                           NORTH KOREA--PM 45\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 \nU.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued an \nExecutive Order (the ``order'') with respect to North Korea. The order \ntakes additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared \nin Executive Order 13466 of June 26, 2008, expanded in scope in \nExecutive Order 13551 of August 30, 2010, relied upon for additional \nsteps in Executive Order 13570 of April 18, 2011, and further expanded \nin scope in Executive Order 13687 of January 2, 2015. The order also \nfacilitates implementation of certain provisions of the North Korea \nSanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016 (Public Law 114-122), \nwhich I signed on February 18, 2016, and ensures the implementation of \ncertain provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution \n(UNSCR) 2270 of March 2, 2016.\n  In 2008, upon terminating the exercise of certain authorities under \nthe Trading With the Enemy Act (TWEA) with respect to North Korea, the \nPresident issued Executive Order 13466 and declared a national \nemergency pursuant to IEEPA to deal with the unusual and extraordinary \nthreat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States \nposed by the existence and risk of the proliferation of weapons-usable \nfissile material on the Korean Peninsula. Executive Order 13466 \ncontinued certain restrictions on North Korea and North Korean \nnationals that had been in place under TWEA.\n  In 2010, I issued Executive Order 13551. In that order, I determined \nthat the Government of North Korea's continued provocative actions \ndestabilized the Korean peninsula and imperiled U.S. Armed Forces, \nallies, and trading partners in the region and warranted the imposition \nof additional sanctions, and I expanded the national emergency declared \nin Executive Order 13466. In Executive Order 13551, I ordered blocked \nthe property and interests in property of three North Korean entities \nand one individual listed in the Annex to that order and provided \ncriteria under which the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \nwith the Secretary of State, may designate additional persons whose \nproperty and interests in property shall be blocked.\n  In 2011, I issued Executive Order 13570 to further address the \nnational emergency with respect to North Korea and to strengthen the \nimplementation of UNSCRs 1718 and 1874. That Executive Order prohibited \nthe direct or indirect importation of goods, services, and technology \nfrom North Korea.\n  In 2015, I issued Executive Order 13687, in which I determined that \nthe provocative, destabilizing, and repressive actions and policies of \nthe Government of North Korea constitute a continuing threat to the \nnational security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, \nand further expanded the national emergency declared in Executive Order \n13466. In Executive Order 13687 I provided additional criteria under \nwhich the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary \nof State, may designate additional persons whose property and interests \nin property shall be blocked.\n  I have now determined that the Government of North Korea's continuing \npursuit of its nuclear and missile programs, as evidenced most recently \nby its February 7, 2016, launch using ballistic missile technology and \nits January 6, 2016, nuclear test in violation of its obligations \npursuant to numerous UNSCRs and in contravention of its commitments \nunder the September 19, 2005, Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks, \nincreasingly imperils the United States and its allies. The order \naddresses those actions and takes additional steps with respect to the \nnational emergency declared in Executive Order 13466 of June 26, 2008. \nThe order also facilitates implementation of certain provisions of the \nNorth Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016 (Public Law \n114-122), which I signed on February 18, 2016, and ensures the \nimplementation of certain provisions of UNSCR 2270 of March 2, 2016.\n  The order is not targeted at the people of North Korea, but rather is \naimed at the Government of North Korea and its activities that threaten \nthe United States and others. It blocks the property and interests in \nproperty of the Government of North Korea and the Workers' Party of \nKorea and provides additional criteria for blocking the\n\n[[Page S1541]]\n\nproperty and interests in property of any person determined by the \nSecretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:\n    to operate in such industries in the North Korean economy \nas may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \nwith the Secretary of State, such as transportation, mining, energy, or \nfinancial services;\n    to have sold, supplied, transferred, or purchased, directly \nor indirectly, to or from North Korea or any person acting for or on \nbehalf of the Government of North Korea or the Workers' Party of Korea, \nmetal, graphite, coal, or software, where any revenue or goods received \nmay benefit the Government of North Korea or the Workers' Party of \nKorea, including North Korea's nuclear or ballistic missile programs;\n    to have engaged in, facilitated, or been responsible for an \nabuse or violation of human rights by the Government of North Korea or \nthe Workers' Party of Korea or any person acting for or on behalf of \neither such entity;\n    to have engaged in, facilitated, or been responsible for \nthe exportation of workers from North Korea, including exportation to \ngenerate revenue for the Government of North Korea or the Workers' \nParty of Korea;\n    to have engaged in significant activities undermining \ncybersecurity through the use of computer networks or systems against \ntargets outside of North Korea on behalf of the Government of North \nKorea or the Workers' Party of Korea;\n    to have engaged in, facilitated, or been responsible for \ncensorship by the Government of North Korea or the Workers' Party of \nKorea;\n    to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided \nfinancial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services \nto or in support of, any person whose property and interests in \nproperty are blocked pursuant to the order;\n    to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported \nto act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose \nproperty and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the order; \nor\n    to have attempted to engage in any of the activities \ndescribed above.\n  In addition, the order prohibits:\n    the exportation of goods, services, and technology to North \nKorea;\n    new investment in North Korea; and\n    the approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee of such \nexports and investments.\n  Finally, the order suspends entry into the United States of any alien \ndetermined to meet one or more of the above criteria.\n  I have delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury the authority, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, \nincluding the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all \npowers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry \nout the purposes of the order. All executive agencies are directed to \ntake all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the \nprovisions of the order.\n  I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.\n\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, March 15, 2016.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/senate-section/article/S1541-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2081.

A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Arizona urging the United States Congress to \n     enact legislation to repeal the health insurance tax; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                     House Concurrent Memorial 2001\n\n       Whereas, sections 9010 and 10905 of the Patient Protection \n     and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) and section 1406 of \n     the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 \n     (P.L. 111-152) impose an unprecedented new tax on health \n     insurance that numerous policy experts agree will be passed \n     on to individuals, working families, small employers and \n     seniors, contradicting a primary goal of health reform by \n     making care more expensive; and\n       Whereas, the health insurance tax will cause premiums on \n     the individual market to rise an average of $2,150 for \n     individuals and $5,080 for families nationally over a ten-\n     year period, will increase premiums in Arizona by an average \n     of $1,964 over ten years and will increase premiums for \n     families in Arizona over $3,958 over ten years; and\n       Whereas, the health insurance tax will impact small \n     employers over the next ten years by reducing future private \n     sector jobs by 125,000, with 59% of these reductions \n     affecting small businesses, and reducing potential sales by \n     at least $18 billion, with 50% affecting small businesses; \n     and\n       Whereas, the health insurance tax will increase premiums \n     for small employers in Arizona by an average of $2,674 per \n     employee over ten years and for large employers by an average \n     of $2,645 per employee over ten years; and\n       Whereas, the health insurance tax will impact Medicare \n     Advantage beneficiaries in Arizona by costing an average of \n     $3,303 more in premiums and reduced benefits over ten years; \n     and\n       Whereas, the health insurance tax will impact Medicaid \n     beneficiaries in Arizona who are enrolled in a coordinated \n     care program by costing an average of $1,337 over ten years, \n     putting pressure on already strained state budgets, \n     decreasing benefits and potentially creating coverage \n     disruption; and\n       Whereas, higher premiums are a disincentive for everyone to \n     obtain insurance coverage, particularly younger, healthier \n     people who are likely to drop their policy if it becomes too \n     expensive, which would further erode the risk pool and make \n     coverage even less affordable.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:\n       1.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Michigan memorializing the United States \n     Congress to appropriate funds from the Nuclear Waste Fund for \n     the establishment of a permanent repository for high-level \n     nuclear waste or reimburse electric utility customers who \n     paid into the fund; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 6\n\n       Whereas, The nuclear power industry needs a permanent \n     repository for high-level nuclear waste produced by reactors. \n     Nuclear power plays a vital role in meeting our nation's \n     current and future energy needs. However, the failure to \n     construct a permanent repository severely impedes efforts to \n     construct new power plants to provide clean and reliable base \n     load power; and\n       Whereas, Over the last 30 years, the nuclear power industry \n     and its customers have paid the federal government billions \n     of dollars to construct a permanent repository. Under the \n     Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the U.S. Congress \n     established the Nuclear Waste Fund to collect money for the \n     repository. Revenue to the fund came from mandatory fees \n     assessed on all nuclear energy. Since 1983, customers of \n     Michigan electric utilities alone have paid $812 million into \n     the fund for construction of the repository; and\n       Whereas, A permanent repository for high-level nuclear \n     waste has not been established and constructed. More than \n     2,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel from power plants \n     continue to accumulate at temporary and potentially \n     vulnerable sites across the nation,\n\n[[Page S1544]]\n\n     adding to the more than 70,000 metric tons already stored at \n     these sites; and\n       Whereas, The Nuclear Waste Fund contains a substantial \n     balance for establishment of the repository. While fee \n     collection was suspended on May 16, 2014, the fund still \n     contains a balance of over $31 billion for the express \n     purpose of supporting radioactive waste disposal activities. \n     It is imperative that Congress meet its obligation to the \n     nuclear power industry and U.S. citizens who paid into this \n     fund: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to appropriate funds from the Nuclear Waste Fund for \n     the establishment of a permanent repository for high-level \n     nuclear waste or reimburse electric utility customers who \n     paid into the fund; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-137. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Michigan urging the U.S. Department of Energy \n     and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to fulfill their \n     obligation to establish a permanent repository for high-level \n     nuclear waste; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 8\n\n       Whereas, Over the past four decades, nuclear power has been \n     a significant source for the nation's electricity production. \n     According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, \n     nuclear power provided about 20 percent of the electricity \n     produced in the United States in 2013, and Michigan's three \n     nuclear power plants provided 28 percent of the electricity \n     generated in Michigan; and\n       Whereas, Since the earliest days of nuclear power, the \n     great dilemma associated with this technology is how to deal \n     with used nuclear fuel. Currently, more than 70,000 metric \n     tons of spent nuclear fuel are stored in pools or casks at \n     temporary sites around the country, including Michigan. This \n     high-level radioactive waste demands exceptional care in all \n     facets of its storage and disposal, including transportation; \n     and\n       Whereas, More than 30 years ago, Congress enacted the \n     Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to address this issue. The \n     act requires the federal government, through the Department \n     of Energy, to build a repository for the permanent storage of \n     high-level radioactive waste from nuclear power plants and \n     begin accepting waste by January 31, 1998; and\n       Whereas, It is now 2015, and the nation still remains \n     without a permanent repository, despite billions of dollars \n     collected from electric ratepayers for the project. Spent \n     nuclear fuel continues to pile up at temporary sites around \n     the country, and the ongoing problem of permanent disposal is \n     a drag on the potential of the nuclear power industry to meet \n     our nation's energy needs. There is only so long that our \n     nation can continue to safely store this waste at temporary \n     sites; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That we urge the U.S. Department of Energy and \n     the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to fulfill their \n     obligation, as provided by law, to establish a permanent \n     repository for high-level nuclear waste; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Secretary of Energy, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and \n     the members of the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/senate-section/article/S1544-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. BARRASSO, from the Committee on Indian Affairs, with \n     an amendment in the nature of a substitute:\n       S. 818.

Mr. President, this resolution concerns a criminal \ncase pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania involving Congressman Chaka Fattah, Sr., and \nothers, including an individual named Herbert Vederman. The Department \nof Justice is seeking trial testimony from Senator Bob Casey about his \noffice's receipt of a letter of support from the Congressman regarding \nMr. Vederman's consideration for appointment to a high Federal office.\n  The government alleges that Congressman Fattah conspired with Mr. \nVederman to advocate for Mr. Vederman's appointment in return for Mr. \nVederman providing money and things of value to the Congressman.\n  The indictment does not allege that any action was taken in response \nto this advocacy, and Mr. Vederman did not receive a nomination for any \nFederal position. Senator Casey is being called as a witness only \nbecause of the fact of his office's receipt of this letter supporting \nMr. Vederman.\n  Senator Casey would like to cooperate with the government's request \nfor his appearance at trial. Accordingly, consistent with the rules of \nthe Senate and Senate practice, the enclosed resolution would authorize \nSenator Casey to testify and to produce documents at trial.

Mr. President, upon waking this morning, like a lot of \nother people did, I put on the news. About midway through the morning, \nabout 7 a.m., a bulletin came out that the President had selected a \nnominee for the Supreme Court. Newsworthy.\n  At about 7 a.m., the email came out that said: ``I've made my \ndecision.''\n  At 7:07 this morning, White House Legislative Affairs circulated a \nnotification to all those folks on Capitol Hill, including our office, \nfrom President Obama that stated this fact: ``We've reached out to \nevery member of the Senate, who each have a responsibility to do their \njob and take this nomination just as seriously.''\n  Well, this Senator thought that was very interesting because we \nhadn't received a notification.\n  At 7:14 a.m., 7 minutes later, the White House Legislative Affairs \nOffice emailed my chief of staff with an attachment of the 7:07 a.m. \nemail from the White House notifying that they had this. So when my \ncounsel called over to the White House Counsel and said: You stated \nearlier this morning that you contacted our offices--``you have reached \nout to us'' was the term--they clarified later in the morning: Well, \nthat email we sent after we said we contacted you was really the \ncontact that we meant to send earlier.\n  This was quite a morning for us. It is again the same doublespeak we \nreceived from the White House. When he said that they had reached out \nto all Members of the Senate, that actually means they had sent us an \nemail after they had sent the American people an email saying they had \nmade a decision. But even that email didn't say who it was.\n  Here is the challenge. It is a constitutional responsibility here, \nand it is extremely important that all of this is done right. It is \nextremely important that article I, the legislative branch, and that \narticle II, the White House, agree on a Supreme Court nominee because \narticle I and article II select article III judges to the Supreme \nCourt.\n  A month ago, the U.S. Senate--the Members of the majority party \nnotified the White House and the American people that we wanted to \nfollow the same\n\n[[Page S1550]]\n\nhistorical precedent that has been followed for decades, saying that in \nan election year, we would not appoint someone to the Supreme Court. \nThis is not a new policy; it is a policy that has been around for a \nvery long time. In fact, in 1968, when Democrats had the Senate and a \nDemocrat, LBJ, was in the White House, the Democrat, LBJ, wanted to be \nable to appoint a Supreme Court nominee, and Democrats in the Senate \nblocked someone from their own party from putting up a Supreme Court \nnominee because it was an election year, and they held it. It has \nhappened over and over again.\n  In fact, it has been interesting, because on this floor I heard \nnumerous folks step up and say: This is unprecedented. This is new. \nThis has never happened before.\n  The problem is that all of us know the history. It is the same \nhistory all of us look at.\n  The Washington Post this morning even put out a piece identifying \nthis basic issue. They occasionally do what has been called the \nPinocchio test, and this morning they identified multiple different \nDemocratic Senators who have spoken on this floor saying things such as \n``Republican Members met behind closed doors to unilaterally decide, \nwithout any input from this committee, that this committee and the \nSenate as a whole will refuse to consider any nominee. It's a \ndereliction of our constitutional duty.''\n  Another statement: ``The Senate shall advise and consent by voting on \nthat nominee. That is what the plain language of the Constitution \nrequires.''\n  Over and over again this has come up.\n  The Washington Post went back and researched and did an extensive \npiece detailing all the real history here of Supreme Court nominees, \nand they ended with this statement: ``[But] the Senate majority can in \neffect do what it wants'' to do, as it has historically, ``unless it \nbecomes politically uncomfortable. Democrats who suggest otherwise are \nsimply telling supporters a politically convenient fairy tale.''\n  The Washington Post gave the Democrats who made all these statements \nabout the Republicans doing something unprecedented in shutting down \nthis process a whopping three Pinocchios in their test in the \nWashington Post this morning.\n  This is not something new or radical; this is consistent. Quite \nfrankly, the Constitution--article II, Section 2--sets up a 50/50 \nproposition for the selection of Supreme Court Justices. The White \nHouse has the first 50 percent to make that nomination, and the Senate \nhas the second 50 percent in that we have what is called advice and \nconsent, and that is choosing the time and person in the process. Is \nthis the right time to do this nominee? Is this nominee the right \nperson? That is advice and consent.\n  It is not new for the White House and the Senate to disagree on this. \nGeorge Washington couldn't even get some of his nominees through the \nvery first Senate, and he personally came over to the Senate, bringing \nhis nominee, and said: I want my nominee to have a hearing. And the \nvery first Senate, with the very first President--the very first Senate \nsent George Washington away and said: We are not going to hear it \ntoday. It is the wrong time and maybe the wrong person. We haven't \ndecided yet.\n  This is an ongoing process. This Senate has determined, as it has \nmany times, that an election year is the wrong time to have a departing \nPresident choose a Supreme Court nominee.\n  As many folks have said over and over again, this is not only old \nhistory in the United States, it is recent history. At that time, \nSenator Biden, who was the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said on \nthis floor in 1992:\n\n       The Senate, too, Mr. President, must consider how it would \n     respond to a Supreme Court vacancy that would occur in the \n     full throes of an election year. It is my view that if the \n     President goes the way of Presidents Fillmore and Johnson--\n\n  Referring to LBJ--\n\n     and presses an election year nomination, the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee should seriously consider not scheduling \n     confirmation hearings on the nomination until after the \n     political campaign season is over.\n       It would be our pragmatic conclusion that once the \n     political season is underway, and it is, action on a Supreme \n     Court nomination must be put off until after the election \n     campaign is over. That is what is fair to the nominee and is \n     central to the process. Otherwise, it seems to me, Mr. \n     President, we will be in deep trouble as an institution.\n       Others may fret that this approach would leave the Court \n     with only eight members for some time, but as I see it, Mr. \n     President, the cost of such a result, the need to reargue \n     three or four cases that will divide the Justices four to \n     four, are quite minor compared to the cost that a nominee, \n     the President, the Senate, and the Nation would have to pay \n     for what would assuredly be a bitter fight, no matter how \n     good a person is nominated by the President, if that \n     nomination were to take place in the next several weeks.\n\n  Even Senator Reid in 2005 said:\n\n       The duties of the Senate are set forth in the U.S. \n     Constitution. Nowhere in that document does it say the Senate \n     has a duty to give Presidential appointees a vote.\n\n  This is not new; it has just become politically expedient to bring \nthis up. It is not even new in the media. It was interesting to be able \nto see a comment in the New York Times from 1987 when the New York \nTimes wrote an editorial about what happens if a President in his final \nterm wants to be able to appoint a nominee with a Senate majority from \nthe other party. Well, at that time in the previous election, the White \nHouse had a President who was a Republican, Ronald Reagan, and the \nSenate had changed over to the Democrats in the previous election. The \nNew York Times wrote this about a Supreme Court selection process:\n\n       The President's supporters insisted vehemently that having \n     won the 1984 election, he has every right to change the \n     Court's direction. Yes, but the Democrats won the 1986 \n     election regaining control of the Senate, and they have every \n     right to resist.\n\n  That was true then for the New York Times, that is true now, and we \nwill see if they stay consistent as a newspaper standing from the exact \nsame principle decades later--not new, not different.\n  The fact is, the Supreme Court is still working, still hearing cases, \nstill going through the arguments, and still releasing opinions. \nNothing has changed over there. The work is still continuing in the \nU.S. Senate. We are still hearing legislation. We are voting on \nlegislation. We voted on a confirmation this week to the Department of \nEducation. We are still working through nominations. We are still \nworking through legislation. Nothing has changed on that. The decision \nwas made that this Senate will not move during this election year.\n  It is interesting. I had a telephone townhall this Monday with \nindividuals across my State, with thousands of people on the line. We \nasked a simple question about what should happen in this process \ndealing with the Supreme Court--this is before a nominee was even \nannounced--and 71 percent of the people on our calls said the next \nPresident and the American people should choose who the next Supreme \nCourt Justice will be.\n  I will submit that we should allow the people to decide this, that \nwhen they decide the Presidential election this November, they are also \ndetermining the direction of the Supreme Court in the days ahead.\n  I don't want us to lose track of the basic facts here, but I also \nwant us to stay focused. This Senate cannot get distracted with bitter \nfighting over something that we resolved a month ago and that will \nremain resolved. We are not going to move.\n  We have a lot of budget issues to deal with. We have appropriations \nbills that will come up in the days ahead. I would submit that one of \nthe biggest things we can do in the Senate is to also reform the budget \nprocess, to stay focused on things that are really going to matter long \nterm for us, because this issue with the Supreme Court is already \nresolved. We need to find ways to be able to eliminate the budget \ngimmicks that are in the budget process to get a long-term view, to \nmake sure there is not this playing with the system in this 10-year \nwindow, and to deal with biennial budgeting to get a better prediction \nof where we are going in the days ahead. We need to find a way to stop \ngovernment shutdowns and the constant threats of government shutdowns \nbecause they do nothing but hurt us. These are things we can work on \nand work on together to keep us on focus.\n  The Supreme Court issue is settled. It is not going to move. Let's \nfind the things that we can agree on, that we can work on, and continue \nto work on those things together.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S1551]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/senate-section/article/S1551-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
