Mr. President, it is clear that the American people \nare concerned about the administration's ability to properly vet \nthousands of individuals from Syria. More than half of our Nation's \nGovernors, Governors of both parties, have demonstrated their concern. \nMany Members in Congress, Members of both parties, have raised concerns \nas well.\n  Given all this and given all that has happened in Paris, it simply \nmakes sense to take a step back for now, to press the pause button so \nwe can determine the facts and ensure we have the correct policies and \nsecurity screenings in place. That is the most responsible thing for \nthe administration to do right now. That is the most reasonable and \nbalanced thing for the administration to do right now.\n  We should also not lose sight of why we are in this position to begin \nwith. The Syrian people are fleeing Syria because of a brutal civil \nwar. The ultimate solution to this problem is to make Syria a place the \nSyrian people can continue to return to, but the administration has \nnever had a coherent strategy to settle this conflict. Every single one \nof us knows that ISIL presents a threat to our homeland, and it is not \ncontained. So if the administration is serious about starting to turn \nthis situation around, then it is going to have to develop a serious \nand workable strategy that can swing and win strong bipartisan support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8113-7", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8113-S8114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GUANTANAMO BAY DETENTION FACILITY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, years ago, then-candidate Obama made a \ncampaign promise that has not withstood the measure of time or the \nrealities brought by terrorism. He said he wanted to close the secure \ndetention facility at Guantanamo Bay. Ever since, he has pursued \npolicies that willfully avoided the targeting chain of capture, \ninterrogate, build intelligence, and target. It turns out that the \nreality of closing the secure detention facility is a lot harder than \nmaking promises on the campaign trail. It is an incredibly complex \nissue with grave national security concerns for the citizens of our \ncountry and for our allies.\n  The fact that the President has never been able to present any kind \nof serious plan to Congress seems to say quite a lot. We hear he is \nworking on one now. We will, of course, give consideration to what the \nPresident says. We\n\n[[Page S8114]]\n\nwill, of course, keep an open mind. It doesn't mean Congress is going \nto agree with him. It is going to be a very tough sell because it is \nhard to understand why indefinite detention for terrorists on U.S. soil \nis preferable to detaining terrorists who cannot be released in \nGuantanamo. This is especially true when one considers the fact that \nbringing terrorists here presents serious risks that simply do not \nexist if we keep the terrorists in the secure facility down there in \nGuantanamo Bay.\n  This much is crystal clear though: If the President wants to be able \nto import Guantanamo terrorists into Americans' backyards, he is going \nto have to persuade a majority in Congress to change the law. The law \nprevents that.\n  Just last week, big bipartisan majorities in Congress voted twice to \nunderscore the point. We overwhelmingly passed a defense authorization \nbill with a clear bipartisan prohibition on the President moving \nGuantanamo terrorists into our country. We overwhelmingly passed a \nveterans funding bill with a clear bipartisan prohibition on the \nPresident improving military facilities for the detention of Guantanamo \nterrorists in our country.\n  The Senate has voted many times in recent years to enact these \nbipartisan protections. We enacted them in Congresses with split party \ncontrol. We enacted them in Congresses with massive Democratic \nmajorities. The President signed them all into law. So if the President \nwants to bring Guantanamo terrorists into the United States, he has to \nchange the law. That is the opinion of the President's own Attorney \nGeneral. She was asked directly this week if the President should \nignore legislation passed by Congress that prohibits him from \ntransferring Guantanamo detainees to American soil. This is what \nAttorney General Loretta Lynch said: ``The law currently does not allow \nfor that.'' Let me repeat that. ``The law currently does not allow for \nthat.'' That is Attorney General Lynch of this administration. That is \nwhat the Nation's chief law enforcement officer, a woman appointed by \nPresident Obama himself, had to say on his ability to import Guantanamo \nterrorists into our country.\n  This isn't exactly a revelation to anybody. The fact that the \nPresident is now contemplating flouting the law in pursuit of a \ncampaign promise from years ago means that it is apparently necessary \nfor his own Attorney General to remind everybody that the law is the \nlaw, even for President Obama.\n  There are a multitude of other reasons not to bring these individuals \ninto our country. I plan to continue reminding my colleagues of them \nhere on the floor from time to time.\n  If the President ever presents some kind of plan we can actually \ndebate, I am sure there will be several different views on it. I am \nsure we will each have a lot to say. I am sure the President will make \nhis pitch to convince Congress that moving terrorists into American \ncommunities is a good idea. As I said, it will be a hard sell. But the \nPresident should make his case if he feels passionately about it. For \nnow, though, we should at least be able to agree with what one of our \nDemocratic colleagues recently said of the President: ``He is going to \nhave to comply with the legal restrictions.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8114-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 3762\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, we all know that the Federal Government has \nmany obligations, but chief among them is to protect the American \npeople from harm. That responsibility is now at the forefront of talk \nhere in our Nation's Capital, and rightfully so. ISIS continues to \nspread its campaign of terror across the entire world.\n  The United States is committed to combating terrorism. Our government \nwill do all that is possible to protect the people of this Nation. In \nthis fight against evil ISIS, it is absolutely critical that we as \nAmericans do not lose sight of our Nation's core principles. Those \nprinciples are eloquently etched into the base of the Statue of \nLiberty.\n  I can remember taking my family there for the first time. I didn't \nhave all my children yet--we had more that had to be born--but my older \nchildren still remember that. I remember it.\n  Here is what it says:\n\n       Give me your tired, your poor,\n       Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\n       The retched refuse of your teaming shore.\n       Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me.\n\n  That, of course, is directed to the United States. All across Europe \nand the Middle East, there are huddled masses of Syrian families \ndesperate to find refuge someplace from Syria's civil war and the ISIS \nreign of terror. Millions of Syrians fled their country. About 300,000 \nof them have been killed since the civil war started--300,000. They \nfled to neighboring nations such as Turkey, Lebanon, and tiny little \nJordan.\n  But the crisis in Syria continues to worsen and people are forced to \nseek refuge. What else can they do? On a daily basis, Europe's borders \nare being flooded by people in search of safety and a better life--\nmothers cradling infants and fathers carrying children in their arms. \nThe nations of Europe have helped. Greece, Germany, and others have \naccommodated the enormous influx of people as safely as possible.\n  They are overwhelmed. The United States must do its part. We have a \nrigorous screening process for when we accept these refugees. The \nrefugees we are accepting are women and children and old and older men \nwith families. Only 2 percent of the refugees are men of military age--\n2 percent. We accepted a little under 2,000 last year. Two percent of \nthose were of military age.\n  The United States has a long and proud history of providing refuge to \nthe world's most vulnerable. That history includes my father-in-law, \nIsrael Goldfarb. He and his family came from Russia. They were refugees \nescaping the programs of a czar. I have been disgusted in recent days \nto see some of my Republican colleagues shun the American tradition of \ndisplaying compassion for those in need, of sheltering those fleeing \ntorture, rape and oppression. Frankly, I have been disappointed by \nRepublican fear-mongering and bigotry.\n  Apparently they have learned nothing from history. We cannot repeat \nthe dark days of the 1930s when many Americans resolved to turn away \nhelpless refugees fleeing Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler or imprisoned \ninnocent Japanese Americans during World War II, like our late \ncolleague Dan Inouye and his family.\n  Those mistakes were based on misguided fears of people we did not \nknow. How many people died because of unfounded apprehension? I don't \nknow but far too many. Yet it seems many Republicans are destined to go \ndown that same path again. Some in the Republican Party have suggested \nthat we categorically block all Syrian refugees. One Republican \ncandidate for President suggested we turn away even 5-year-old refugee \nchildren. Two other Republican candidates for President implied that \nthe United States of America should have some sort of religious test \nfor refugees. They are saying only Christians.\n\n[[Page S8115]]\n\nThis is the latest in what has become a disturbing pattern of \nRepublican hatred and intolerance toward Muslims. Remember, Syria is \nmostly Muslim, but there are Jews, there are Christians--lots of them. \nDuring the course of the current Presidential cycle, we have heard from \nthe leading lights of the Republican Party the following: that we are \nat war with Islam, that we should be shutting down Muslim houses of \nworship in America, close the mosques, that we should ban Muslims from \ngovernment service. We have two of my friends who serve in the House of \nRepresentatives who are Muslim. They are proud. That religion has made \nthem better people.\n  Now they are even suggesting that we should reject refugees fleeing \npersecution on the grounds that they are Muslim. That is not America. \nThat is hate emanating from some Republicans. That anti-Muslim venom \nfrom Republicans is a propaganda bonanza for ISIS. Christian groups \nhave responded to those Republican attacks. We have heard what the Pope \nsaid: to kill in the name of religion is blasphemous.\n  World Relief, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Lutheran \nImmigration and Refugee Service are all dismayed at the anti-refugee \nfervor pushed forward by Republicans and are urging supporters to \ncontact elected officials on behalf of these victims of the Syrian \nconflict.\n  We must pause and think about what they have been through--poison \ngas, cluster bombs. Let's think about who these refugees are. They are \nnot our enemies. They are expelled from their homeland by the same evil \nrulers we are fighting. All they want is to find safety, to restart \ntheir lives. These people have been persecuted--that is an \nunderstatement--by President Assad and ISIS. The Syrian regime, I \nrepeat, has barrel-bombed their own citizens, has unleashed chemical \nweapons against their own citizens, rapes, justifying the rapes of \nthese hundreds and hundreds of women in the name of their religion--\nmurdering women and children. Those refugees hate Assad. They hate \nISIS. That is why they are trying to get out of that horrible situation \nthey find themselves.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has verified that not one of \n1,800 refugees already admitted in the United States has a single \nconfirmed tie to terrorism--not one. To deny our moral obligation to \nthese struggling people would be to abandon the principles of this \ngreat country. That is how France feels about it also. On the heels of \nlast week's appalling attacks, the President of France is refusing to \nneglect France's duty to humanity. Here is what this good man said \nyesterday:\n\n       30,000 refugees will be welcomed over the next two years. \n     Our country has the duty to respect this commitment.\n\n  After what they have been through, this is what the President of \nFrance said: Accepting Syrian refugees is the moral thing to do and it \nis sound policy. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice agrees that \nthe United States must open its arms to those fleeing persecution. Here \nis what she said:\n\n       What the United States has done is to be open to people who \n     are fleeing tyranny, who are fleeing danger, but we have done \n     it in a very careful way.\n\n  Secretary Madeleine Albright authored an op-ed this week for Time \nmagazine. Now, remember, she herself was a refugee. That is how she \ncame to this country during World War II. She said Americans must \nrespond with compassion if we are going to defeat ISIS. We can do all \nwe want with refugees. This is no way to win the war, attacking the \nrefugees. Here is what she said, Madeleine Albright:\n\n       Our enemies have a plan. They want to divide the world \n     between Muslims and non-Muslims, and between the defenders \n     and attackers of Islam. By making Syrian refugees the enemy, \n     we are playing into their hands. Instead, we need to clarify \n     that the real choice is between those who think it is okay to \n     murder innocent people and those who think it is wrong. By \n     showing that we value every human life, we can make clear to \n     the world where we stand.\n\n  What Secretary Albright said and what Secretary Rice said is \nabsolutely right. We process Syrian refugees in a very careful way. It \nhas worked. We are not the nations of Europe. Has anyone stopped for a \nminute and thought that we have an ocean between us and them, an ocean, \nthe Atlantic Ocean.\n  The U.S. refugee screening takes place well before any individual \ncomes to our borders. To enter the U.S. refugee program as an \napplicant, the U.N. Refugee Agency must first select and refer all \npotential refugees to our program. We accept refugees solely on a \nreferral basis from the United Nation's agency. We do not go out and \nsolicit any of these people. After being referred, all refugees, \nincluding those from Syria, are subjected to extremely rigorous \nscreening and security checks. This is not some easy procedure where \nrefugees fly right through the application process and are sent here in \na matter of days. No. It takes an average of 18 to 24 months for a \nrefugee to make it through the process to come to the United States.\n  Remember, the vast majority of these people are checked and \nrechecked, taking 24 months; they are women and children and old men. I \nrepeat. It takes 18 to 24 months for a refugee to make it through the \nprocess of coming to the United States. That is why only 1,800 refugees \nhave been admitted since the start of the conflict out of the millions \nwho are fleeing Syria. Our government accepts only the most vulnerable \nof the Syrians, survivors of violence and torture, those with severe \nmedical conditions, women and children, but security precautions are \nnot taking a backseat in the process. These Syrian refugees are real \npeople. Images of their plight should be so visually apparent in our \nminds. Think of that little boy whom we saw and everyone saw around the \nworld, a picture of this little dead boy washed up on a beach, a \ndrowned Syrian boy whose body was washed up on this Turkish beach, \npictures on the front page of newspapers, all the TV programs for \nseveral days.\n  At that time, Democrats and Republicans together responded with calls \nfor compassion and action. I urge Republicans to remember that little \nboy. We must help where we can. That is who we are. We are America. We \ncome to the defense of the defenseless. We come to the aid of those in \nneed. Right now we are needed. We are a nation--a nation of freedom. We \nshould not forsake our duty and obligation to these struggling people.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 2302 and the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration; I further ask that the \nbill be read a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider \nbe considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, moments ago I asked this body to take up and \npass two commonsense pieces of legislation in response to the terrorist \nattack in Paris. The first, the Expatriate Terrorist Act, is \nlegislation I introduced over a year ago--attempted to pass over a year \nago--and that the Democratic Party blocked. That legislation provides \nthat any American citizen who goes and joins ISIS, who takes up arms \nagainst America and attempts to wage jihad, by doing so, forfeits his \nor her U.S. citizenship. Existing Federal law provides for grounds of \nrevocation of citizenship, and this piece of legislation would add \njoining terrorist groups such as ISIS to those grounds.\n  Unfortunately, the Democratic Party has just objected to passing that \ncommonsense legislation. As a consequence, and because of that \nobjection, it means that Americans--and the estimates are it could be \nup to or over 100 Americans--who have gone and joined ISIS right now \nare waging jihad against America. As a consequence of that objection, \nit means those ISIS terrorists can come back to America using a U.S. \npassport and wage jihad against this country--attempt to murder \ninnocent men and women in this country using a U.S. passport. That is, \nI believe, a profound mistake.\n  The second piece of legislation I just asked this body to pass and \nthe Democrats just objected to is legislation that would stop President \nObama and Hillary Clinton's plan to bring in tens of thousands of \nSyrian Muslim refugees to the United States in light of the declaration \nof war from ISIS, in light of the horrific terrorist attack and in \nlight of the admissions from the Director of the FBI, Director Comey--\nwho I might note President Obama appointed--who said the administration \ncannot vet these refugees to determine whether or not they are ISIS \nterrorists. Indeed, he said since they do not have the data on which of \nthe Syrian refugees are involved with ISIS terrorism, they can query \nthe database, but with no information in the database, he said they can \nquery over and over again until the cows come home, but they do not \nhave the information.\n  Unfortunately, the Democratic Party, the Democratic Senators in this \nbody have chosen to stand with President Obama and his absurd political \ncorrectness, his unwillingness even to utter the words ``radical \nIslamic terrorism.'' The President refuses to say the words ``radical \nIslamic terrorism.'' Hillary Clinton refuses to say the words ``radical \nIslamic terrorism.'' Not only do they refuse to say the words, but they \nare supporting a policy of bringing tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim \nrefugees into this country knowing full well we cannot vet them to \ndetermine who is coming here to wage jihad. That is a profound threat \nto this country, and I hope we will stand as one. This ought to be an \narea of bipartisan agreement.\n  I would note that the legislation I introduced includes an exception \nfor persecuted minorities facing genocide--Christians, Yazidis, small \nminorities facing genocide. In response to my acknowledging genocide as \na different circumstance, President Obama, 2 days ago in Turkey, \nattacked me directly. He said it was un-American to want to protect \nthis country from terrorists and to want to help persecuted Christians. \nThen yesterday, President Obama attacked me again from Manila, saying \nit was offensive that I, and so many millions of other Americans, want \nto keep our children safe.\n  Mr. President, it is neither un-American nor offensive to believe in \nthe rule of law, to believe in standing up to radical Islamic \nterrorism. And it is an astonishing statement that so many Democratic \nSenators choose to stand with a President who will not confront radical \nIslamic terrorism.\n  Indeed, just this week Secretary Kerry rationalized the terrorist \nattack on Charlie Hebdo saying it was understandable why they attacked \nCharlie Hebdo. We should not be acting as apologists for radical \nIslamic terrorists. The very first obligation of the Commander in Chief \nis to keep this Nation safe. And I will say that any official \nresponsible for bringing people in when they do not know if they are \nradical Islamic terrorists will bear responsibility for the \nconsequences of their actions.\n  ISIS has been plain. They intend to murder as many Americans as \npossible and they intend to carry out terror attacks here, such as that \nwhich happened in Paris. This commonsense legislation would have helped \nprotect this Nation, but I am sorry to say the Democratic Party is \nobjecting to it.\n  I believe we should put America first, protecting America first. \nUnfortunately, my friends on the other side of the aisle are blocking \nthat effort.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand there is a limited amount of \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining on the \nDemocratic side.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am worried in this country that we hear rhetoric \nthat is dangerous, and it is time to stop. It shames the very nature of \nwhat America is. These are ideas that are wrong, and I would say they \nare deeply anti-American.\n  My grandparents--my Italian grandparents, my Irish great-great-\ngrandparents--heard some of this rhetoric when some in this country \nsaid they shouldn't come here: Don't allow these Papists into the \nUnited States; don't allow these Irish, who are opposed to the rule of \nGreat Britain on their island, and they actually stood up and fought \nagainst Great Britain.\n  The words back then, like some of the words today, come from a place \nof fear and hatred. I do not want to stand by quietly and see the \nvictims of terrorism and torture be demonized just so people will have \ntalking points for the local evening news. We are better than this.\n  The bill my colleague, the junior Senator the from Texas, introduced \nan hour ago would prevent refugee protection for virtually all \nnationals of Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen, regardless of how \nmuch they have suffered at the hands of terrorists and despots. Women \nfleeing gang rapes and children fleeing horrors we cannot even imagine \nwould be closed off.\n  A few weeks ago the world came together, stunned and heartbroken over \nthe image of a 3-year-old Syrian child's lifeless body washed up on a \nTurkish beach. His tragic death focused our attention on the desperate \nplight of so many Syrians who have fled the horror of ISIS and Bashar \nal-Assad.\n  We called it the humanitarian issue of the day. We called forth \nimages of our Statue of Liberty and our proud history as a land of \nrefuge for those fleeing persecution. I heard so many on this floor as \nwell as from commentators in the news. Those who call now for us to \nslam our doors on even properly vetted Syrian and other refugees should \nremember that the people we will shut out are those very children who \ntouched our hearts just weeks ago.\n  Of course, we are horrified by what happened in Beirut and Paris, and \nwe need an effective, thoughtful strategy for countering ISIS and other \nterrorist organizations. That is what we should be debating. What we \nhave done so far is not working, and we should be talking about how \nmore countries should be involved in this fight. ISIS is our enemy; the \npeople fleeing ISIS are not.\n  In fact, we have had discussions about other things that could be \ndone. Somebody who is on a terrorist watch list but who is in this \ncountry legally can go to a gun show and buy all the automatic weapons \nthey want, and they break no law. They can buy all the ammunition they \nwant, and they\n\n[[Page S8117]]\n\nbreak no law. They can go to the store, as did one of the greatest \nterrorists this country faced--the man who did the Oklahoma city \nbombing--and buy the components of a bomb, and they break no law. These \nare the things we ought to be discussing.\n  I do not understand why Senator Cruz is on the Senate floor seeking \nunanimous consent to pass this bill. This very bill is on the Judiciary \nCommittee agenda, and the committee is currently considering it and \nneeded improvements to it.\n  When the Senate Judiciary Committee debates this bill, we will have a \nlot to discuss. This legislation affects constitutional rights, and \nshould be carefully vetted by the judiciary committee. Serious \nconstitutional concerns have been raised by voices from across the \npolitical spectrum--from the National Review to the ACLU.\n  Just yesterday I received a letter from former NRA president David \nKeene and Georgetown Law professor David Cole, in their roles with The \nConstitution Project. They urge opposition to this bill because it \n``serves virtually no practical purpose, raises serious constitutional \nconcerns, and would do nothing to keep America safe.'' These are strong \nwords, and I take these concerns seriously. Rushing a bill to the floor \nwhen that very bill is already scheduled for consideration by the \ncommittee of jurisdiction is not a responsible approach to legislating. \nAnd when legislation involves something as fundamental as citizenship, \nwe should give the judiciary committee an opportunity to consider and \ndebate this bill before it is brought to the Senate floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nseveral articles relating to the topic at hand.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     The Constitution Project,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 18, 2015.\n     Hon. Chuck Grassley,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Hart Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Russell Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Leahy, and Judiciary \n     Committee Members: On January 22, 2015, Senator Ted Cruz (R-\n     TX) introduced S. 247, the Expatriate Terrorists Act (ETA). \n     Representative Steve King (R-IA) simultaneously introduced \n     companion legislation in the House. According to the bill's \n     sponsors, the ETA is a common sense counterterrorism tool \n     that would strip U.S. citizenship from Americans who fight \n     with or support foreign terrorist organizations working to \n     attack the United States. The ETA would also purportedly \n     ``fill . . . statutory holes'' in the Secretary of State's \n     ``authority to revoke a terrorist's passport.''\n       In fact, the ETA serves virtually no practical purpose, \n     raises serious constitutional concerns, and would do nothing \n     to keep America safe. We urge you to oppose it.\n       Like previous iterations of the same idea, the ETA would \n     amend 8 U.S.C. 1481(a), which sets out limited circumstances \n     under which U.S. citizens can be denaturalized or \n     expatriated. The bill would add the following to the short \n     list of predicate acts that can result in loss of \n     citizenship: 1) taking an oath of allegiance to a foreign \n     terrorist organization; 2) joining a foreign terrorist \n     organization's armed forces while they are fighting the \n     United States; and 3) ``becoming a member of, or providing \n     training or material assistance to,'' a foreign terrorist \n     organization.\n       The ETA also amends the Passport Act of 1926 to require the \n     Secretary of State to deny a passport to, or revoke one from, \n     anyone who the Secretary has determined is a member, or is \n     attempting to become a member, of a foreign terrorist \n     organization.\n       Senator Cruz has said repeatedly that the ETA works a \n     ``formal'' or ``affirmative'' renunciation of U.S. \n     citizenship. To the extent he means to suggest that, under \n     the bill, a person would automatically lose citizenship \n     simply by engaging in the above conduct, he is wrong. The ETA \n     does not and could not achieve that result.\n       Citizenship is a constitutional right, and the Constitution \n     prohibits the government from revoking a person's citizenship \n     against his will under any circumstances. As the Supreme \n     Court has explained, ``the intent of the Fourteenth \n     Amendment, among other things, was to define citizenship . . \n     . [and] that definition cannot coexist with a congressional \n     power to specify acts that work a renunciation of citizenship \n     even absent an intent to renounce. In the last analysis, \n     expatriation depends on the will of the citizen rather than \n     on the will of Congress and its assessment of his conduct.'' \n     As a constitutional right, citizenship can be knowingly and \n     voluntarily waived, but it cannot be taken away from an \n     individual absent such a waiver. Thus, to revoke a person's \n     citizenship the government must prove not only that he \n     committed an expatriating act prescribed in section 1481(a), \n     but also that he did so voluntarily and with the specific \n     intent to relinquish his citizenship.\n       Given these requirements, the ETA will almost certainly \n     result in no additional expatriations. Unless Senator Cruz \n     expects citizens subject to expatriation proceedings freely \n     to admit that they joined or supported a foreign terrorist \n     group specifically intending to renounce their U.S. \n     citizenship, no one will in fact be expatriated. We doubt \n     that government officials would believe it an efficient use \n     of resources to try, especially given the broad reach of \n     existing laws that already provide harsh penalties for U.S. \n     citizens who engage in acts of terrorism.\n       The bill's passport revocation provisions are similarly \n     unnecessary. There is no ``statutory hole'' to fill--the \n     Secretary of State already has the authority to deny a \n     passport to anyone whose ``activities abroad are causing or \n     are likely to cause serious damage to the national security \n     or the foreign policy of the United States,'' and to revoke a \n     passport on the same grounds.\n       Not only is the bill practically useless, it also raises \n     serious constitutional concerns. The ETA makes membership in \n     or ``providing training or material assistance to'' certain \n     foreign terrorist organizations a predicate act to \n     expatriation. There are two constitutional problems with this \n     provision. First, neither ``training'' nor ``material \n     assistance'' is defined. Similar language in 18 U.S.C. 2339B \n     was ruled unconstitutionally vague until Congress added \n     specific definitions. Because Congress has not done so here, \n     this provision of the ETA suffers from the same \n     constitutional flaw.\n       Second, unlike other crimes currently listed in section \n     1481(a) that can result in loss of citizenship (see section \n     1481(a)(7)), Senator Cruz's addition does not require proof \n     of a conviction as a prerequisite. That omission undermines \n     the constitutional right of due process. As the Constitution \n     Project's Liberty and Security Committee explained in \n     opposing similar past attempts to amend section 1481(a):\n       [T]he language of 1481(a)(7) expressly requires a \n     conviction as a necessary prerequisite to denaturalization or \n     expatriation proceedings. This requirement protects the \n     constitutional right of due process, since one cannot \n     actually be said to have committed the acts specified in \n     1481(a)(7)--each of which are crimes against the United \n     States--until and unless those acts have been proven to a \n     jury beyond a reasonable doubt. As the Supreme Court \n     expressly held in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, Congress \n     cannot deprive an individual of his or her citizenship as a \n     ``punishment'' absent the procedural safeguards of a criminal \n     trial.\n       The rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) \n     and the United States' response to date raises a critical \n     question for Congress to consider, but it is not the ETA. For \n     well over a year, the United States has been at war with ISIL \n     and Congress has still not weighed in, notwithstanding its \n     constitutional responsibility to do so. Members should spend \n     their time debating and voting on this grave question, not \n     preoccupied with needless and likely unconstitutional \n     legislation.\n       We urge you to oppose the Expatriate Terrorists Act.\n           Sincerely,\n     David Cole,\n       Hon. George J. Mitchell, Professor in Law and Public Policy \n     at Georgetown University Law Center; co-chair of the \n     Constitution Project's Liberty and Security Committee\n     David Keene,\n       Opinion Editor, The Washington Times; Former Chairman, \n     American Conservative Union; co-chair of the Constitution \n     Project's Liberty and Security Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the National Review, Jan. 28, 2015]\n\n                       How Not To Fight Terrorism\n\n                           (By Gabriel Malor)\n\n       Representative Steve King and Senators Ted Cruz and Chuck \n     Grassley have reintroduced the Expatriate Terrorist Act, a \n     bill to strip U.S. citizenship from terrorists. The proposal \n     sounds nice in theory, but it is also unconstitutional and \n     unnecessary, the latest in a sad line of civil-liberties \n     infringements justified by politicians trying to look tough \n     in the war on terrorism. Even if the bill did not have these \n     fatal infirmities, it would put the determination of who will \n     retain their citizenship in the hands of unelected \n     bureaucrats at the Departments of Justice, State, and \n     Homeland Security. On that ground alone, all Americans should \n     unite in opposition.\n       The idea to strip citizenship from terrorists is not a new \n     one. In 2010, Senators Joe Lieberman and Scott Brown \n     introduced similar legislation, dubbed the Terrorist \n     Expatriation Act. Their bill would have amended the list of \n     expatriating acts in the Immigration and Nationality Act to \n     include material assistance to foreign terrorist \n     organizations. Legal scholars and civil libertarians pointed \n     out that the bill was neither necessary nor constitutional, \n     and ultimately it died.\n\n[[Page S8118]]\n\n       The new bill put forward by King, Cruz, and Grassley goes \n     further, adding membership, training, and oaths of allegiance \n     to the list of expatriating acts. They claim that this \n     legislation is necessary to protect the homeland from \n     radicalized citizen-terrorists returning from abroad.\n       But citizenship is not a mere privilege. It is a right \n     specifically protected by the Constitution. Congress cannot \n     simply decide that individuals lose their citizenship when \n     they commit certain acts. Rather, to strip a person's \n     citizenship requires that the government prove not only that \n     he committed an act deemed expatriating by Congress but that \n     he did so knowingly and voluntarily and with the intent to \n     relinquish his citizenship. In the words of Justice White, \n     writing for the Supreme Court when this issue was settled \n     decades ago, ``in the last analysis, expatriation depends on \n     the will of the citizen rather than on the will of Congress \n     and its assessment of his conduct.''\n       Senator Cruz's claim that his bill would make the act of \n     becoming a terrorist an ``affirmative renunciation'' of \n     citizenship is deeply misleading. To be constitutional, \n     expatriation can be accomplished only by intent to \n     relinquish, something that Cruz, a lawyer and litigator of \n     great skill, should already know. And if he doesn't mean what \n     he is saying, he owes it to the American public to tell us \n     how he believes the law would operate or if it would even be \n     practicable at all.\n       On the issue of deception, King, Cruz, and Grassley say the \n     statutory change targets dangerous terrorist fighters who try \n     to return to the United States from abroad. The plain \n     language of the proposed legislation, however, is not limited \n     to those who actually take up arms. It applies to anyone who \n     merely claims membership in a terrorist organization or gives \n     an oath, training, or material assistance to terrorists, \n     regardless of whether he actually fights. And it is not \n     limited just to terrorists abroad; any of those actions taken \n     inside the United States would also trigger the citizenship-\n     stripping provision under the express terms of the \n     legislation, leading to the deplorable circumstance of \n     creating stateless terrorists within the jurisdictional \n     boundaries of the United States.\n       This is assuming the courts actually credit King, Cruz, and \n     Grassley's stated security purpose for proposing the law. If \n     the courts were to decide that the expatriation of terrorists \n     was intended to be a punitive act rather than a security \n     measure, a different and more stringent series of \n     constitutional prohibitions come into play, including the \n     Fifth and Sixth Amendment protections for criminal \n     defendants.\n       King, Cruz, and Grassley are selling fear to justify an \n     unconstitutional deprivation of rights, and they are doing it \n     for no good reason. If the U.S. government has enough \n     information to identify citizen-terrorists abroad and \n     intercept them on their attempted return, it has enough \n     information to bring criminal prosecutions against those \n     individuals for terrorism when they try to reenter the United \n     States. The authority to intercept and detain such \n     individuals has already been granted by Congress to the \n     Department of Homeland Security. The Department of Justice, \n     of course, also has the authority to prosecute such \n     individuals. And so the stated purpose for the proposed \n     legislation is dubious, since the government's responsibility \n     for intercepting returning terrorists is settled law, which \n     has a side benefit of being constitutional.\n       Even if this legislation were passed into law, because of \n     its constitutional infirmity it would never work as billed by \n     its proponents. Instead, it would mobilize an army of \n     bureaucrats at Justice, State, and Homeland Security to start \n     sniping away at Americans' rights of citizenship and travel. \n     For example, the Justice Department gets to designate or \n     decline to designate foreign terrorist organizations and so \n     controls the determination of who is subjected to losing his \n     citizenship. State Department officials have the authority to \n     determine who gets sent expatriation certificates. And \n     Homeland Security customs and border officers are responsible \n     for detaining and paroling or removing non-citizens, \n     including expatriated former citizens, who attempt entry to \n     the United States.\n       All of these bureaucratic acts are subject to abuse. For \n     that reason they are also subject to various types of \n     administrative and judicial challenge, which typically drag \n     on for years at great cost. Such litigation and the \n     bureaucratic infrastructure to support it would be for \n     questionable benefit in light of the alternate means already \n     in place to intercept terrorists.\n       In short, the Expatriate Terrorist Act is a \n     constitutionally suspect law. Well-established programs for \n     intercepting terrorists attempting to enter the United States \n     already exist. At best, the proposed bill would greatly \n     increase the power of government to use and abuse its \n     discretion to meddle with American lives. It does not \n     represent a genuine attempt to better our national security. \n     On the contrary, it is merely the latest in a series of \n     questionable infringements of civil liberties proposed by \n     politicians eager to exploit the public's fear of terrorism.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               American Civil Liberties Union,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 18, 2015.\n     Re Oppose Senator Ted Cruz's Request for Unanimous Consent on \n         S. 247, the Expatriate Terrorists Act, which Strips U.S. \n         Citizenship without Due Process and based on Suspicion\n\n               Vote ``No'' on S. 247 as Unconstitutional\n\n\n   S. 247 STRIPS AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP BASED ON MERE SUSPICION BY AN \n                      UNNAMED GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL\n\n       Dear Senator: The American Civil Liberties Union strongly \n     urges you to oppose S. 247, the Expatriate Terrorists Act, \n     which is sponsored by Senator Ted Cruz. The bill would strip \n     U.S. citizenship from Americans who have not been convicted \n     of any crimes, but who are merely suspected by an unnamed \n     government official of wrongdoing.\n       S. 247 is dangerous because it would attempt to dilute the \n     rights and privileges of citizenship, one of the core \n     principles of the Constitution. As the Supreme Court \n     explained in 1967 in Afroyim v. Rusk, ``the Fourteenth \n     Amendment was designed to, and does, protect every citizen of \n     this Nation against a congressional forcible destruction of \n     his citizenship, whatever his creed, color, or race . . . [It \n     creates] a constitutional right to remain a citizen in a free \n     country unless he voluntarily relinquishes that \n     citizenship.'' The bill is also unnecessary because existing \n     laws already provide significant penalties for U.S. citizens \n     who engage in acts of terrorism.\n       An already unconstitutional federal statute, 8 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1481, provides that an American can lose his or her \n     citizenship by performing either of the following broad \n     categories of acts with the intention of relinquishing his or \n     her nationality:\n       acts that affirmatively renounce one's American \n     citizenship, such as taking an oath of allegiance to a \n     foreign government or serving as an officer in the armed \n     forces of a foreign nation; or\n       committing crimes such as treason or conspiracy to \n     overthrow the U.S. government, or bearing arms against the \n     United States, ``if and when [the citizen] is convicted \n     thereof by a court martial or by a court of competent \n     jurisdiction.''\n       S. 247 would add a new category of expatriating acts--\n     ``Becoming a member of, or providing training or material \n     assistance to, any foreign terrorist organization designated \n     under Section 219.'' This implicates several constitutional \n     concerns.\n       First, the material assistance provision added by the bill \n     would treat suspected provision of material assistance as an \n     act that affirmatively renounces one's American citizenship. \n     Thus, unlike treason or conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. \n     government, this provision would not require a prior \n     conviction. It would only require an administrative finding \n     by an unspecified government official that an American \n     citizen is suspected of providing material assistance to a \n     designated foreign terrorist organization with the intention \n     of relinquishing his or her citizenship.\n       Second, this provision would violate Americans' \n     constitutional right to due process, including by depriving \n     them of citizenship based on secret evidence, and without the \n     right to a jury trial and accompanying protections enshrined \n     in the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. In sum, the bill turns the \n     whole notion of due process on its head. Government officials \n     do not have the power to strip citizenship from American \n     citizens who never renounced their citizenship and were never \n     convicted of a crime.\n       Third, the material assistance provision suffers from the \n     same constitutional flaws that plague other material support \n     laws, and goes far beyond what the Supreme Court has held is \n     constitutionally permissible when First and Fourth Amendments \n     rights are at stake. In 2010, the Supreme Court \n     disappointingly ruled in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project \n     that teaching terrorist groups how to negotiate peacefully \n     could be enough to be found guilty of material support. Even \n     if that logic might apply to criminal conduct, it should not \n     cause an American to lose his or her citizenship.\n       For these reasons, the ACLU urges you to oppose S. 247. \n     Please contact Chris Anders at canders@aclu.org or (202) 675-\n     2308, if you have any questions regarding this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Karin Johanson,\n       Director, Washington Legislative Office.\n     Christopher Anders,\n       Senior Legislative Counsel, Washington Legislative Office.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I reserve my time, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes on the Democratic side and \n2 minutes on the Republican side.\n  The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say at the outset the initial \nunanimous consent request made by the junior Senator from Texas was a \nbill which he had pending before the Senate Judiciary Committee today. \nHe did not attend that meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I \nwish he had. I think we should have all been there if we wanted to take \nthis up and debate it. I objected on behalf of Senator Leahy and \nmyself, and the Senator has spoken to the reasons for that objection.\n  Let me address the second part of this bill relative to refugees. We \nwill reflect in years to come about what happened in this world in the \nlast week and 10 days. We will reflect on the terrible tragedy that \noccurred in Paris,\n\n[[Page S8119]]\n\nFrance, and in Beirut and other nations, which was led by the ISIS \nterrorists. We will reflect on those poor victims who died as a result \nof their terrorist acts. And we will also reflect on acts of heroism \nand wisdom that emerged from this terrible tragedy, heroism on the \nground in Paris and other places by those who defied these terrorists \nand those who risked their lives to bring those responsible to justice, \nand the wisdom and compassion shown by leaders around the world not to \nexploit this situation.\n  When President Hollande of France announced that his country would \nreceive 35,000 refugees after this attack, he made it clear that he \nwould not hold those innocent, helpless refugees accountable for the \nterrible misdeeds of these terrorists. When the nation of Canada said \nthey would accept thousands of refugees, even after the Paris attack, \nthey showed the wisdom and good sense to differentiate those helpless \nvictims of terrorism around the world who are seeking refuge on our \nshores from those who perpetrated these terrorist acts. Then listen to \nthe debate on Capitol Hill. Listen to the unanimous consent requests \nmade this morning by the junior Senator from Texas. It is not \nconsistent with that ethic. It is not consistent with those values.\n  To say we will accept only refugees who are the victims of genocide \nwould close the doors to Cuban refugees who came to the United States, \ntrying to escape all of communism and what it meant to their families. \nIt would have closed the doors to Soviet Jews persecuted in that \ncountry who were looking for freedom and came to the United States as \nrefugees. I can list countless others who were not the victims of \ngenocide, but they were the victims of persecution, they were from war-\ntorn countries, and they were the victims, as Senator Leahy has said, \nof gang rape and terrorism.\n  Listen to what has been said on the other side of the Rotunda and in \nthis Chamber today. It does not merit the kind of appreciation of \nAmerican values that we insist on when we make these critical \ndecisions. In time of war, in time of attack, sometimes rash decisions \nare made. I predict that in the course of history, as people in the \nfuture reflect on what happened in the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives this week, they will hope that saner voices will \nprevail.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, the Senator from Vermont spoke against \noverheated rhetoric and in the very next breath accused me of being \nanti-American, echoing the attack President Obama gave standing on the \nsoil of Turkey. Let me say that speaking the truth is not terrorism.\n  My Democratic friends invoked their Irish and Italian grandparents. \nWell, when my Irish and Italian grandparents came to this country, they \ndid not pose a terrorist threat because they were not seeking to murder \ninnocent citizens. When my Cuban father came as a refugee, he was not a \nterrorist threat seeking to murder innocent citizens. This is an \nexample of the Democratic Party's refusal to acknowledge the \nqualitative difference. Perhaps if they cannot see it, they can hear \nit, because in 2009 the Obama administration released Abu al-Baghdadi, \nthe leader of ISIS. As he was being released, Abu al-Baghdadi turned to \nArmy COL Kenneth King and said: See you in New York.\n  ISIS intends to murder Americans, and if the Democratic Party cannot \ndistinguish between ISIS terrorists and Irish and Italian and Jewish \nand Cuban immigrants, then they are ignoring reality.\n  I would note that the Expatriate Terrorist Act is very, very similar \nto legislation that was introduced in 2010 by Democratic Senator Joe \nLieberman and Senator Scott Brown, both of whom apparently, under the \nview of the Senator from Vermont, are un-American as well. I would note \nthat at the time, then-Senator Hillary Clinton said about legislation \nvirtually identical to my legislation:\n\n       United States citizenship is a privilege. It is not a \n     right. People who are serving foreign powers--or in this case \n     foreign terrorists--are clearly in violation of the oath \n     which they swore when they became citizens.\n\n  Yet President Obama and the Senator from Vermont apparently now \nconsider Hillary Clinton's statement to be un-American. It is the \nessence of being American to say the Commander in Chief should protect \nthe safety and security of this country.\n  I would note that the assistant Democratic leader invoked President \nHollande in France. President Hollande said he would support stripping \nFrench citizenship. We should protect ourselves every bit as much as \nthe other nations on Earth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Terrorist Attacks Against France and Syrian Refugees\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I wish to speak about Friday night for a \nfew moments. In Connecticut, on Friday night the world really did stop. \nThousands of people in my State watched their television set or their \nsmartphone as images like this one poured in from the blood-soaked \nstreets of Paris: horrific reports, scores dead, more badly wounded. \nDeep down, in Connecticut, we ached deeply for Paris's loss. Maybe it \nis because for those of us who hail from the former colonies, we feel a \nspecial sense of brotherhood with the French. In my boyhood town of \nWethersfield, CT, I grew up a stone's throw from the tavern where \nWashington and Rochambeau met to plan their campaign against the \nBritish. We pain for France because of 250 years of friendship and also \nbecause we know, unfortunately, exactly what they are going through. \nThat ominous sense of familiarity and that perverse bond among nations \nthat have been visited by mass terrorist attack are part of the reason \nwhy we ached so acutely on Friday night, over the weekend, and into \nthis week.\n  But also, these pictures cause us pain because we fear this isn't the \nend of the mass slaughter. We grieve because the massive scale of this \nparticular attack, on a nation that already had its antenna tuned for a \npotential attack, made us realize how vulnerable we still are today to \na similar assault. The threat of another large-scale extremist attack \njust became so much more real for millions of Americans who had, \nfrankly, begun to settle into an understandable comfortable \ncomplacency, a decade and a half since that last major terrorist attack \njust miles from Connecticut's border.\n  In Connecticut, to be honest, people are mad and they are scared. \nHaving watched all of this coverage, I understand why. But images such \nas this also move the people of my State. These are two little kids, \nRalia and Rahaf, 7 and 13 years old. This is where they sleep at night, \non the streets of Beirut. They went there from Damascus after their \nmother and their brother were killed by a grenade. Along with\n\n[[Page S8120]]\n\ntheir dad, they have been sleeping on the streets for over a year. \nRahaf, who is 13, says she is scared of the ``bad boys'' in Beirut on \nthose streets at night. When she talks about that, Ralia starts crying.\n  I don't want to cast with a broad brush all of the people of my \nState, but I think I can safely say that their hearts ache for pictures \nlike this, for images such as the one of the 3-year-old boy--just about \nthe same age as my youngest son--who washed up limp and dead on the \nbeach in Turkey. My neighbors are not comfortable living in a country \nthat simply turns its back on little kids who have been ravaged by \ntorture and rape, dying from barrel bombs and executions and slipshod \nescape vessels.\n  There has been a lot that has disturbed me about the debate here in \nWashington, across the country, and on the cable news channels since \nFriday's massacre: the hyperpartisanship, the concern for one religion \nover another, the refusal to wait for facts before jumping to policy \nconclusions.\n  Maybe what has disappointed me the most is the suggestion that the \npeople in my State or the people of this country or this Congress need \nto make a choice between acting on concern for this image or acting out \nof concern for this image. The suggestion is that if your priority is \nprotecting us from a Paris-style attack, you can't show compassion for \nthose two little kids. If you want to show compassion for these \ninnocents, then you compromise national security.\n  Here is the truth: Not only are these two priorities not mutually \nexclusive, they are actually interdependent. There is simply no choice \nto be made between protecting this country and helping the victims of \nterror. We can take steps together--Republicans and Democrats--to make \nsure terrorists do not get into this country, and we can continue in \nthe best traditions of America to be, as our Statue of Liberty says, a \nhome for ``your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.'' How do I \narrive at this conclusion that we can do both, that we can protect our \ncountry and respond to the victims of terror in Syria? First, I asked \nthe questions my constituents are asking: How can we be sure refugees \nfleeing Syria aren't going to pose a risk to the security of the people \nwho live in my State in Connecticut?\n  Yesterday I sat through two exhaustive briefings to seek the answer \nto this question, and here is what I learned. There is no one who comes \nto the United States, in any immigration category, that receives a more \ncomprehensive and exhaustive background check than refugees: \nbiometrics, international background checks, interviews, fingerprints--\na process that takes anywhere from 18 months to 2 years to make sure we \nget it right. It is exhaustive, and it is probably why of the nearly \n2,000 Syrian refugees who are resettled in the United States this year, \nnot a single one has been connected to terrorist activity. The other \nreason for this, as I learned yesterday, is because the profile of the \nrefugees we are prioritizing for entry into the United States tells the \nstory as well. We largely bring women and children, the frail and the \nsick, those who have been beaten, raped or tortured by terrorists--the \nones who simply cannot survive in the refugee camps. It means that of \nall the Syrians who are already here, only 2 percent of them are young, \nsingle males. We aren't bringing into the United States the type of \npeople who fit the profile of those who could pose a danger to us.\n  The second reason I have concluded that ending the refugee program \nreally will not make us safer is because of conversations I have had \nwith experts about the nature of ISIS itself. I don't think you can \nargue that ISIS has been contained. Paris showed us ISIS can be lethal \nanywhere, anytime. Over the past year, ISIS has proffered two \nnarratives to its recruits. The first is that this so-called caliphate \nis expanding. It is an unstoppable, inexorable force that challenges \nyoung Muslims to get on board now before it overtakes them by force. \nThe second is this narrative that there is a war between the West that \nis left over from Iraq, left over from Afghanistan, left over from the \naftermath of Sykes-Picot, left over from the Crusades. It is this idea \nthat the Western World is out to destroy the East, they argue, and we \nhave to fight for our survival.\n  The first narrative is still strong, but it is not strong as it used \nto be. ISIS isn't expanding its territory in the Middle East anymore. \nThey have 25 percent less territory than they did last year at this \ntime. The second initiative now actually becomes more important, and \nthe Paris attacks are evidence of this. Indiscriminate attacks on \ncivilians in a place like Paris are designed, in part, to provoke a \nresponse from the West to feed this argument over a clash of \ncivilizations. That doesn't mean we shouldn't respond, it doesn't mean \nwe shouldn't respond forcefully, but it should wake us up to the \nreality of the necessity of this us-versus-them narrative that is \nessential to the growth of ISIS. The story of the Christian world's \nmarginalization of the Muslim world is the nourishment that feeds the \ngrowth of ISIS.\n  That is what makes our response to the Syrian humanitarian disaster \ninterwoven into our strategy to defeat ISIS. Turning our back on those \nwho have been tortured and raped and battered and beaten by Bashar al-\nAssad, after having welcomed massive refugee flows from Cuba and \nVietnam and Bosnia, feeds straight into this radical Sunni argument \nthat we are at war with Islam. Imagine the glee in Raqqa when they see \npostings of American politicians arguing we should take Syrian refugees \nbut only the Christian ones and not the Muslim ones. That is a story \nline that is an ISIS recruiter's dream.\n  None of this is to suggest we shouldn't be taking the fight to ISIS \nin Syria and Iraq. I have been a vocal supporter of the thousands of \nbombing runs by American planes, of our efforts to support the Iraqi \nArmy and the Peshmerga as they seek to kill as many ISIS fighters as \npossible. Fighting ISIS inside Syria and Iraq is absolutely necessary \nin order to defeat them. So we engage in that fight with the knowledge \nthat our involvement may also help with recruitment. We weigh the \nbenefit against the cost and we fight.\n  When it comes to turning away the victims of terror inside Syria, if \nwe are able to build a system that screens out any Syrians who pose a \nthreat to the United States, then the meager benefit can never outweigh \nthe costs of feeding this anti-Muslim narrative. Now that narrative is \nmore important than ever to sustain ISIS.\n  Here is the most important point to make. The people I represent \ndon't believe we can just stand still in the wake of Paris, even if \nthey believe the screening program is robust enough. They may be \nconvinced of this, but they are certainly right that we can't accept \nthe status quo. My worry over the past week is that this hyperfocus on \nthe refugee program that has only brought in 2,000 immigrants last \nyear--mostly women and children--misses the forest for the trees.\n  The Visa Waiver Program brings in 20 million people a year--not \n2,000--20 million people. It has background checks, too, but nothing \nlike what is applied to refugees. There is a good reason for this \ndifference, because the countries that are part of the Visa Waiver \nProgram are our allies--countries we can generally rely on--but with \nseveral of the Paris attackers bearing EU passports, making them \neligible for the Visa Waiver Program, this sense of security we have \nhad with these countries has been shattered. If we want to have a real \nconversation about changing our immigration laws to better protect this \ncountry, then focusing on 20 million lightly vetted visitors rather \nthan 2,000 highly vetted visitors sounds like the better approach.\n  There is absolutely room to make the Visa Waiver Program stronger. \nThere are a myriad of security information sharing agreements between \nthe United States and Europe and among countries within Europe that \nhave not been executed. Now is the time to demand that these \nagreements, like the umbrella law enforcement agreement between the EU \nand the United States, be executed, be signed. Now is the time for both \nthe United States and Europe to require that every EU nation modernize \ntheir protocols for uploading law enforcement and anti-terrorism \ninformation onto the databases that we use to compile our no-fly list. \nIf these agreements aren't signed or these protocols aren't updated, \nthen we need to consider whether an unreformed Visa\n\n[[Page S8121]]\n\nWaiver Program is still in our national interests.\n  If our goal is really to keep America safe from infiltration of \nterrorist groups, this reform is the most important one we can make to \nour immigration system, and it should bring together Republicans and \nDemocrats.\n  Every day that I go home to my 7-year-old and my 4-year-old, I am \nreminded that my most sacred duty here is to enact policy that keeps \nthem safe and keeps my constituents safe. The hundreds of calls and \nemails that my office has received since Friday reinforces for me this \ncommitment, but I live in a nation like no other. I live in the United \nStates of America, a nation that in the late 1800s had emerged from \nCivil War to become a beacon for the oppressed and the repressed all \nover the world and millions showed up on our shores--people like my \nIrish and Polish ancestors--and a nation that was spreading its wings \nover the world, beginning to understand the impact for good that we \ncould have. It was during that time that the poet Emma Lazarus called \nAmerica ``The New Colossus.'' The feeling was that we were capable of a \ngreatness, a bigness of both achievement and heart that the world had \nnever witnessed and exceptionalism, one that still burns bright today.\n  The argument that America cannot both protect itself and protect \nthose who are fleeing terrorism feels so small. It feels so contrary to \nthis idea of exceptionalism that has been at the foundation, at the \nroot of the American story. It feels very weak. In fact, the moments \nwhere we have made choices solely out of fear to marginalize others are \nmoments we now regret. We interred Japanese Americans in camps because \nwe were at war with Japan or hesitated to take Jewish refugees fleeing \nthe Nazis out of fear that some might be spies. In hindsight those \nmeasures did not reflect on who we really are as a nation.\n  The America I live in does not settle for false choices that make \nAmerica look and feel small or powerless. We can save the terrorized \nand protect ourselves from being terrorized at the same time. In fact, \nwe have to do the former to accomplish the latter. In doing so we can \ncome together as a Congress and as a country to make good policy and to \nrecall that sense of American exceptionalism that caused Emma Lazarus's \npoem to end up on a statue that was sent as a present to the United \nStates from France as a reminder of our unbreakable bond with them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2 \np.m. today, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the \nfollowing nominations: Calendar Nos. 366 through 371; that the Senate \nvote on the nominations without intervening action or debate; that \nfollowing disposition of the nominations, the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or \ndebate; that no further motions be in order to the nominations; that \nany statements related to the nominations be printed in the Record; \nthat the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and \nthe Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, for the information of our colleagues, \nwe are making good progress in clearing a number of amendments that \nhave support on both sides of the aisle. I expect we will be able to \nproceed with an amendment offered by Senator Cornyn and Senator Reid \nshortly, and in the meantime I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment in order to call up my amendment No. 2844.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, over 1,000 \nAmericans have called my office in the last couple of days, and they \nare very concerned about admitting people from the Middle East when we \nare not sure what their intentions are. The Boston bombers were here \nunder the refugee program, and two Iraqi refugees came to my State with \nthe intent to buy Stinger missiles.\n  I have asked for a very simple amendment. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave an amendment placed in the queue for a vote that lets the American \npeople vote on whether we want to bring more people here from the \nMiddle East and whether we are doing an adequate job of screening these \npeople. I think having a vote on that is a reasonable request, and \ntherefore, until I am allowed to have a vote for which I think the \nAmerican people are clamoring, I will continue to object.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent to bring \nforward my amendment to limit and end the subsidized housing for new \npeople who come here from the Middle East. My amendment is No. 2843, \nand I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to set aside the current \nbusiness and bring my amendment forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, on behalf of myself and the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee, Senator Reed, I object. We are in a process \nwhere we are trying to clear amendments, and we are making good \nprogress on this bill. I understand Senator Paul has raised an issue \nthat is issue, but it does not belong on this bill and indeed would \nresult in this bill not progressing.\n  We are trying to get back to regular order on the appropriations \nprocess. With cooperation, I am confident we could finish this \nimportant appropriations bill today. We could show the American people \nthat we can govern and fund essential transportation and housing \nprograms that are included in this bill. By and large, we have had \nexcellent bipartisan cooperation. I was hoping we could move to the \namendment offered by the Senator from Texas--a member of the Republican \nleadership--and cosponsored by the Senate Democratic leader. It is an \namendment that I believe we could dispense with quickly, and we would \nthen be able to continue to work through the amendments on this bill.\n  Since the amendment from the Senator from Kentucky would grind this \nbill to a halt and does not belong on this bill--and there will be \nother opportunities to deal with this issue because the House is going \nto be passing legislation this week dealing with the issues raised by \nthe Senator from Kentucky--I will object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I agree with the senior Senator from \nMaine and the bill manager that the concerns Senator Paul has raised, \nwhich are shared by many of us as far as the adequacy of the screening \nprocess for the refugees coming to our country, is a serious matter. It \nis a matter, as the Senator from Maine has said, that will be voted on \ntoday, and my prediction is that there will be broad bipartisan support \nfor the additional security measures contained in that bill.\n  This is a transportation bill, and it is very important for us to get \nour work done, and unfortunately that is appearing more and more \ndifficult.\n  If I could say a word about my amendment because this is an important \nmatter to me and to my State, as well as to other States. My amendment \nwould direct the Secretary of Transportation to conduct cost-benefit \ndeterminations for new airports which are seeking entry into the \nfederal\n\n[[Page S8122]]\n\ntower program but have been unnecessarily prohibited by the Federal \nAviation Administration. The FAA's current moratorium on accepting new \nairports negatively impacts airport sponsors that have already \nsubmitted their applications to the FAA, including the North Texas \nRegional Airport in Grayson County, TX. I know there are airports like \nthat around the country, which is why this amendment has such broad \nbipartisan support.\n  This amendment would simply require the Secretary of Transportation \nto process applications that have already been submitted--in some cases \nyears ago--but have been punished by this arbitrary administrative \ndelay. It would not have any negative impact on any current contract \ntower airports and would only allow new airports to be admitted to the \nprogram if funds are available.\n  I am grateful to Senator Collins and Senator Reed for their favorable \nconsideration of this amendment, and I hope we can work through the \nobjection raised by the Senator from Kentucky so we can process this \nlegislation and pass it in the near future.\n\n\n                        National Adoption Month\n\n  Madam President, on another note, I wanted to say a few words about \nNational Adoption Month.\n  Yesterday, Senator Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, convened a very important hearing on the subject of \ninternational adoptions; specifically, ensuring that the process--which \nat times can be bogged down in bureaucratic redtape and take an \nexcruciatingly long time to complete--remains a priority for this \nadministration.\n  Last year, if my recollection serves me correctly, there were about \n22,000 intercountry adoptions. In other words, there were families here \nin the United States who wanted to adopt these children who, in many \ncircumstances, have very poor prospects in the countries where they \nwere born.\n  As I said, this is National Adoption Month. I am glad Senator \nGrassley enabled us to highlight the challenges of people who are \ntrying to adopt children from, for example, the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo. There are about 400 adopted children the government of the \nCongo will not release. Yesterday, many of us, on a bipartisan basis, \nmet with the ambassador and asked: What is the way forward for these \nfamilies and these children, many of whom are in pretty poor \ncircumstances back in their home country.\n  Americans, of course, adopt not only children from their local \ncommunities or their State, but from literally around the world. It is \nsomething we ought to encourage. Devoted parents who make the decision \nto adopt ought to be commended for providing an opportunity for a \nbetter life for a child in need and for providing support and the love \nthat all children need and deserve.\n  One of the things that struck me yesterday during the hearing, as we \nheard from the State Department, are the numerous protections that are \nembedded within the adoption process to ensure that these \ninternationally adopted children are placed in safe homes and how \nimportant they are for protection of these children. These measures \ninclude commonsense safeguards such as thorough background checks, \nintensive interviews with potential parents, multiple visits to the \nchild's future home, and, of course, proper vetting of other people who \nwill be living under the same roof. This is important for the \nprotection of this adopted child.\n  This is a process that puts safety and the interests of the child \nfirst, and I think we would all agree that is exactly where that \npriority should stand: the best interests of the child first.\n  So while it was reassuring to me to hear about these rigorous \nrequirements that our government has put in place to protect these \nadopted children, I was reminded that protecting children during the \nplacement process should not be just limited to when we are talking \nabout adoptions. Over the last two fiscal years, more than 95,000 \nunaccompanied children have crossed our southern border without legal \npermit, the large majority of them making a perilous and deadly journey \nacross thousands of miles from Central America. We can only imagine the \nhorrible circumstances that parents must see and the poor prospects for \ntheir own children's future for them to turn them over to essentially \ncriminal organizations that will then ferry them, if they are lucky, \nfrom their country of origin through Mexico and into the United States. \nBut the surge of which we are all familiar--again, 95,000 unaccompanied \nchildren in just the last 2 years--has exposed the vulnerability of our \nsouthern border to human smugglers and transnational criminal networks. \nAs a matter of fact, I asked one of the witnesses at the hearing \nyesterday: Are the same criminal organizations that engage in human \ntrafficking and illegal immigration and illegal importation of drugs--\nare they all the same people?\n  He said: Absolutely.\n  I don't know how we can turn a blind eye to some of the illegal \nimmigration issues and to say we are completely outraged at the drug \ntrafficking going on between our countries or the human trafficking \ngoing on between our countries when, in fact, that activity is being \nconducted by exactly the same criminal organizations that have one \ninterest in mind, and it is not the best interest of the child. It is \nmoney. They view children as a commodity just as they view drugs as a \ncommodity.\n  Yesterday's hearing showed us that the lack of border security can \ncause a humanitarian crisis that endangers the lives of children who \nwere turned over by their parents and then smuggled into the United \nStates. We know from numerous reports and testimony that children on \nthis journey are preyed upon in the form of human trafficking, rape, \nand even murder. Many of them don't even make it here because they are \nkilled along the way, held hostage, perhaps for ransom, or otherwise \nassaulted. To this day, we still have no idea how many children and \nparents have perished during this unprecedented surge across our \nborder. Once these children arrive here in the United States, I think--\nI would hope--we would all agree that it is our joint and collective \nresponsibility to do what we can to protect them and ensure that they \nare no longer preyed upon by criminals and human traffickers.\n  Current law requires that within 72 hours of being located by law \nenforcement officials, a child be placed in the protective custody of \nthe Department of Health and Human Services so they can be protected \nfrom the danger of abuse and exposure to forms of violence. \nUnfortunately, current law also requires that these children be \nreleased, sometimes even to nonfamily members, sometimes even to \nnoncitizens, without any assurance or systematic protections that they \nare being sent into a safe environment--certainly nothing even remotely \napproaching the sort of care and precautions that we use when it comes \nto international adoptions.\n  As I heard yesterday, the administration is capable of making these \nassurances in the context of international adoptions, so why would we \nnot take steps to ensure that the same level of protection is there for \nthese unaccompanied children?\n  During the surge of these children across our border in 2014, I stood \nright here and I posed two very important questions: Could anyone in \nthe administration say with certainty that the children being released \nfrom U.S. custody were leaving with an actual family member? Believe it \nor not, there is no legal requirement that these children be turned \nover to an actual family member. Also, could the administration say \nwith certainty that none of these children have been handed over to an \nadult with a criminal record?\n  The answer to both of these questions was and continues to be no, and \nthat ought to shock our collective conscience. Sadly, we don't know how \nmany of these children have fallen into the wrong hands.\n  Earlier this year, four individuals were indicted for their \ninvolvement in a trafficking ring that smuggled unaccompanied \nGuatemalan children into the United States and forced them into slave \nlabor at egg farms in Ohio. These children faced horrific conditions, \nincluding long work hours, abuse, threats, and exploitation. But even \nmore shockingly, many of these children could have been spared if the \nFederal Government and the Department of Health and Human Services had \nan adequate system for screening and vetting the nongovernmental \nsponsors for these unaccompanied children. None of\n\n[[Page S8123]]\n\nthe protections--none of the protections--that are available for \ninternational adoptions have been applied here to protect these \nchildren.\n  The human traffickers in this case that I mentioned were able to gain \ncustody of these children by simply showing up at an HHS shelter, \ntelling the U.S. Government that they were family friends, and \nsubmitting a fake family reunification application. This is \nunacceptable, and it is our duty to these children to make sure that we \ndo a better job of protecting them, just as we do in cases of \ninternational adoption.\n  I know that our colleague from Ohio, Senator Portman, in his \noversight role in the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs is taking a hard look at this process through which we move \nunaccompanied children out of protective custody and into the hands of \npotential danger--not even family members, not even citizens, no \ncriminal background check, and absolutely no way to know what the \ngovernment is turning these children over to. I look forward to \nreviewing the findings of his forthcoming report, and I hope we can \nmake efforts to implement his recommendations.\n  Last Congress, I was proud to be the author and sponsor of a piece of \nlegislation that we called Helping Unaccompanied Alien Minors and \nAlleviating National Emergency Act--or the HUMANE Act--which would \nrequire all potential sponsors of unaccompanied children to undergo a \nrigorous biometric background and criminal history check. This is \nbipartisan legislation. Though there is certainly more we can do to \nensure an acceptable screening process, I believe that the protections \nin my legislation are a good start and would make a difference.\n  So I urge my colleagues, or anybody else who may be listening, as we \nreflect on National Adoption Month and the appropriate protections we \nput in place for international adoptions, to think about these almost \n100,000 other children who have crossed our borders over the last few \nyears and who were afforded none of the protections that we afford \nadopted children.\n  I truly hope we will take a comprehensive look at the concerns I have \nraised here today.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Immigration Reform\n\n  Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, last November, faced with Congress's \nfailure to act, President Obama, through Executive action, took a \ncourageous and practical step on immigration. Like every President \nsince President Eisenhower, President Obama exercised his legal \nauthority to prioritize U.S. immigration enforcement and make our \nsystem more fair and just. The most significant parts of the \nPresident's Executive actions were those intended to keep families \ntogether and give more people the opportunity to come out of the \nshadows.\n  The President announced an expansion of the successful Deferred \nAction for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. He also created a new \nDeferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents \ncalled DAPA. DAPA allows the undocumented parents of U.S.-born children \nto stay in this country with their families.\n  Since its creation in 2012, DACA has given nearly 700,000 \nundocumented young people the opportunity to pursue their dreams \nthrough education and jobs. Sixty percent of DACA recipients have been \nable to find new jobs, contributing to our tax base and our economy. \nExperts estimate that DACA recipients will contribute $230 billion to \nour GDP over the next decade.\n  Together, the expanded DACA and DAPA programs will mean that around 5 \nmillion more individuals will be able to work legally, pay their taxes, \nand care for their families.\n  While the President's actions generated a great deal of support and \nexcitement, they also generated opponents who challenged these actions \nin court. These court challenges resulted last week in a Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals ruling that further delays help for these 5 million \npeople in our country. As Judge Carolyn King stated in her very strong \ndissent in the Fifth Circuit case, ``a mistake has been made.''\n  The administration is acting to swiftly appeal this decision to the \nUnited States Supreme Court. I am hopeful that the Supreme Court will \nfind that the President's actions are lawful and that justice for \nmillions of workers and families will eventually be served. We cannot \ncontinue to be inactive in Congress while millions of people remain in \nthe shadows. Yet, here we are.\n\n  Today, politicians--from Presidential candidates to sitting \nGovernors--appeal to our Nation's fears in arguing against any \nmeaningful reform of our broken immigration system. Conjuring up \nshadowy images fuels these fears--violent gang members from South \nAmerica, terrorists from the Middle East. In their divisive rhetoric \nand in their rush to build walls and close our borders, they neglect \nthe faces of those they demonize, and they forget the facts.\n  The National Academies of Sciences recently released an authoritative \nlook on how immigrants assimilate into the United States. That report \npaints a very different picture from what you will hear from \nRepublicans on the campaign trail. For example, the Academies found \nthat neighborhoods with more immigrants have lower rates of crime and \nviolence than comparable nonimmigrant neighborhoods, and foreign-born \nmen are incarcerated at \\1/4\\ the rate of native-born Americans.\n  Today's immigrants are learning English just as fast as prior waves \nof immigrants; only our schools aren't equipped to help them as well as \nthey should be. Eighty-six percent of first-generation male immigrants \nhave jobs, as do 61 percent of women. In fact, immigrant men with the \nlowest education levels are more likely to have jobs than comparable \ngroups of nonimmigrant men.\n  These paint a very different picture than gang members and \nterrorists. In fact, it is clear that immigrants are an asset to our \ncommunities and our Nation. The vast majority of people come to America \nseeking a better life for themselves and their families. They work \nextremely hard and in many cases under very difficult circumstances.\n  Despite our country's being a nation of immigrants and the great \nbenefit immigration has meant to our culture and economy, immigration \nremains a difficult issue in America.\n  Just last month we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Immigration \nand Nationality Act of 1965. Prior to President Johnson's signing that \nlaw, the United States had a racially discriminatory quota system. In \nfact, prior to 1965, Asians were essentially excluded from immigrating \nto the United States. The 1965 law wasn't perfect, but it moved our \nsystem forward by focusing on family reunification--not racial quotas \namounting to racial discrimination--as a guiding principle.\n  Since the 1965 law, our Nation has benefitted greatly from the \nmillions of immigrants from all over the world who have come here. \nImmigrants have built vibrant communities, become titans of industry, \nexpanded American arts and music, and strengthened our public \ninstitutions. Their positive contributions have changed America and \nwhat it means to be an American.\n  No matter how toxic the immigration rhetoric may be right now, we \ncan't stop pushing to improve our broken system. President Obama's \nExecutive actions were neither a complete nor a permanent solution for \nimmigration reform, but they were positive steps forward. It has been \nmore than 2 years since the Senate passed its comprehensive immigration \nreform bill with 68 bipartisan votes. I was proud to have worked on \nthis bill as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Sadly, the House refused even to consider the bill--even after \nRepublicans released their immigration principles, acknowledging the \nbrokenness of our immigration system. Congress remains deeply divided, \nand there is still no indication that we will be able to pass \ncomprehensive immigration reform any time soon, leaving 11 million \npeople in our country in the shadows.\n\n[[Page S8124]]\n\n  As the only immigrant serving in the Senate today, I remember very \nwell my mother's courage in bringing her three children to this country \nso that we could have a chance at a better life. That is what \ncomprehensive immigration reform will mean to the 11 million people \nliving in the shadows in our country--a chance for a better life for \nthemselves and their families. These are mothers, fathers, sisters, \nbrothers; and they are neighbors and friends. They are not looking for \nhandouts. They are looking for the chance for a better life, and that \nis the universal appeal of our great country.\n  As leaders, we need to act to make real for these millions of people \nthe promise of America. We need to pass comprehensive immigration \nreform soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to leave the \nbill for a couple of minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I would yield to the Senator from \nOklahoma for the purpose of explaining an amendment that he has at the \ndesk, and a modification--a very good amendment, I might add.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Madam President.\n  It is my intention to ask to set aside the pending amendment for the \npurpose of considering the Inhofe amendment No. 2820, and I want to \nexplain what this is.\n  Today the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the FAA \nare working on the next generation radar system. We have talked about \nthis for a long period of time. I think the Senate knows that this \nSenator has been active in aviation for a long time, and this is \nsomething we have been working on together. The next generation radar \nsystem, called Multi-function Phased Array Radar, or MPAR, is comprised \nof individual radar stations capable of both air traffic tracking and \nweather surveillance.\n  The new system will replace the multiple systems separately \nmaintained by the FAA and NOAA and allow the consolidation of the \nnumber of discrete radar sites in the United States by about a third \nand yet do a more thorough job.\n  To support the development of the next generation radar, it is \nimportant for the FAA and NOAA to be working together and one not \ngetting out in front of the other one. For that reason--and I think my \njunior Senator, who is going to be working on this, agrees--there is \nsome concern that the FAA is getting out in front of NOAA on the \nselection of technology to meet both goals. We would clarify that in \nthe amendment.\n  What I will be asking for is the consideration of amendment No. 2820, \nas modified. The modification is at the desk now, expressing the sense \nof the Senate that the FAA and NOAA continue to work together so that \none agency doesn't get out ahead of the other and ensuring that the \npriorities of both agencies are met. Sometimes you have to get involved \nwith the bureaucracies when there is more than one working on it.\n  At the proper time, I will be wanting to do that. There is a courtesy \nbeing extended to another Member to be involved perhaps in this.\n  So with that, I will yield the floor and be prepared to offer my \namendment.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I want to thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his \ncourtesy to one of our colleagues who is on his way to the floor to \nrepeat an earlier ritual that we went through when one of our \ncolleagues attempted to make an amendment pending.\n  So in deference to that colleague, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I spent some time on the floor a few \nminutes ago explaining an amendment that I have. It is amendment No. \n2820, as modified. The modification is at the desk. It is one of those \nthings where there is no opposition at all.\n  We are trying to get to a new radar system that is--it is rather \ncomplicated. It will end up saving a lot of money and letting other \npeople in other parts of the country--all over the country--have the \nradar capability they don't have today. So it is something I know that \nno reasonable person would object to.\n  Madam President, for that reason, I ask unanimous consent to set \naside the pending amendment to call up my amendment No. 2820, as \nmodified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, the biggest issue of the day is how we \nprotect ourselves from terrorism. My amendment goes to the heart of the \nmatter.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. PAUL. Are we sufficiently vetting those who might come here and \nattack us from the Middle East?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. PAUL. I don't think we are. The two Boston bombers were here \nduring the refugee program. Two Iraqi refugees came to my hometown----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, Parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. PAUL. Of Bowling Green, KY.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. PAUL. I have an amendment that is not only pertinent----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PAUL. To the biggest issue of the day. I have an amendment that \nis germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PAUL. For those who make a mockery of this process by saying we \nare going to have regular order, we are not going to have regular \norder----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PAUL.

Madam President, for the information of our colleagues \non both sides of the aisle, I would like to explain the situation we \nface. First, let me say that working very closely with the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee, my friend and colleague Senator Jack Reed, \nwe have been making very good progress on this bill.\n  We have a number of amendments offered by Senators from both sides of \nthe aisle that we have agreed to work out, to clear on both sides, with \nboth managers of the bill. In some cases we have also gotten to the \nauthorizing committees, the Budget Committee. In other words, a great \ndeal of hard work has gone into clearing amendments that are ready to \nbe considered, that could be accepted by voice vote or\n\n[[Page S8125]]\n\nunanimous consent or in a managers' package. I am confident because of \nthis bipartisan cooperation, because of the extraordinarily hard work \nof our staffs, that we could finish this appropriations bill today.\n  Would that not be progress for the Senate, to be able to complete \naction on a bill that has vital funding for homeless veterans, for \nhomeless youth, for disabled and low-income elderly who depend on the \nsubsidized housing programs that are funded in this bill? This bill has \nimportant infrastructure spending. All of us are aware of the \ndeteriorating infrastructure, the crumbling roads and structurally \ndeficient bridges that we have in this country, the need for \nimprovements in rail safety, in our transit system.\n  There are so many issues that are important to the American people. \nThis bill funds the Community Development Block Grant Program, possibly \none of the most popular programs with State and local officials for \nspurring economic development and job creation in their communities, \nbut, alas, we have encountered a roadblock. As we have seen this \nmorning, even amendments that have been cleared on both sides of the \naisle are not being allowed to proceed. I think that is so unfortunate \nbecause with cooperation I am confident we could have finished work on \nthis bill and moved to final passage today. Regrettably, that is not \ngoing to occur unless there is a change of heart.\n  I do want to say I recognize there are other very important issues \nfor us to deal with. The House today is taking up a bill that would \ndeal with the screening process for refugees who come into this \ncountry. All of us recognize that our first obligation is the security \nof the American people. That is not what the bill before us is dealing \nwith, but there is action on the House side. A bill is expected to pass \ntoday with widespread bipartisan support and will be sent over for our \nconsideration. So I think it is unfortunate that we apparently cannot \ncomplete action on the appropriations bill that is before us.\n  However, I do want to assure my colleagues that we are going to \ncontinue to work on this bill. We are going to continue to review the \namendments that have been filed. We are going to work with the \nsponsors. We are going to work with the floor managers. We are going to \ncontinue to make progress behind the scenes in the event that we find a \nway around this roadblock.\n  In the meantime, I do want to express my appreciation to my ranking \nmember, Senator Reed, for his close cooperation on this bill. He and I \nintroduced the substitute amendment jointly when we began work on this \nbill. A special thanks to our staffs who have been working night and \nday to clear amendments that are ready go but unfortunately cannot be \nconsidered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, this whole process has been moved forward \nby the leadership of Chairman Collins. She and her staff have done an \nextraordinary job of taking the additional resources made available by \nthe budget agreement and constructively focusing them towards \naddressing important policies in transportation and housing in the \nUnited States.\n  As Chairman Collins discussed, we have about nine amendments--\nbipartisan amendments--that have been agreed to that focus on housing \nand transportation issues exclusively. These amendments also display \nthe give-and-take and back-and-forth that is necessary, the compromise \nthat is necessary. One example is the amendment that Senator Cornyn, \nalong with Senator Harry Reid, proposed that dealt with small airports \nthroughout the United States.\n  Those are the types of issues that should be the focal point of our \ndeliberations on the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development \nappropriations bill, and that is what we have tried to do. Frankly, \nunder Senator Collins' leadership, we were moving forward, but we have \nrun into a bit of an impasse. We are going to continue to work because \nit is critical to the country that we rebuild our infrastructure and \nmake sure that we have adequate, affordable housing, which is key to so \nmany things--to having a job, to holding a job, to children being in a \nschool for the whole year and not moving from school to school. All of \nthese are tied directly to our efforts here today.\n  I again compliment the chairman for her extraordinary efforts. The \nstaffs have done a superb job. We will continue to work. Our objective \nis to get a bill done and move forward in the process. Unfortunately, \nwe have hit this bump, but we are still going down the road.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8125-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8125-S8126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WASTEFUL SPENDING\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, the Presiding Officer has been in the \nchair before when I have done my waste of the week. This is my 27th \n``Waste of the Week'' this year, where I come to the floor of the \nSenate and take a documented waste, fraud, or abuse within the Federal \nGovernment, expose that abuse, and inform taxpayers that their hard-\nearned money is being wasted by this Federal Government. We are taking \nthose items that have been documented by government accounting \nagencies, by agencies that have been charged with the responsibility of \nlooking into how we spend the taxpayers' money and alerting us to \nproblems of fraud, waste, and abuse.\n  So No. 27 waste of the week is up this week, and this week it \ninvolves the issue of paid leave. This is an executive policy which \napplies to departments and agencies across the Federal Government.\n  Specifically, what I wish to do today is highlight the $31 million in \npayments to Federal employees who have received paid leave for over a \n1-year period of time. For Federal employees, paid administrative leave \nis typically a paid, excused absence that is separate from vacation \ntime. It includes things such as jury duty or time to allow a person to \ntransition home after an overseas deployment or post. Some agencies \nalso use paid leave when making personnel evaluations. This could \ninclude things such as investigations into alleged misconduct, security \nthreats, and similar situations where the employee should be restricted \nfrom the worksite while the investigation occurs. Many of these are \nlegitimate. Many of these fall into this category. But being given paid \nleave for over a year?\n  First, it raises the question, What is going on here? This is way \nbeyond the norm.\n  Secondly, shouldn't we have some documentation as to why this takes \nplace? Currently, Federal agencies across the Federal Government have \nthe authority to set their own policies regarding administrative leave, \nand this leads to a variety of different policies from agency to \nagency. Why are there discrepancies among agencies in both length of \ntime and the frequency of the granted paid leave?\n  What is particularly troubling to me is that an audit by the \nGovernment Accountability Office, the GAO, found that 263 employees \nhave received paid administrative leave for over a 1-year period of \ntime--more than 1 year. Most of us expect, yes, OK, 2 days off or a \nweek off because I have been selected for jury duty. I have a citizen's \nand a resident's obligation to do that. Paid leave is justified on that \nbasis. For someone returning from a post overseas, to get resettled, \npaid leave is justified. There are some other justifications. But over \na year? Paid leave for over a year and $31 million paid out to people \nwho haven't worked for over a year? Something needs to be looked into \nregarding how and why that takes place.\n  Last month, the Washington Post told a story about how this issue has \npersisted within the Department of Homeland Security even after the \nreport was issued. The Post article states that ``close to 100 DHS \n[Department of Homeland Security] employees still are being paid not to \nwork for more than a year.''\n  So I think the question we need to ask ourselves in response to this \nreport is why? Why did the Federal Government spend $31 million to pay \n263 employees not to work for more than a year? And what is the \njustification for the 1-year paid leaves? Unfortunately, the Government \nAccountability Office was unable to disclose the specific details as to \nwhy these 263 individuals were on paid leave for over a year. However, \nthere are public reports that give examples of employees who have\n\n[[Page S8126]]\n\ncontinued to receive paychecks for over a year.\n  The Washington Post again reported the case of a former high-level \nEnvironmental Protection Agency employee who pretended he was a member \nof the Central Intelligence Agency for years. This employee collected \npaid leave under the pretense he was conducting top-secret work for the \nCIA when, in fact, he was home exercising and pursuing a personal \nresearch project. He effectively, according to the Post, stole $900,000 \nfrom taxpayers for work he never did. That included his salary and \nbonus. He was actually paid bonuses. The man was paid a bonus payment \nfor not working--defrauding the Agency he worked for. The good news is \nthat they caught him. The bad news is that it took 2\\1/2\\ years to \nfigure out something was going on.\n  An article in the Washington Times details a 4-year case where an \nemployee at EPA was fired for ``sending a `hostile email' and making \ninappropriate statements that `caused anxiety and disruption in the \nworkplace.' '' That employee was ultimately removed from the EPA a \nsecond time but only after he received 1,496 hours of backpay.\n  And on and on it goes. I could stand here for a long time talking \nabout examples of paid leave to personnel totaling $31 million for \npayments of paid leave for over a 1-year period of time. It is not just \nthe EPA. I am not picking on one agency. Every agency in government has \nthese policies. GAO estimates that there are some bad track records for \nthese agencies. For instance, the Department of the Treasury has 25 \nemployees on paid leave for over a year and the Department of Veterans \nAffairs has over 46. And even more disturbing is the fact that the GAO \ninvestigation found that Federal agencies don't have sufficient \ndocumentation for the paid leave, if they had any documentation at all. \nHow can you put someone on paid leave, how can you make payments for \nover a year and have no documentation as to why you are making the \npayments?\n  Coming to the floor with these waste of the week, fraud-and-abuse \nsituations, it is hard to comprehend how these things go on. The \ningenuity of those who are committing fraud and those who oversee \nagencies that are paying this out is stunning.\n  I want to make it clear that I am not against paid leave. There are \nmany valid cases. But taxpayers deserve to know why Federal agencies \nare paying their employees not to work for over a year without \nsufficient documentation for taking such action. In fact, this ought to \ngo for all paid leave, whether it is for 1 day, 1 month, or 1 year.\n  Particularly, though, what ought to be ringing an alarm bell is \nsomeone who is on the record as receiving paid leave for several months \nor over a year--and I am only documenting that which was documented for \nover 1 year. Who knows how much this would total if we looked into \nevery agency's policies and found out that they weren't documented and \nthat they couldn't prove that the paid leave was legitimized.\n  I need to give credit where credit is due. The Office of Personnel \nManagement has finally recognized that this is a costly issue and has \nmoved to take steps to address this misuse of taxpayer dollars. This \nsummer, the agency announced guidance on what does and doesn't \nconstitute paid administrative leave. I urge OPM to follow up now and \nensure that all Federal agencies are implementing these \nrecommendations. But why did it take us so long? Why do we have to have \nan investigative report? Where is the management? Where is the \nmanagement in these agencies that oversees this and does not allow this \nto happen? Why do we have to wait for the Government Accountability \nOffice to come in and audit these agencies and find this unbelievable \namount of waste, fraud, and abuse that takes place?\n  So taxpayers are on the hook for another $31 million of waste. We add \nthat to our ever-growing total of waste, fraud, and abuse, now reaching \nwell over--almost $119 billion. And we have Members down here talking \nabout a program that needs funding because it is an essential program, \nbut we don't have the money to do it. Others come down and say we can't \ncut a penny more from any of the programs we have--and that is another \nissue--and yet we continue to waste this kind of money.\n  Next week it will be item No. 28 as we go forward exposing waste, \nfraud, and abuse in the Federal Government, taking hard-working \ntaxpayers' dollars at a time when the economy is not doing all that \nwell. This is something which continues to be a noose around the \nFederal Government's neck and which needs to be addressed.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, because of what happened in Paris last \nweek, a lot of speeches are going to be given on the floor of the \nSenate about terrorism. But it is too bad that we only seem to talk \nabout the dangers of terrorism when bad things happen in the United \nStates or happen in Paris or someplace else that brings the issue to \nour attention. I think what we all need to remember is that it is a \nconstant danger that may not appear to us daily, but somewhere out \nthere are people thinking about killing us for what we believe.\n  So I rise today, again, expressing my sympathies to the people of \nParis and those affected by Friday's terrible attacks by radical \nIslamic terrorists there. On behalf of the people of Iowa, I continue \nto stand with the people of France.\n  Unfortunately, the attacks last Friday should not have been a \nsurprise. Radical Islamic terrorists have been waging war against the \nUnited States and our allies for years. When thinking about the last \nthree decades of the last century, you think about the terrorism at the \nMunich Olympics or an American being murdered on a TWA plane. Then we \nhad a Jewish person in a wheelchair thrown overboard in the \nMediterranean. There was the attempt to bring down the Twin Towers in \n1993\n\n[[Page S8127]]\n\nby car bombs. Marines were murdered in Lebanon--over 200, I think it \nwas. We had the attack on the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, where our \nmilitary people were living. We had the East African Embassy attacked, \nand we had the USS Cole attack.\n  Now, all of those happened before \n9/11. Since 9/11, attacks have occurred around the world--from the \ntrain bombings in Madrid in 2004 to the suicide bombings in London in \n2005 to the senseless slaughter in the streets of Mumbai in 2008. My \nfocus today, however, will be on the United States homeland.\n  Terrorists have continued to try to attack us here on many occasions \nsince 9/11. Some of these attacks have succeeded. Most of them have \nfailed. Some of them have involved direct coordination with terrorist \nleaders abroad, and some have been committed by lone wolves inspired by \nterrorists overseas or the views of those terrorists. But these threats \nare ongoing, and that is what we should not fail to understand. \nConsequently, we must be vigilant to guard against those threats. We \nknow that we will face them again.\n  Several prominent terrorist attacks in the United States come to \nmind. We all remember the carnage at the Boston Marathon in April 2013, \nwhere two brothers detonated bombs at the finish line that killed an 8-\nyear-old boy and two others and injured hundreds more. Although the \nbrothers did not appear to have direct ties with terrorist \norganizations, they were motivated by radical Islamic beliefs.\n  We also remember the November 2009 shooting at Fort Hood, TX, where \n13 people were killed and several dozen others were wounded. \nIncredibly, the Obama administration refused to categorize this as a \nterrorist attack, in spite of the fact that the shooter had traded \nemails with then senior Al Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki. The shooter \nalso later identified his extremist beliefs as a basis of his attack.\n  But those tragedies only continued the pattern followed by radical \nIslamic terrorists since Al Qaeda hijacked and crashed airplanes into \nthe Twin Towers and the Pentagon that fateful day in 2001. Soon after \n9/11, for example, British citizen Richard Reid attempted to detonate \nexplosives packed in his shoe while on a flight to Miami in December \n2001. He had previously trained at Al Qaeda terrorist camps in \nAfghanistan. Thankfully, he failed, but this attempted attack put us on \nnotice that these terrorists were not finished with what happened on 9/\n11.\n  More attacks and plots followed, perhaps less well remembered after \nthe passage of time. And the passage of time is our biggest enemy here, \nas we don't think about this often enough. But they still demonstrate \nthe ongoing threat we face.\n  In July 2002, an Egyptian shot and killed two Israelis and wounded \nfour others at the Los Angeles International Airport. Although the FBI \ndid not find evidence linking the shooter to a terrorist group, the \nagency concluded the shooting was an act of terror.\n  In March 2006, another radical Islamic terrorist injured six people \nwhen he drove his vehicle into a group of pedestrians at the University \nof North Carolina. The attacker claimed to have conducted the attack in \norder to avenge the killing of Muslims around the world by our American \nGovernment.\n  Another example is the ``Fort Dix Six'' plot in May of 2007. In that \ncase, six men planned to kill American soldiers at the military base in \nNew Jersey but were arrested before they could do so. The men were \ninspired by jihadi videos.\n  In June 2009, a terrorist shot two recruiters at a military center in \nLittle Rock, AR. One of the recruiters was killed, and the other was \nseriously wounded. The shooter told the judge in his case that he was a \nsoldier of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\n  Later in 2009, three radical Islamic terrorists were arrested just \nbefore they were able to conduct suicide attacks in New York City. One \nof these terrorists drove all the way from his home in Colorado to \nstrike the New York City subway system with homemade explosives hidden \ninside a backpack. He later admitted in court that he was trained by Al \nQaeda to be a part of what they call a ``martyrdom operation.'' He \nfurther confessed that Al Qaeda officials ordered these suicide attacks \nfrom Pakistan.\n  Also in 2009, on Christmas Day, a terrorist often referred to as the \nUnderwear Bomber attempted to blow up a bomb concealed in his underwear \nwhile on a flight over Detroit. Several days later, Al Qaeda affiliates \nin Yemen and Saudi Arabia claimed responsibility for that effort.\n  In May 2010, a terrorist tried to set off a car bomb in the middle of \nTimes Square in New York City. He was arrested while attempting to flee \nthe country on a flight to the Middle East. The bomber was trained and \nfinanced by the Pakistani Taliban.\n  More recently, the threat from radical Islamic extremism has sprung \nfrom the chaos in Syria. By now we are all familiar with ISIS, or the \nIslamic State. Last year, we witnessed the horrors of ISIS's brutal and \nbarbaric beheading of American journalists James Foley and Steven \nSotloff, and aid worker Peter Kassig in Syria.\n  As FBI Director Comey explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee \nearlier this year, ISIS presents a new type of Islamic extremist \norganization. For one thing, ISIS exploits social media to promote its \nterrorist agenda and encourage people within the United States to \ncommit terrorist attacks. As Director Comey explained, ISIS's \npropaganda machine is like a devil on somebody's shoulder saying: \n``Kill, kill, kill;'' and ``if you can't come to Syria, kill somebody \nwhere you are. Kill somebody in uniform. Kill anybody.'' Those are the \nwords Comey used in paraphrasing the message that comes from ISIS on \nsocial media.\n  ISIS's deadly message of terror is having a profound effect here in \nour country. Over the last year, the government has stopped numerous \nindividuals in the United States who tried to travel to Syria to fight \nfor ISIS. According to Director Comey, over 200 Americans have traveled \nor attempted to travel to Syria for this purpose. I fear that such \nindividuals who successfully return home could recreate the Paris \nattack here in our country, given the training, the indoctrination, and \nthe battlefield experience they received abroad. The Washington Post \nreported on November 16 that 66 men and women in the United States have \nbeen charged with crimes associated with ISIS, including both \nattempting to travel to Syria to join ISIS or planning attacks here.\n  Beyond ISIS's recruitment of Americans to fight in Syria, the Paris \nattack demonstrates the extreme dangers the group now poses here in \nNorth America. Look at what occurred just over the past year or so. In \nOctober 2014, a radical Islamic terrorist who could not obtain a \npassport to travel to Syria shot up the Parliament in Canada, killing a \nCanadian soldier on duty at the Canadian National War Memorial. The \nnext day, a self-radicalized Muslim convert attacked four police \nofficers on the streets of New York City with a hatchet after watching \nISIS Internet propaganda.\n\n  In January of this year, the FBI arrested a person in Ohio for \nplotting to attack the U.S. Capitol with pipe bombs and guns. The \nterrorist also allegedly expressed a desire to support ISIS, and he had \nposted videos and messages on social media, supporting violent attacks \nby radical Islamic terrorists.\n  Later, in May of this year, two Islamic terrorists drove from Arizona \nto Garland, TX, to attack a conference center during an art exhibit. \nThe center was hosting an exhibition of cartoons depicting the Islamic \nProphet Mohammed. The pair shot and injured a security guard before \nbeing killed by a police officer. ISIS subsequently claimed \nresponsibility for that attack.\n  In June 2015, law enforcement officers in Massachusetts shot and \nluckily killed a knife-wielding member of a group of ISIS supporters \nwho were plotting attacks here in the United States, along the lines of \nwhat Director Comey has said: Just go out and ``kill, kill, kill.'' Two \nother alleged terrorists were arrested and are being prosecuted.\n  Just this month, an American was arrested in Ohio for supporting \nISIS. He allegedly posted online detailed personal information, \nincluding their addresses, of 100 U.S. military members. He had then \nallegedly called on fellow\n\n[[Page S8128]]\n\nterrorists to kill these military personnel in their homes and \ncommunities, along the lines of what the social networking message is \nfrom overseas to people in the United States, as Director Comey has \nreported to us: ``Kill, kill, kill.'' Just kill anyone.\n  More chilling than a lot of this is the video released earlier this \nweek. On Monday, ISIS released a video warning countries against \nparticipating in air strikes in Syria. The video claimed that ISIS \nwould attack these countries just as it attacked France last Friday. \nThe video specifically threatened to attack this city, right here, \nWashington, DC.\n  According to the New York Times just this morning, ``at least three \ndozen people in the United States suspected of ties to the Islamic \nState were under heavy electronic or physical surveillance even before \nthe Paris attacks.'' That ought to wake us all up to the dangerous \nenvironment that exists.\n  It is all too obvious that we will continue to face attacks from \nradical Islamic terrorists in the future. We ought to remind ourselves \nevery day about this potential threat. So to help remind us both of \nthat certainty and that we must be prepared for it, I ask unanimous \nconsent to enter into the Record a long list of terrorist attacks in \nthe United States that I prepared from public sources. The list may not \ninclude each and every attack by terrorists, but it does include a wide \nvariety of attempted and planned attacks against our citizens. Because \nof space limitations on material submitted for the Record, a more \ncomplete and annotated list can be found on my website. That list also \nincludes a separate list of individuals prosecuted in the United States \nfor attempting to leave the country to fight for ISIS.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nRadical Islamic Terrorist Attacks and Plots in the United States Since \n                                  9/11\n\n\n                         I. Successful Attacks\n\n       July 4, 2002: Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, a 41-year-old \n     Egyptian national, shot and killed two Israelis and wounded \n     four others at the El Al ticket counter at Los Angeles \n     International Airport. Although the FBI did not find evidence \n     linking Hadayet to a terrorist group, the agency concluded \n     the shooting was an act of terrorism because of Hadayet's \n     stated anti-Israel views and opposition to U.S. Middle East \n     policy.\n       March 5, 2006: Mohammed Reza Taheri-Azar injured six people \n     when he drove a Sport Utility Vehicle into a group of \n     pedestrians at the UNC-Chapel Hill campus. Taheri-Azar \n     claimed to have conducted the attack in order to avenge the \n     killing of Muslims around the world by the U.S. government.\n       July 28, 2006: Naveed Afzal Haq shot and killed one woman, \n     and wounded five others, at the Jewish Federation building in \n     Seattle, Washington. During the shooting, Haq spoke with a \n     911 dispatcher and said ``these are Jews and I'm tired of \n     getting pushed around and our people getting pushed around by \n     the situation in the Middle East.''\n       June 1, 2009: Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad shot two military \n     recruiters at a Little Rock, Arkansas Army/Navy Career \n     Center, killing one and seriously wounding the other. \n     Muhammad had previously converted to Islam and spent \n     approximately 16 months, beginning in 2007, in Yemen. \n     Although no independent, public confirmation of Muhammad's \n     ties to Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula exists, Muhammad \n     wrote to the judge in his case stating that he was ``a \n     soldier'' of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and undertook \n     his attack as revenge for U.S. killing of Muslims in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan.\n       November 5, 2009: Nidal Malik Hasan, a U.S. Army Major \n     serving as a psychiatrist, shot and killed 13 people and \n     wounded several dozen others at Fort Hood, Texas. Hasan \n     stated that his motive was jihad to fight ``illegal and \n     immoral aggression against Muslims'' in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n     Hasan had earlier exchanged 18 e-mails with Anwar al-Awlaki, \n     an important, U.S.-born leader of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian \n     Peninsula.\n       April 15, 2013: Tamerlan Tsarnaey and his younger brother, \n     Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, detonated two bombs within moments of each \n     other near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing \n     three people and injuring hundreds more. Although the \n     brothers were motivated by radical Islam to carry out the \n     attacks, they did not appear to have had any direct ties to \n     Islamic terrorist organizations.\n       October 23, 2014: Zale Thompson attacked four New York City \n     police officers with a hatchet, injuring two of them (one \n     critically) at a Queens, New York shopping district. The \n     police shot and killed Thompson, and a bystander was injured \n     in the process. Thompson appears to have been a self-\n     radicalized Muslim convert who had posted ``antigovernment, \n     anti-Western, anti-white'' messages online.\n       May 3, 2015: Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi began shooting \n     outside the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland, Texas during an \n     art exhibit hosted by an anti-Muslim group called the \n     American Freedom Defense Initiative. The center was hosting \n     an exhibition of cartoon adaptations depicting the Islamic \n     Prophet Muhammad. The pair shot and injured a security guard \n     before being killed by a police officer. The Islamic Sate of \n     Iraq and Syria subsequently claimed responsibility for the \n     attack, though the group did not provide evidence of how it \n     was involved with the shooters or in the attack.\n       July 16, 2015: Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez--who reportedly \n     had been in various locations in the Middle East for nearly \n     seven months last year--shot at government personnel in two \n     military installations in Chattanooga, Tennessee, first \n     through a drive-by shooting at a recruiting center, then by \n     traveling to a naval reserve center and continuing to fire. \n     Before being killed by police, Abdulazeez killed four \n     Marines, and wounded another Marine, a Navy sailor, and a \n     police officer. The Navy sailor died from his wounds two days \n     later. The FBI is investigating the attack as an act of \n     terrorism.\n\n\n                   II. Unsuccessful Attacks and Plots\n\n       December 22, 2001: British citizen Richard Reid attempted \n     to detonate explosives packed in his shoes while on a flight \n     from Paris to Miami. The airplane's crew and passengers \n     subdued him, and the plane landed safely in Boston. Reid had \n     previously received training at Al-Qaeda terrorist camps in \n     Afghanistan.\n       May 8, 2002: Jose Padilla was arrested at Chicago's O'Hare \n     International Airport and subsequently accused of plotting to \n     attack the United States with a radiological weapon (a \n     ``dirty bomb''). He had previously spent several years in the \n     Middle East, and the U.S. government produced evidence at his \n     trial indicating he had attended an Al-Qaeda training camp in \n     Afghanistan.\n       May 1, 2003: Iyman Faris pled guilty to providing material \n     support to Al-Qaeda and providing information to Al-Qaeda \n     about potential targets in the United States--including a \n     bridge in New York City.\n       August 2004: A group of men in the United Kingdom, led by \n     Al-Qaeda ``member or close associate'' Dhiren Barot, were \n     arrested for being part of an Al-Qaeda plan to bomb the \n     International Monetary Fund, New York Stock Exchange, \n     Citigroup and Prudential buildings in the United States, as \n     well as targets in the United Kingdom. Barot had earlier \n     scouted the American targets while visiting the United States \n     in 2000 and 2001.\n       August 2004: Shahawar Matin Siraj and James Elshafay were \n     arrested after conducting surveillance at the Herald Square \n     subway station in Manhattan. The pair were planning to attack \n     the station with explosives in response to actions by \n     American military forces in Iraq.\n       August 31, 2005: Kevin James, Hammad Samana, Gregory \n     Patterson, and Levar Washington were indicted on charges to \n     wage war against the United States through terrorist \n     activities. The men planned attacks against targets including \n     American military and Jewish institutions, located in \n     Southern California.\n       November 24, 2006: Uzair Paracha was convicted of \n     conspiring to help an Al-Qaeda operative member suspected of \n     planning bombing attacks in Maryland to enter the United \n     States. Paracha was later sentenced to 30 years in prison.\n       June 23 2006: Seven men, known as the ``Liberty City \n     Seven,'' were arrested for being involved in a plot to blow \n     up the Sears Tower in Chicago as part of an Islamic jihad. \n     Attorney General Gonzales stated later that year that the \n     plotters had promised to fight ``a full ground war against \n     the United States.''\n       July 7 2006: Three men were arrested in Lebanon for \n     plotting to bomb transit tunnels underneath the Hudson River \n     in New York City. The men intended that the New York \n     financial district would then be flooded. The FBI discovered \n     the plot and gathered information on it through emails and \n     chat-room postings on web forums used to recruit Islamic \n     terrorists.\n       December 8, 2006: Derrick Shareef was charged with plotting \n     to detonate hand grenades at a shopping mall in Illinois \n     during the Christmas shopping season. Shareef was a Muslim \n     convert who reportedly had discussed his desire to wage jihad \n     against civilians and had also spoken of attacking government \n     facilities.\n       2007: Sabrihan Hasanoff and Wessam Hanafi, beginning in \n     2007 and at the direction of Al-Qaeda members in Yemen \n     performed surveillance on several potential targets, \n     including the New York Stock Exchange, for future terrorist \n     attacks in the United States. El-Hanafi forwarded the report \n     to Al-Qaeda.\n       May 2007: Six men planned to kill American soldiers at Fort \n     Dix, New Jersey, but were arrested before they could do so. \n     This plot is popularly known as the ``Fort Dix Six'' plot, \n     and the men appear to have been inspired by Jihadi videos\n       June 3, 2007: Four men were indicted for plotting to blow \n     up jet-fuel tanks and a fuel pipeline at John F. Kennedy \n     International Airport in New York City. Assistant Attorney \n     General Kenneth Wainstein said that the men ``sought to \n     combine an insider's knowledge of JFK airport with the \n     assistance of Islamic radicals in the Caribbean to produce'' \n     a ``devastating attack.''\n       January 28, 2009: Bryant Neal Vinas pleaded guilty to \n     joining Al-Qaeda and developing a plan with Al-Qaeda \n     leadership to conduct an attack on the Long Island Railroad \n     in New York.\n\n[[Page S8129]]\n\n       February 26, 2009: Christopher Paul, also known as Abdul \n     Malek, was sentenced for conspiring to use weapons of mass \n     destruction against targets in Europe and the United States. \n     Paul, who had received terrorist training at overseas \n     terrorist camps in Afghanistan, and had subsequently \n     joined Al-Qaeda, had worked with an Islamic terror cell in \n     Europe to prepare to attack targets in the United States.\n       May 20, 2009: Four men were arrested for plotting to bomb \n     Jewish synagogues in New York City after they had planted \n     what they thought were bombs near two synagogues. The men \n     also allegedly planned to shoot down U.S. military planes \n     operating out of Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh, \n     New York. The men were apparently angry over the U.S.-led war \n     in Afghanistan, and one told an FBI informant that he'd be \n     interested in joining a Pakistan-based terrorist group ``to \n     do jihad.''\n       September 2009: Daniel Patrick Boyd and Hysen Sherifi were \n     charged with plotting to kill U.S. military personnel at the \n     Quantico marine base in Virginia. They had undertaken \n     reconnaissance of the base and had practiced attacking the \n     base in July. Boyd, along with several other suspects, had \n     earlier been charged with international terrorism charges in \n     August, but those charges did not concern attacks in the \n     United States. Prosecutors played a tape during Boyd's \n     detention hearing where he decried the U.S. military, decried \n     the struggle of Muslims, and mentioned the honor of \n     martyrdom.\n       September 2009: Najibullah Zazi, and later Adis Medunjanin \n     and Zarein Ahmedzay, were arrested for planning to conduct \n     suicide attacks with homemade explosives in the New York City \n     subway system. All three had received weapons training from \n     Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, and Zazi admitted in court that he \n     was trained by Al-Qaeda to be part of a ``martyrdom \n     operation.'' Evidence indicates that senior Al-Qaeda \n     officials ordered the attacks. According to the indictment \n     against Medunjanin, before being arrested for the planned \n     subway attacks, on January 7, 2010, Medunjanin attempted to \n     conduct an attack in New York City by intentionally crashing \n     his car on the Whitestone Expressway.\n       September 24, 2009: Michael Finton, also known as Talib \n     Islam, was arrested and charged for attempting to kill \n     federal employees by detonating a car bomb at the federal \n     building in Springfield, Illinois. He was arrested after he \n     attempted to detonate what he thought was the bomb, but which \n     was in fact a fake bomb. Finton reportedly idolized (and had \n     written to) American-born Taliban member John Walker Lindh.\n       September 24, 2009: Hosam Maher Husein Smadi, an illegal \n     immigrant from Jordan, was arrested for placing, with the \n     intent to detonate, what he thought was a car bomb outside of \n     the 60-story Fountain Place office tower in Dallas, Texas. \n     FBI undercover agents met with Smadi over several months \n     while posing as members of an Al-Qaeda sleeper cell. \n     According to the FBI, Smadi ``stood out based on his vehement \n     intention to actually conduct terror attacks in the United \n     States.''\n       December 14, 2009: Ehsanul Islam Sadequee and Syed Haris \n     Ahmed were sentenced for their earlier terrorism convictions \n     in support of terrorism. Among other activities, Sadequee and \n     Ahmed had driven to and taken videos--for use by ``the jihadi \n     brothers abroad'' with whom the pair were connected via the \n     internet--of targets in Washington, DC., including the U.S. \n     Capitol, the World Bank, the Masonic Temple, and a fuel tank \n     farm.\n       December 25, 2009: Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian \n     citizen, attempted to blow up the commercial airliner he was \n     flying on over Detroit by igniting high explosives concealed \n     in his underpants. Several days later, Al-Qaeda's affiliate \n     in Yemen and Saudi Arabia claimed responsibility for the \n     attempted attack. Abdulmutallab later plead to the charges \n     against him and read a statement in court saying ``I \n     attempted to use an explosive device which in the U.S. law is \n     a weapon of mass destruction, which I call a blessed weapon \n     to save the lives of innocent Muslims, for U.S. use of \n     weapons of mass destruction on Muslim populations in \n     Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen and beyond.''\n       May 1, 2010: Faisal Shahzad attempted, but failed, to \n     detonate a car bomb in Times Square in New York City. \n     Evidence indicated that the Pakistani Taliban was behind the \n     attempted attack, and that Shahzad was in contact with the \n     group via the internet while living in the United States. \n     Shahzad was attempting to flee the country through a flight \n     to the Middle East when arrested.\n       May 2010: Paul and Nadia Rockwood, from King Salmon, \n     Alaska, were arrested for lying to the FBI about having \n     compiled a list of 20 domestic terrorism targets, including \n     members of the U.S. military, the media, and two religious \n     organizations. The couple had also begun to acquire \n     components for mail bombs. Rockwood, who had earlier \n     converted to Islam and was studying the writings of Anwar al-\n     Awlaki, sought to ``exact revenge by death on anyone who \n     desecrated Islam.''\n       October 20, 2010: Zachary Adam Chesser, a supporter of \n     designated foreign terrorist organization Al-Shabaab, pleaded \n     guilty to charges that included soliciting other jihadists \n     online to murder U.S. citizens in the United States. Among \n     other things, he pleaded guilty to taking specific, repeated \n     steps to encourage jihadists to attack the writers of an \n     American television show for the way the show had depicted \n     Muhammad.\n       October 27, 2010: Farooque Ahmed, a naturalized U.S. \n     citizen, was arrested for plotting to bomb multiple \n     Washington, D.C. metro stations Ahmed believed he was \n     conspiring with Al-Qaeda operatives in plotting the attacks.\n       November 26, 2010: Mohamed Osman Mohamud, a Somali-\n     American, attempted to wage jihad by trying to ignite what he \n     thought was a real bomb, but which was a fake bomb supplied \n     by an undercover officer, at a Christmas tree lighting \n     ceremony in Portland, Oregon. Among other statements Mohamud \n     made regarding the attacks, he said ``I want whoever is \n     attending that event to leave, to leave either dead or \n     injured.''\n       December 8, 2010: Antonio Martinez, also known as Muhammad \n     Hussain, was arrested after a sting operation for plotting to \n     blow up the Armed Forces Career Center in Catonsville, \n     Maryland. Martinez, a Muslim convert, was motivated to plot \n     the attack because he was upset that the U.S. and other \n     militaries were fighting Muslims.\n       February 24, 2011: Khalid Ali-M Aldawsari, a Saudi Arabian \n     student in the United States, was arrested for planning and \n     having begun to build bombs for use in various terrorist \n     attacks in America. Targets of the attacks included former \n     President George W. Bush's home, hydroelectric dams, nuclear \n     power plants, nightclubs, and the homes of American soldiers \n     who had been stationed in Iraq at the Abu Ghraib prison. \n     Aldawsari described in his journal, as well as on blog \n     postings, his desire for violent jihad.\n       May 11, 2011: Ahmed Ferhani, a native of Algeria, and \n     Mohamed Mamdouh were arrested for plotting to attack Jewish \n     synagogues in New York City. The pair were arrested after \n     purchasing several handguns and one grenade. The two were \n     said to be ``committed to violent jihad.''\n       June 23, 2011: Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif and Walli Mujahidh \n     were arrested after purchasing machine guns and grenades for \n     the purpose of conducting a suicide attack against a federal \n     building housing the Military Entrance Processing Station in \n     Seattle. The pair's motive was to conduct physical jihad in \n     the United States, as they were upset about U.S. military \n     activities in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Yemen.\n       July 27, 2011: Naser Jason Abdo, a U.S. Army Private who \n     had been Absent Without Leave (AWOL), was arrested in a plot \n     against Fort Hood, Texas. He was found with jihaclist \n     materials, weapons, explosives instructions, and materials. \n     The explosives instructions were from an Al-Qaeda explosives \n     course manual.\n       September 28, 2011: Rezwan Ferdaus was arrested, following \n     an FBI undercover operation, and charged for plotting to use \n     a remote-controlled aircraft filled with explosives to attack \n     the U.S. Capitol and the Pentagon. Ferdaus planned to commit \n     violent jihad with the materials, and hoped to cause a \n     ``psychological impact'' by killing Americans--who he \n     referred to as ``enemies of Allah.''\n       November 20, 2011: Jose Pimentel was arrested for building \n     and plotting to detonate pipe bombs in and around New York \n     City. Pimentel's intended targets included U.S. military \n     personnel who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan, U.S. postal \n     facilities, and police. Pimentel was described as an ``Al-\n     Qaeda sympathizer,'' though he is believed to have worked on \n     his plot alone.\n       January 7, 2012: Sami Osmakac, a naturalized U.S. citizen \n     from Kosovo, was arrested for plotting to use weapons and \n     explosives ``to create mayhem'' in Tampa, Florida. He planned \n     to conduct a car bombing, then take hostages, and to finally \n     detonate a suicide belt he would be wearing. Osmakac told an \n     FBI undercover agent that ``We all have to die, so why not \n     die the Islamic way?''\n       February 17, 2012: Amine El Khalifi, a Moroccan who was \n     illegally inside the United States, was arrested following an \n     FBI sting operation for plotting to carry out a suicide \n     bombing inside the U.S. Capitol building.

Siddiqui had allegedly contacted members of \n     Al-Qaeda on repeated occasions.\n       April 10, 2015: John T. Booker was arrested, after a sting \n     operation, for allegedly trying to detonate a car bomb at the \n     Fort Riley military base in Kansas on behalf of ISIS. Booker \n     allegedly had spent months discussing different plans of \n     attack before deciding on a suicide attack against the base, \n     and had begun acquiring components for a vehicle bomb before \n     becoming the subject of the FBI operation. He also allegedly \n     repeatedly stated that he wished to engage in violent jihad \n     on behalf of ISIS.\n       June 12, 2015: David Wright and Nicholas Rovinski were \n     charged with conspiring to commit attacks against persons \n     inside the United States, which was intended to further \n     ISIS's objectives and therefore constituted material support \n     to that group. Wright and Rovinski also allegedly intended to \n     behead a man who had organized a conference in Garland, Texas \n     that featured cartoons depicting Muhammad. Moreover, Wright \n     and Rovinski allegedly conspired with Usaamah Abdullah \n     Rahim--Wright's uncle--who was shot and killed after \n     attacking police officers. The FBI stated that Rahim had been \n     under surveillance because he had bought fighting knives and \n     spoken of imminently attacking ``boys in blue.'' Rahhim, when \n     confronted by the police on a sidewalk, menaced the officers \n     with a military-style knife before shooting him when he \n     refused to drop the knife.\n       June 17, 2015: Fareed Mumuni and Munther Omar Saleh were \n     arrested for allegedly conspiring to attempt to assist ISIS \n     in committing a terrorist attack in the New York area.

He allegedly had pledged his support to ISIS via social \n     media, took steps to create propaganda for the group, and had \n     tried to persuade others to join ISIS too. He allegedly had \n     also expressed his desire to conduct an attack on the United \n     States, and had attempted to purchase an assault rifle.\n       July 13, 2015: Alexander Ciccolo was arrested on gun \n     charges after purchasing two pistols and two rifles from an \n     undercover FBI informant. His apartment allegedly was loaded \n     with bomb-making equipment and jihadi paperwork. Ciccolo \n     allegedly had planned to travel to a town with a state \n     university where he could attack students at the college. \n     Ciccolo was turned in by his father, who said his son was \n     inspired by ISIS, had said he is ``not afraid to die for the \n     cause,'' and reportedly characterized America as ``Satan'' \n     and ``disgusting.''\n       July 28, 2015: Harlem Suarez was charged with attempting to \n     use a weapon of mass destruction against a person or property \n     within the United States. Suarez came to law enforcement \n     attention following Facebook posts he made with Islamic \n     extremist rhetoric and promoting ISIS. Suarez allegedly had \n     told a confidential FBI source that he wanted to make a \n     ``timer bomb,'' which was to include galvanized nails and for \n     which he had purchased components, to be buried and detonated \n     at a beach in Key West, Florida.\n       November 12, 2015: Terrence McNeil was arrested in Ohio for \n     soliciting the murder of members of the U.S. military. He had \n     disseminated ISIS rhetoric and detailed U.S. military \n     personnel information for 100 military members, then called \n     on fellow terrorists to kill the military personnel in their \n     homes and communities.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. These lists include successful attacks that harmed \nAmericans as well as unsuccessful attempts that did not--often thanks \nto law enforcement's efforts. What is common to all the attacks is that \nthey were undertaken by terrorists who coordinated with radical Islamic \nextremists, were inspired by them or by those who shared their views. \nThe listed attacks should serve as a reminder that we must always be \nvigilant. We must never forget that radical Islamic extremists are \nwaging war against us. We must always be prepared to fight this battle \nand to defend against their attacks.\n  I am grateful this Thanksgiving season for the people in this country \nwho do the difficult work of protecting us from terrorists every day. \nWe must continually strengthen our country's ability to win this war. \nWe must ensure that our military and Special Forces have the ability to \ntake the fight to the terrorists overseas, wherever they are lurking. \nWe must ensure that our intelligence agencies have the tools needed to \nidentify terrorists and their plots, while preserving the civil \nliberties that make our country very special. And we must ensure that \nlaw enforcement is able to use the lawful tools provided by Congress, \nconsistent with our Constitution and approved by our courts, to help \nstop these terrorist attacks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst).

Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute and to \nhonor two great Americans, two wonderful people--Bart and Cherry \nStarr--for their numerous personal, professional, and charitable \ncontributions to the Nation and the great State of Wisconsin.\n  We are all aware of Bart's extraordinary contributions on the \nfootball field as quarterback for the Green Bay Packers. Drafted in the \n17th round in 1956, Bart proceeded to win 5 world championships, \nincluding victories in the first 2 Super Bowls. He was named the Super \nBowl's Most Valuable Player for both games, but ever humble, Bart gave \nfull credit to his teammates and to legendary coach Vince Lombardi for \nthe team's historic success.\n  Over the years, Bart has received many honors. He was selected as a \nPro Bowl Player four times and was named the NFL's Most Valuable Player \nin 1966. He was recognized in 1970 with the Gladiator of the Year Award \nfor best exemplifying the character attributes of a citizen-athlete. \nAnd he has been inducted into multiple Halls of Fame: The Alabama \nSports Hall of Fame in 1976, the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977, and \nthe Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1981.\n  Bart's football legacy goes beyond technical skill. His excellence in \nleadership and strength of character earned him the respect of his \ncoaches, teammates, and fans worldwide. He continues to be lauded as an \nexample throughout the NFL. Every year, the Bart Starr Award is \npresented to an NFL player who demonstrates leadership and integrity on \nthe field and in his community.\n  Bart considers his wife Cherry to be the most important member of the \nStarr family team. Cherry supported and inspired her husband as they \nraised their children, Bart Junior and Bret, and devoted herself to \nnumerous charitable causes throughout their life together. Their gifts \nof time, financial support, and celebrity continue to be a part of a \nlifelong mission benefiting many charities and causes.\n  At the height of his career with the Packers, Bart and Cherry \ncofounded Rawhide Boys Ranch, a home for at-risk boys. Over the years, \nthe Rawhide Boys Ranch has grown into a campus comprised of seven boys \nhomes, a state-of-the-art high school named in honor of Bart and Cherry \nStarr, and numerous work experience facilities that expose youth to a \nvariety of trades.\n\n  Bart and Cherry also served as honorary chairpersons for the Vince \nLombardi Cancer Foundation for more than 44 years. Their work behind \nthe scenes was central to raising more than $16 million for cancer \nresearch.\n  In addition, Bart and Cherry have been longtime supporters of \nCornerstone Schools of Alabama. Cornerstone offers a Christ-centered \neducation committed to academic excellence for Birmingham's inner city \nchildren whose families have limited school choice.\n  Finally, Cherry's passion for animals fuels their generous support \nover many years for the Greater Birmingham Humane Society.\n  Bart and Cherry are very proud of their children, grandchildren, and \ngreat-grandchildren, but the accomplishment they value most, that they \ncherish most, is their 60 years of loving marriage. I am honored to \nrecognize\n\n[[Page S8131]]\n\nBart and Cherry Starr for their exemplary lives. May their humble \nleadership, sacrifice, and love for others serve as an inspiration for \nall of us.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to speak once again on the topic \nof religious liberty. This is the sixth in a series of addresses I have \ngiven on this critical subject. In my previous remarks, I have \ndiscussed why religious liberty matters and why it deserves special \nprotection from government interference. I have also detailed the \nhistory of religious liberty in the United States and its centrality to \nour Nation's founding. Likewise, I have debunked the erroneous notion \nthat religion is a purely private matter that has no place in the \npublic domain.\n  Last week, I discussed the status of religious liberty in \ncontemporary American life. I argued that, in ways that are both \nalarming and unprecedented, religious liberty is under attack here in \nthe United States. Today, I turn my attention beyond our borders to \nexamine the status of religious liberty abroad. Again, my argument is \nstraightforward: across the world, religious liberty is under serious \nattack.\n  My observations are particularly relevant as we approach \nThanksgiving. Our Nation commemorates this special holiday in \nremembrance of our pilgrim ancestors who fled persecution in search of \nreligious freedom. These brave men and women sailed unchartered waters \nand settled strange lands in order to build a society where they could \npractice their religion free from state interference. Their earnest \nefforts precipitated not only the establishment of a new colony, but \nthe birth of a nation committed to the principles of religious \npluralism.\n  For America's earliest settlers, this land stood as a symbol of \nrefuge--a haven from the storm of religious oppression that lingered \nover Europe. Centuries later, victims of religious persecution across \nthe world still look to our shores for sanctuary. They see America as \nJohn Winthrop once described it: ``As a city upon a hill''--a light \nthat reaches across the oceans, giving hope to those still living in \nthe shadows of religious intolerance.\n  Today our world needs that light more than ever. Nearly four \ncenturies after the Pilgrims made landfall at Plymouth Rock, the state \nof religious liberty across the world is increasingly precarious. From \nbrutal crackdowns on religious minorities in Central Asia to a growing \nwave of anti-Semitism in Europe; from the violent campaigns of Boko \nHaram in Africa to the nefarious specter of ISIS in the Middle East--\nreligious liberty is under attack like never before.\n  Despite the rapid advance of democracy over the last century, the \nblessings of religious freedom are still inaccessible to a majority of \nthe world's population. In fact, a recent Pew study finds that three-\nquarters of the global population ``lives in countries with high-\ngovernment restrictions and significant hostilities surrounding \nreligion.''\n  Think about that. In spite of the substantial progress our own \nsociety has made in securing individual rights and enshrining religious \nliberty in law, there are still billions of people across the world who \nare unable to exercise their religion freely and fully. There are still \nbillions of individuals living under despotic regimes that not only \nfail to protect people from persecution, but that actively constrain \nthe conscience of citizens through law. There are still billions of \npeople who understand religious liberty as little more than a \nphilosophical concept, much less a reality.\n  I wish I could offer these people hope. I wish I could say that the \ngradual march of progress will part the waters of religious \nintolerance, paving a clear path forward for religious liberty, but \nreality restrains my optimism. Around the world, hostility to religion \nis increasing.\n  Religious liberty abroad faces opposition from two sources: states \nand nonstate actors. While I would like to relate an exhaustive account \nof the war being waged on both fronts, time permits me to highlight \nonly the most grievous examples of persecution.\n  I begin with state-sponsored acts of religious oppression. Far from \nbeing a relic of the past, government persecution of religious \nminorities is alive and well. First, consider the state of religious \nliberty in Asia. China is perhaps the world's leading instigator of \nreligious persecution. Last year, in a nearly unprecedented crackdown \non religious expression, the Chinese Government bulldozed or removed \ncrosses from more than 400 Protestant and Catholic Churches. According \nto the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, \nmany experts have characterized this growing tide of oppression against \nChristians in China as ``the most egregious and persistent since the \nCultural Revolution.''\n  And Christian denominations are not the only groups facing \noppression. Members of all faiths, including Muslims and Tibetan \nBuddhists, ``face arrests, fines, denials of justice, [and] lengthy \nprison sentences'' because of their religious beliefs. Practitioners of \nFalun Gong experience the most intense persecution. Sixteen years ago, \nthe Chinese Government imposed an outright ban on the practice of Falun \nGong. Since that time, the government has imprisoned believers in \nforced labor camps, subjecting them to psychiatric experiments and \nother heinous forms of torture. The government has even executed \npractitioners of Falun Gong, mutilating their bodies and harvesting \ntheir organs for profit. Our Nation can no longer turn a blind eye to \nthese atrocities.\n  Nor can we ignore the plight of religious prisoners in North Korea, \nwhere Kim Jong-un has incarcerated thousands of his own citizens for \ntheir religious beliefs. These men and women are separated from their \nfamilies and forced to work in concentration camps. While the \ngovernment punishes followers of any faith, the country's Christians \nface the greatest persecution. If caught practicing their religion, \nChristians face imprisonment without trial. Many face execution.\n  In Southeast Asia, Myanmar is responsible for propagating religious \nbigotry, not so much by what it does but by what it doesn't do. Across \nthe country, religious and ethnic minorities face increasing \npersecution at the hands of the Buddhist majority. Rather than \nintervene to protect these vulnerable groups from mistreatment, the \nMyanmar Government has stood idly by as an observer to the violence. As \na result of the government's inaction, 140,000 Muslims and at least \n100,000 Christians have been internally displaced.\n  In Africa and the Middle East, the situation is just as bleak. In \nIran, despite President Rouhani's promise to extend greater protections \nto religious minorities, the number of individuals detained because of \ntheir religious beliefs has actually increased during his term. \nBaha'is, Christians, Jews, and Sunni Muslims throughout the country \nface perpetual persecution, arrest, beating, and imprisonment. Some are \neven executed for their beliefs. And of course, there is perhaps no \ngovernment on earth more vocal in its anti-Semitism than Iran.\n  Meanwhile, in Saudi Arabia, the state prohibits all non-Muslim public \nplaces of worship. Any citizen who dares question the government's \nrepressive policies is likely to face charges of apostasy, blasphemy, \nand even sorcery--a crime punishable by death.\n  In Syria, Bashar al Assad has abandoned all appearances of religious \nliberty by deliberately targeting Sunni Muslim civilians in a bloody \ncivil war. As he massacres his own people, he does so on the basis of \ntheir religious affiliation.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to \nfinish my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. In Pakistan the government consistently fails to protect \nits own citizens from religiously motivated violence, and the courts \nexploit repressive anti-blasphemy laws to prosecute religious \nminorities. Egypt's\n\n[[Page S8132]]\n\ncourts convict and imprison citizens under the same pretext.\n  In Sudan the government harasses its minority Christian population \nand subjects Muslims and non-Muslims alike to the punishments of Sharia \nlaw. The state even executes citizens who convert from Islam to another \nreligion.\n  Even in Europe, religious liberty is under attack, albeit in more \nsubtle ways; take, for example, Switzerland, where a constitutional \namendment placed a countrywide ban on the construction of minarets--a \nwidely recognized symbol of Muslim prayer and devotion.\n  In another blow to Europe's Islamic population, France recently \noutlawed the wearing of burqas and niqabs in public. When a Muslim \nwoman appealed the ban to the European Court of Human Rights, the court \nupheld the law.\n  What I have related here is only a small sampling of the manifold \nabuses taking place around the world. If I were to relate every \ninstance of state-sponsored religious bigotry abroad, I would be \nspeaking here for days.\n  And none of this is to mention the war against freedom being waged by \nnon-state actors. In the past decade, we have witnessed an \nunprecedented rise of terrorist groups and other criminal organizations \nseeking to eradicate religious liberty altogether.\n  Take, for example, the rise of Boko Haram in the Lake Chad region of \nAfrica. This Islamic terrorist organization made headlines last year \nafter kidnapping over 276 Nigerian schoolgirls. According to the Human \nRights Watch, Boko Haram has since forced these young girls to convert \nto Islam and undergo severe physical and psychological torture. Many of \nthese young women have been subject to forced labor, and others have \nbeen raped while in captivity.\n  Boko Haram's central mission is to annihilate all Western social and \npolitical activities, including any religion that isn't Islam. In its \nfight against religious freedom and other Western values, the group has \nconducted indiscriminate attacks on civilians and has even used \nchildren as suicide bombers.\n  The brutality of Boko Haram is only surpassed by the barbarism of \nISIS. Far from being the ``jayvee team'' President Obama once \ndescribed, ISIS has proven to be perhaps the most formidable terrorist \nnetwork in operation today. I fear that too many underestimate the \nthreat ISIS poses to religious freedom. This is an organization whose \nvery raison d'etre is to establish a global Islamic caliphate and usher \nin the apocalypse.\n\n  As Islamic State militants carry out their mission, religious liberty \nis often the first casualty. In the barren world ISIS envisions, there \nis no room for dissent: either convert or be killed. Yazidis, \nChristians, and Shia Muslims throughout the Middle East have been \nconfronted with this impossible ultimatum. Refusal to give in to the \nIslamic State's demands has resulted in mass executions, extrajudicial \nkillings, kidnapping of civilians, forced displacement, the killing and \nmaiming of children, rape, and other forms of sexual violence. The \nsavagery of ISIS has even gone viral as the group posts videos of \ngrisly beheadings on the Internet. In almost every case, captors target \ntheir victims on the basis of religion.\n  As we are all too aware, the cruelty of ISIS is not confined to the \nMiddle East. Just last week, three teams of ISIS militants carried out \nterrorist assaults throughout Paris, detonating suicide bombs at a \nsoccer stadium and opening fire on innocent civilians at a concert \nhall. The violence injured more than 350 innocent bystanders and \nclaimed at least 129 lives in what is considered the worst terrorist \nattack on French soil in the nation's history.\n  We could call these attacks ``senseless acts of violence'' because \nthat is exactly what they appear to be, both in the scope of their \nbrutality and in the scale of their indiscrimination. But I fear that \ndismissing these attacks as ``senseless'' too often hides from our view \nthe radical rationale that motivates such violence. ISIS does not kill \nmerely to feed an insatiable bloodlust; it kills because it wants to \nterrorize, shock, and intimidate other civilizations into submission. \nIt kills because it wants to impose on all people a narrow-minded, \nmedieval ideology of Islam--one that would rob us of our religious \nfreedom and other fundamental rights.\n  Sadly, ISIS is not alone in its animus toward religious freedom. \nNearly every terrorist organization that has vowed our destruction--be \nit Al Qaeda, Hamas or Hezbollah--seeks to strip us not only of our \nsense of security but also of the fundamental freedoms that make \nreligious pluralism possible.\n  If we are committed to defending religious liberty overseas, we must \nconfront the growing menace of Islamic extremism, and we must challenge \nthose nations that engender religious intolerance through law. Today, \nby calling attention to the suffering of religious peoples throughout \nthe world, I have demonstrated clearly and without question that \nreligious liberty faces growing hostility abroad from both state and \nnon-state actors alike. From the heavy hand of government to the \nviolent campaigns of terrorist organizations around the globe, the \nright to worship according to the dictates of one's own conscience is \nunder relentless attack.\n  With a fuller understanding of the threats facing religious liberty, \nthe question now becomes: What is to be done? If religious liberty is \nunder attack abroad, what can our Nation do to protect this precious \nfreedom now and in the future?\n  First, we must recognize that protecting religious freedom abroad is \nnot just a question of moral principle; it is a matter of national \nsecurity. Often, violations of religious liberty abroad threaten our \nown safety at home. As a case in point, consider the role of religious \nintolerance in the Syrian civil war. Bashar al-Assad quickly disposed \nof religious freedom when he began deliberately targeting Sunni \nMuslims, murdering thousands of citizens on the basis of their \nreligion. His brutal actions precipitated the formation of ISIS--an \norganization hell-bent on destroying other religions and entire \ncivilizations in the name of Islam.\n  As ISIS gained in strength, it began to export its extreme ideology \nabroad, triggering several attacks throughout the world, including last \nweek's coordinated assaults in Paris. Now, ISIS poses a formidable \nthreat to the United States and all of our allies. Assad's blatant \ndisregard for religious liberty not only escalated violence in the \nregion but also catalyzed the formation of ISIS. As a result, the world \nis less safe.\n  Given the obvious nexus between protecting religious liberty and \nstrengthening global security, I agree with the following assessment \nfrom the U.S. Commission on International Freedom:\n  In the long run, there is only one permanent guarantor of the safety, \nsecurity, and survival of the persecuted and the vulnerable. It is the \nfull recognition of religious freedom as a sacred human right which \nevery nation, government, and individual must fully support and no \nnation, government, or individual must ever violate.\n  If we are committed to bolstering the security of other nations, then \nwe must be equally devoted to strengthening religious liberty abroad. \nAt the forefront of foreign policy should be a commitment to defend and \nadvance religious liberty in countries where it is under attack. We \nshould also be prepared to reevaluate our relationship with governments \nthat fail to make religious liberty protections a priority.\n  Congress took concrete steps to prioritize religious freedom as a \nforeign policy objective when it passed the International Religious \nFreedom Act of 1998. This law established the Ambassador-at-Large for \nInternational Religious Freedom. The Ambassador oversees the State \nDepartment's Office of International Religious Freedom, which monitors \ndiscrimination against people of faith and publishes an annual country-\nby-country report on the status of religious freedom abroad.\n  This historic legislation also created the U.S. Commission on \nInternational Freedom--an independent, bipartisan organization that \nclosely follows religious persecution in other countries and offers \nrecommendations to the executive branch and Congress on how best to \npromote religious freedom overseas.\n  As one of the only countries in the world to make religious liberty \nan explicit foreign policy objective, our nation is unique in its \ncommitment to this preeminent freedom. As a legislative body, Congress \ncan renew that commitment by continuing to support\n\n[[Page S8133]]\n\nthe provisions of the International Religious Freedom Act. The future \nof religious liberty overseas depends on our willingness to strengthen \nit here in Congress.\n  Lastly, if we are committed to protecting religious liberty abroad, \nwe must be ready to defend it here at home.\n  At the beginning of my remarks, I recalled the imagery of John \nWinthrop's ``City on a Hill.'' Throughout our Nation's history, several \npublic figures have invoked Winthrop's allusion to capture a simple \ntruth: America's special freedoms make her a light to other nations.\n  Through our robust exercise of religious liberty, we offer hope to \npeople beyond our borders--men and women suffering under the yoke of \noppression who look to our country for sanctuary. As our nation strives \nto be an example of religious freedom, we can offer greater hope to \nthose persecuted for their religious beliefs, and by addressing threats \nto freedom of conscience here at home--including the attacks on \nreligious liberty that I detailed in previous remarks--we can \nstrengthen and beautify our City on a Hill, building upon the \nfoundation laid for us by our Pilgrim forbears, so that the light of \nour Nation might shine before all mankind.\n  With this call to action, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate in morning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8133-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8133-S8135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 2303\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, over the last month, in a series of \nterrorist attacks around the globe that have killed hundreds of people, \nISIL has commenced a new phase in its war on the civilized world. We \nhave seen attacks in Ankara, Beirut, and Baghdad, the bombing of a \nRussian airliner over Egypt, and, of course, the horrific scenes last \nFriday in Paris, where ISIL gunmen wearing suicide belts attacked \ninnocent civilians at restaurants, bars, a soccer stadium, and a \nconcert hall, killing, as we know, 129 people and wounding 352 others.\n  This evolution in ISIL operations further highlights the threat that \nthey pose to countries beyond the Middle East, including the United \nStates of America. We cannot and should not wait for ISIL to attack the \nUnited States before we finally, finally, finally acknowledge that we \nare a nation at war and that we must adopt a new strategy to destroy \nISIL.\n  What we must also acknowledge is that while the threat posed by ISIL \nand our other adversaries is growing, our national security budgets are \nincreasingly disconnected from our national security requirements. \nRegardless of what ISIL will do next or how the United States will \ndecide to act, our national security budgets through fiscal year 2021 \nhave been arbitrarily--I emphasize ``arbitrarily''--capped by the \nBudget Control Act.\n  To be sure, the recently passed Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 \nprovides important relief from the sequester-level budget caps for \nfiscal year 2016 and 2017, and I am grateful to the Republican majority \nleader for leading that effort. Our national defense would be in far \nworse shape without that legislation. At the same time, that agreement \nis less optimal for next year and obviously does not seek to address \nthe budget caps that continue for the next 4 years. Indeed, under the \nrevised Budget Control Act, in constant dollars, we are actually on \ntrack to spend less on defense next year than this year. It has not \ntaken long for world events, yet again, to show the inadequacy of this \nexercise. At roughly the same time we were locking in next year's \ndefense budget caps, ISIL began demonstrating its capability to strike \ntargets outside of Iraq and Syria and now at the very center of the \nwestern world.\n  Indeed, since the Budget Control Act of 2011 capped defense and other \ndiscretionary spending for the subsequent 10 years, absent any \nconsideration of changing global threats or national requirements, \nlet's consider what has transpired since 2011. Any semblance of order \nin the Middle East has collapsed. We are all tragically familiar with \nthe carnage in Syria and Iraq, but Libya has also deteriorated into \nanarchy and safe havens for ISIL and its affiliates. Yemen has become \nthe scene of a proxy war between Iran and the gulf Arab nations. \nGeneral David Petraeus testified to the Armed Services Committee: \n``Almost every Middle Eastern country is now a battleground or a \ncombatant in one or more wars.''\n  From the outset, the Obama administration's policy was to withdraw \nfrom the Middle East. The President pulled all U.S. troops out of Iraq \nand put us on the path to do the same in Afghanistan, but as we \nexpected, and as I predicted, evil forces have moved in to fill the \nvacuums that we have left behind. ISIL has captured large swaths of \nterritories in Syria and Iraq and has spread across the region to \nAfghanistan, Libya, Egypt, and other countries.\n  As a result, we now have thousands of troops back in Iraq. The U.S. \nmilitary has conducted over 6,000 airstrikes in Syria and Iraq to \ncombat ISIL. We are increasing counterterrorism operations in North \nAfrica and providing military assistance to Saudi Arabia and our gulf \npartners fighting in Yemen. The situation in Afghanistan has driven the \nPresident to further delay the drawdown of U.S. troops. The \neffectiveness of these policies is questionable, but their cost is not.\n  In Europe, we have seen Russian forces invade Crimea and intervene \nmilitarily in Ukraine. This is the first time since World War II that \none government has invaded and sought to annex the territory of another \nsovereign territory in Europe. Since then, Vladimir Putin has grown \nbolder. He continues to modernize Russia's military. And most recently, \nof course, he has deployed Russian forces into Syria to prop up the \nAssad regime, even firing cruise missiles into the region from outside \nof it, as far away as nearly 1,000 miles.\n  Russia's actions have now forced the administration to bring back to \nEurope on a rotational basis one of the two brigade combat teams that \nit withdrew. As Russia continues its aggression in Europe and increases \nits involvement in the Middle East, the Secretary of Defense \nacknowledges that we need an entirely new strategy to counter \nRussia. All of this requires proper funding--all of it. All of it \nrequires proper funding levels, but our defense agencies have not \ngotten that, even as they have been asked to do more to counter Russia.\n\n  The situation isn't limited to Russia and Europe. China is growing \nmore assertive as well. It has built several land features in the South \nChina Sea, equipped with military buildings, fort facilities, and even \nrunways, all in an effort to expand Chinese territorial claims in the \narea. In addition to harassing other regional states, five Chinese navy \nships were spotted in the Bering Sea off of Alaska during President \nObama's recent trip to Alaska. Meanwhile, hackers in China continue to \nconduct cyber espionage and cyber attacks against our government and \ncritical sectors of our economy. Russia, Iran, and North Korea are \ndoing so as well, all in the past year.\n  Again and again, national security requirements have materialized \nafter the Budget Control Act was passed, but we forced our military to \ntackle a growing set of missions with arbitrary and insufficient budget \nlevels, revised periodically with whatever additional resources the \nCongress is able to scare up. The results speak for themselves. Since \n2011, as worldwide threats have been increasing, we have cut our \ndefense spending by almost 25 percent in annual spending. Not only has \nannual spending decreased, but so have the long-term budget plans of \nthe Department of Defense. Each year the Department releases a 5-year \nbudget. However, each year it has reduced its 5-year plan in an effort \nto closer align its spending to the Budget Control Act. As a result, \nwhile the short-term effects of these arbitrary budget caps are bad \nenough, the long-term harm they are doing is arguably worse. Our \nmilitary is raiding its own future readiness, modernization, and \nresearch and development spending to pay its present bills and meet \npresent needs. We are not making the kinds of investments in\n\n[[Page S8134]]\n\nour future warfighting capability to remain technologically superior to \nadversaries that are closing the gap with us.\n  What is even more troubling is that even as we made these reductions, \nour national security and defense strategies have stayed essentially \nthe same. Day-to-day requirements for the military have not been \nreduced to match declining budgets. Independent analysis by defense \nexperts at places such as the Center for Strategic and Budgetary \nAssessments and the RAND Corporation have all pointed out that current \nbudget levels and even the President's budget are insufficient to pay \nfor our national security strategy given the current threat \nenvironment.\n  All of this applies equally to our other national security agencies \nbeyond the Department of Defense. Protecting our Nation is not just the \njob of the U.S. military; it also depends on a strong and properly \nresourced intelligence community, Federal law enforcement, and homeland \nsecurity agencies, and a diplomatic presence overseas that can project \nAmerican leadership and resolve problems before they become threats to \nour people and our interests. Yet these other national security \nagencies have been dealing with the same fiscal challenges under the \nsame worsening threat environment and with the same effects as our \nmilitary. Not just our military, but the NSA, the CIA, the State \nDepartment, FBI--all of these agencies are unable to function \neffectively because of the effects of these budget cuts.\n  To continue on this way, especially after Paris, is not only absurd, \nit is dangerous. If we are serious about national security, if we are \nserious about meeting our highest constitutional responsibility of \nproviding for the common defense, and if we are serious about heeding \nthe frequent and urgent warnings of our Nation's most respected \nnational security and foreign policy leaders, then we must change \ncourse immediately. We cannot continue to prioritize deficit reduction \nover national defense, allowing arbitrary budget caps to determine our \nnational security needs.\n  This process ought to be simple. We must identify what we need to be \nsafe, define those requirements clearly, and provide budgets to \nresource them. The two can't be disconnected. If we choose not to fight \nISIL or deter Russian aggression in Europe or uphold freedom of the \nseas in Asia, then we can justify the cuts to the budget. But neither \nthe Congress nor the administration wants to do that, nor should we. \nThe only responsible thing to do, then, is to spend the money that is \nnecessary to meet the national security requirements we have set for \nourselves. And with the threats to our homeland growing closer, we \ncan't afford to delay any longer.\n  That is why I have introduced commonsense legislation that is long \noverdue. Its goal is simple: to exempt national security spending from \nsequestration under the Budget Control Act. This exemption would not \njust apply to the Department of Defense; it would also include the \nsecurity-related functions of our intelligence agencies, the Department \nof Homeland Security, the State Department, and the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration. By doing so, we will enable the President and \nCongress to build national security budgets based on national security \nrequirements instead of arbitrary caps that entail greater risk to our \nNation.\n  I know that some will express concern about the impact of this \nlegislation on national deficits and the debt. I will match my record \nas a fiscal conservative with anybody's. I have spent decades targeting \nwasteful government spending, and I believe we must tackle our debt \nproblem before it overwhelms generations. But we cannot afford to put \nthe lives of our men and women in uniform as well as those of our \ncitizens at greater risk, which everyone--all of our senior military \nleaders--has said we are doing. By holding to these budget caps, we \nare putting the lives of the men and women serving in the military \ntoday at greater risk. Don't we have an obligation to these young men \nand women who are serving in the military in uniform? Just because of \narbitrary caps, are we going to put their lives in greater danger? Of \ncourse the world has become more dangerous. Of course there have been \ntremendous upheavals. And we are asking them to do the job with less \nthan they need in order to do it most effectively and at the very risk \nof their own lives. This is disgraceful. This is disgraceful, that we \nshould neglect the view of every national security expert and every one \nof our uniformed leaders. They have all said the same thing in \ntestimony before the Armed Services Committee.\n\n  I have asked them: Does sequestration and the effects of \nsequestration put the lives of our young men and women in uniform at \ngreater risk?\n  Answer: Yes.\n  History does not repeat itself, but I do remember in the 1970s when \nwe slashed defense spending and the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army \ncame over and said we had a hollow Army. We are now not approaching the \nhollow Army, but we certainly are approaching a point where we are \nunable to meet the new challenges that I just articulated in these \ncomments, and we are putting the lives of the men and women in the \nmilitary in greater danger. That is not what we are supposed to be all \nabout.\n  We can't persist with the illusion that we will somehow balance the \nFederal budget and meaningfully cut the debt on the back of \ndiscretionary spending alone. Our defense and national security budgets \nare not the root of our spending problem. The real problem is rising \nentitlement costs and mandatory spending.\n  A Heritage Foundation report found that 85 percent of projected \ngrowth and spending is due to entitlement programs and interest on the \ndebt. Reducing our debt will only be possible with real entitlement \nreform. Cuts to discretionary spending will not have a major long-term \nimpact, but for years we have gone to that well because it is \npolitically easier than reforming entitlement programs.\n  So the major sources of the debt are three: Medicare, Social \nSecurity, and interest on the debt. That is the problem we face. So we \nenacted arbitrary cuts on our Nation's national security capabilities \nin somehow trying to convince people that therefore we will reduce the \ndebt. That is a lie. We don't have the guts to stand up here and do the \nright thing, which is entitlement reform. Instead, we continue on this \nmindless sequestration--mindless because it is a meat ax.\n  I am happy to say that we have identified $11 billion in this \nNational Defense Authorization Act. As chairman of the committee, I \nhave worked with Members on both sides of the aisle. We have identified \n$11 billion in savings and lots more to come. We can trim from the \ndefense budget a lot of the waste and inefficiencies that are there, \nbut to do it with a meat ax is the wrong way to do it. I encourage \nother committees to use their authorization processes to reform \ngovernment and eliminate wasteful spending. However, to purposefully \nshortchange our national security agencies is obviously penny-wise and \npound-foolish.\n  Just last week, all of us went home and celebrated Veterans Day. \nThere is probably not an event that is quite like it in all of the \nthings we do in this Nation. To spend time with our veterans and to see \nour Nation honor them is a remarkable experience and incredibly \nuplifting. It seems to me that year after year, there are more and more \nAmericans who are applauding and appreciating the service and sacrifice \nof our veterans. We are reminded that what makes America great is the \nmen and women who serve it, and those who have served we honor. These \nvolunteers sacrifice their personal comfort, their families, and \nsometimes their lives for this country. They always put the mission \nfirst, and it is time we do the same. We must fully resource national \nsecurity so that those who work to keep us safe day in and day out have \nwhat they need to accomplish what we have asked of them. If their \nmission is worth the ultimate sacrifice, what other policy agenda could \nbe more important?\n  These young men and women are putting their lives on the line as we \nspeak, and what are we doing? We are mindlessly cutting defense and \ntheir ability to defend this Nation and themselves. It is a shameful \nchapter. It is a shameful chapter and an abrogation of our \nresponsibilities to these men and women.\n  So the next time Members are home in their home States and they meet \nthese men and women in uniform and they support the sequestration, look \nthe other way because they are not taking care of those men and women \nwho are willing to sacrifice.\n\n[[Page S8135]]\n\n  I am sorry if my words sound harsh, but in this world we are in \ntoday, to continue this mindless sequestration is an abrogation of our \nresponsibility as their elected leaders.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on the \nBudget be discharged from further consideration of S. 2303 and the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration; I further ask consent \nthat the bill be read a third time and passed and the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  What this is, for the benefit of my colleagues, is the elimination of \nsequestration for not only defense but all of our national security \nrequirements and agencies of government that are suffering under this \nmindless sequestration.\n  I see my colleague from Rhode Island is going to object. All I can \nsay to my colleague from Rhode Island is I am deeply, deeply, deeply \ndisappointed in his objecting to doing the right thing for the men and \nwomen who are serving in the military.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, reserving my right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I think Chairman McCain is headed in exactly the right \ndirection, which is trying to eliminate sequestration. The real answer \nis to repeal the Budget Control Act because the scope of relief offered \nby the chairman is certainly broader than just the Department of \nDefense, but it doesn't include all the agencies that actually protect \nus and interfere with our opponents. For example, the Department of \nTreasury, in terms of trying to suppress terrorist financing, would be \nsubject to sequestration in this legislation; the CDC would be subject \nto sequestration, even if there were a biological attack--and \nunfortunately our opponents, particularly terrorists, have talked about \nsuch an attack.\n\n  It is not really the issue of sequestration; it is limiting the scope \nof relief. I think we should, as my colleague suggests, stand up and \nsay we can repeal the BCA. Then we can talk about budgeting according \nto the demands, according to our total national security picture.\n  Longer term, national security in this country is certainly bolstered \nimmediately by the Department of Defense, Department of Treasury, State \nDepartment, et cetera; but without education, without many other \nefforts in our government, we will not be able to truly defend the \nNation. So for that reason, Mr. President, I with great reluctance \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven).

Mr. President, 7 years ago, Wall Street came closer to \nimploding than at any other time since the Great Depression. Wall \nStreet had stacked the deck for themselves and against consumers by \nturning a banking system that in the past had helped families and \nbusinesses build their prosperity into a casino for Wall Street's own \nbig bets. When things went badly, taxpayers were left holding the bag.\n  While our economy has slowly returned, the memory of the crisis is \nfresh in the minds of American families--millions of families who lost \ntheir jobs, millions of families who lost their homes, millions of \nfamilies who lost their retirement savings.\n  For this reason, there is broad bipartisan support across America for \nnot allowing the return of the Wall Street casino, with 9 in 10 likely \nvoters saying it is important to ensure they are safe and fair for \nconsumers and that they are designed to build the success of consumers.\n  Through the Wall Street reform bill, we ended predatory home lending \npractices. We stopped teaser rates that then had exploding interest \nloans. These loans went from 3 or 4 percent in the beginning, and then, \nafter 2 years, would turn into 9 percent or 10 percent, ensuring that \nthe family was unable to make their payments. We stopped the kickbacks \nthat went to loan originators to steer their unsuspecting home-buyer \nclients into high-cost loans. We stopped the liar loans designed to \nfail just after originators got their commissions. In short, we \nrestored home ownership and home loans as a powerful, wealth-building \ntool for the middle class in America. Indeed, over the course of the \npost-World War II history, home ownership has been the most significant \nwealth builder for the middle class. Wall Street turned it into a \npredatory, wealth-stripping experience, and we restored it to ensure \nthe financial success of working families.\n  We ensured that banks and financial institutions have skin in the \ngame, mandating they retain risk in the products they sell. We \nestablished the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, to \nprevent scams from stripping wealth from our working families.\n  Before we established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, \nconsumer protection was handled by the Federal Reserve. The Federal \nReserve also handled monetary policy. Monetary policy was much more \nexciting, and perhaps they thought it was more up to their \nsophisticated educations. They took consumer protection and put it in \nthe basement of the Federal Reserve, and they locked it up and then \nthrew away the key. They never honored their responsibilities for \nconsumer protection, allowing all of these predatory practices that we \nhad to end through the Dodd-Frank legislation.\n  To date, the CFPB has returned more than $11 billion to 25 million \nwronged consumers. That is a pretty impressive record. Show me \nsomething else that has brought a little bit of justice and a lot of \nfinancial restitution to 25 million wronged American citizens.\n  The commonsense reforms we established laid the groundwork for a \nfinancial system that is not premised on elevating quarterly profit \nmargins on Wall Street. It is not about the size of bonuses on Wall \nStreet but is instead about providing a foundation for our businesses \nand families to thrive financially. That is building the future \nprosperity of America.\n  Nobody wants to repeat the financial collapse, the bailouts, and the \neconomic recession. We spent 6 years digging out of the hole that was \ncreated. But despite the fact that to return to this model would be so \ndestructive to American families, there are at this very moment \ncolleagues of mine gathering in rooms in the Senate and in the House \nwho are preparing policy riders to return us back to those dark days. \nThey want to add policy riders to the financial year 2016 \nappropriations bills designed to turn back these improvements that \nrestored home ownership for American families, that restored financial \nsystems for small businesses. I wholeheartedly oppose attaching these \npolicy riders to the spending bills. And the American people don't like \nit either.\n  So what is going on? One conversation is to design policy riders to \nreverse the improvements we made in mortgage guidelines, to ensure that \nmortgages did build the wealth of the middle class instead of preying \non the middle class.\n  Second, there are conversations going on about policy riders designed \nto weaken the tools and authorities of the Financial Stability \nOversight Council, or FSOC. During 2002, 2007, 2008, we didn't have \nanyone systemically looking at weaknesses in the system. I remember \nlooking at a chart that laid out the vast growth in predatory teaser \nrate loans that started in 2003. As that chart surged upwards for those \nloans as a percent of all loans done in America, the number of prime \nloans came down just as dramatically. We now understand why. The \noriginators were telling their customers: You don't want this prime \nloan--this low-interest rate locked in for 30 years. You want this \nteaser rate loan. You get a little bit of a lower rate in the \nbeginning.\n  They never explained to their customer that their interest rate was \ngoing to go up dramatically just 2 years later to a level they wouldn't \nbe able to afford, and yet that originator was getting undisclosed \nkickbacks.\n  I say this because had there been an FSOC in place, we would have \nbeen reviewing that chart and saying: Wait; what is going wrong? From \n2003 to 2005, we have this huge surge in predatory lending. Why do we \nhave this huge collapse of prime lending?\n  They would have talked to the Wall Street Journal. The Wall Street \nJournal ran an article, an analysis, a study that looked at this and \nvirtually said that all those folks who are being steered into these \nsubprime loans qualified for prime loans. This is the essence of a \npredatory practice. An FSOC would have seen that and said that \nsomething needs to be done. That is why we have it--to look at bubbles \nor possible bubbles in our economy or practices in our economy that are \ngoing to cause a future collapse and to remedy these problems before \nthey happen. Despite that, we have folks right now trying to undo the \ncreation of the FSOC or disable it from being able to do its job.\n  There is another group that is gathering to try to undermine the \nsuccess or ability of having a watchdog--the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau--on the beat, ending predatory loan practices from \nhere forward.\n  They can't just go through statute, because as soon as they outlaw \nthis practice over here, another one develops over here. There are \nnewly invented strategies to continuously find new ways to turn solid, \nsuccessful financial products into predatory products--misleading \nproducts, gouging products, products that explode in a couple years \nthat consumers are not fully informed on. So we have to have a \ncommission to be able to stop those practices.\n  It is the same thing we have in consumer products. We don't have \ndetailed legislation that says: You can't design a toaster with this, \nthis, this, and this. Instead, we have a Consumer Product Safety \nCommission that looks at it and says: These new products are unsafe, \nand for these reasons they can't be allowed. New products come in, they \nget examined, and they make sure we continue to have safe products. It \nshould be the same for our financial products.\n\n[[Page S8137]]\n\n  The CFPB has done an extraordinary job ending predatory practices and \nreturning funds to ordinary working families. If you want working \nfamilies to fail, then allow predatory products. If you want them to \nsucceed, if you have a vision for America that involves the success of \nfamilies, then let's end these financial wealth-stripping predatory \npractices. That means the CFPB has to be able to do its job. So it \nwould be 100 percent the wrong direction to put these policy riders in \nthe dark of night to dismantle the Dodd-Frank protections on these \nspending bills.\n  The Senate Democratic caucus is going to keep fighting for our \nAmerican families. We are going to keep fighting for our American \nconsumers. We are going to keep fighting for the success of individuals \nacross this country and to ensure that the Wall Street casino stays \nclosed.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 3 short weeks ago, many of us, many of my \ncolleagues enthusiastically welcomed the budget agreement reached \nbetween the White House and congressional leaders of both parties. It \nwas a budget agreement that put aside the short-term shutdown politics \nand gave us the opportunity to finally give American families and \nbusinesses the longer term economic certainty they need and deserve. It \nwas a budget agreement that made balanced increases in both defense and \nnondefense discretionary spending--increases that were fully paid for. \nIt was a budget agreement that was negotiated in good faith by \nRepublican and Democratic leadership and the White House. It was a \npreview of what we might be able to accomplish if we put the politics \nof the moment, the partisan politics of the 2016 campaign, and other \nissues aside and actually focus on getting some things done.\n  Barely 3 weeks later, barely 3 weeks since bipartisan majorities \napproved the agreement in both letter and spirit, here we are again \nstaring down a potential government shutdown we all thought we had \navoided because there was some insistence here--some colleagues who are \ninsisting on poisoning the appropriations bills with policy riders \nwhich they know are opposed and which would undermine the ability of \nthe Federal Government to function.\n  Let's be clear. The policy riders we are discussing, the policy \nriders I am objecting to don't represent a good-faith policy debate. \nThese are predominantly partisan political priorities that Republicans \nare otherwise unwilling to bring to the floor of this Chamber because \nthey know they aren't popular with the American people. For example, in \nmy view, we shouldn't be using the appropriations process to try to \ndismantle or sideline the Environmental Protection Agency and put clean \nair, clean water, and climate action at risk. If the majority chooses \nto make devesting cuts to Planned Parenthood, which more than 8,000 \nresidents of my home State of Delaware rely on for health care and \nfamily planning, I think my colleagues should bring it to the floor in \na separate bill so the American people know that is the focus of the \nlegislation.\n  I join my colleagues today to make it clear that we are not going to \nuse the appropriations process to pass narrow ideological riders that \nwould not otherwise have been considered on this floor and have not \nmade it through the appropriate process.\n  As the ranking member of the Appropriations financial services \nsubcommittee, I want to be clear that it is particularly unacceptable \nto me to use the appropriations process to roll back many of the \ncritical Wall Street reforms put in place over 5 years ago in response \nto the financial crisis that was devastating to the economy, to \nfamilies, and to businesses throughout Delaware and the country. If the \nmajority wants to bring a bill to the floor that rolls back some of the \nkey consumer protections put in place in the Dodd-Frank bill, then \nlet's have that debate. Frankly, it is a debate we at times have been \nengaged in on large- and small-scale issues.\n  The problem for my colleagues is that they don't have enough support \nin the Senate to pass these changes in a stand-alone bill. That is why \nthey have taken the troubling step of jamming a 200-page bill--an \nentire banking bill loaded with controversial riders--right into a \nmust-pass, last-minute government funding bill.\n  I ask my colleagues--it is my hope and my expectation that many of my \nRepublican colleagues would say that I give honest and thorough \nconsideration to new policy proposals, even ones I am disinclined to \nagree with. I am open to discussing ways to improve existing reforms so \nwe don't unfairly burden, for example, small community banks that \nweren't responsible for the financial crisis. No legislation is \nperfect, but compromising and improving is what authorizing bills and \npolicymaking bills are all about. But the examples I referenced are a \nfew of many areas that should not be jammed into an appropriations bill \nat the last minute without being fully and carefully vetted by the \nauthorizing committee.\n  It would be difficult for me today to address all the different \npolicy riders that are in the various pieces of the appropriations \nbills currently under consideration. They range from education, to \nhealth, labor, natural resources, environment, civil rights, justice, \nhousing, immigration, voting rights, telecommunications, to name just a \nfew.\n  Our budgets--how we spend the taxpayers' dollars--are a reflection of \nour priorities. But there is a substantial difference between using the \nappropriations process to support a specific program, department, or \nFederal activity and using it to sneak around the legislative process \nand to jam new, big changes into last-minute appropriations bills.\n  Instead of manufacturing another crisis here in the days ahead, \ninstead of having to look over the cliff of a government shutdown, \nlet's get back to regular order, fulfill our responsibility to \nresponsibly fund the government, and separately engage in positive \ndiscussions about how we can make the policy changes we need to ensure \nthat our economy is competitive, that our country is innovative, and \nthat our society continues to benefit from the work we all do here \ntogether.\n  Paul Ryan has barely had time to set up his new office and settle \ninto his new role and we are already back in crisis mode, walking back \nan agreement that, as I said at the outset, a majority of this Congress \nsupported and a majority of America cheered.\n  I urge my colleagues to put the middle class and the stability and \nfuture of our economy ahead of partisan politics. Let's negotiate a \nclean and honest, a clear omnibus spending bill that is free of poison \npill policy riders that only serve to divide this body and to unite \nspecial interests who at times work against us.\n  With that, I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor this afternoon \nto speak on an energy-related topic--one that I think the Presiding \nOfficer and many will have interest in--and that is the issue of \ninnovation within the energy sector.\n  Before I speak on energy, I wish to bring up an issue that has come \nabout today with the announcement coming out of the Food and Drug \nAdministration that they have approved an application for what they \nhave called AquAdvantage salmon.\n  This is actually quite disturbing news to any of us who care about \nour wild species of salmon, our healthy wild stocks, and who are \nproponents of good amounts of fresh seafood in our diets, knowing that \nnutritionally it is a pretty extraordinary source of omega-3 fatty \nacids and good-for-you nutrients.\n\n[[Page S8138]]\n\n  We have been trying to get the FDA to make good on their commitment \nto make sure that pregnant women and nursing mothers know and \nunderstand the guidelines out there in terms of what is safe to consume \nwhen it comes to fish because, again, when we are looking for that \ngood, nutritious food source, it is pretty tough to beat Mother Nature. \nYet, that is exactly what this approval from the FDA is trying to do, \nwhich is, effectively, not only trying to beat Mother Nature but \nmessing with Mother Nature.\n  Again, as one who believes that the real thing is the best thing for \nour families, the best thing to serve at the dinner table, I find it \nvery troubling. In fact, I am spitting mad today. I have calmed down a \nlot since I received this news this morning, but I can tell my \ncolleagues that people back home are going to be mad about this for a \nlong time.\n  For about 5 years now, the FDA has been considering this application \nfor this genetically engineered salmon. Again, they are giving it a \npretty nice name, calling it the AquAdvantage, that somehow or another \nthis gives an advantage to the salmon. Well, it does. What it does is \nallow this genetically engineered fish--I don't even know that I want \nto call it a fish--this genetically engineered organism to grow twice \nas fast as any other salmon in the water.\n  So how does it get to grow twice as fast? Well, it doesn't happen \nnaturally. It is not the way Mother Nature orders it. What they do is \nthey start messing with it. This process, which has now been approved \nby the FDA, is a process that splices genetic material from a Chinook \nsalmon, a king salmon, and it takes that genetic material and it \nintegrates it with a pout fish and an Atlantic salmon. People might \nknow about an Atlantic salmon, a farmed salmon. What is an ocean pout? \nLet me show my colleagues what an ocean pout is. An ocean pout is \nbasically this eel-type of bottom fish. Those of my colleagues who know \ntheir salmon know about the Chinooks, the sockeyes, and the chums, and \nthey know that this isn't anything close to a salmon, whether it is a \nwild Alaskan salmon or whether it is a farmed salmon. This is an eel. \nWe are taking a splice from this, and we are taking a splice from an \nAtlantic salmon, and we are basically splicing this with a Chinook \nsalmon. The resulting organism, this company claims, is going to grow \nto the size of an Alaskan king salmon in a shorter period of time than \nthat found in nature. Freaky.\n  We call this combination ``Frankenfish'' because it is just not \nright. It is just not right. It disturbs me, quite honestly, that the \nFDA would sign off on the approval of a genetically engineered animal \ndesigned for human consumption. This is the first time ever.\n  The FDA is saying this is going to be safe: We are going to make sure \nit is safe. We are going to make sure that it doesn't interbreed with \nthe wild stocks, and thus perhaps destroy them. We are going to make \nsure that it doesn't mix with them so that it doesn't transmit disease. \nWe are going to make sure that it is separated so that it doesn't eat \nup all of the wild sources available for our Alaskan salmon.\n  They are going to make sure, apparently by doing this, because they \nare saying that with this approval, these AquAdvantage salmon can only \nbe raised in land-based, contained hatchery tanks in two specific \nfacilities in Canada and in Panama. We should all feel safer, I guess, \nbecause it is all going to be in Canada and Panama. There are no other \nlocations under this application in the United States or elsewhere that \nare authorized to do this. Somehow or other, the FDA says they are \ngoing to maintain regulatory oversight over the production and the \nfacilities, and they are going to conduct inspections to confirm that \nadequate physical containment measures remain in place. They will be \nworking with the Canadian and Panamanian governments to be conducting \ninspections. Really? Do I feel safer about making sure that our wild \nand healthy stocks are going to be not infiltrated by the Frankenfish, \nby these genetically engineered organisms designed for human \nconsumption, designed to grow twice as fast to get to the size of a \nking salmon, so that a company can derive the benefit of selling more \nof this fish.\n  Well, I am saying FDA should never have approved this--never have \napproved this. The fact is that the Alaska delegation, as well as \nmembers of other delegations in this body and on the other side, have \npounded their fists for quite some time against this measure through \nthe FDA. They know full well how much we object to it. At 7:55 last \nnight my assistant got an email from the FDA saying that commissioner \nwould like to talk to me about some imminent news. By the time the \nmorning came around, the imminent news was already made public. \nAlaskans were already aware that this approval from FDA had come forth. \nIt was not only me; it is my understanding that the head of the \nagriculture appropriations subcommittee--I met with him yesterday--\ndidn't get a heads-up about it. The nominee was before us yesterday in \nthe HELP Committee, and I actually put two questions to him about \nseafood. There was no heads-up that this was coming our way, just kind \nof, boom, lay it on the table.\n  I have to tell my colleagues, we have made no bones about the fact \nthat this is wrong not only for Alaska and our wild stocks, it is wrong \nfor our salmon stocks around the country, and it is something I am \ngoing to continue to fight.\n  I am not sure as we deal with this news today if we can get the FDA \nto reverse this. I am going to keep working on it. But at a bare \nminimum, people around this country need to know what they are serving \ntheir families when it comes to seafood. If this is going to be allowed \ninto the markets, if it is going to be allowed on restaurant menus, \nthen it needs to be labeled as such.\n  The FDA has said there will be draft guidance on voluntary labeling \nindicating whether food has or has not been derived from GE Atlantic \nsalmon. So, basically, if you want to put a label on that says this is \na fake fish, a fake salmon, you can go ahead, but you don't have to. It \nis only voluntary.\n  That is not good enough for this mom. That is not good enough for \nmost who care about what their families are eating. So we are going to \ncontinue to press for mandatory labeling if the FDA is going to \napprove--wrongheadedly, in my mind--this genetically engineered fake \nfish for human consumption. They darn well better agree that labeling \nwill be required because I am not going to eat it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8138-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8138-S8140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ENERGY INNOVATION\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me switch to a better topic, and \nthat is one I know the Presiding Officer cares a great deal about; that \nis, the issue of energy and the importance of energy to our Nation's \neconomy and to our overall health.\n  I have come to this floor many times to highlight what I believe are \nthe shortsighted, anti-energy decisions that we have seen come from \nthis administration. Whether we are talking about the Keystone XL \nPipeline, more than 7 years of delay and the eventual rejection of that \ninfrastructure, whether it is the burdensome rules coming out of the \nEPA that raise the energy costs or whether it is the actions from the \nDepartment of Interior that seek to halt resource development in \nFederal areas, this administration has rarely ever worked with us to \npromote responsible energy, mineral, and timber development.\n  In Alaska this ever-shifting Federal regulatory environment played a \nvery key role in the recent decision by Shell to abandon 7 years of \nwork and $7 billion of investment in the offshore Arctic. It was just \nthis week we received word that another company, looking again at low \noil prices but seeing this same deteriorating regulatory environment, \ndecided to follow suit, and they are seeking to return their leases in \nthe offshore.\n  The Obama administration has also canceled offshore lease sales in \nthe State. It has hamstrung projects in our National Petroleum Reserve, \nwhich we absolutely need if we are ever going to refill our Trans-\nAlaska Pipeline. It has placed half of the National Petroleum Reserve \noff-limits, even though it was specifically designated for development. \nOf course we all know the situation in ANWR. This administration is \ntrying to lock away 10 billion barrels of oil in the nonwilderness \nportion of\n\n[[Page S8139]]\n\nANWR, which could be safely produced with development of just 0.01 \npercent of its surface area. The list goes on and on.\n  I told you I was going to move to more promising and more uplifting \nsubjects than Frankenfish and what the administration has done to \nsuppress our ability to access our energy resources. I do want to move \nto another area because I think this is an area and a focus that I \nwould like to believe we can find support, not only working with the \nadministration but working with colleagues and building some \npartnerships on both the public and the private side. This is in the \narea of energy innovation, where I believe there is greater hope for \nworking together with this administration to make a real difference for \nour Nation. Innovation holds tremendous promise, not just for us as \npolicymakers but also in terms of long-lasting benefits that it can \ndeliver for not only the United States but around the world.\n  Innovation doesn't require more complex and costly regulations. It \ndoesn't need to choose winners or losers in the energy sector. Instead, \ninnovation offers a chance at common ground that will deliver results \nand help power our Nation for decades to come. No matter your \nmotivation for seeking cleaner and more affordable energy, we should \nall be able to agree that without innovation--without pushing every day \nfor that greater technology--our energy future and our economic \nprosperity are hardly secure.\n  The good news for us in this country is that the United States is the \nglobal leader in innovation. We hear this is a race and that America is \nfalling behind, but I would contend that our strength and skill are \nunmatched. Our innovation, ideas, inventions and our products and \nprocesses have changed history and in turn changed the world.\n  The United States has led the way in research and development that \nhas changed our lives and lives across the world for the better. Among \nFederal agencies, the Department of Energy, in particular, has played \nan important role in these efforts, and I think they can make even \ngreater contributions, especially when it comes to vital basic \nresearch.\n  The DOE is hardly perfect. Many of us would make changes to the scope \nof its mission and improve its priorities if we were given the chance, \nbut given that, the Department has also sparked innovation that has \nhelped transform the global energy landscape. The most successful \ninnovations give us more energy, reduce the amount of energy we use, as \nwell as lower the cost we pay for energy. I think as we move forward we \nshould keep those goals in focus and we will improve. Increasing access \nto energy, making it more affordable, and improving its environmental \nperformance are the key factors that drive our innovation policy.\n  Those of us on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee are always \ntalking about innovation and how best to promote it through reasonable \nFederal policies. We understand how critical it is to our Nation's \nfuture. That is why energy and the innovation part of energy is a key \npart of our broad bipartisan Energy bill that we reported through the \nenergy committee by a vote of 18 to 4 back in July.\n  The bill also includes legislation that is authored by Senator \nAlexander to renew some of the energy-related portions of the America \nCOMPETES Act. We have agreed to authorize a 4-percent increase in \nfunding for basic energy research each year, which I think puts us on a \nresponsible path to double our Nation's commitment to it.\n  It is basic research that is at the heart of the mission of our \nsystem of national labs and also many of our research universities. The \nmen and women in the research sector are pushing to make that \nfundamental discovery--to conduct the basic research that could find \nthe next big thing for energy. This type of research should be a \npriority for us, and the Department of Energy should be committed to \nhelping new discoveries transition to market viability.\n  Within this bipartisan bill we also reauthorize the ARPA-E Program, \nwhich solicits ideas that are too early for private sector investment \nbut with bridge funding has the opportunity to transform the energy \nsector. ARPA-E is a true hands-on program that ensures awardees meet \nmilestones toward the goal of market viability. ARPA-E hasn't been \naround that long, but it has been promoting some good ideas, strong \nideas, and producing some good results.\n\n  Our bill also supports innovation in a number of other areas; \nspecifically, energy efficiency, energy storage, and distribution; in \nvehicles it provides for hybrid microgrid systems; and for recycling, \nfor geothermal power, for marine hydrokinetic, and for many other \ndeveloping technologies.\n  Recently, we have also seen more reports of private individuals and \ncompanies who plan to invest in energy technologies with the potential \nto transform the way energy is produced, delivered, and consumed. This, \ntoo, will help drive energy innovation in this country.\n  Back in July, Bill Gates announced his personal commitment to invest \n$1 billion over 5 years to advance new energy technologies. He made \nthat commitment based on his recognition that currently available \nenergy options will not allow the world to achieve its much discussed \nclimate goals in a way that also works to reduce the costs for people \nusing energy. It is one thing to be working toward climate goals, but \nin doing so if all that we do is increase the cost to the consumer, \nthat doesn't help us. His focus is as much on clean air and clean water \nas it is on lifting people around the world out of poverty.\n  I had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Gates several weeks ago and \nlook forward to seeing what comes out of his commitment. I am also \nfollowing the possibilities that are coming out of venture capital and \nother private investments. I think these efforts augment the Federal \nresearch and development dollars, in many cases ensuring that promising \ntechnologies are not just set up on a shelf somewhere but are pursued \nto a successful and productive result.\n  Now you have heard me say it on the floor many times, but we in the \nState of Alaska are desperate to see energy innovation. Energy prices \nin many parts of Alaska are much higher than the prices paid by our \nfriends in the lower 48. In some communities in Alaska it costs 40 to \n50 cents a kilowatt hour for electricity. In certain parts of the \nState, over half of a family's budget goes just toward energy to keep \nwarm and keep the lights on. Can you imagine what that means when over \nhalf of your family's budget--half of your income--is used just to keep \nyour lights on and keep yourself warm? It doesn't leave a lot for \nanything else, such as educating your kids, feeding them or for health \ncare. It is a huge issue for us. There are so many things that \ncontribute to the high cost of energy. It is the big geography and the \nlack of a comprehensive and interconnected energy delivery system. We \nhave tremendous energy potential in the State of Alaska, and \nunfortunately many of our communities are just not powered by it. We \nhave natural gas in abundance, and yet our second largest community in \nAlaska doesn't have access to natural gas. We are trying to get it \nthere, but that is our current reality.\n  Many communities in rural Alaska still rely on diesel to generate \ntheir power. Delivering the diesel, whether it is moving it up river by \nbarge or flying it in by plane is hugely expensive. It is not \nsustainable. Innovation is essential to moving these rural \ncommunities--and even the not so rural communities--off diesel and onto \nmore sustainable, locally generated, and less expensive energy systems.\n  What we are doing in Alaska is bringing some very innovative \ntechnologies to communities around the State through a variety of \nState-run programs that are largely financed by the revenues that are \nderived from our oil production. Think about that. We are a State that \nderives most of our revenues and income from oil. We are taking a \nnonrenewable energy source, taking the revenues from that and helping \nto facilitate our renewable resources--our resources that will be there \nfor well into the future. These programs need to be financed. We are \ndoing so much of it from our oil production. Responsible development of \nAlaska's resources has enabled our State to take the necessary steps to \nimprove energy delivery in our remote communities. In many ways this is \nalmost like a virtuous cycle, where current energy production helps \nfund the next generation of energy production and where we harness\n\n[[Page S8140]]\n\ntoday's energy to significantly improve the lives of our people.\n  What we are seeing in the State are several communities working with \nvarious State agencies to integrate wind, solar, and geothermal into \ntheir electricity delivery system in an effort to displace the power \nthat is normally generated from expensive diesel. It is the microgrids \nthat we are seeing that are coming to be found as the solution. We are \nhome to more microgrids in the State of Alaska than any other State out \nthere. That is largely because they are the only option for us. They \nare the only option for many of our communities that lie far outside \nany regional transmission grid. We have transmission grids in what we \ncall the Railbelt area. But it is difficult when you have large \ngeography and small population numbers. So you are going to have to \nfigure out how you can literally power one village at a time or maybe \nyou get lucky and you are able to cluster a few.\n\n  But knowing what, for instance, the island of Kodiak has done with \nbeing able to power a major seafood-producing port through wind, \ncombined with their hydro resources and also utilizing batteries--that \narea in Kodiak is almost 100 percent powered by renewable resources. \nThis, again, is one of the major seafood-producing ports not only in \nthe State but in the country. So the energy that is needed for those \nprocesses is coming to us by renewable energy sources--almost 100 \npercent. The irony--and we were able to talk about this briefly in the \nenergy committee this morning--is that in order to meet increased \ndemand in Kodiak, they are going to need to expand one of their hydro \nfacilities, Terror Lake, and so they have asked for assistance with \nthat. If they cannot get the expansion, which some are objecting to \nbecause they don't want to see an expansion of that dam, what will \nhappen? You go back to diesel. You go back to diesel. That is not the \nanswer here.\n  So what we have been doing with pioneering of our microgrids is \nsomething that I think provides States and the Federal Government with \nample opportunities to conduct research and develop solutions to better \nintegrate renewable technologies into these microgrids. In order for \nrenewable technologies to be effective in the State, innovative \nresearch and development is required, and I think the result of those \nefforts has made a dramatic difference in many communities.\n  Bringing renewables online in remote communities like Kodiak has \ndisplaced hundreds of thousands of gallons of diesel fuel, not only \nsaving the people who live there hundreds of thousands of dollars but \nresulting in a cleaner environment overall.\n  I do think it is exciting to think about what a difference future \ninnovations in renewable technologies and energy storage could mean for \ncommunities not only in a place like Alaska but really around our \ncountry and around the world. Whether it is through Federal research \nand development, whether it is through our State programs that are \nassisting our private capital, promoting innovation is a clear path to \nlower energy costs and a future with cleaner water and cleaner air.\n  We might not agree on every energy policy that comes to this Chamber, \nbut I hope we can all agree that energy innovation is one key to \nensuring our economic growth, our national security, as well as our \ninternational competitiveness. I look forward to working with \ncolleagues in all of these areas.\n  With that, I see that my friend and colleague from Kansas--a \ngentleman who is always filled with thanksgiving and who has shared \nthat with many of us today--is here on the floor, and so I will yield \nat this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska for her kind comments, her advice, and her help on several \nimportant issues we have worked on together. I hope she enjoyed the \nThanksgiving meal we had--I guess it is called the Thursday lunch \nbunch.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8140-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8140-S8141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST FRANCE AND GUANTANAMO BAY DETAINEES\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the French \nGovernment for taking aggressive and appropriate action to arrest and \nkill the terrorists responsible for last Friday's vicious attack in \nParis that resulted in 129 killed and over 300 wounded. We all pray for \nthe full recovery of those wounded and note that everywhere within our \ncountry we see the American flag at half staff, along with many \ndisplaying the flag of our ally France.\n  The good news today is that the mastermind of several terrorist plots \nand the plot that killed so many last Friday is dead. Abdelhamid \nAbaaoud is dead in the same fashion as his victims. So be it. Viva la \nFrance! Continuer le combat! Keep up the fight.\n  As our Nation memorializes those who perished in France, it is the \nabsolute wrong time for President Obama and this administration to be \nputting forth a plan to relocate Guantanamo detainees to the U.S. \nmainland--the absolute wrong time.\n  Now we learn that the administration has delayed the much-publicized \nbut secret plan to close Guantanamo and bring terrorists to the United \nStates. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, ``I don't have any \nadditional guidance for you but the plan will come relatively soon.'' \nHe has been saying that for some time. Others think the plan could even \nbe released while the President is gone for the G20 meeting in Turkey. \nAs a personal aside, I might suggest he try to move the terrorists \nthere. The reason President Obama delayed the plan is that we had a \nterrorist attack in France. France has gone to war. The United States \nis on high alert. Apparently he has tossed this decision and public \nannouncement regarding the plan to the Department of Defense, which has \nstated there is nothing imminent. Thank goodness for that.\n  Now, beyond the security threat this poses to our communities in \nKansas and in South Carolina or Colorado--the sites which this \nadministration has surveyed for potential relocation--there has been no \nintelligence assessment regarding the danger of moving enemy combatants \nfrom Guantanamo to the United States. That is amazing. The question is, \nHow can the administration ask Kansans or Coloradans or South \nCarolinians or any Americans to paint a bull's-eye on their community \nwithout providing assurances that moving detainees to the United States \nwill not pose a threat to them or our national security? It seems \nunfathomable, yet this President is proposing to do just that.\n  This President's unending affinity for Executive orders risks \noverriding his Attorney General's view of the law, the advice of those \nat the Department of Defense, especially those close to Fort \nLeavenworth, and military law enforcement. It goes against the will of \nthe Congress, which voted in this body 91 to 3 to maintain a \nprohibition on moving detainees to the mainland.\n  There is absolutely no intelligence to support the move--none. In \nshort, the Senate, Congress, Department of Defense, the Attorney \nGeneral, and the American people have spoken.\n  Yesterday I wrote Department of Defense Secretary Carter to ask \nwhether an intelligence report has been done to support the \nadministration's claims that Guantanamo Bay is a recruiting tool for \nISIS and other terrorist organizations. Some people believe that. \nCommon sense tells you, however, that moving detainees to the mainland \nwould be a greater recruiting tool for ISIS and other terrorist \norganizations. I asked if an assessment showed detainment in the United \nStates would decrease recruiting or did an intelligence product show \nthat national security threats would decrease if any enemy combatants \nare held in the United States. From my discussions with Members of this \nbody on the Senate Intelligence Committee, the answer is that they have \nno comprehensive intelligence assessment.\n\n  Simply put, an assessment regarding the transfers of detainees to the \nmainland has not been done. So I have asked Secretary Carter and the \nDepartment of Defense to ensure that an assessment is completed. To do \notherwise would be irresponsible and reckless. How can the President of \nthe United States allow ISIS to paint a target on those who live near \nwhat would become Gitmo North? No community in the United States wants \nthat label.\n  Fort Leavenworth, in particular, is not a suitable replacement for \nGitmo.\n\n[[Page S8141]]\n\nIt is the intellectual center of the Army. It hosts our Nation's best \nand brightest warfighters at the Command and General Staff College, \nwhich also hosts 100 international officers every year.\n  I want to remind my colleagues just how important Fort Leavenworth's \nmission is to the Army and to our national security and of the risk \nthat this entire mission would be endangered by making it a terrorist \nprison.\n  Fort Leavenworth is home to the U.S. Army's Training and Doctrine \nCommand Combined Arms Center. The Combined Arms Center oversees 13 \nschools, including the Command and General Staff College. Most \nrecently, Fort Leavenworth was named the ``Army University,'' giving \nour intellectual center of the Army an official title. Since 1881, the \nCommand and General Staff College and the Combined Arms Center have \nbeen engaged in the primary mission of preparing the Army and its \nleaders for war.\n  In order to accomplish critical missions, Fort Leavenworth develops \nand integrates Army leader development, doctrine education, lessons \nlearned, functional training, training support, training development, \nand proponent responsibilities in order to support mission command and \nto prepare the Army to successfully conduct unified land operations in \na joint, interagency, intergovernmental, multinational environment--a \nlot of words. It is a big mission, an important mission. To degrade \nFort Leavenworth to a terrorist prison would have ominous repercussions \nto our professional military and the value it serves every American and \nour national security.\n  In addition, we must consider how our allies will respond to having \nenemy combatants so close to their top military leaders training at \nFort Leavenworth. In my effort to reach out to Embassies tied to the \nschool, all have expressed their deep support for the International \nMilitary Officers Division, its value to their military and security, \nand the importance of maintaining the program at Fort Leavenworth. \nThere is every possibility that the countries that participate in the \nCommand and General Staff College would reconsider their participation \ngiven the relocation of terrorists. This would bring negative \nconsequences and represent a terrible detriment to the partnership \nbuilding that takes place during their course work. It would mean a \nloss of international cooperation for American military education and \nour national security.\n  There are so many imperative factors that must be examined at Fort \nLeavenworth, in Colorado, and in South Carolina, factors that we cannot \nignore. The fact that the FBI has nearly 1,000 investigations into ISIS \nactivity within the United States and all 50 States, that ISIS released \na video right after the attacks in Paris stating that the United States \nwas next, and, most important, the fact that we are not dealing with \neveryday criminals--the detainees currently held at Guantanamo Bay are \nenemy combatants, terrorists, individuals with no remorse, and with a \nrecidivism of 30 percent and a strong desire to return to the \nbattlefield. The reality is, these individuals and the organizations \nthey support pose the greatest risk to national security we face today.\n  This administration should not obstruct the will of Congress \nreflecting the voice of the American people, which has prohibited this \nWhite House from transferring detainees from Gitmo to the United States \nevery year since 2009 when we first won this battle. We won the battle \nback then. Why do we have to repeat it now?\n  If the President believes he can act without consequences, he is \nwrong. Again, 91 Senators voted in favor of this prohibition just last \nweek when we passed the National Defense Authorization Act. That is not \njust a majority, that is a veto-proof majority. Article II of the \nConstitution does not provide this President--any President--with the \npower to ignore the law.\n  Just the other night in a tele-townhall meeting, caller after caller \nasked if the President's actions are constitutional. The question was, \nHow can the President do this when Congress has prohibited funding? In \nmy view and that of the President's own Attorney General, if the \nPresident acts by Executive order, he is acting unconstitutionally.\n  I agree with our Founding Fathers such as George Mason who said \n``When the same man, or set of men, holds the sword and the purse, \nthere is an end of liberty'' and James Madison who said it is \n``particularly dangerous to give the keys of the treasury and the \ncommand of the army, into the same hands.''\n  I have mentioned the Congress, the merits of Ft. Leavenworth, the \nConstitution, but what I have not mentioned yet are our servicemembers. \nWe have asked so much of our men and women in uniform over the past 14 \nyears. We have asked them to go into harm's way before every bit of \nequipment was ready. We have asked them to deploy and redeploy with \nalmost no dwell time. We have asked them to extend their stays, and we \nhave put them in more places across the globe than any period in \nhistory. They have done it all without hesitation or complaint because \nwe have the best fighting force in the history of the world.\n  I am unwilling to ask them to take on the challenge of guarding enemy \ncombatants in the United States and put their families at risk for \nharassment, kidnapping, or other tactics homegrown terrorists and \nforeign fighters have used or will use. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nand marines do not live anonymously when their families are stationed \nwith them, as is the case at Ft. Leavenworth.\n  I believe, along with many who have worn the uniform, that the \nattacks in Benghazi may have broken the Nation's promise to never leave \na man in harm's way. On a personal note, when I signed up to enlist in \nthe U.S. Marine Corps, I was told that if I was in harm's way, I would \nnever be left behind. That is what the Marine Corps could do for me. \nThe Corps would have my back either by squad--if I got in harm's way--\nor they would send the platoon or the company or the battalion or the \nregiment or the division or the whole Marine Corps, and I believed \nthat. I still believe it as the senior marine in the Congress. The \nMarines would have my back.\n  It has been the same for generations before me and hopefully \ngenerations after--that is, until now. If we are going to ask our men \nand women to fight ISIS or to put their families at risk, they have to \nknow that we have their backs.\n  Until that bond is restored and we have a President who is willing to \nlead instead of following, our Nation remains vulnerable to every \nterrorist organization and cell in the world. We must put national \nsecurity back as our top priority. It must be our first duty in \nCongress and by the Commander in Chief.\n  I stand on the floor because America's national security is my top \npriority. Bringing Guantanamo Bay detainees to the United States is not \nputting our Nation's security above politics, campaign promises, or \nanything else.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Another way to fight this war on terrorism and to help our \nefforts on fighting ISIS is to actually put the people in place in the \nU.S. Government who help us do that. I came to the floor today to join \nSenator Casey--my friend from Pennsylvania who is\n\n[[Page S8142]]\n\ngoing to mention him too--and to support the nomination of Adam Szubin.\n  Adam Szubin has been delayed for more than 200 days by Republican \nobstruction in the Senate banking committee. Well, who is Adam Szubin? \nAdam Szubin has been nominated--listen to this job--to be the Under \nSecretary for Terrorism and Financial Crimes at the Treasury \nDepartment. This isn't a low-level employee who has nothing to do with \nISIS, fighting ISIS, and fighting terrorism; this is the No. 1 person \nin the Treasury Department--perhaps the No. 1 person in our whole \ngovernment next to the Commander in Chief--who is in the position to \nfight terrorism and fight the kinds of financial crimes that ISIS \ndepends on to fund its operations.\n  We had a hearing. Originally Mr. Szubin worked for the Bush \nadministration for a number of years. He has been serving interim \nduring the Obama administration, but my colleagues on the banking \ncommittee, my colleagues in the Senate, simply have refused to bring \nMr. Szubin to a vote. He served Republican and Democratic \nadministrations in senior positions. There is no question, zero \nquestion, that he is qualified for this position.\n  Let me tell you a little more about him. In 15 years he has \ndistinguished himself as a tough, aggressive enforcer of our Nation's \nsanction laws--not against England or Germany--but against countries \nsuch as Iran, Russia, North Korea, against money launderers, against \nterrorists, against narcotraffickers, the source of a good bit of the \nmoney for terrorist groups such as ISIS.\n  Republicans say the administration is not doing enough; Barack Obama \nwon't stand up. Well, the Republicans are blocking this appointment \nthat would give the President the tools he needs to fight terrorism.\n  Again, more about Mr. Szubin, he earned his undergraduate and law \ndegrees with high honors, he was a Fulbright scholar in Israel before \njoining the Department of Justice. As I said, he served with President \nBush and with President Obama; he was counsel to the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral. He worked as trial attorney on the Terrorism Litigation Task \nForce. He received the Department of Justice Special Commendation Award \nfor his work countering terrorism. For 9 years he directed the \nTreasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Many of us first came to \nknow him then--in both parties--as a thoughtful policymaker and superb \nlawyer. Both parties respected him until Barack Obama nominated him; \nthen Republicans seemed to forget how good he was and how qualified he \nwas.\n  The Anti-Defamation League in this letter described him as an \n``intellectual heavyweight who has worked effectively with global \npartners to amplify the effects of U.S. sanctions.''\n  The United Against Nuclear Iran, a group that strongly opposed the \nPresident's deal with Iran, supports Mr. Szubin to be promoted, to be \nconfirmed by the Senate.\n  Many of my colleagues on the banking committee said: We are not going \nto confirm Szubin because he was for the Iran nuclear deal. Well, he \nworked for the President of the United States, who was negotiating it. \nOf course, he was for it. But are they going to oppose him because they \ndon't like what his boss did or are they opposing him because they \ndon't like much of anything President Obama did?\n  The fact is that group after group, whether they are for the Iran \nnuclear agreement or against it--it really doesn't matter--supports Mr. \nSzubin.\n  His mentor, Bush Under Secretary Stuart Levy--his mentor and his \npredecessor, not immediate predecessor but predecessor--was confirmed \nby the Senate 3 weeks after his nomination. But you know what, both \nparties then with President Bush recognized that you confirm somebody \nwho is central to the war on terrorism. Republicans then believed that.\n  Today, with a Democratic President, even though Adam Szubin is \nsupported by darn near everybody--with his qualifications, with his \nsupport and work in two administrations--they don't want to bring him \nforward for a vote. I am not even sure why. I hear all kinds of \nreasons, none of them really on the record, none of them official, from \nmy colleagues. Oh, they don't like President Obama or this guy must be \na bad guy because President Obama appointed him or he was part of the \ngovernment when the nuclear agreement with Iran was negotiated. All of \nthese reasons simply don't pass a straight-face test. This is a \ncritical national security post, and it needs to be filled permanently \nand quickly.\n  Mr. Szubin heads what is, in effect, Treasury's economic war room. It \nmanages U.S. efforts to combat terrorist financing and fight financial \ncrimes. Again, ISIS, ISIL, gets a good bit of its funding through \nillegal activities like that. If the U.S.--and if Mr. Szubin has the \nfull range of powers that we have given him in the Congress, he can \nhelp us fight that kind of financing, stop that kind of financing for \nISIS.\n  He is helping to lead the charge to choke off their funding sources \nto prevent them from developing additional capacity to strike more \ntargets around the world. He is working to hold Iran to its commitments \nunder the nuclear deal and to lead a campaign against the full range of \nIran's other destructive activities. He is supported by the Global \nJewish Advocacy and, as I said earlier, by the Anti-Defamation League \nand by United Against Nuclear Iran.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the documents \nfrom the organizations I just mentioned.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                    American Jewish Committee,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 4, 2015.\n\nAJC Statement on Adam J. Szubin Nominee for Under Secretary of Treasury \n                for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence\n\n       Jason Isaacson, AJC Associate Executive Director for \n     Policy, today issued the following statement on the \n     organization's behalf:\n       AJC has worked with, and admired the dedication and \n     effectiveness of, the Under Secretary-designee for Terrorism \n     and Financial Intelligence, Adam Szubin, whose nomination is \n     now before the Senate Banking Committee.\n       At a time when Iran and its terrorist proxies are ever more \n     active and empowered, and when other terrorist threats to the \n     United States and its allies are escalating, it is urgent \n     that Treasury have in this critical position an experienced, \n     creative, tireless watchdog, who has the know-how and the \n     authority to lead U.S. efforts to track and choke off the \n     financial lifeblood of terror.\n       As Acting Under Secretary, Adam Szubin has demonstrated \n     that resolve and that skill--to the benefit of America's \n     security and that of our allies. We look forward to his \n     continued public service.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Anti-Defamation League,\n\n                                  New York, NY, September 9, 2015.\n     Hon.

Sherrod Brown,\n     Ranking Member, Banking Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Brown: On behalf of \n     the Anti-Defamation League, we write in support of President \n     Obama's nomination of Adam J. Szubin to serve as Under \n     Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Crimes, Department of \n     Treasury.\n       As director of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control \n     (OFAC), Mr. Szubin has earned a reputation as an intellectual \n     heavyweight who has worked effectively with global partners \n     to amplify the effects of U.S. sanctions. OFAC has been \n     dubbed America's war room, a front line for the United States \n     and its allies against terrorists and tyrants. It is a \n     critical part of the effort to engage global partners to \n     amplify the impact of sanctions and to innovate in the way \n     that the U.S. targets violators.\n       OFAC's effectiveness, under Mr. Szubin's leadership, has \n     exemplified the balance between working quietly behind the \n     scenes or through diplomatic channels and sending strong \n     public messages around the world about America's robust \n     commitment to crack down sponsors of tcrror like Iran.\n       But Mr. Szubin has done much more than simply ably \n     administer and enforce U.S. sanction against terrorism, \n     weapons proliferation and rogue states. He has continued to \n     expand and innovate how sanctions are devised and implemented \n     as he has done with respect to sanctions on Iran and Russia.\n       As Members of Congress have debated how to balance \n     diplomacy and sanctions, leaders on all sides of the debate \n     are unified in their assessment that the strong, vigorous \n     enforcement efforts by committed professionals like Adam \n     Szubin have been one of the most potent and effective tools \n     against the funding of terror and the isolation of rogue \n     regimes.\n       We urge the Committee to act promptly and favorably on Mr. \n     Szubin's nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Jonathan Greenblatt,\n                                                National Director.\n\n[[Page S8143]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n          [From the United Against Nuclear Iran, Nov. 3, 2015]\n\nUANI Supports Senate Confirmation of Adam Szubin as Under Secretary for \n                     Terrorism and Financial Crimes\n\n\n     Ambassador Wallace and Senator Lieberman Express Support for \n                              Confirmation\n\n       New York, NY--United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI) CEO \n     Ambassador Mark D. Wallace and UANI Chairman Senator Joseph \n     I. Lieberman issued the following statement today regarding \n     the Senate confirmation of Adam Szubin as Under Secretary for \n     Terrorism and Financial Crimes in the U.S. Department of the \n     Treasury:\n       ``UANI was a leading opponent of the Joint Comprehensive \n     Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear agreement with Iran. The \n     administration's success in blocking bipartisan and majority \n     opposition to the JCPOA on Capitol Hill should not be the \n     basis to oppose the confirmation of Director Szubin as Under \n     Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Crimes. \n     Simply put, he is the best person for the job, a true expert, \n     a dedicated public servant and fully committed to serve his \n     country. He has shown those traits over two successive \n     administrations--a rare feat in Washington. On behalf of \n     UANI, and in the strongest possible terms, we support \n     Director Szubin's confirmation. We respectfully call on all \n     of our Senate friends who were rightfully frustrated by the \n     administration's tactics related to the JCPOA to put those \n     concerns aside and support the confirmation of Director \n     Szubin.''\n\n  Mr. BROWN. He has support across the political spectrum--or at least \nhe did until he was nominated by this President.\n  I serve on the banking committee with Chairman Shelby. I sit next to \nhim as the ranking member. I like Senator Shelby. I work with Mr. \nShelby day-by-day on many things. He has described Mr. Szubin as \n``eminently qualified.'' He has served with distinction in senior \nnational security roles--I will say it again--for 15 years under \nPresidents of both parties. He is well regarded around the world for \nhis intellect, courage, and expertise. He deserves the strong backing \nof the Senate.\n  Republicans in Congress need to stop holding our national security \napparatus hostage to political demands. They should allow--we should \nallow Adam Szubin and other national security nominees to be approved \nas soon as possible.\n  Again, strip the partisanship away. Do what is right: Confirm Adam \nSzubin; confirm these other national security people.\n  They aren't controversial. The only thing controversial about these \nnominations is that Barack Obama made them. Well, the last time I \nchecked, he was elected President of the United States twice, including \nmy No. 1 swing State in the country--the hardest one to win, the one \nthat both parties fight for in every election. He carried my State \ntwice. He carried my State by over 100,000 votes.\n  He is the President of the United States. He appointed Adam Szubin, \nwho is eminently qualified, who has had support from both parties. Why \ndon't my colleagues confirm him, giving him the full range of powers to \nfight ISIS, to keep ISIS from getting the resources and the financing \nthey are getting now to launch these terrible terrorist crimes against \ninnocent men and women all over the world?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8143-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8143-S8146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  ISIS\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the recent \nterrorist attacks around the world--including, of course, the horror of \nParis--but also to talk about what undergirds that, and that is the \nthreat posed by ISIS. Some use the acronym ISIL; Daesh is another \nphrase that has been used to describe this vicious terrorist group. But \nI think we need to--at the same time as we are trying to prevent \nterrorist attacks--focus on the broader policy to destroy ISIS.\n  We know it has been 4\\1/2\\ years since the people of Syria began \nprotesting against the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad. As we also \nknow, that conflict escalated rapidly and was coupled with a \ndysfunctional and sectarian government in Iraq, especially starting \nfrom the capital of Baghdad. The fighting and unrest created space for \nextremism to grow and to take root.\n  About 1\\1/2\\ years ago, we saw the emergence of the group we now know \nas ISIS. This group poses a very serious threat to our national \nsecurity as well as to the security of many parts of the world. There \nis no question that ISIS is a clear threat to the security of our \npartners in the region and--as we know most horrifically, in the last \nfew days--in Europe.\n  They also have a desire to attack the U.S. homeland. We know that. We \nhave to remember that this is a group that originated as an Al Qaeda \noffshoot. They share the same motivations or at least similar \nmotivations, and they, of course, share the same brutality, if not \nworse.\n  In recent weeks, ISIS has claimed responsibility for horrific attacks \noutside of Syria and Iraq. They claim responsibility for the bombing of \na Russian airliner that went down over Egypt in the Sinai, killing all \nof its passengers--Russian passengers. ISIS suicide bombers attacked a \nmarket in Beirut, Lebanon, last week, just before Paris. Then, of \ncourse, came Friday night, the 13th. This was, as has been reported, a \ncoordinated, ruthless, and despicable attack in Paris that killed 129 \ninnocent civilians.\n  So what this horror--and we could list other examples, but these most \nrecent events remind us--what this horror reminds us, is what our job \nis in Congress and across our country, but especially when it comes to \nthe role of the U.S. Federal Government. We have at least two \nresponsibilities in this area. No. 1 is to prevent terrorists from \ncoming into the United States of America; and second, but related, is \nto destroy ISIS, without a doubt. To do both of these will continue to \nbe difficult and challenging. Anyone who comes up with a simple \nproposal or a commentary that makes it seem simple really doesn't know \nwhat they are talking about, really doesn't understand the complexity \nof this. I even doubt their commitment to it when they give one-line \nanswers to difficult challenging problems.\n\n  Last year, I was blessed, in June of 2014, to have the chance to go \nto Normandy. Senator Leahy, the senior Senator from Vermont, organized \na visit to Normandy on the 70th anniversary of D-day. For someone \nrepresenting any State--in my case representing the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania, from where so many Pennsylvanians and, of course, so many \nAmericans died on the beaches of Normandy or died within days of that \nbattle--it was deeply moving to be in Normandy, to listen to \npresentations from those who had lived through the horror of Normandy \nand those who were coming back to celebrate the fact that they had \nserved and were alive after these 70 years.\n  We were able to see the beaches. We saw the cemetery. I walked down \nto the cemetery, and the first grave I happened to look at was one of a \nPennsylvania soldier, just fortuitously when I was looking at the first \nmarker, the first grave.\n  One of the themes of that visit, of course, was France, the people of \nFrance thanking the United States, thanking allies and expressing \ngratitude in so many different ways, in heartfelt ways, at the \nleadership level, from President Hollande, all the way down. And one of \nthe best images of that gratitude was displayed in this picture. I will \nput it up on the easel. This is an enlarged version of what was on a \nbrochure. You can see it, and it is written in two languages, of \ncourse. The translation is ``70th Anniversary of the Liberation of \nFrance,'' in English and French, and the date--June 6, 2014, \ncommemorating the 70th anniversary.\n  What you may not be able to make out from a distance is the image. It \nis, of course, a beach, and it is the image of a little girl. She has \nan orange plastic pail and a green plastic shovel--an image we all \nunderstand--a child going on to the beach to play in the sand. She is \nin a yellow dress, with her back towards us, and she is moving towards \nthe beach.\n  What is so moving about this expression of gratitude by the people of \nFrance is that the shadow that emanates from that little girl is not \nher shadow. Rather, it is the shadow of an American GI, or what I \nbelieve to be an American GI, and I am not sure anyone could contest \nthat. It is a profound and\n\n[[Page S8144]]\n\nvery moving and very powerful expression of gratitude that all of us \ncan understand: that this little girl would not be able to be on that \nbeach to play in freedom--or any of the other places that were under \nattack during World War II--were it not for the bravery of American \nsoldiers, the commitment of the American people, and the work that was \ndone to undergird that effort by the allies against the axis powers.\n  It is a very powerful reminder of the contribution of that soldier \ndepicted by the shadow and the freedom that little girl can enjoy \nbecause of that sacrifice--a profound sacrifice, a sacrifice you cannot \neven describe if you had volumes of books to write about it. I was \nmoved because it was a wonderful expression of gratitude to the people \nof the United States by the French people.\n  I was thinking about that in the aftermath of this horror. Folks all \nover the United States and around the world were expressing solidarity \nwith the people of Paris and the people of France, and it gave us the \nchance to try to give back to them in the aftermath of their tragedy, a \nyear or so after they had expressed gratitude to us. This relationship \nbetween our two countries is very strong and goes back to the \nbeginnings of our Republic, even back to the days of the Revolution.\n  That image of that little girl probably couldn't be expressed or \npresented were it not for what happened in World War II and what \nhappened on the beaches of Normandy. Again, we were able to achieve \nthat result by working with allies the world over. It would not have \nbeen possible were it not for the work of people around the country \nsacrificing--the soldiers and their families, the factories, the \nspouses who worked in the factories while soldiers were overseas. There \nwas a lot of good work done then by the Congress to support the war \neffort. We have to figure out a way here to get back to that kind of \nsacrifice, that kind of commitment.\n  There was a reminder recently of what a Member of this body said \naround that time, about 1945. Senator Arthur Vandenberg from the State \nof Michigan delivered a seminal speech in January 1945 on this floor. \nSenator Vandenberg was a Republican, an avowed isolationist and a \nstrong opponent of President Roosevelt. But on that day he said:\n\n       We cannot drift to victory. We must have maximum united \n     effort on all fronts. . . . and we must deserve the continued \n     united effort of our own people.\n\n  It is Vandenberg's example of setting aside partisan politics for the \ngood of our Nation that gives us this expression: Politics stops at the \nwater's edge. We have all heard that expression. If we haven't, we \nshould educate ourselves, and if we have heard it, we should remind \nourselves of it. But I am afraid when we debate foreign policy and \nsecurity policy, there is often a dismissal of that basic lesson he \ntaught us. I am afraid we have lost sight of his legacy that politics \nmust stop at the water's edge when it comes to our security, whether \nthat is the fight against terrorism itself or whether that is a \nmilitary campaign against ISIS.\n  This fight against ISIS demands our attention, but it also demands \nour unity. Unity is not just a nice expression, something we should \nhope for. The challenge demands it. If we are not unified, it is going \nto be very difficult to defeat ISIS or any other threat, frankly. We \nmust not do oversight by sound bite when it comes to this policy. We \ncan engage, as some have done--not everyone but enough to be concerned \nin both Houses of Congress--in categorical condemnation of the \nPresident's policy on virtually everything in the international arena. \nThat doesn't move the ball down the field. It also doesn't absolve the \nPresident of accepting and incorporating critiques of the policy--\nspecific critiques of what we should be doing or are not doing or might \nwant to consider. But categorical condemnation doesn't help anyone. It \ndoesn't solve the problem. It just divides people and prevents us from \nhaving that essential unity to make sure the strategy works.\n\n  I have been critical of a number of the President's policies on the \ninternational stage. I haven't always agreed with him. But if one is \ngoing to disagree with the President or disagree with a colleague about \nsomething as important as a strategy to defeat what most people believe \nis the biggest threat to the civilized world, you should be very \nspecific. Unity demands that you be specific. We don't have time for \njust words and finger pointing. We need a bipartisan approach to this \nchallenge.\n  So we do need bipartisanship. We need sober and serious deliberation, \nand we also need spirited debate. I am not advocating that someone \ndoesn't criticize the policy or engage in a very heated exchange with \nsomeone who has a different point of view. But it has to be a debate, \nand it has to be an engagement that yields a result. And the result is \na policy and a strategy that is going to be effective and that has some \ndegree of substantial unity.\n  A lot of our allies look at the squabbles here in Washington and \nwonder how serious we are about this fight. If all we do is just \ncomment and answer reporters' questions, maybe go to a hearing once in \na while, that is OK, but this policy is going to take a lot more than \nthat. Some of our allies look at our failure to unite behind a common \nstrategy and wonder whether the United States will be an enduring \npartner for as long as it takes to eliminate ISIS from the planet--not \njust to defeat them on the battlefield but to destroy them. A lot of \nthese allies, I am afraid, are wishing for more Senator Vandenbergs or \nat least more Vandenberg-Roosevelt days, when someone could disagree \nalmost violently about domestic policy or even an aspect of our \nsecurity, but at some point you came together and said: We are going to \nmove forward with this strategy and work together.\n  In November of last year, the President outlined a multipart strategy \nto address the threat posed by ISIS. He spoke about the airstrike \ncampaign in Iraq and Syria, which now involves 11 countries and has \nyielded more than 8,000 airstrikes as of last week. Those strikes have \ntaken out ISIS leaders. They have taken out financiers, bomb makers, \nforeign fighters and foreign fighter recruiters.\n  Of course, most recently--just last week, just before the horrific \nnews about Paris--we were told the man responsible for the beheadings \nof ISIS hostages had, in fact, been killed. That was a good result for \nthe civilized world. We also heard from the President at that time--and \nsince that time--of a 60-plus nation coalition.\n  Most recently, there have been hits on the tanker trucks bringing oil \nout of ISIS-held areas for sale on the black market, hits on \ncommunications equipment or weapons caches, and they have helped \nprotect opposition fighters who cleared the way for significant \nterritorial gains, especially by the Kurdish Peshmerga forces--great \nfighters in this battle. Reports now indicate that ISIS territorial \nholdings in Iraq and Syria have been diminished by as much as 25 \npercent in roughly the last year. CENTCOM's assessment--this isn't an \nassessment by a politician; this is CENTCOM--indicates that the \nrefinery in the city of Tikrit has been largely retaken, as has been \nthe city of Sinjar and a main road connecting ISIS strongholds in Raqqa \nand Mosul. These airstrikes are denying ISIS safe haven and \nsignificantly hindering their ability to move freely around areas where \nthey operate.\n  So what have we heard over and over? Airstrikes alone will not win \nthis. I agree with that. I get that. But airstrikes are moving the ball \ndown the field in the sense that they are giving the opportunity to \nfighters on the ground and helping in other aspects of the strategy. So \nwe have to continue the airstrikes. I hope people around here don't \nstart saying: Well, airstrikes alone don't do the job; so let's stop \nthe airstrikes. No, we have to continue them and, if necessary, for \nyears--many years.\n  But this strategy is not just a military strategy. The President also \noutlined an effort to counter the financial networks that support ISIS, \nwhich gets funding from multiple sources. We know them: illicit oil \nsales, trafficking in antiquities and other goods, extortion of the \nlocal communities, and outside donations. The Department of Defense is \ntargeting financiers for kinetic strikes, a fancy way of saying you are \ngoing to be taken out if you are a financier. Treasury has sanctioned a \nnumber of senior ISIS leaders and facilitators, cutting off access to \nthe U.S. financial system. The strategy also includes measures to \naddress foreign fighter recruitment and travel. We\n\n[[Page S8145]]\n\nare also working to expose ISIS's hypocritical propaganda which many \nMuslim leaders around the world have said is inconsistent with their \nreligious values. It is clear there can be no enduring defeat of ISIS \nwithout remedies for the governance issues which created this space for \nextremism to fester.\n\n  In Iraq we are working to create an inclusive government that has a \ncapability to counter ISIS. In Syria we need a negotiated political \nsolution that ensures Bashar al-Assad--whose continued presence in \nDamascus has been a recruiting windfall for ISIS--has no role in the \nfuture of Syria and has to go. I have said that many times. I \nappreciate the fact that Secretary Kerry and his team have recognized \nthese underlying problems and have worked to address them.\n  So while the administration has taken important steps, we know it is \nnot enough. We know that. Recent events require an intensification of \nour efforts. I have critiqued this Syria policy for years and will \ncontinue to press the administration to do more on ISIS financing. We \nhave to make sure ISIS can't pay their people's salaries. We have to \ncut off their financing so they can't operate, so they can't pay for \npropaganda, so they can't buy weapons, so they can't buy ammunition, \nand so they can't make the horrific IEDs that kill innocent civilians \nand soldiers. So we must continue this debate as Members of the Senate \nwith the administration. Part of making sure we get the financing \nchallenge in the right place is to confirm Mr. Adam Szubin, who would \nplay a substantial determinative role in the Treasury Department.\n  So what do we do? It has been very difficult to get people focused on \na bipartisan strategy. There is a lot more we can do. I believe the \nestablishment of a bipartisan study group, comprised of experts and \nformer government officials from both sides of the aisle, will be \nuseful at this juncture. This group should be authorized by Congress, \nappropriated a modest amount of money for supporting its work, similar \nto the Iraq Study Group formed in 2006. The group should evaluate the \nnature of the ISIS threat as well as the conditions in Iraq and Syria \nthat have allowed it to grow and evolve, and it should evaluate the \nmilitary and nonmilitary options available to the United States to \naddress this threat and the underlying conflicts and governance issues. \nThere is a lot this group could do and contribute to what would be a \nstronger, bipartisan, unified policy. There are many outside experts \nwhose careers of service in the Middle East, and civilian, military, \nand intelligence roles, offer a wealth of expertise. This group could \nconduct its work over a 6- to 9-month period and report back to \nCongress with its findings. If they could do it faster, we would \ncertainly authorize and encourage them.\n  Initiating a bipartisan study doesn't mean we should press pause on \nour current efforts. Members of Congress need to continue supporting \nour soldiers, bringing the fight to ISIS with intensity and focus. We \nneed to continue our efforts to reach a negotiated political transition \nin Syria and to encourage inclusivity and good governance in Iraq. If a \nSunni soldier doesn't feel a part of his own government, they have to \nsupport a unifying government. We need to continue to press the growing \nhumanitarian crisis emanating from Iraq and Syria, but I believe our \nefforts to defeat ISIS and our long-term goal of countering violent \nextremism would benefit from a serious bipartisan expert study group.\n  In closing, I will once again invoke the words of Senator Vandenberg. \nIn the speech he gave in the 1940s, he said: ``Here in the Senate we do \nnot have perpetual agreement between the two sides of the aisle, but we \nhave never failed to have basic unity when crisis calls.''\n  ``We have never failed to have basic unity when crisis calls.'' \nCrisis has called, right now. We know that. The crisis is ISIS and \nterrorism. We have to destroy ISIS and prevent terrorism from coming to \nour shores. We don't have time for politics. We don't have time for \npeople talking in sound bites and pretending they are doing oversight. \nWe need bipartisan work that will bring people together on a unified \nstrategy. I urge my colleagues to reflect on the spirit of Vandenberg's \nseminal speech and to find a unified path forward that supports our \nlong-standing partners and protects the security of this great Nation.\n  I will conclude with a picture. This is a picture of a little girl \nwho can walk on a beach in freedom because of the bravery and sacrifice \nof our soldiers in World War II. If we are worthy--worthy of that \nsacrifice--we had better get our act together, come together--both \nparties--and make sure we have a bipartisan policy. We don't have time \nfor finger-pointing. We have to come together and make sure we do all \nwe can to have a sound, serious, bipartisan effort against ISIS and \nagainst terrorists. I believe that is a mission worthy of a great \nnation and certainly worthy of the sacrifice of the people who are on \nthe battlefield right now--our soldiers, our fighters, as well as \nsoldiers from around the world--and certainly worthy of the sacrifice \nthat led to the beautiful expression of gratitude that the French \npeople gave us just last year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I look forward to working with my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania on that sound bipartisan policy he is \ntalking about, and I want to talk a little bit about that today. He \nmentioned Senator Vandenberg, who famously said that partisanship ends \nat the water's edge. I think he would have been surprised by President \nObama's comments beyond the water's edge in Turkey yesterday, where he \nattacked Republicans who dared to talk about the need for us to ensure \nthat we know who is coming to our shores and specifically with regard \nto refugees and having a proper vetting process in place. In fact, the \nHouse of Representatives--with over 40 votes from Democrats--I \nunderstand just voted on legislation today, which is a veto-proof \nmajority, to say we ought to tighten requirements for people who want \nto come to our shores.\n  So we do need to work together. We do need to ensure that \npartisanship does not get in the way of working together as Americans \nto solve these problems. The partisan speech from across the ocean, \nwell beyond our shores, was an example of where we are not meeting the \nstandards Mr. Vandenberg set out.\n  As we all know now, last weekend ISIS terrorists killed over 130 \ninnocent people in a series of very well-coordinated attacks in Paris. \nI would say these attacks did not occur in isolation. They were one but \na series of attacks that occurred within a 24-hour period. Sometimes we \nforget the context of these attacks. The series of attacks left 43 \npeople dead in Beirut, 18 people dead in Baghdad, countless wounded--\nall ISIS attacks. In the preceding month, ISIS took credit for a downed \nRussian airplane, claiming the lives of 224 innocent civilians. In \nSeptember, Islamic extremists murdered nearly 50 in Yemen.\n  In fact, if we look back over the period of last year, several \nhundred civilians have been killed in nearly 30 attacks--incidents \nspanning the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, Asia, and North \nAmerica. It is impossible to deny the growing threat that this \nextremism poses to our Nation, our allies, and our shared values and \nglobal stability.\n  Despite all of its great qualities, technology has bridged the oceans \nthat once separated us from foreign turmoil and brought this threat to \nour communities and to our homes, the places we feel most safe. These \nattacks must serve as a wake-up call, not only about the nature of the \nenemy we face in ISIS but about the chaotic and dangerous state of the \nworld and the dire need for American leadership to address it.\n  The attacks in Paris were not a ``setback,'' as the President said. \nThey were a continuation of terrorist acts. They were a tragedy and a \nwarning--a warning that if we fail to take a leadership role in \ncombatting extremist behavior everywhere it resides, we will confront \nanother tragedy here, on our shores.\n  We cannot develop a successful strategy to defeat ISIS unless we \nunderstand its true nature. There has been a lot of talk this week \nabout Syrian refugees and whether they should be properly vetted. Of \ncourse they should, but we need to take a broader look at this issue \nand have a broader discussion about the roots of the problem: Why are \nthese refugees streaming into Europe and coming here? We need to look\n\n[[Page S8146]]\n\nat not just the roots of the problem but what is the comprehensive \nstrategy to address that problem.\n  We can't develop a successful strategy to defeat ISIS unless we \nunderstand its true nature. The President's insistence on downplaying \nthe extremist threat and viewing each act in isolation is a fundamental \nflaw in his national security policy, in my belief. Referring to ISIS \nas the ``JV team,'' as it seized nearly one-third of Iraq, publicly \nstating that ISIS has been ``contained'' just hours before the attack \nin Paris, and then referring to those attacks as a mere ``setback'' are \nall symptomatic of this failed policy, in my view.\n  I think this is a time for moral and strategic clarity. I think of \nRoosevelt and Churchill in World War II. I think of Kennedy and Reagan \nin the Cold War. Times of crisis require seeing threats as they are and \nnot as we might wish them to be. Nothing would make me happier than if \nthe President of the United States would provide this clarity.\n  We now know that the Paris attacks were planned in Syria, organized \nin Belgium, and carried out in France. This revelation is yet another \nconfirmation of a key fact many of us have been saying for years: ISIS \nis a global threat with global reach and ambitions. It is motivated by \na radical Islamist ideology that while rejected by the majority of \nMuslims, nevertheless holds great appeal to too many Muslims around the \nworld. This ideology rejects any form of government that is not based \non a radical interpretation of Sunni Islamism and holds that it is the \nduty of all Muslims to wage jihad against those who do not share their \nviews--including of course the United States, including of course \nIsrael, including of course the apostate regimes, as they call them, \nlike America's Arab allies all through the Middle East.\n  The President continues to insist that the limited scale and scope of \nthe administration's strategy to counter ISIS is working, but ISIS is \nnot just a nuisance to be managed. It is a global threat to be \ndefeated. Rather than containing ISIS to a geographic region, the \nconflict in Syria and Iraq has served as an incubator for terrorism. \nThe territory ISIS holds provides a safe haven for these terrorists to \ntrain, organize, gather resources, and project power. Tens of thousands \nof foreign fighters from Europe, the United States, and around the \nworld have flocked to the frontlines of the global jihad, and many \nreturn home with the training and resources necessary to carry out \nmonstrous attacks. Meanwhile, a flood of refugees fleeing atrocities \nand persecution in Syria have provided ISIS operatives a community in \nwhich they can easily hide. Indeed, it appears at least one of the \nParis attackers was someone who disguised himself as a refugee to get \ninto Europe.\n  This enemy is cunning and knows it cannot defeat us on a conventional \nfight on the battlefield, so it is employing asymmetric warfare to \nattack our values and degrade the collective security of our nations. \nThey know they have access into every home and are using modern media \ntechnologies to exploit a disenfranchised minority. Their audience \nspans the globe. Think about this: If they only reach 0.0001 percent of \nthe global population, then they have an army of over half a million \npotential terrorist recruits.\n  More intelligence cooperation between the United States and our \nallies is absolutely necessary to track suspected ISIS terrorists and \nprevent them from hiding their presence and launching attacks. The \nUnited States should also increase the scale and intensity of military \noperations against ISIS targets. If we can give the French the \nintelligence to be able to attack key ISIS targets in Syria, then why \nhaven't we used that intelligence ourselves to degrade the enemy? We \nmust intensify the use of our military. We must intensify U.S. Special \nOperations forces and local allies. We must defeat ISIS forces on the \nground and retake territory.\n  As I have argued for a couple of years now, we cannot ignore the \nbroader conflict in Syria and must lead our allies in pursuing a \ncomprehensive strategy to not just defeat ISIS but to also achieve a \nnegotiated resolution of the Syrian conflict.\n  Over 4 million people have fled Syria. The Government of Syria has \nmurdered over 200,000 of its own citizens. I saw an interview today \nwhere someone was asking one of the refugees from Syria what their \npreference was--to go to Europe or to go to the United States. The \nrefugees said what most refugees said: I want to go home, but I need a \nsafe haven there.\n  We should have a no-fly zone in Syria and provide for people the \nability to stay in their own country. Military force alone will not \nsolve this problem. Obviously, we need to do more and engage the Muslim \nworld in this effort, but it can shape the parameters of an acceptable \nsolution.\n  These measures are all important, but they all stem from the \nrecognition of something far more fundamental. In the absence of U.S. \nleadership, chaos and instability ensues. It takes active American \nleadership to reassure our allies, to deter our enemies, and to uphold \nthe international order upon which global stability and prosperity \ndepend. We should not be the world's policemen; I agree with that. It \nis more like being the world's sheriff, where you bring together a \nposse of like-minded nations. Whether it is the NATO countries with \nregard to Ukraine or whether it is our Sunni allies with regard to what \nis happening in the Middle East, we must be the sheriff who pulls the \nposse together. In the absence of that, in the absence of that \nleadership, we will not meet this challenge.\n  In the Middle East, the chaos we see is not just contained in Syria, \nand it is not just confined to ISIS. As the United States prepares to \nprovide billions in sanctions relief agreed to in the Iran nuclear \ndeal, Iran has been very busy. Iran has sent ground troops into Syria \nas part of a new joint offensive with Assad, Russia, and the terrorist \ngroup Hezbollah. Iran has tested a ballistic missile, they have \narrested several American citizens living in Iran, and they have \nthreatened to wipe Israel off the map of the Middle East. Ayatollah \nKhamenei has now banned any further negotiations with the United States \nof America.\n  Meanwhile, Russian forces are conducting combat operations in the \nMiddle East for the first time since 1941. Russia has launched a \nsustained air campaign--not really against ISIS, as Putin claims, but \nalmost entirely against U.S.-backed rebel groups and other moderate \ngroups opposed to both ISIS and Assad. There is discussion of them \ntargeting ISIS more. I hope that is true. In Europe, Russian forces \ncontinue to occupy portions of eastern Ukraine and continue to occupy \nCrimea. After a brief lull, violence is once again rising, as Russian \nefforts to undermine the democratic pro-Western government of Ukraine \npersist. Russia also continues to wage an unprecedented information war \nthat leverages all elements of national power to confuse, demoralize, \nand mislead.\n  In the meantime, hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing conflict \nin the Middle East stream into Europe, threatening to overwhelm \nEurope's ability to vet and process them and create opportunities for \nterrorists to evade detection and conduct attacks like those we saw in \nParis.\n  In the Pacific, China is building artificial islands in international \nwaters to reinforce its claims in the South China Sea.\n  This is the world that unenforced redlines and leading from behind \nhave created. It is a world where the very structure of international \norder is under siege and where the direction of our collective future \nis brought into question. Of course, this trend is not irreversible, \nbut the United States must first step out of the shadows.\n  Ronald Reagan spoke memorably about peace through strength. We must \nbe unambiguous in our support of our allies, and we must be clear-eyed \nand resolute in standing up to our foes. This is the path to peace and \nsecurity for us and for the world.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8146-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8146-S8148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PRESIDENT'S REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT PLAN\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the remarks of \nSenator Portman. I think he is touching on some critically important \nissues that all of us need to fully understand. As always, his insights \nare valuable and worthy of serious consideration by all.\n\n[[Page S8147]]\n\n  I would also briefly note that I do believe--and I spoke about this \nseveral weeks ago--there is a need for this country, as Senator Casey \nnoted, to develop a bipartisan strategy, particularly with regard to \nhow we deal with the rising spasm of extremism in the Middle East. It \nis a fact. It is happening. We as a country have to be able to work \ntogether in a bipartisan way to decide what action we may choose to \nuse--whether it is military force, whether it is technological \nadvancement, whether it is working with allies--to do whatever we can \nto increase more stability, more peace and tranquility, and less \nterrorism and violence. It is a big matter, and I am not at all \nconfident that we have a strategy. In fact, we don't have a strategy \nthat anyone can recognize as effective in this region, as a number of \nwitnesses before the Armed Services Committee have testified, including \nformer Secretary of Defense Bob Gates, who served under both President \nBush and President Obama.\n  This President seems to have his own plan. He refuses to listen. As \nhe traveled around the world recently talking about the attacks in \nParis, I think it stunned our allies. This is not a healthy situation. \nThere are millions of refugees. Good leadership, responsible \nleadership, should have anticipated this danger, and when it developed, \nhave a sound strategy that deals with it in a humane way. It cannot be \nthe strategy of the United States and Europe that when instability \noccurs anywhere in the world, when instability occurs in Syria or other \nplaces in the Middle East, the solution is for everybody to come to \nEurope or the United States. This is not healthy for those countries, \nit is not part of the historical tradition, and for reasons I am going \nto touch on, it is very bad policy.\n  I think Senator Portman is correct that we are not where we need to \nbe militarily, strategically, and in other ways, to help bring about a \nsituation in which people can return to their homes and be with their \nfamilies and not have to be running all over the world, marching \nthrough Europe, not knowing where they are going to go, in countries \nthat will not and cannot support them. It is not sound policy.\n  I want to address the economic and security threats imposed by the \nPresident's refugee resettlement plan and talk about it in some detail \nand explain why the more effective and compassionate solution is to \nresettle the region's refugees in safe zones in the region rather than \nflying them into the United States or Europe or other places around the \nglobe.\n  Each and every year, the United States issues green cards to roughly \n1 million immigrants. We admit approximately 500,000 foreign students. \nWe distribute work visas to approximately 700,000 foreign workers and \ngrant approximately 25,000 requests for asylum. Asylum is when a person \narrives in our country and says: I can't go home because I will be in \ndanger. A refugee is when somebody is in a foreign country--not their \nown country--and comes to our Embassy or to the UN and says: I am \nthreatened here. I am not safe. I want to be a refugee and go \nelsewhere. If they are accepted, they are a refugee. If the others are \naccepted after they come to our country--perhaps illegally--they are \nasylees. We have brought in another 70,000 refugees on top of that each \nyear in recent years.\n  The fact is, refugees are among the most costly immigration programs \nfor several reasons. Refugees are instantly eligible for all Federal \nwelfare and entitlement programs. Most are low-skilled and frequently \nlack any formal education and many--most don't speak English.\n  There is great cost involved in this. One estimate from an expert is \nthat for every 10,000 refugees admitted, there will be a lifetime cost \nto the U.S. Treasury of $6.5 billion. This year, we are now going to \naccept 85,000. The President says he will accept 100,000 next year and \nmaybe more. Now, 100,000 is 10 times $6.5 billion added to the debt of \nthe country, because no extra money is being appropriated for Medicaid \nand for food stamps. The money is going to be added to the debt. It is \nnot healthy. It is very expensive.\n  There are enormous security concerns as well. We have seen a number \nof refugees implicated in terrorist activity inside the United States. \nWe wish it weren't so, but it is a fact. Yet, in this environment of \nincreasing Federal debt, wage stagnation driven by excess labor supply, \nand ISIS terrorists trying to infiltrate as refugees, President Obama \nhas announced a unilateral expansion of the refugee program to begin \nadmitting many more Syrian refugees. This is at a time when 83 percent \nof the voters say projected growth in immigration should be curbed, \naccording to Pew polling.\n  The President persists in his plan even though his own officials, \ntestifying before the Subcommittee on Immigration and the National \nInterest, conceded there is no database in Syria with which to vet \nrefugees.\n  The administration briefed us last night, and they publicly stated: \nWe are going to use biometric techniques. In the United Sates, what \ndoes that mean? It means they take your fingerprint and run it against \nthe NCIC--National Crime Information Center--and see if you have \nwarrants for your arrest or if you have been convicted of anything. You \ncan't do that in Syria. You can take their fingerprints, but there is \nno database to run it against. So that is just puffing. That is spin. \nYou can't run fingerprints in Syria, because there is no database to \nrun them against. As his officials further concluded, there is no way \nto prevent refugees from radicalizing after their entrance into the \nUnited States, as has happened, unfortunately, with Somali refugees.\n  It is an unpleasant but unavoidable fact that bringing in large \nunassimilated flows of migrants from the Muslim world creates the \nconditions possible for radicalization and extremism to take hold. This \nis what they are seeing in Europe.\n  The FBI Director tells us there are now active ISIS investigations in \nall 50 States. They have a terrorist investigation involving ISIS in \nevery State in the Union today. I think there are 900 open cases.\n  Our subcommittee has identified dozens of examples of foreign-born \nimmigrants committing and attempting to commit acts of terror on U.S. \nsoil. It is happening every day. Preventing and responding to these \nacts is an effort encompassing thousands of Federal agents, attorneys, \nand prosecutors and billions of dollars in costs. They are directing \ntheir efforts away from bank fraud and Medicare fraud and toward \nwatching terrorists. Their ability has been limited by restrictions on \ntheir ability to conduct surveillance. In effect, we are voluntarily \nadmitting individuals at risk for terrorism and then on the back end \ntrying to stop them from carrying out bad, violent designs.\n  The former head of the Citizenship and Immigration Services union, \nwhich represents immigration workers who handle the casework on these \nevaluations for admission, issued this warning more than a year ago. \nThis is important. This is the man who represents the individuals who \ndo the work every day, and he got frustrated and he told the truth. \nThis is what he said:\n\n       It is also essential to warn the public about the threat \n     that ISIS will exploit our loose and lax visa policies to \n     gain entry to the United States.\n\n       Indeed, as we know from the first World Trade Center \n     bombing in 1993, from the 9/11 terrorist attacks, from the \n     Boston Bombing, from the recent plot to bomb a school and \n     courthouse in Connecticut, and many other lesser-known terror \n     incidents, we are letting terrorists into the United States \n     right through our front door. . . . Applications for entry \n     are rubber-stamped, the result of grading agents by speed \n     rather than discretion. We've become the visa clearinghouse \n     for the world.\n\n  We can't properly vet the people coming now. Yet we are still talking \nabout adding more and more people to it.\n  Senator Cruz and I sent the administration a list of 72 individuals \ncharged with or convicted of terrorism-related offenses in just the \nlast year. We wanted to know something. We asked for the immigration \nhistories of each one of these individuals. Isn't that a good thing to \nknow? We are policymakers. We are supposed to decide how to conduct \nimmigration issues. As we evaluate how to improve our immigration \nsituation, shouldn't we know how these terrorists--who have been \narrested, charged, or convicted--got into the country?\n  Well, stunningly, the administration has just refused to respond. \nThey didn't\n\n[[Page S8148]]\n\nrespond because they don't want the public to know. They think if they \ncan ignore these requests, then people will not know and will not begin \nto question how things are being conducted. Congress should not \nacquiesce to the President's refugee funding request when he refuses to \neven publicly disclose the immigration history of these 72 terrorists, \nmany of whom are involved with and directly connected with Al Qaeda and \nISIS.\n  An outright majority of the public opposes resettling Syrian refugees \nin the United States. In fact, voters across all parties wish to see a \nreduction of Middle Eastern refugee settlements. It is in the data. \nThat is what people think. They are worried about this issue. Why \nshouldn't they be? We have had our own problems. We have had 9/11, we \nhave had the Boston bombers, and many other instances, such as \nChattanooga, and look at what is happening in Europe. I don't think the \nAmerican people are mean or unkind. They are just rightly concerned. \nThey want to protect their families, their Nation, and their interests, \nand I think we should consider their concerns.\n  The safe and proper course is to focus on regional resettlement. One \nreport says that for the price of placing one refugee in the United \nStates, 12 can be helped in their homeland. Our goal must be to help \nrefugees find safety and help them return to their homes, not for us to \ndepopulate the region.\n  How serious is this? Only this strategy will protect the security of \nthe United States and the West, protect the finances of our country \nfrom further debt, and protect the long-term stability and safety of \nthe Middle East itself. That is what our goal should be, and our \nPresident is not focused on this issue. It has been raised in committee \nafter committee and nothing has been accomplished. He just sticks with \nthe plan he has.\n  What then is Congress to do to stop the President from carrying out a \nplan the voters oppose and Congress has not approved? The answer lies \nin the power of the purse. Each and every year the President submits a \nrequest to Congress to fund his Refugee Admissions Program. Only with \nthese funds can the President carry out his plans. Congress, which has \nbeen run over time and again by this President, must not write the \nblank check the President is asking for. He can also bring in more \nrefugees than he has currently indicated. Secretary Kerry has told the \nJudiciary Committees of the House and Senate they just may well bring \nin more than this.\n  My colleague Senator Shelby and I outlined in a joint statement that \nthe answer is for Congress to include in the year-end funding bill a \nclear requirement that the President must submit his annual refugee \nplan to Congress for approval. Senator Shelby is on that Appropriations \nCommittee. Under this plan, Congress must approve how many refugees are \nbrought in and from where.\n  Mr. President, is it time to wrap up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and ask for 1 \nadditional minute to wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are facing a humanitarian crisis of \nmonumental proportions. In large part, it is because the President has \nmismanaged the situation in Syria. He is the Chief Executive, he is the \nCommander in Chief, the military does what he says, and this has not \nbeen good. It just has not been good. It has caused danger, it has \ncaused innocent people to be killed, it has caused people to have to \nflee, and it has also allowed the surge of ISIS and Al Qaeda-type \nterrorist organizations in Syria to be able to create an entire state \nof their own and to export their terrorism.\n  We have to create safe zones in Syria and other places in the region \nwhere people can stay in their homes, and we need to work to end this \nfighting as soon as possible so people can go back home permanently. It \ncannot be the position of this country that we just bring in millions \nof people because of the dangers abroad. It just does not make common \nsense.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, as my colleague from Alabama prepares to \nleave, I want to wish him and his family a happy Thanksgiving holiday \nand I look forward to seeing him in 10 days.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Senator Carper is one of our most \ndelightful colleagues. He is always gentlemanly and calls us to \nconsider and think on the higher things. I thank my friend from \nDelaware for that and his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8148-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8148-S8150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  ISIS\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, it has been quite a week. I think we have \nall learned a bit about Syrian refugees, the challenges they face, and \nthe potential challenges they create for us in this country. One of the \nthings we have learned is that it is not easy to come here as a refugee \nto this country. In fact, it is pretty difficult. It is not something \none can do easily. If you want to come over thinking that you might \nwait a couple of weeks or a couple of months--you might wait a couple \nof years. You have to go through a vetting process with the United \nNations. You go through a vetting process overseas with the U.S. folks. \nYou have to have your information go through any number of databanks to \ndetermine whether you are a person of special interest and could \npotentially be a problem. It is a long process.\n  I will be honest. If I were a bad guy over there, one of these ISIS \nfolks trying to get into the United States and create mayhem, there is \nno way I would want to wait 2 years, go through a refugee program, and \nprobably get bounced out somewhere along the line through all these \nbackground checks and access to intelligence databanks and personal \ninterviews. I think I would find another way to get here, and there are \nother ways to get here. We have been talking about that more recently \ntoday and yesterday.\n  One of the potential ways to get here is through what is called the \nVisa Waiver Program. It is an agreement we have with 38 different \nnations. The Visa Waiver Program started a number of years ago, and it \nhas now grown to include 38 countries. It started off as a travel \nfacilitation program, kind of like the TSA precheck or the global \nentries we have at the airports here in the United States. It started \noff as a travel facilitation program, and over time it has turned into \nan information sharing partnership with 38 different foreign countries. \nThe idea is to make it a little easier for folks who we believe are \ntrusted travelers to get into this country from several dozen nations. \nOne of the things we don't focus on very much in this program is we \nbelieve it is to our economic advantage to facilitate travel and \ntourism for those visiting our country. That is hard to argue with. It \nalso facilitates tourism and traveling to the other 38 countries.\n  We didn't just enter willy-nilly into this agreement with these other \n38 other countries. There are certain requirements we have in terms of \naccess about the people who would like to come to this country under \nthe Visa Waiver Program. We have any number of different kinds of \naccess to intelligence data files and databases, and we insist on that \nbefore we allow these countries to participate. If they don't want to \ndo that, they are not part of the Visa Waiver Program.\n  If they change their mind during the course of our relationship with \nthem as part of the Visa Waiver Program and become not very good \npartners in this, we bounce them out, they are no longer part of the \nVisa Waiver Program, and then those people have to go through the \nregular visa process.\n  Anyway, that would provide another option. It is probably a more \nfavored option for somebody who is anxious to get over here from Syria \nor for anybody who wants to do mayhem. That might be an option if they \nlive in one of those 38 countries. People can go to U.S. consulates all \nthe time in other countries. They ask to come here. Sometimes they ask \nto come here on a visa. It could be a tourism visa. A lot of people \nwant to come to the United States as a tourist. It could be that they \nwant to come here to study. Those may be perfectly legitimate, but in \nsome cases they may not be. Folks come here in many other ways.\n  We had an interesting hearing today in the Senate's Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee. We had two witnesses from the \nFederal\n\n[[Page S8149]]\n\nGovernment, and then we had five witnesses from a variety of different \nbackgrounds. One of the things we asked were: Where do the real threats \nlie for our country? It could be Syria. It could be ISIS people from \nIraq. It could be folks who have been radicalized from other countries \nwho have gone to Syria to fight and have become jihadists and want to \nsomehow get into our country and create not just mischief but mayhem. \nEverybody who testified said the primary concern should not be the \nRefugee Resettlement Program. Why would anybody want to go through \nthat? It wastes 2 years. Maybe they will get through it, maybe not. If \nyou are lucky, you get through it 2 years later.\n  The 2,000 people or so who have come through that program from Syria \nthis year, I am told they were mostly women and children, older men--\nvery old men. Out of the 2,000, in terms of the folks who are male and \nof fighting age, only about 2 percent fall into that category. They all \nhave to provide family connections of the people they are related to \nand will be reunited with over here. That is part of the deal for \ngetting in. It is not like every refugee who comes here would even be \nsomeone who would be expected to be of fighting age.\n  One of the other things most of the folks agreed on was that one of \nthe greatest concerns we ought to have for folks getting into our \ncountry and doing mischief here would not necessarily be folks from \nother countries. The concern is about the folks who are already here \nand may be natives to the United States who have become radicalized. We \nheard that again and again and again. That is a major concern, and that \nis something we have to be serious about.\n  One of the best ways we can reduce the likelihood that folks living \nhere would be radicalized and want to be a part of the ISIS army \noverseas or right here is to do what we are trying to do as a country; \nthat is, to degrade and destroy ISIS militarily. And that would be not \njust us by ourselves--us using our air superiority, us using our \nability to gather and disseminate intelligence, with direct strikes, \nand to provide help to the people on the ground, to the boots on the \nground--not us--but to help other countries that are doing that sort of \nthing.\n  My guess is--and this was confirmed by most of our witnesses today--\nthat the folks who most likely want to be a homegrown jihadist, be \naffiliated with ISIS, and do their job here in this country as opposed \nto over in Syria want to be on the winning side. They are not \ninterested in affiliating with a loser. So the question is, What can we \ndo to make sure that ISIS is degraded and destroyed?\n  I will mention a couple of things that happened in the last couple of \nweeks that would suggest to me that at long last the coalition of 60 \nnations is beginning to get its act together and make progress on the \nground. Over the past year ISIS has lost 25 percent of its safe haven \nin Syria and Iraq. Our coalition has conducted more than 8,000 \nairstrikes against ISIS. We have killed ISIS fighters at a rate of \n1,000 fighters a month.\n\n  The Iraqi Security Forces have now liberated Tikrit, which is a city \nin Iraq that is Saddam Hussein's old hometown. It has been liberated \nfrom ISIS now. About 70 percent of Tikrit's pre-ISIS citizens have been \nreturned to the city.\n  With Syrian Kurdish forces on the ground and the United States in the \nair, the Syrian town of Kobane was kept from falling to ISIS, despite \nthe fact that most analysts thought the town would fall within days \nearlier this year.\n  Just last week in Iraq, Kurdish forces supported by the United States \nin the air took back the key town of Sinjar from ISIS. That strategic \ntown sits on the top of a key roadway that connects ISIS's stronghold \nin Mosul with ISIS's capital in a place called Raqqa.\n  Now these Iraqi Kurds are working with the Syrian Kurds, an Arab \ncoalition, and the United States to fully sever that key supply line \nand isolate Mosul and Raqqa.\n  In August, a U.S. drone strike killed a fellow named Junaid Hussain, \none of ISIS's online propagandists who had helped to direct the \nhomegrown attack at Garland, TX, last May.\n  Just last week, a U.S. drone strike also killed Jihadi John, ISIS's \nchief executioner. Jihadi John has publicly executed dozens of people, \nincluding at least three Americans--James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and \nPeter Kassig.\n  Last week, an American airstrike took ISIS's leader in Libya, a guy \nnamed Abu Nabil.\n  Now, is that the ball game? No, it is not. Is that encouraging? Yes, \nit is. It has to be discouraging to folks with ISIS, and it has to be \ndiscouraging to fans here in the United States. The idea is to degrade \nthem and ultimately destroy them, and I am encouraged that we finally \nseem to be on the right track to accomplishing that.\n  The other thing we heard from our witnesses today is that there is a \nFederal program run by the Department of Homeland Security called the \nOffice of Community Partnerships Countering Violent Terrorism. The idea \nthere is to work with the Muslim communities throughout the country--\nand there are a number of them--to counter the social media message \nthat some find so alluring that is put up by ISIS. Part of the ability \nto compete with that and to degrade that message is to degrade ISIS on \nthe ground.\n  The other way to do it is to do what the Department of Homeland \nSecurity is doing in conjunction with Arab communities and Muslim \ncommunities throughout our country and in conjunction with, for \nexample, the district attorney in Minneapolis, to develop a good \npartnership in saying: Let's see if we can't convince our young people \nliving there not to want to go to Syria, not to want to go to fight, \nnot to want to go anywhere, but just to live their lives and not to be \njihadists in this country. It is a good program. It seems to be bearing \nfruit. It has been well accepted, I am told, by many in the Muslim \ncommunity. We are being asked to help fund that through the \nappropriations process, and it is very important that we do.\n  I will close where I started. It has been a bit of a wild and crazy \nride this week. Every now and then I feel--when I was raising my kids, \nmy boys, I would just say, why don't we just take a deep breath and \nchill for a little bit, and then figure out what to do. Given \neverything that has come across in the media and the scare that has \nbeen visited on so many people, it is probably a good time for us to \njust take a deep breath and to think about some of the things that I \nhave said, some of what we learned in our hearing today.\n  There are threats to this country that are real. They are probably \nnot posed by the refugee problem. We are reminded by the Pope that we \nhave an obligation to follow the Golden Rule and treat other people the \nway we wanted to be treated. We have an obligation, as we were reminded \njust two months ago by the Pope on the other side of the Capitol when \nhe addressed a joint session of Congress. He told us to remember \nMatthew 25: When I was hungry, did you feed me? When I was thirsty, did \nyou give me a drink? When I was naked, did you clothe me? When I was a \nstranger in your land, did you take me in?\n  He posed to us sort of a moral dilemma and certainly reminded us that \nwe have a moral obligation to the least of these in our society. We \nalso have a moral obligation as leaders here in the Congress to make \nsure that we are not only trying to be true to that moral obligation to \nthe least of these but the obligation that we have to protect the \npeople of this country.\n  The question for us as we approach Thanksgiving--maybe in the spirit \nof Thanksgiving--is that it possible for us to be true to both of the \nmoral imperatives, to the least of those in our society and, frankly, \noutside this country, and the moral imperative to our country men and \nwomen to protect them. I think we can do both.\n  As we leave here today to head for our homes and for Thanksgiving, I \nam encouraged we can do both, and that if we are smart about it, we \nwill do that.\n  I wish the Presiding Officer and all of our pages and all of the \nstaff here a blessed Thanksgiving holiday. Thank you all for your \nservice. I will see you in about 10 days. God bless you.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S8150]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse).

Mr. President, the Presidential Medal of Freedom is our \nNation's highest civilian honor, presented to men and women who have \nmade ``an especially meritorious contribution to the security or \nnational interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other \nsignificant endeavors.''\n  It is the highest honor a civilian of the United States can achieve. \nIn all, the recipients have included seven Presidents, nine Supreme \nCourt Justices, countless Members of Congress, First Ladies, military \nleaders, lawyers, artists, athletes, civil rights leaders, and doctors. \nIt is the list of the best of America. It is a diverse list. The \nrecipients come from all backgrounds and all walks of life. They all \nhave one thing in common. They have dedicated their lives to achieving \nexcellence in serving causes greater than themselves.\n  On November 24, next week, Bonnie Carroll, a proud Alaskan, will join \nthis honor roll when she is presented with the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom at a White House ceremony. It is certainly an exciting time for \nall of us in Alaska. We are so proud of Bonnie, who just happens to be \nhere tonight in the Gallery.\n  Let me tell you a little bit about Bonnie Carroll, a woman of \ndetermination, perseverance, honor, and strength. You can't talk about \nBonnie without talking first about how she met her husband Tom, which \nin many ways--in tragic ways I will get to--led to the great work she \nhas done for a grateful nation.\n  In 1988, Bonnie was working at the White House when news broke that \nthree whales were trapped in the ice off the coast of Alaska. Now I \nknow this doesn't happen in the Presiding Officer's State that often, \nbut in Alaska we have certain challenges that other States don't. She \npicked up the phone to see what could be done, and on the other line \nwas her future husband, Alaska Army National Guard COL Tom Carroll, who \nworked with many others to help rescue the whales. This was part of the \nlove story between Bonnie and Tom and part of a story so unique that \nwhat happened up in Alaska actually caught the attention of Hollywood. \nYou can see their love story portrayed in the film ``The Great \nMiracle.''\n  For the Carrolls, the story didn't end with the saving of the whales. \nUnfortunately, their story is in many ways happy but also did not have \na so-called Hollywood ending--unfortunately, far from it. After they \nwere married in 1992, COL Tom Carroll of the Alaska National Guard died \nin an Army C-12 plane crash in the mountains of Alaska. Seven other top \nAlaska National Guard members were tragically lost that day. It was a \nhorrible tragedy for America, for Alaska, for the Carroll family, and \nfor all the other families who suffered tragic loss that day in Alaska.\n  After the crash Bonnie realized there were no organizations \nestablished in this country to help people like her who had lost loved \nones--military members and family members who had lost military members \nin tragedies such as the day of that crash. What she did after that was \namazing. What she did was heroic. She took her deep grief and put it to \nuse for the rest of us.\n  Just 2 years after her husband's tragic death, Bonnie founded the \nTragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, also known as TAPS. The idea \nfor TAPS came in part as a result of her consultations with former \nSenator Ted Stevens, another great Alaskan and great American, who \nwould also tragically die in a plane crash in Alaska. This is why \nBonnie is being honored by the President next week. Since 1994, her \norganization, TAPS, has offered support to 50,000 surviving families of \nour military members whom we have lost. Fifty thousand surviving family \nmembers and caregivers have benefitted from the services of TAPS, which \nBonnie founded. Think of the grief and think of what she has done \nacross America to soothe grieving families.\n  TAPS provides a variety of grief and trauma resources, including \nseminars for adults and a summer camp for children in Alaska to help \nfamilies heal and to help them work through their grief. I heard many \nof these stories, and you can't help but be touched and moved by the \npower of what TAPS does to help Americans, family members of our \nmilitary, work through some of the most difficult times. For years \nthose of us in the military and those of us in Alaska have known how \nBonnie's work and the work of TAPS has been healing families throughout \nthis country, for those we have lost--our heroes who have been \ndefending this country. We have known in the military, we have known in \nAlaska, and as of Tuesday the world will know when Bonnie is presented \nwith this incredible honor at the White House.\n  As she puts it: ``Out of an Alaskan tragedy came hope and healing for \ntens of thousands of our military families.''\n  For the work that she does with the families of our heroes who have \nmade the ultimate sacrifice for all of us, Bonnie Carroll is utmost \ndeserving of this great honor. She is a great Alaskan, a Great \nAmerican, and she has made us all very proud.\n  Congratulations, Bonnie.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a year ago today, in a nationwide address, \nPresident Obama announced a series of measures to improve our broken \nimmigration system. He outlined efforts to focus scarce resources on \nidentifying and deporting those people who pose a danger to our \ncommunities, to modernize our legal immigration system, and to provide \ntemporary relief from the threat of deportation for hard-working, law-\nabiding members of our communities. For many, the President's \nannouncement offered at last a hope for stability. It acknowledged the \nlongstanding presence and contributions of immigrants to our country.\n  But the President's announcement also underscored the real human \nconsequences of the House of Representatives failing to allow a vote to \nreform our immigration laws. Importantly, it highlighted the \nimpracticality of deporting 11 million undocumented immigrants. Many of \nthem have strong family ties in the United States and a deep desire to \nbecome fully integrated in our country. They are mothers and fathers, \nsisters and brothers, sons and daughters. To suggest that we can simply \nremove them is unrealistic and it would conflict with fundamental \nAmerican values.\n  The President's Executive action is no substitute for legislation. He \nreminded critics of that very fact during his address, pointing out \nthat the commonsense, responsible solution to the problems in our \nimmigration system is to pass a comprehensive reform bill. A year \nlater, the Republican-led Senate has failed to debate, let alone pass \nmeaningful immigration reform. Instead, it has repeatedly taken up \ndivisive and partisan proposals that do not reflect a desire to fix \nwhat we all agree is a broken system.\n  These political gimmicks are not serious attempts to address an issue \nas important as immigration and could not be more different from what \nthe Democratic-led Senate accomplished in 2013 when we passed a \nbipartisan immigration bill supported by 68 Senators. During the Senate \nJudiciary Committee's consideration of the Border Security, Economic \nOpportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, I convened multiple \nhearings, and we heard from 42 witnesses. Government officials and \nindividuals representing a range of perspectives--including law \nenforcement, civil rights, labor, faith, business, and State and local \ngovernments--testified about the challenges confronting our current \nimmigration system.\n  We heard the powerful testimony of witnesses such as Jose Antonio \nVargas and Gaby Pacheco who pressed the urgent need for immigration \nreform. The compelling stories of DREAMers, young immigrants brought to \nthis country as children, who have grown up as Americans and have every \ndesire to make meaningful contributions to their communities, continue \nto inspire.\n\n[[Page S8151]]\n\nMany of them have qualified for the temporary relief provided by the \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA, program, which has \nestablished a path for them to become our next generation of teachers, \nengineers, public servants, and doctors. Our Senate-passed, \ncomprehensive bill included the DREAM Act, an important measure that \nwould have provided a long-lasting solution to the problems these \ncourageous young individuals face, acknowledging that they deserve to \nbe part of our Nation's future.\n  The Senate-passed bill would have addressed many of the injustices in \nour current immigration system. It was a remarkable example of all that \nwe can accomplish when we actually focus on the hard job of \nlegislating. But the Republican-led House of Representatives blocked \nthat effort. It stubbornly refused to even allow a vote on that bill. \nGiven that lack of action, I understand the President's frustration and \nmotivation. His Executive action was a response to what we all \nacknowledge is a broken system, but it is no substitute for \ncomprehensive immigration reform.\n  Following the President's announcement, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee held a hearing on the Executive action program and heard the \ntestimony of Astrid Silva. Hers is a fundamentally American story. It \nis similar in many ways to those of our parents and grandparents. It is \na story of a family looking to find a better life. Astrid qualifies for \nthe President's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA, program. \nAnd her parents would be eligible for the Deferred Action for Parents \nof Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, DAPA, program because her \nyounger brother is a U.S. citizen. For more than 20 years, Astrid's \nfamily has been working hard and contributing to their local community. \nThey are the kind of family we want to have as our neighbors and \ncoworkers. Their stories remind us that their dreams, along with those \nof so many others affected by our dysfunctional immigration system, \nhang in the balance, and underscore the need for a permanent \nlegislative solution.\n  Some in Congress claim that the President's executive action \nundermined the prospect of achieving comprehensive immigration reform. \nBut I remind them that the President's action--prompted by \ncongressional inaction--is not an excuse for continued congressional \ninaction. We must keep working to find a permanent legislative solution \nthat provides today's immigrants with an opportunity to prosper and \ncontribute to our country. As families across the Nation gather next \nweek around the table to give thanks, we will all count our family \nmembers and their security among our greatest blessings. Our fight for \ncomprehensive immigration reform is at its core a fight to help reunite \nfamilies and provide the security that we all want for our loved ones. \nI urge Republicans to return to the cooperative and bipartisan approach \nof 2013 and work on comprehensive immigration reform legislation. The \nAmerican people support immigration reform. It is the right thing to \ndo, and it should not be delayed any longer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8151-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REFORMING THE EB-5 REGIONAL CENTER PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have championed the EB-5 Regional Center \nProgram for many years. I have done so because I have seen its ability \nto generate investment and create jobs in distressed communities. But \nthe program is facing some pressing challenges. Reports of rampant \nfraud and abuse raise serious concerns and threaten to cripple the \nprogram's integrity. The incentives Congress established to invest in \nhigh unemployment and rural communities are also routinely abused, \nundermining a core objective of the program--to spur growth and create \njobs in underserved areas. The Regional Center Program is set to expire \non December 11. It should be reauthorized, but we should not extend it \nblindly. There is bipartisan consensus that the program is in dire need \nof reform, and we cannot squander this opportunity.\n  I have long sought reforms to the Regional Center Program. Last \nCongress, my EB-5 amendment to Comprehensive Immigration Reform \nprovided the Department of Homeland Security additional authority to \nrevoke suspect regional center designations or immigrant petitions. It \nalso provided for increased reporting, background checks, and \nsecurities oversight. My amendment was unanimously approved in the \nJudiciary Committee, but unfortunately the improvements it contained \nhave all had to wait, as the House of Representatives failed to allow a \nvote on the bipartisan immigration reform bill that passed the Senate \nlast Congress.\n  In the past year, only more concerns have emerged. In January, I \njoined Senators Grassley, Corker, Johnson, and others in requesting \nthat the Government Accountability Office, GAO, audit the EB-5 program. \nThe GAO report released in August detailed fraud vulnerabilities within \nthe program and questioned its economic impact. Separate reports from \nthe Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence and \nAnalysis and Office of the Inspector General highlighted additional \nissues that need to be addressed.\n  I am also troubled by the fact that the incentives Congress created \nto promote EB-5 investment in rural and high unemployment areas have \nbeen rendered meaningless. Investors are provided a discount if they \nchoose to invest in rural or high unemployment areas, known as targeted \nemployment areas or TEAs. At present, however, the most affluent \nneighborhoods in the country routinely qualify as TEAs by selectively \nstitching together otherwise unrelated census tracts. Department of \nHomeland Security Secretary Johnson rightly described this practice as \ngerrymandering. I do not suggest that affluent areas should not benefit \nfrom EB-5; they should. But they should not qualify for incentives \nintended to benefit high unemployment and rural areas. These areas \ntypically do not have access to significant capital and often struggle \nto create jobs.\n  Secretary Johnson himself called for significant reforms to \nstrengthen the Regional Center Program. In a letter to the Judiciary \nCommittee last April, he asked for authority to quickly act on criminal \nand national security concerns, additional protections for investors, \nenhanced reporting and auditing, improved integrity of TEAs, increased \nminimum investment amounts, and more.\n  I have now worked for over 2 years to develop legislation that would \nprovide a necessary overhaul of the Regional Center Program. In June, I \nwas joined by Chairman Grassley in introducing this reform-oriented \nlegislation, S.1501. Since then, Chairman Grassley and I have worked \nwith House Judiciary Chairman Goodlatte on a bicameral bill based on \nS.1501.\n  This bicameral bill would provide the Department with the authorities \nand investigative tools necessary to address national security concerns \nand fraud. The reforms include further expanding background checks, \nconducting a more thorough vetting of immigrant investors and proposed \ninvestments, and providing for the ability to proactively investigate \nfraud, both in the United States and abroad, using a dedicated fund \npaid for by certain program participants. The bill would provide \ngreater protections for investors and clarity and shorter processing \ntimes for project developers. It would also raise minimum investment \nthresholds so more money goes to the communities that need it. And it \nwould help to restore the program to its original intent, by ensuring \nthat incentives to invest in distressed and undercapitalized areas are \nrestored.\n  Such reforms would answer the concerns raised by Secretary Johnson, \nthe Department's inspector general, the GAO, and others, instilling \nboth confidence and transparency in the program. I believe these \nreforms would result in a secure EB-5 program that creates American \njobs and promotes economic growth throughout our country. We cannot \ncontinue to leave the Department ill-equipped to administer this job \ncreation program. We know what is needed to fix it. And we should fix \nit now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8151-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8151-S8152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOMINATION OBJECTION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I intend to object to any unanimous \nconsent request at the present time relating to the nomination of \nThomas A. Shannon, Jr., of Virginia, a career member of the Senior \nForeign Service, class of Career Ambassador, to be an\n\n[[Page S8152]]\n\nUnder Secretary of State, Political Affairs.\n  I will object because the Department of State has still not responded \nto almost a dozen investigative letters dating back to 2013. In \naddition, on August 20, 2015, my staff met with Department officials in \nan effort to prioritize material for production. The Department has \nfailed to comply with its commitments, producing material late, failing \nto provide all requested material, and even failing to provide material \nto the Senate Judiciary Committee contemporaneously with providing the \nsame documents to Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, requestors. These \nare the same complaints that I raised on September 30, 2015, when I \nplaced a hold on Brian James Egan of Maryland to be legal advisor of \nthe Department of State. Apparently, the Department simply does not \nunderstand its obligation to respond to congressional inquiries in a \ntimely and reasonable manner.\n  Two and a half years ago I began a broad inquiry into the \ngovernment's use of special government employee programs. I did not \nsingle out the State Department on this issue. To the contrary, I wrote \nto 16 different government agencies.\n  Two and a half years have passed since I began my inquiry, and the \nState Department has still not produced the materials I have requested \nor certified they do not exist.\n  In addition to the investigation of the Department's special \ngovernment employee program, I am also investigating the Department's \ncompliance with the FOIA as it pertains to Secretary Clinton's private \nserver that was used to transit and store government information.\n  The Minority Leader has questioned whether the Judiciary Committee's \njurisdiction extends to these matters. I would note that the special \ngovernment employee designation is an exception to Federal criminal \nconflict-of-interest laws. Those laws are within the jurisdiction of \nthe Judiciary Committee, as is FOIA.\n  During the course of my investigation, a former State Department \nemployee--Mr. Bryan Pagliano--declined to speak to the Judiciary \nCommittee about his work on Secretary Clinton's email server.\n  He pled the Fifth Amendment.\n  We keep hearing that the FBI's inquiry is just a security review and \nnot a criminal inquiry; yet this witness cited his Constitutional right \nagainst self-incrimination to avoid talking about his work on the email \nserver. And he is relying on the Fifth Amendment to withhold his \npersonal emails as well.\n  So naturally we are searching for other ways to get information \nbefore deciding whether it might be appropriate to seek an immunity \norder for his testimony. The most likely source of information without \nforcing the witness to testify would be his emails.\n  Yet the Department has failed to produce any in response to my \nrequest and the request of Chairman Johnson of the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  As a further example of the Department's continued intransigence, I \nrequested all SF-312 ``Classified Non-Disclosure Agreements'' for \nSecretary Clinton, Ms. Huma Abedin, and Ms. Cheryl Mills on August 5, \n2015. My staff met with Department personnel three times since that \nletter and participated in dozens of emails and phone calls in an \neffort to acquire these documents. In addition, after the Department \ncomplained that it had received too many requests from me, my staff \nproduced a prioritized list of requests to assist the Department in \nproducing responses. At number three on that list were the SF-312 \nforms, and at number one are the official emails of Mr. Pagliano.\n  Notably, during conversations with my staff on the subject, \nDepartment personnel stated that they could not locate those forms with \nthe exception of only page 2 of Ms. Abedin's SF-312 exit form. On \nNovember 5, 2015, the Department produced SF-312 entrance forms for \nSecretary Clinton, Ms. Abedin, and Ms. Mills to a FOIA requestor but \nfailed to provide the same to the Committee. Clearly, the documents \nexist.\n  In addition, I am also looking into several State Department \ninspector general and whistleblower reports that suggest that the State \nDepartment does not hold its own employees accountable for human-\ntrafficking and prostitution violations.\n  Earlier this year, the Judiciary Committee led the effort to pass the \nJustice for Victims of Trafficking Act, and I have sent letters to DOJ \nand DHS--and not just the State Department--to ensure that Federal \nemployees are held accountable for soliciting prostitutes.\n  Last week, the minority leader questioned my use of Judiciary \nCommittee resources to conduct these investigations, suggesting that my \nwork in this area is somehow taking away from the committee's other \nwork.\n  Back in September, the Justice Department sent me a letter \ncomplaining that I have sent them almost 100 oversight letters \ncontaining more than 825 questions and document requests--in 2015 \nalone.\n  Since then, my office has sent 11 additional oversight letters to the \nJustice Department, containing more than 65 questions and document \nrequests. So perhaps the minority leader should ask the assistant \nattorney general for legislative affairs at DOJ whether my committee is \nnot doing enough DOJ oversight.\n  The continued intransigence and lack of cooperation make it clear \nthat the Department did not care enough about their Foreign Service \nofficer candidates to ``get in gear'' and begin to produce responses to \nmy oversight letters. Accordingly, I have released my hold on these \nofficer candidates and have escalated to Mr. Shannon.\n  The Department of State's refusal to fully cooperate with my \ninvestigations is unacceptable.\n  As I have noted before on the floor of the Senate, the Department \ncontinues to promise results, but there has been very little or no \nfollow-through. The Department's good faith will be measured in \ndocuments delivered and witnesses provided.\n  My objection is not intended to question the credentials of Mr. \nShannon in any way. However, the Department must recognize that it has \nan ongoing obligation to respond to congressional inquiries in a timely \nand reasonable manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8152-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8152-S8153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REMEMBERING NOHEMI GONZALEZ AND THE VICTIMS OF THE PARIS TERRORIST \n                                ATTACKS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in honoring the life of Nohemi Gonzalez, a 23-\nyear-old senior at California State University, Long Beach who was \ntragically killed during the recent terrorist attacks in Paris.\n  Nohemi grew up in Whittier, CA with her mother, Beatriz, who \ndescribed her as ``very strong and independent,'' even graduating high \nschool early because she couldn't wait to go to college. At Cal State, \nshe chose to study industrial design--recently taking home a second \nplace prize in an international design competition. She was thrilled to \nbe achieving one of her dreams of studying at the Strate School of \nDesign in Paris this semester.\n  Nohemi's professors laud her as a very gifted student--curious, \ndetermined, and incredibly caring. She took on a leadership role as a \nteacher's aide and shop technician for the department of design. \nClassmates remember Nohemi as a mentor and tutor, someone who \nencouraged everyone around her to strive to be the best versions of \nthemselves. Friends say she was a blessing and always had an upbeat, \ncheerful attitude.

Mr. President, I wish to bring attention today to the \n108,000 foster children in our country who right now are waiting to be \nadopted. Of these, more than 14,000 are in California.\n  These are children who cannot safely be reunited with their \nbiological families and are without a permanent place to call home \nthrough absolutely no fault of their own. These are children who are \nwaiting for a family, wanting to belong, and needing our help. Of these \nchildren, more than 20,000 age out of the foster care system every \nyear. They are sent on their way and expected to make it on their own. \nThis is unacceptable.\n  What do we know about their outcomes? It isn't good. Around half of \nfoster youth graduate high school, and less than three percent earn a \ncollege degree. Around a quarter will become homeless after aging out \nof the foster system. Many will find their way into the justice system.\n  Now, imagine a different outcome. Children are meant to be in a \nfamily. All children deserve love, safety, and permanency. No child is \nunadoptable.\n  November marks National Adoption Month, and November 21st is National \nAdoption Day. This highlights not only the need to find loving homes \nfor children who are waiting, but celebrates those who have opened \ntheir hearts and chosen to build their families through adoption. \nChildren in foster care are not just in need, they are waiting for a \nfamily to give their love and to share their joy.\n  In 2014, more than 50,000 children were adopted from foster care. \nWhat adoption means to youth who have been through foster care is best \nsaid in their own words.\n  From Athena, a young lady in Pasadena, CA, who was adopted from \nfoster care: ``Adoption is very dear and important to me. As an older \nyouth in the system, you expect to have no support, let alone adoption \nas an option. But being a part of a family was all I ever wanted and \ndeep down it is what most foster youth want because it means love, \nstability and a place for one to grow and excel in.''\n  And from Cassidy, an adopted teenager in California: ``If you take a \nchance on a foster child by adopting them, you give them a chance to be \nwho they were born to be. Let's make `aging-out' a term no longer \nneeded in the English language.''\n  Darnell, an older teen adopted in California, explains what finding a \npermanent family means to him: ``Adoption means I have a second chance \nat life, I know I am loved and have a safe place to call home. When \nstrangers take you into their home and love you just for who you are; \nyou can relax and live a regular life.''\n  All children in foster care deserve this second chance at having \ntheir forever family and a safe and loving home. I encourage those who \nare interested in learning more about adoption from foster care to \nvisit www.adoptuskids.org.\n  This is also a time to celebrate the many volunteers and mentors who \nprovide a positive, stable relationship for a child going through a \ntime of vast uncertainty. There may not be a simple solution, but we do \nknow what gets us closer.\n  Programs that provide comprehensive resources--tutoring, mentoring, \nmental health services, and adults that build meaningful relationships \nwith youth leads to improved outcomes, including higher rates of \npermanency.\n  Focused family finding efforts that reach out to extended family \nmembers and others who have played a role in the life of the child gets \nresults. That means fewer youth who age out of the system.\n  We can and must do better because 20,000 of our Nation's foster \nchildren aging out of the system each year is simply unacceptable. \nThese are our most vulnerable, the ones recovering from trauma, abuse, \nand neglect. The ones who are at high risk of being sold into child sex \ntrafficking and a number of other terrible outcomes.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure a better \nfuture for foster youth in our country and, as Cassidy, a teenager who \nwas adopted from foster care in California says, make the term ``aging \nout'' one that we no longer need to use. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8153-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JAY S. FISHMAN\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a distinguished \nand outstanding business leader, Mr. Jay S. Fishman, as he steps down \nas chief executive officer of The Travelers Companies on December 1, \n2015.\n  I met Jay during my first term as chairman of the Senate Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs Committee. Jay reached out to the committee \nin the wake of Hurricane Katrina. After handling claims and helping \npeople rebuild their homes and businesses, Jay was interested in \nshaping public policy for how this country handles natural \ncatastrophes. He proposed many innovative and thoughtful ideas on how \nto protect policyholders and taxpayers from what he called ``the next \nbig one.'' I then watched as Jay deftly managed his company during the \nfinancial crisis, not merely weathering the storm, but thriving while \nmany of his competitors were seeking help from the government in the \nform of taxpayer bailouts. Jay never asked what the government could do \nto help Travelers; he always asked how Travelers could help us to \ndevelop better public policy based on the expertise that he and his \ncolleagues could provide.\n  Jay will continue to serve Travelers as executive chairman as he \ncontends with the challenges that come with the diagnosis of ALS. He \nhas handled the diagnosis with great dignity and a steadfast resolve to \nengage, which will surprise no one who knows him. I know he will work \nrelentlessly to promote research that will extend and eventually save \nlives of people who are stricken with this terrible disease.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to this exceptional \nman, a man who passionately engaged in business and public policy, who \nhas led a truly remarkable career and left an indelible impact on those \npeople who were lucky enough to work for him and with him during his \nlong career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8153-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8153-S8154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NOMINATION OF DR. ROBERT CALIFF\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a copy of my remarks to the Senate Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                    NOMINATION OF DR. ROBERT CALIFF\n\n       Today we are reviewing the nomination of Dr. Robert Califf \n     to serve as Commissioner of Food and Drugs. Dr. Califf, \n     congratulations on your nomination. Welcome to you and to \n     your family members who are here. I enjoyed having the \n     opportunity to visit with you in my office.\n       If confirmed to lead the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \n     as its Commissioner, you will be in charge of steering the \n     agency responsible for assuring the safety and effectiveness \n     of our nation's medical products and protecting our country's \n     food supply. That is a huge job. The FDA affects nearly every \n     single American and regulates about a quarter of all consumer \n     spending in the United States--over $4 trillion annually. It \n     is responsible for product areas as diverse as prescription \n     drugs for humans and animals, medical devices, biologics, \n     cosmetics, over-the-counter medications, food, and tobacco. \n     That is a vital mission, and we all want to make sure that \n     the right person is leading it.\n       The president has nominated you to do that job, and like \n     every full-time nominee, you've been through an exhaustive \n     process to make sure that you do not have any conflicts of \n     interest or other problems in your background.\n       Before the president even announced your nomination, there \n     was an extensive vetting process by the White House and the \n     FBI. You also submitted paperwork to the Office of Government \n     Ethics, which carefully reviewed your financial information \n     and found that, with several recusals which you have \n     committed to do, there would not be any remaining conflicts \n     of interest that would prevent you from doing your job. The \n     form you submitted is public and includes every source of \n     income over $200 and every asset worth more than $1,000, and \n     every potential conflict that the Office of Government Ethics \n     determined would require a recusal.\n       You answered 37 pages of questions from our committee, \n     including some confidential questions on financial \n     information, and responded to written follow-up questions. \n     Your responses included over 3,000 pages of articles and \n     lectures my staff reviewed and that any member of the \n     committee could review.\n\n[[Page S8154]]\n\n       You were nominated on September 17. My staff has spent two \n     months carefully reviewing everything you submitted and has \n     not found anything that would call into doubt your ability to \n     lead the FDA fairly and impartially.\n       You come here today with impressive qualifications. You are \n     one the nation's leading cardiologists and have been a \n     professor at one of the nation's top medical schools for over \n     30 years. You are an expert on clinical research and have \n     been recognized by the Institute for Scientific Information \n     as one of the top 10 most cited medical authors, with more \n     than 1,200 peer-reviewed publications. You have experience \n     managing large organizations, including in your current \n     position supervising all of the FDA's work on medical \n     products and tobacco, and in your past work as the founding \n     director of the Duke Clinical Research Institute.\n       Moreover, you have conducted scores of important clinical \n     trials, and you have advised and worked on research with some \n     of the nation's leading pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical \n     companies. So you understand how research gets done in the \n     real world, where there are opportunities for the FDA to help \n     address challenges, and where the FDA needs to get out of the \n     way.\n       I'm eager to hear about your priorities, and how you intend \n     to manage an organization as large and diverse as the FDA. I \n     also think everyone on this committee will have some \n     questions for you. Here are a few of mine.\n       First, I would like to hear what you will do to help ensure \n     that affordable drugs are available to American patients. The \n     FDA's job, of course, is not to set drug prices. It is to \n     make sure that drugs are safe and effective. And I hope \n     you'll agree with me on that. But FDA can help the market \n     lower drug prices by approving generic drugs and other \n     products as quickly as it possibly can, so there is more \n     choice and competition in the market.\n       There are thousands of applications for generic drugs \n     sitting at the FDA, awaiting approval. Addressing this \n     backlog will allow lower-cost drugs to be available for \n     patients. Approval times have gotten worse instead of better. \n     In 2011, the FDA published the median approval time on its \n     website, and it was 30 months. Since then, the FDA has \n     stopped publishing the statistics online, but the Generic \n     Pharmaceutical Association surveyed its members and estimates \n     that the median approval time is now about 48 months. This is \n     despite generic drugmakers agreeing in 2012 to give the FDA \n     approximately $1.6 billion in user fees over 5 years, nearly \n     $1 billion of which the FDA has already collected. I'm eager \n     to hear what you think the FDA can do to improve.\n       Second, there has never been a more exciting time to lead \n     the agency. We know more about biology and medicine than ever \n     before, and that's not likely to stop anytime soon given \n     advancement of regenerative cell therapies, 3D printing, and \n     the president's Precision Medicine Initiative--which is aimed \n     at developing our knowledge so that medical treatments and \n     devices can be tailored to individual patients. For example, \n     Smith & Nephew, a device company I toured in Memphis a few \n     weeks ago, uses 3D printing to make tools that doctors use in \n     approximately 25% of knee replacements.\n       Your job, if confirmed, will be to make sure that FDA \n     regulation is appropriate. Too much regulation could reduce \n     investment in these areas in its track, and not enough \n     regulation could lead to patients getting therapies that are \n     not safe or effective.\n       Your job also will be to make sure the FDA keeps up with \n     science and relies on the expertise outside the FDA when \n     appropriate. Doing that will require you to manage a large \n     and complex organization--not just on the big policies that \n     make headlines, but on the less flashy stuff like hiring and \n     training scientists on the agency's core mission, and \n     integrating information technology in the right ways.\n       There is work to be done. Medical products take more time \n     and money to discover, develop, and reach American patients \n     than ever before, and we hear stories about drugs and devices \n     that are available to patients outside the U.S. before they \n     become available here, often because it is difficult for \n     manufacturers to navigate the FDA's often unclear approval \n     requirements. It often takes over a decade to develop a drug \n     that gains marketing approval in the U.S., and, according to \n     one recent study, the costs have nearly tripled in the last \n     ten years. In 2003, it cost an inflation-adjusted $1 million \n     in capital and out-of-pocket expenses; in 2014, it cost over \n     $2.5 billion.\n       In this Committee, we are working on legislation to help \n     get safe cutting-edge drugs, medical devices and treatments \n     into Americans' medicine cabinets and doctors' offices more \n     quickly, and we hope to move on that by the end of the year. \n     I want to hear what you think the FDA can do to build its \n     capacity and fix the impact of its regulations so that the \n     FDA is a partner in innovation, rather than a barrier.\n       Thank you, and I look forward to hearing your testimony on \n     these important issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8154-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nRECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SANTA \n                                  CRUZ\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating the University of California, Santa Cruz on its 50th \nanniversary and recognizing the outstanding faculty and staff for their \nimmense contributions.\n  For 50 years, UC Santa Cruz has educated, inspired, and helped shape \nthe futures of generations of young people, fostering an environment to \nproduce not only good scholars but also good citizens.\n  Modeled after historic institutions like Oxford, from its earliest \ndays, students have been encouraged to ask questions--to learn how to \nthink for themselves and debate the status quo inside and outside the \nclassroom. Today the university counts among its alumni some of the \nworld's most prolific and influential leaders on everything from \norganic farming to ocean health, from women's rights and medical \nresearch.\n  A half century after its founding, UC Santa Cruz is a world-renowned \nresearch facility at the center of many critical scientific \nbreakthroughs, such as producing the first working draft of the human \ngenome, helping global researchers develop a vaccine for the Ebola \nvirus, and playing a leading role in cancer genome research. The \nuniversity is also home to one of the world's top marine mammal \nresearch centers. Its internationally recognized faculty includes 14 \nmembers of the National Academy of Sciences, 26 fellows of the American \nAcademy of Arts and Sciences, and recipients of the Presidential \nNational Medal of Science and the Benjamin Franklin Medal from the \nFranklin Institute, one of the oldest and most prestigious science \nawards in the world.\n  Anyone who is lucky enough to have visited the UC Santa Cruz campus \nis immediately struck by its beauty. Nestled between the Pacific Ocean \nand redwood forests, the campus offers students a spectacular backdrop \nto their education. Students hike trails to class, elephant seals can \nbe heard in the background, and stunning sunsets can be seen from \nuniversity grounds. These breathtaking surroundings have attracted a \ncreative and passionate student body that has proudly embraced \nenvironmental, social, and political causes--and a sense of humor. In \n1986, the students selected their now-famous official mascot--the \nBanana Slugs.\n  Since 1965, UC Santa Cruz has created an atmosphere of discovery and \nactivism, shaping minds, pushing the frontiers of knowledge, and making \nour world a better place. I congratulate Chancellor George Blumenthal \nand the faculty, staff, alumni, and students of UC Santa Cruz on this \n50th anniversary and wish this extraordinary institution continued \nsuccess in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8154-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8154-S8155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARY CRAWFORD\n\n Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, in honor of National Adoption \nMonth, I want to recognize one member of Montana's community who has \nopened her home and heart to be an adoptive parent. Mrs. Mary Crawford \nis what I believe one of the best Montana has to offer.\n  As an original cosponsor of a resolution to designate November as \nNational Adoption Month and November 21 as National Adoption Day that \npassed the Senate unamiously this week, I could find no better time \nthan this to honor Mary. This month we honor selfless individuals like \nMary who have dedicated themselves toward comforting, protecting, and \nimproving the lives of children they have welcomed into their homes.\n  Like most foster parents who later become adoptive parents, the \nprocess isn't easy, but the resolve of both Mary and husband to \ncontinue to provide a loving home for nine children is nothing short of \nadmirdable. Mary has provided a family which has made a huge difference \nin these childrens' lives--giving them a family for life, beyond just \ntheir childhood years. These children are safe today in the arms of \nloving, adopting parents because of Mary.\n  Montana has kids who are ready and waiting to be adopted. In fact, \nthere are 415,000 children currently in the U.S. Foster Care System, \nand 108,000 of those are waiting to be adopted. Mary has taken \ntremendous steps in providing six children with a forever home to give \nthem the stability and love that she and her husband could provide.\n\n[[Page S8155]]\n\n  I am unbelievably proud to have a citizen like Mary Crawford in the \ngreat State of Montana.

I am pleased to see this commission, which \ncontributes so much in support of Nevada's Native American community, \nreach this significant milestone.\n  The Nevada Indian Commission has been a positive force in communities \nacross our State. The commission continues to serve as a forum for \nNevada's Native American population, bringing important issues \naffecting this community to light. I am grateful to have the Nevada \nIndian Commission serving as an important liaison between Nevada's 27 \ntribal communities and our State's government.\n  The Nevada Indian Commission was established in 1965 as a means to \nmaintain a positive quality of life for our State's Native Americans. \nThose that serve on the commission work to bring greater awareness of \nNevada's many tribes' cultures, values, and customs. The commission \ndevotes countless hours to improving education, employment, heath, \nwell-being, and socioeconomic status by advocating on behalf of \nNevada's Native Americans, while communicating with local officials. \nThe commission has five board members working to strengthen economic \nopportunity and community development. I am thankful for their \nleadership and for the great things they are doing for this community.\n  The Federal Government has unique and important responsibilities to \ntribes and their people. That responsibility is something I take \nseriously as one of Nevada's Senators, which is why I have supported \npolicies in Congress focused on promoting tribal self-governance and \nself-determination. Just recently, the Senate passed a resolution \nrecognizing November as National Native American Heritage Month. As a \nproud original cosponsor of this resolution, I was pleased to see it \npass to celebrate the heritages and cultures of Native Americans and \ntheir contributions to the United States and Nevada.\n  For the past 50 years, the Nevada Indian Commission has proven its \nunwavering dedication to our state. The hard work of those that have \nserved this Commission has greatly contributed to the positive impact \nthe Native American community has had across Nevada. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in honoring the Nevada Indian Commission on its \n50th anniversary and thanking the commission for all it does for the \nSilver State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8155-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATING PROFESSOR ANA DOUGLASS\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate \nProfessor Ana Douglass on receiving the 2015 Carnegie Foundation for \nthe Advancement of Teaching Nevada Professor of the Year award. This \naccolade is truly prestigious, attained by only the most influential of \nNevada's educators. The Silver State is truly fortunate to have \nProfessor Douglass working at Truckee Meadows Community College, TMCC.\n  The State Professors of the Year Awards Program, sponsored by the \nCarnegie Foundation, recognizes educators who go above and beyond in \ntheir career. These professors have an extraordinary dedication to \nundergraduate teaching as proven through their relationships with \nstudents, approach in helping their students learn, contributions to \nundergraduate education, and support from students and colleagues at \ntheir institutions. These educators' unwavering commitment to their \nstudents is unparalleled and has not gone unnoticed.\n  Professor Douglass is the first faculty member of a Nevada community \ncollege to receive this prestigious award. She has served at TMCC for \n19 years, working not only as an English professor, but also as a \nleader among her peers. As a teacher, Professor Douglass is dedicated \nto motivating her students to be the best they can be by challenging \nthem in their studies. She is also a mentor to many hardworking \nstudents, serving as an example of excellence in education for the TMCC \ncommunity.\n  As the father of four children and as the husband of a teacher, I \nunderstand the important role educators play in enriching the lives of \nNevadans. Ensuring students throughout the Silver State are prepared to \ncompete in the 21st century is critical for the future of our country. \nThe State of Nevada is fortunate to be home to educators like Professor \nDouglass.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in thanking Professor \nDouglass for her dedication to enriching the lives of Nevada's students \nand congratulating her on receiving this award.

Mr. President, at the end of the fall season, we see \nthe culmination of youth athletics across the country. In each sport, \nwhether it is field hockey, football, soccer, or the like, we as \nparents and spectators see the aggregation of hard work, sportsmanship, \nand perseverance come together to produce outstanding championship \nathletes. Today I wish to draw attention to all of the talented Maine \nyouths who won athletic championships across the State this year. In \nparticular, I would like to congratulate the members of the Lewiston \nHigh School Blue Devils boys' soccer team, who on the path to their \nundefeated regular season and recent state championship victory have \ndemonstrated remarkable levels of teamwork and sportsmanship.\n  The Blue Devils' achieved victory through an impressive display of \ntalent and teamwork. Throughout their regular season the team scored a \ntotal of 114 goals, consistently demonstrated their strong defense, and \nearned recognition when USA Today ranked them 22nd in the country. The \nteam's display of unity, patience, and determination in the state final \nagainst Scarborough High School was a fitting conclusion to a stunning \nseason of hard work.\n  During two prior seasons, the Blue Devils earned their way to the \nState finals but each time returned home without the win. Following \ntheir defeat last November, Lewiston High School coach Mike McGraw \nvowed to his team that they would return and they would win. This year, \nthat promise was fulfilled.\n  But the story of the Blue Devils' win is not solely one of raw \nathletic talent and training. This is a team with a long history and \ndeep friendships that have spanned many years and continents. A number \nof the players originally hail from Somalia and have known each other \nand played soccer together since they were children in a refugee camp \nin Kenya. Others--native Mainers and immigrants alike--have bonded and \nshared their passion for the sport since grade school. This fraternal \nbond between the players and the supportiveness of the Lewiston \ncommunity is a fine example of Maine citizens from diverse ethnic, \nreligious, and experiential backgrounds coming together to achieve \nvictory while championing Maine's spirit and America's highest ideals \nof inclusiveness and unity.\n  I wish to join the city of Lewiston and the entire Maine community in \ncongratulating the Lewiston High School boys' soccer team for their \nwell-earned success. They demonstrated impressive athletic ability, \nincredible determination, loyalty to their coach and one another, and \nhave highlighted the richness that multiculturalism brings to our \ncommunities. The Blue Devils have earned their title as champions in \nmore ways than one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8155-4", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8155-S8156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL BOB HARTER\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I acknowledge COL Bob \nHarter of the United States Army Reserve as he is promoted to brigadier \ngeneral, effective November 8, 2015.

Bob lived in Alaska in the \nmid-1970s, when Bob's father was stationed at Fort Wainwright. While \nBob has spent the last 27 years serving his country both at home and \nabroad, he has always maintained his Alaskan residence and remains the \nson of a proud Alaska family. In fact, both Bob and his father travel \nto Cordova, AK, every summer to spend time on the family boat, fishing \nand enjoying ``the last frontier.''\n  BG Bob Harter is the incoming director of the Office, Chief Army \nReserve, OCAR, Staff. He was previously assigned to the Army's chief of \nstaff transition team, where he provided a total force perspective for \nGEN Mark Milley, the newly assigned chief of staff of the Army. As the \ndirector of the OCAR Staff, Brigadier General Harter will be \nresponsible for synchronizing the actions of the 400-person Army \nReserve headquarters based out of Fort Belvoir, VA, in support of the \nchief of Army Reserve's priorities.\n  A graduate of Virginia Tech, Brigadier General Harter began his \nmilitary career in 1988 as an artillery officer, assigned to the 11th \nArmored Cavalry Regiment, ACR, in Bad Hersfeld, Germany.\n  While assigned to the 11th ACR, Brigadier General Harter participated \nin multiple border security missions prior to the fall of the Berlin \nWall and German reunification.

While in Iraq, Brigadier General Harter served as \nthe 316th's distribution management chief, responsible for \nsynchronizing logistics support to the more than 150,000 military \nmembers operating in Iraq.\n  Upon redeployment from Iraq, Brigadier General Harter attended the \nNational War College at Fort McNair, Washington, DC, and was \nsubsequently assigned as branch chief in the Force Protection Division, \nJ8, of the Joint Staff. While in the J8, Brigadier General Harter was \nresponsible for vetting the mine-resistant ambush protected, MRAP, and \ncounter improvised explosive device requirements in support of Central \nCommand, CENTCOM, operations.\n  In 2011, Brigadier General Harter became the executive officer for \nthe chief, Army Reserve, and, in 2013, assumed duties as the Office, \nChief Army Reserve assistant chief of staff.\n  Brigadier General Harter's awards include the Legion of Merit, the \nBronze Star, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, and the parachutist \nand air assault badges. Brigadier General Harter is a graduate of the \nNational War College. He lives in Stafford, VA, with his wife, Erin, \nalso a Virginia Tech graduate, and his three children: Anna, 20, \ncurrently a sophomore at the University of Virginia; Bobby, 16; and \nJack, 14.\n  It is only fair and proper to acknowledge the unwavering support of \nhis wife, Erin, and their three children, as they enabled him to work \ntirelessly on his assigned duties throughout his career and will \nundoubtedly continue to do so for many years to come. Let us thank them \nall for their sacrifices and wish them continued success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8156-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO REVEREND SCOTT FISHER\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this weekend the interior Alaska \ncommunity will honor the Rev. Scott Fisher, the rector and senior \npastor of St. Matthew's Episcopal Church in downtown Fairbanks on the \noccasion of his retirement. St. Matthew's is not just any church. It is \none of the three oldest churches in Fairbanks, a beautiful log building \noverlooking the Chena River. It is a diverse congregation, the \nspiritual home of the Athabascan community of interior Alaska. And \nScott Fisher is not just any pastor. All who know Scott would agree \nthat he reflects all that is good and all that is holy. Easy to talk to \nand calming in manner, Scott is respected by people of all faiths for \nhis strength, compassion, and humanity.\n  There is an old plaque on the door of St. Matthew's that reads: ``To \nall who are joyful and thankful--to all who mourn and need comfort--to \nall who are weary and need rest--to all who are friendless and wish \nfriendship--to all who pray and to all who do not but ought--to all who \nsin and need a Savior and to whosoever will--this church opens wide the \ndoor and in the name of Christ the Lord says welcome.'' And under Scott \nFisher's leadership, that was so. This is a church where newcomers feel \nwelcome immediately.\n  The Rev. Scott Fisher has served as rector of St. Matthew's Episcopal \nChurch since June 1991. He arrived in Alaska, through the legendary \nBishop William Jones Gordon, Jr., as a volunteer layworker in October \n1970 and lived in the interior villages of Chalkyitsik, Stevens \nVillage, and Beaver before leaving for seminary under Bishop Gordon's \ndirection in the summer of 1973. Receiving his M.Div. from the \nEpiscopal Theological Seminary of the Southwest, in Austin, TX, he \nreturned to the interior of Alaska, working for the church in Fort \nYukon and Beaver before moving into the diocesan office. He was an \nassistant to the bishop, traveling and working extensively throughout \nthe interior and Arctic coast, before coming to St. Matthew's in the \nsummer of 1991.\n  I want to take this opportunity to thank Rev. Scott Fisher for the \npowerful contribution he has made to life in interior Alaska and to \nwish him well in retirement. I know that I speak for the entire \ncommunity in telling you that your departure leaves a large hole in our \nhearts, and we shall miss you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8156-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8156-S8157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATING BEATRIZ R.

In addition to her work at Coke, Ms. Perez spends \na great deal of time giving back to the Atlanta community as a trustee \nfor the Save the Children Foundation and a board member for Children's \nHealthcare of Atlanta.\n  At Coca-Cola, working with the company's top leaders and nonprofits \nfrom around the world, Ms. Perez directs efforts that seek to build \ncooperation in the ``golden triangle of government, business and civil \nsociety.'' Ms. Perez is working with local governments around the world \nto continue the company's stewardship of natural resources through the \ndevelopment of water projects in nearly 100 countries, working with \ncommunities to advance and empower economic opportunities for women, \nand continuing the company's efforts in the distribution of more than \n10 billion fully recyclable PlantBottleTM packages across 24 \ncountries, which eliminates the need for the equivalent of more than \n200,000 barrels of oil.\n  In 2014, Ms. Perez was named as one of the 10 Most Powerful Women in \nSustainability by Green Building & Design magazine. She has been \nfeatured as one of the 25 Most Powerful Latinas on CNN en Espanol and \nin People en Espanol, and is a member of the American Advertising Hall \nof Achievement\n\n[[Page S8157]]\n\nand the Sports Business Journal's Hall of Fame.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize \nBetty Russell Vandiver, wife of former Gov. Ernest Vandiver, who served \nas first lady of Georgia from 1959 to 1963. When Mrs. Vandiver became \nfirst lady, Central State Hospital in Milledgeville served as Georgia's \nonly State hospital for the mentally ill and developmentally disabled. \nIn the late 1950s, Central State Hospital was home to more than 12,000 \nclients, many of whom had been abandoned by their families at an early \nage.\n  Upon visiting the hospital, Mrs. Vandiver became very concerned about \nthe plight of the clients and their living conditions. She determined \nthat she would devote much of her time and energy as first lady to \nraise public awareness of the needs of Georgia's mentally ill and \ndevelopmentally disabled.\n  One of Mrs. Vandiver's initiatives to show care and concern for the \nclients at Central State Hospital was to work with the Georgia \nMunicipal Association to create a statewide Christmas gift collection \ndrive known as the Mayors' Motorcade, which was established in 1959 and \nexpanded years later to support the clients of the State's regional \nhospitals. Each year, caring Georgians support the Mayors' Motorcade by \ndonating gifts to cities participating in the program.\n  Through Mrs. Vandiver's efforts, thousands of clients residing at \nGeorgia's State hospitals have received Christmas gifts and visits from \ncity officials at special Motorcade events.\n  Today it is my pleasure to honor Mrs. Vandiver for having the vision \nto create the program as a way of providing not only gifts but also \nraising public awareness about the needs of Georgia's mentally ill and \ndevelopmentally disabled.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8157-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING CHIEF VERNON ASHLEY\n\n Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate and reflect \non the life and legacy of Vernon Ashley who passed away on November 10, \n2015.\n  Vernon Ashley was born on January 15, 1916, at the mouth of Wolf \nCreek along the banks of the Missouri River near present day Fort \nThompson, SD. In 1946, after serving in the Army Air Corps during World \nWar II, Vernon was elected tribal chairman of the Crow Creek Sioux \nTribe. As chairman, he was credited both with helping to author the \ntribe's first constitution and bylaws and for working to preserve \ntribal lands for his people during the Federal Government's flood \ncontrol projects of the 1940s and 50s. He was a servant to his people \nof the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe and to his fellow South Dakotans. After \nnearly 10 years of working for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Vernon \nwent to work for South Dakota as the first Indian Affairs coordinator, \nserving in that role under three different Governors. He was a fluent \nDakota speaker whose Dakota name was Sinkpe, which means muskrat. This \npast July, the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe honored him by making him a \nchief.\n  The eagle bone whistle was traditionally used by some Plains Indian \nwarrior societies. When Vernon and his fellow veterans were honored at \nhis memorial services, several people heard the sound of the eagle bone \nwhistle even though no one was playing one. Therefore, may the sound of \nthe eagle bone whistle be with us, too, when we need to be inspired to \nbe brave and do what is right for the people we serve.\n  Chief Vernon Ashley will be remembered by all for his humility, for \nbeing a man of faith, and for his friendship to so many. With this, I \nwelcome the opportunity to recognize and commemorate the life and \nlegacy of this good friend of mine, a great leader, Chief Vernon \nAshley. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8157-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8157-4", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8157-5", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8157-S8158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 11:45 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 2262.

A bill to promote the strengthening of the private sector in \nBosnia and Herzegovina; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, on November 21, the world will mark the \n20th anniversary of the Dayton Agreement, which ended the conflict in \nBosnia and Herzegovina that began in April 1992.\n  Last July, the Senator from New Hampshire and I had the privilege and \ndistinct honor of being part of a delegation of House and Senate \nMembers to visit Srebrenica as part of the official U.S. delegation to \nremember the genocide in Srebrenica on its 20th anniversary. So a few \nmonths later in November, we commemorate a happy occasion, a positive \ndevelopment in the history of Europe and in international relations, \nthe Dayton Accords.\n  I commend a bipartisan duo for securing approval within the United \nStates. President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, and Speaker Newt Gingrich, \na Republican, were both instrumental--along with a host of others--in \npersuading on a nonpartisan basis Americans and American Congressmen to \nsupport this agreement, which involved a bit of risk for the United \nStates. It involved troops of the United States going into this area \nand risking their safety in order to make this accord work. So I \nappreciate this, and on the 20th anniversary of that agreement and \ntheir leadership, I commend them.\n  The Dayton Agreement was part of a response to a conflict that helped \nthe international community transition from a world divided between \nEast and West in order to meet post-Cold War challenges.\n  I wish to mention three accomplishments of the Dayton Accords and \nthen Senator Shaheen will speak for a few monuments about that aspect. \nThen we will talk about some legislation that she and I have had the \nhonor and privilege of working on together as a result of this trip \nthat she and I took, along with others, to commemorate this tragedy in \nSrebrenica.\n\n[[Page S8163]]\n\n  Back to the Dayton Accords, among the accomplishments is a successful \nand robust peacekeeping force under NATO, which actually replaced the \nU.N. peacekeeping group with a NATO command group. It was deployed for \nthe first time, and NATO also intervened out of area for the first time \nto make peace.\n  Secondly, persons were held accountable for war crimes on an \ninternational basis--crimes against humanity and genocide. This is the \nfirst time this had happened since World War II.\n  Third, international cooperation on demining and a concerted search \nfor missing persons became essential parts of post-conflict recovery.\n  Dayton also put the OSCE on center stage--the Organization for \nSecurity and Co-operation in Europe, of which I am a committee chair \nrepresenting the United States of America. The Accord mandated that the \nOSCE oversee arms control efforts and develop confidence-building \nmeasures within Bosnia and regionally and make it possible for a \ncountry divided and almost destroyed by war to hold elections in a \nreasonably Democratic manner.\n  So let's celebrate that accomplishment, and I am sure the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire will have some more important insights to offer at \nthis point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be on the floor \nwith my friend and colleague from Mississippi to talk about Bosnia-\nHerzegovina and about our trip to commemorate the horrible massacre in \nSrebrenica that occurred in 1995. As Senator Wicker has said, that was \na very moving trip for us.\n  One of the things that was very particular to New Hampshire that I \nfound hopeful was listening to the very young mayor from Srebrenica, \nthe current mayor, whose name is Camil Durakovic. He had actually spent \na number of years in New Hampshire and had gone to Southern New \nHampshire University. His family had fled after the massacre in Bosnia \nand came to New Hampshire. He went back in 2005 and was elected mayor. \nOne of the things he talked about was the need to work with Serbia, to \nwork across the ethnic and religious lines in Bosnia to achieve peace. \nIt was, as Senator Wicker said, so heartening to think that we were \nactually able to get these Dayton Accords that ended that long conflict \nin Bosnia--very bitter and bloody--and see some real progress.\n  One of the things we talked about on the flight back with President \nClinton and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was what we \ncould do to help Bosnia continue to progress and move forward, because \none of their challenges is economic. This is a country that has a very \nhigh level of education, and it has a lot of young people who need \nopportunities for the future. So we talked about whether there was a \nway that we in Congress could look at trying to provide some economic \nhelp for Bosnia in the future.\n  We came back and looked at how we could work together to come up with \nan idea that might be successful. What we came up with--and it was \nanother tremendous bipartisan effort--was to look at the enterprise \nfunds that were done after the fall of the Soviet Union and some of the \nEastern European countries. Enterprise funds were funds passed by \nCongress with bipartisan support that helped those fledgling private \nsector economies begin to recover after the fall of the Soviet Union.\n  So we took that model--a U.S. enterprise fund--and focused on Bosnia-\nHerzegovina, and this is the legislation that we are going to be \nintroducing. I don't know how Senator Wicker feels about it, but I \nthink this offers real opportunity to Bosnia because we can leverage a \nvery small amount of public resources through the private sector, \nthrough other local funds that might be available in Bosnia, and see \nreal progress on the economic front that will help create jobs that \nwill help those young people stay in the country and build a strong \ncountry.\n  So for my friend from Mississippi, I think this is a very good way to \nprovide some of the assistance they are going to need. Would the \nSenator agree?\n  Mr. WICKER. I certainly agree with my colleague from New Hampshire, \nand I commend her for her leadership in getting this legislation \ndrafted.\n  It is an opportunity to provide a very meaningful chance for Bosnians \nand Herzegovinians to live the good life and remain in the area, but it \nis also in the absolute national security interests of the United \nStates of America. We can't tend to everything, but we saw 20 years \nago--25 years ago and forward--with the war in the Balkans what could \nhappen and what almost happened to security in all of Europe. We know \nthis has been a flash point down through the decades and even the \ncenturies. To the extent that we can address some things that we didn't \nget done at Dayton, this will help people in the region and the former \nYugoslavia and also help the United States of America.\n  The Dayton Agreement was a crowning achievement, but it didn't \nprovide Bosnia with a constitutional framework and political structures \nthat could effectively govern on into the 21st century. And the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire and I certainly saw that. We were meeting with the \ntripartite head of the government after the ceremony we attended.\n\n  Dan Serwer of Johns Hopkins University recently observed:\n\n       We imposed the Dayton Accords, but we imposed what the \n     ethic nationalist warring parties told us they could live \n     with. It is therefore unsurprising that one way or another, \n     ethnic nationalists have dominated Bosnia almost \n     continuously, making it ungovernable, since 1995.\n\n  So we are hoping the Bosnians and Herzegovinians can address this \nissue, and while they are doing that, our legislation would establish \nan enterprise fund directed by a board of American investment \nprofessionals capable of leveraging both public and private funding to \nprovide entrepreneurs access to the same kinds of loans and investment \nopportunities afforded to small- and medium-sized businesses here in \nthe United States.\n  By strengthening the private sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina, this \nlegislation would help create space to continue moving forward on the \npolitical reforms I just alluded to. As the Senator said, it would \nestablish an enterprise fund modeled after U.S. programs that supported \ncentral and eastern European economies after the fall of the Berlin \nWall, with approximately $10 billion of public and private funding.\n  I would also point out that this legislation doesn't score as an \nexpense. I think we are being very frugal with the authorization we are \nproviding to the Congress to build on this, if our legislation passes.\n  Per capita income in Bosnia and Herzegovina averages less than $5,000 \nannually. And that is a shame 20 years after the Dayton Accords. \nCompare this $5,000-a-year per capita to $13,000 a year right across \nthe border in neighboring Croatia. The unemployment rate stands at 40 \npercent.\n  Things are at a critical juncture in this country, and that is why I \nthink our trip over there with former President Clinton and with former \nSecretary Albright and Members from the House of Representatives came \nat such an important time and prompted us to work together on \nlegislation to help make the situation better for individuals over \nthere but also help make our national security stronger and more \nreliable here in America.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, as my colleague from Mississippi points \nout, this really is critical not just to Bosnia and its future, but \nthis is also about the national security of the United States.\n  My colleague talked about the Balkans. We know World War I began in \nthe Balkans. We know it has continued to be a part of Europe where \nRussian aggression and Russian efforts to subvert the governments there \ncontinue, they continue their activity. It is a place where we have a \nnumber of different ethnic groups and where different religions \nconverge. So it is a place we need to keep supporting--Bosnia and \nHerzegovina. We need to look at how we can help them ensure their \ncontinued progress toward the West and Europe and also toward economic \nprosperity.\n  I traveled there in 2010 with former Senator Voinovich from Ohio, who \nhad done a lot of work on the Balkans when he was in the Senate. I will \nnever forget a lunch we had with a number of young people there, mostly \ncollege students or recent graduates. We talked to them about what they \nsaw for the future of the country, and there was so\n\n[[Page S8164]]\n\nmuch hopelessness in that conversation because they didn't see the \nkinds of opportunities we want young people to see as they are thinking \nabout their futures and their children and what is going to happen in \ntheir country. So I think this is a partial answer to how we can help \nthem provide that economic prosperity they are looking forward to.\n  Finally, I think what has happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina with the \nDayton Accords--for all of its flaws, it is a model we can look to as \nwe are looking at the challenges we face in Syria. The Bosniaks, the \nSerbs, the Croatians, the Muslims, the Orthodox Christians, and the \nRoman Catholics all came together and they agreed to end the conflict \nin Bosnia. They agreed to try to build a successful democracy and a \nstrong economy to create a successful multiethnic, multisectarian state \nunder very difficult circumstances. And while we need to continue to \nlook at how the Dayton Accords should change, it is still a milestone \nin what happened with that conflict and I think serves as a model for \nso many other regions in the world where there is conflict.\n  Mr. WICKER. The Senator from New Hampshire makes two very salient \npoints I do want to underscore. And it pains me that we have to be on \nthe floor of the Senate this afternoon talking about an aggressive \nRussia. Russia was trying to help 20 years ago in the Dayton Accords. \nThey were trying to be part of getting things done. This is no longer \nthe case. Russia and some of the few countries aligned with their \ninterests now seem to be trying more to block effective responses to \nthe international problems.\n  In addition, some of the aggression of Russia in Ukraine, for \nexample, is eerily, troublingly reminiscent of some language in \nprevious decades--talk of violating a neighbor's sovereignty, \nterritory, and claiming they are doing nothing more than defending a \nthreatened local ethnic population. That is troubling and familiar \nrhetoric from a very dangerous past time. So I would underscore the \nSenator's point there about Russia.\n  Before I toss this back to her to close, I would simply say this \nabout her comments about American leadership. No one could have made \nthis work except the United States of America in the early 1990s and in \nthe mid-1990s. There was one people on the face of the Earth, and that \nwas the Americans. The world turned to us, and we stopped a \nconflagration in Europe that was about to get out of hand.\n  With regard to Syria, I am so glad my friend mentioned this. The \nUnited States is being looked to internationally for leadership. No one \nelse can provide that leadership. Again, it is incumbent on us to help \npeople who are suffering in other locations, and we want to do that if \nwe can, to the extent we can afford it. But we need to act with \nleadership on behalf of the United States of America, on behalf of our \nown citizens, on behalf of our own national defense interests and the \ninterest of every American to live in the absence of fear from \nterrorism and the attacks and ill wishes of those who would cause us \ninjury, if they possibly could.\n  I very much appreciate her point about American leadership, and I \nknow this will not be done unless we do it across the aisle. It is why \nit means so much to me to take the floor this afternoon in this \ncolloquy, with a Democratic Senator from New Hampshire and I, a \nRepublican Senator from Mississippi, pushing in the same direction and \nasking for American leadership.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank my colleague. As you point out, we represent \ntwo very different parts of the country.\n  Mr. WICKER. Although we both are Ole Miss graduates.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. We are. We share that. The fact is, this is a \nbipartisan issue. As my colleague points out, the United States \nbrokered that historic agreement in Dayton. We were the only country \nthat could really take that leadership, and we need to continue that \nrole in the world.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Wicker as we try to move this \nbipartisan bill to support Bosnia and Herzegovina and continuing to be \nvigilant on efforts to undermine democratic values wherever they exist \nin the world, and certainly this is one place where we can provide help \nin a way that is very important.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. WICKER. And I thank the Senator from New Hampshire.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DAINES (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Lee, Mr. \n        Rubio, Mr. Lankford, Mr. Perdue, Mr. Vitter, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 2310. A bill to allow a State to submit a declaration of intent to \nthe Secretary of Education to combine certain funds to improve the \nacademic achievement of students; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, as a fifth-generation Montanan and product \nof Montana public schools, I understand how important a first rate \neducation is to our kids' future. By increasing local control of our \nschools and lessening the influence Washington bureaucrats, we can \nprovide States with the flexibility needed to meet the unique needs of \nour students and communities. That is why I am introducing the Academic \nPartnerships Lead Us to Success, or A-PLUS, Act. By shifting control \nback to the states, individual and effective solutions can be created \nto address the multitude of unique challenges facing schools across the \ncountry. Through these ``laboratories of democracy,'' Americans can \nwatch and learn how students can benefit when innovative reforms are \nimplemented on the local level. The A-PLUS Act would give states \ngreater flexibility in allocating federal education funding and \nensuring academic achievement in their schools. With A-PLUS, States \nwould be freed from unworkable teacher standards, Washington-knows-best \nperformance metrics, and onerous Federal testing requirements that have \nfailed to bring about promised improvements in academic achievement. \nStates would be held accountable by parents and teachers because a \nbright light would shine directly on the decisions made by State \ncapitals and local school districts. With freedom from Federal mandates \ncomes more responsibility, transparency, and accountability on States. \nStates would need to adhere to all civil rights laws and work towards \nadvancing educational opportunities for disadvantaged children as well. \nThis legislation would go a long ways towards returning the \nresponsibility for our kids' education closer to home and reduces the \ninfluence of the Federal Government over our classrooms. I want to \nthank Senators Grassley, Cruz, Lee, Rubio, Lankford, and Perdue for \nbeing original cosponsors of this bill and I ask my other Senate \ncolleagues to join us in support of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Booker, and Ms. \n        Hirono):\n  S. 2323.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2323\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge, \nlocated in the State of Washington, as the Billy Frank Jr. Nisqually \nNational Wildlife Refuge, to establish the Medicine Creek Treaty \nNational Memorial within the wildlife refuge, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, last year the Pacific Northwest, and the \nNation lost one of our greatest civil rights heroes with the passing of \nBilly Frank, Jr. It is clear a great leader has been lost when an \nentire community shows up to commemorate his life and celebrate his \nspirit. I attended Billy's memorial, along with Senator Murray and \n6,000 others, and was honored to have the chance to pay tribute to the \nman who fought for the civil rights of Native Americans, the principles \nof environmental stewardship, and the importance of salmon recovery and \npreservation in the Pacific Northwest.\n  Today, I am introducing the Billy Frank Jr. Tell Your Story Act, \nwhich would change the name of the Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge \nto the ``Billy Frank Jr. Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge.'' In \naddition, this legislation would create a national memorial to \ncommemorate the signing of the Medicine Creek Treaty, the treaty that \nBilly Frank fought so hard to enforce, within the refuge. The wildlife \nrefuge sits adjacent to the Nisqually Reservation where Billy grew up \nand lived, and contains the estuary and salmon that Billy devoted his \nlife to protecting.\n  Billy Frank, Jr. just wanted to fish. He was a fisherman to his core, \nand that's how he wanted history to remember him. Everyone who knew \nBilly would want us to remember him as the legend that walked and \nfished among us. Given his life, his legacy, and the way he changed \nWashington State and the Nation, it is only right that we honor his \nlegacy by forever linking his name to the Nisqually National Wildlife \nRefuge.\n  Along with his advocacy for protecting Tribal treaty rights, Billy \nFrank changed the way we look at the environment. Because of his \nadvocacy, we now have environmental restoration efforts throughout the \nPuget Sound, including at the Nisqually River Delta, the largest tidal \nmarsh rehabilitation in the Northwest. Additionally, we have the Puget \nSound Partnership, a Tribal and public-private partnership dedicated to \nimprove the health of our Puget Sound. Billy understood that we have a \nsacred responsibility to be stewards of our environment, and that we \nmust leave it for future generations in better condition than it was \nleft to us.\n  The Billy Frank Jr. Tell Your Story Act has the support of the \nNisqually Tribe and the neighboring Puyallup Tribe, along with the \nAffiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, the National Congress of \nAmerican Indians, and the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission. A \ncompanion bill introduced by Congressman Denny Heck has been approved \nby the House Natural Resources Committee and is awaiting consideration \nby the House. I urge its passage in the Senate, especially given the \nrecent decision by President Obama to posthumously award Billy the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom.\n  Billy grew up listening to the stories of his father and others \nbelonging to the Nisqually and other tribes. Routinely harassed for \nfishing his tribe's namesake Nisqually River with nets, Willie Frank, \nSr. recalled a warden telling him, ``Your treaty isn't worth the paper \nit's printed on.'' Billy's father always told him, ``Just keep fishing. \nEven if they arrested you, just keep fishing. Even if they beat you \njust keep fishing. Keep fishing and claim what was promised in the in \nthe Medicine Creek Treaty.'' By changing the name of the Nisqually \nwildlife refuge, we will not only honor the fisherman that fought to \nprotect the land and its people, but we will make this land better than \nit was left to us, just like Billy Frank, Jr. would have wanted.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 2331. A bill to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to make \ninvalid and unenforceable predispute arbitration agreements with \nrespect to controversies arising under provisions of such Act and to \npreserve the rights of servicemembers to bring class actions under such \nAct, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, our Nation has a strong tradition of \nensuring that our service members are protected while they serve to \nkeep us safe. As the challenges facing our service members change, we \nmust work to ensure that our laws continue to keep pace. In this \nregard, I have worked with my colleagues over the years to strengthen \nthe protections for service members and their families under the \nServicemember Civil Relief Act, SCRA.\n  Today, I am joined by Senator Graham in introducing on a bipartisan \nbasis legislation to further enhance SCRA protections. The SCRA Rights \nProtection Act seeks to protect service members from being forced to \naccept mandatory arbitration clauses as part of everyday transactions, \nsuch as those relating to mortgage origination, automobile leases, and \nstudent loans. Often service members sign contracts that include \narbitration clauses buried in the fine print, and this eliminates their \naccess to the courts, which can limit their ability to assert their \nrights and reach a fair resolution. In disputes involving SCRA rights, \nthis bill would make arbitration clauses unenforceable unless all \nparties consent to arbitration after the dispute arises, and would also \nensure that service members retain their right to join with other \nservice members to file a case together as a class.\n  I urge our colleagues to join us in supporting this improvement to \nthe SCRA, which will better protect our military families while the men \nand women of our Armed Forces protect our nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/senate-section/article/S8165-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 319--DESIGNATING NOVEMBER 29, 2015, AS ``DRIVE SAFER \n                                SUNDAY''\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON (for himself and Mr. Coons) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Con. Res. 25\n\n       Whereas the United States is party to the United Nations \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change, with annexes, done at \n     New York May 9, 1992, and entered into force March 21, 1994 \n     (in this resolution referred to as the ``Convention'');\n       Whereas the Convention requires the United States to \n     ``adopt national policies and take corresponding measures on \n     the mitigation of climate change, by limiting its \n     anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases,'' but does not \n     require the United States to commit to specific targets or \n     timetables for emissions reductions;\n       Whereas, during the Convention's advice and consent process \n     in the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate (in this \n     resolution referred to as the ``Foreign Relations \n     Committee'') a question arose whether future protocols made \n     pursuant to the Convention ``containing targets and \n     timetables'' for emissions reductions should be submitted to \n     the Senate for advice and consent;\n       Whereas the Foreign Relations Committee submitted a written \n     question, ``Would a protocol containing targets and \n     timetables be submitted to the Senate?'' to which the \n     Executive Branch responded, ``If such a protocol were \n     negotiated and adopted, and the United States wished to \n     become a party, we would expect such a protocol to be \n     submitted to the Senate.'';\n       Whereas the Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by Senator \n     Claiborne Pell, issued Executive Report 102-55 regarding the \n     Convention in which it noted ``that a decision by the \n     Conference of the Parties to adopt targets and timetables \n     would have to be submitted to the Senate for its advice and \n     consent before the United States could deposit its \n     instruments of ratification for such an agreement'';\n       Whereas Executive Report 102-55 further noted ``that a \n     decision by the executive branch to reinterpret the \n     Convention to apply legally binding targets and timetables \n     for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases to the United \n     States would alter the `shared understanding' of the \n     Convention between the Senate and the executive branch and \n     would therefore require the Senate's advice and consent'';\n       Whereas, under the auspices given by the Executive Branch \n     that future agreements made pursuant to the Convention \n     containing targets and timetables for emissions reductions \n     would be submitted to the Senate, the Senate gave its consent \n     to ratification of the Convention on October 7, 1992;\n       Whereas, in December 2011, at the seventeenth session of \n     the Conference of the Parties (COP-17) in Durban, South \n     Africa, the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for \n     Enhanced Action was established, inter alia, ``to develop a \n     protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with \n     legal force'' under the Convention to be completed no later \n     than 2015 and adopted at the twenty-first session of the \n     Conference of the Parties (COP-21);\n       Whereas, subsequent to COP-17, representatives of President \n     Barack Obama, including the Special Envoy for Climate Change, \n     have made public statements indicating that the United States \n     intends to finalize a climate change agreement at COP-21 that \n     contains\n\n[[Page S8167]]\n\n     targets and timetables for emissions reductions;\n       Whereas the Executive Branch has made clear through its \n     public statements that it intends to negotiate a climate \n     change agreement at COP-21 that contains legally binding \n     provisions as well as non-binding provisions--including \n     targets and timetables for emissions reductions--attached as \n     an addendum or schedule to the legally-binding agreement;\n       Whereas the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Laurent \n     Fabius, who will host COP-21, has stated, ``We must find a \n     formula which is valuable for everybody and valuable for the \n     U.S. without going to the Congress.'';\n       Whereas the Department of State developed guidelines known \n     as the Circular 175 Procedure (C-175) to facilitate ``the \n     application of orderly and uniform measures to the \n     negotiation, conclusion, reporting, publication, and \n     registration of U.S. treaties and international agreements'';\n       Whereas C-175, inter alia, set forth eight factors for \n     determining ``whether any international agreement should be \n     brought into force as a treaty or as an international \n     agreement other than a treaty'';\n       Whereas the Executive Branch must give ``due \n     consideration'' to the eight factors outlined in C-175, and \n     ``the utmost care is to be exercised to avoid any invasion or \n     compromise of the constitutional powers of the President, the \n     Senate, and the Congress as a whole'';\n       Whereas the eight factors are as follows: (1) the extent to \n     which the agreement involves commitments or risks affecting \n     the Nation as a whole; (2) whether the agreement is intended \n     to affect State laws; (3) whether the agreement can be given \n     effect without the enactment of subsequent legislation by the \n     Congress; (4) past United States practice as to similar \n     agreements; (5) the preference of the Congress as to a \n     particular type of agreement; (6) the degree of formality \n     desired for an agreement; (7) the proposed duration of the \n     agreement, the need for prompt conclusion of an agreement, \n     and the desirability of concluding a routine or short-term \n     agreement; and (8) the general international practice as to \n     similar agreements;\n       Whereas COP-21 will be held in Paris, France from November \n     30 to December 11, 2015;\n       Whereas, at COP-21, the United States will be expected, \n     inter alia, to commit billions of dollars in taxpayer money \n     to fund the Green Climate Fund and other financial mechanisms \n     to fund mitigation and adaptation projects in developing \n     countries;\n       Whereas the Paris climate change agreement, either in the \n     form contemplated by the President or in its current draft \n     form released on October 5, 2015, by the Ad Hoc Working Group \n     on the Durban Platform, reflects the characteristics of a \n     treaty as set forth in C-175, and does not reflect the \n     characteristics of an international agreement other than a \n     treaty; and\n       Whereas, pursuant to commitments made by the Executive \n     Branch to the Senate during the advice and consent process \n     for the Convention the Executive Branch stated that any \n     protocol containing targets and timetables would be submitted \n     to the Senate: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the statements made by the Executive Branch to the \n     Senate during Senate consideration of the Convention and set \n     forth in Executive Report 102-55 remain valid and in force \n     and, accordingly, any agreement adopted at COP-21 containing \n     targets and timetables, whether deemed ``legally binding'' or \n     not, must be submitted to the Senate for advice and consent \n     pursuant to Article II, section 2 of the Constitution;\n       (2) any agreement or decision made at COP-21 that contains \n     targets and timetables--whether they are contained within a \n     legally-binding instrument or attached as a non-binding \n     schedule or addendum to a legally-binding instrument--shall \n     be considered by the Congress to be an agreement ``containing \n     targets and timetables'';\n       (3) a decision by the Executive Branch made at COP-21 or \n     any other venue to apply targets and timetables for reducing \n     emissions of greenhouse gases to the United States would \n     alter the ``shared understanding'' of the Convention between \n     the Executive Branch and the Senate and would therefore \n     require the Senate's advice and consent;\n       (4) the Department of State developed the ``Circular 175 \n     Procedure'' to determine how international agreements would \n     be negotiated, and the eight factors contained in the \n     Procedure strongly support the conclusion that any agreement \n     made under the Convention that contains targets and \n     timetables for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases must be \n     submitted to the Senate for advice and consent;\n       (5) until all commitments on emissions targets and \n     timetables made at COP-21 are submitted to the Senate for \n     advice and consent and subsequently ratified by the Executive \n     Branch, such commitments shall have no effect on the \n     interpretation of United States law or the international \n     obligations of the United States; and\n       (6) Congress should refuse to consider any budget \n     resolutions and appropriations language that include funding \n     for the Green Climate Fund or any affiliated body or \n     financing mechanism unless and until all agreements on \n     emissions targets and timetables reached at COP-21 are \n     submitted to the Senate for advice and consent.\n\n
