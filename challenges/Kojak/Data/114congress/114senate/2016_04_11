Mr. President, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, \nSenator Thune, says that keeping Americans safe from future attacks is \na top priority. He is right, of course. From Brussels to Egypt, events \naround the world underscore the need for stronger security measures for \nour Nation's air traffic.\n  That is why I was glad when large bipartisan majorities voted last \nweek to advance the FAA Reauthorization Act and then to strengthen it \nfurther with the most comprehensive airline security reforms in years.\n  We appreciate Senator Thune's work with the Aviation Subcommittee \nchair, Senator Ayotte, as well as Senators Nelson and Cantwell, to move \nan amendment designed to keep passengers safer and to help deter \nterrorism in airports on U.S. soil. The amendment will help shore up \nsecurity measures for international flights coming into the United \nStates as well as improve vetting and inspections of airport employees.\n  I would also like to recognize Senator Heinrich for his work to \ninclude provisions that will increase security measures in prescreening \nairport zones and expand preparation for active shooter events.\n  This FAA reauthorization legislation will do more for security than \nany other in years. It will do more for passengers than any other in \nyears as well.\n  Don't take my word for it. A consumer columnist for the Washington \nPost labeled it ``one of the most passenger-friendly Federal Aviation \nAdministration reauthorization bills in a generation.'' It includes a \nnumber of consumer-friendly provisions, like fee disclosures and \nrefunds for lost bags or services paid for but not received, and does \nso without imposing choice-limiting regulations or fees and taxes on \nairline passengers.\n  This is a good bill and a good example of what can get accomplished \nwith a Senate that is back to work. It would help keep Americans safe, \nboth in our airports and in the skies. It has enjoyed support from both \nsides of the aisle.\n  If Members have additional ideas they think might strengthen the bill \nfurther, I would again encourage them to work with the bill managers so \nwe can continue moving forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/11/senate-section/article/S1841-6", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, later today the Senate will confirm Waverly \nCrenshaw to serve as a district judge for the Middle District of \nTennessee.\n  Mr. Crenshaw is a superb nominee with impeccable credentials and a \nsharp legal mind. He works at a prestigious law firm in Nashville, \nwhere he became the first ever African-American partner.\n  Mr. Crenshaw is well liked by Democrats and well liked by \nRepublicans. His nomination is supported by the Republican Senators \nfrom Tennessee, and the Judiciary Committee reported his nomination \nunanimously.\n  Waverly Crenshaw's confirmation is desperately needed. The vacancy he \nwill fill in the Middle District of Tennessee is a judicial emergency, \nmeaning there are more cases than the judges in that district can \nadminister.\n  While I am pleased the Senate will confirm Mr. Crenshaw later today, \nI wonder why this eminently qualified nominee wasn't confirmed a long \ntime ago. It has been more than a year since President Obama nominated \nhim. The Judiciary Committee reported his nomination unanimously more \nthan 9 months ago.\n  That a consensus nominee like Waverly Crenshaw had to wait so long to \nbe confirmed is another example--and not a good one--of Senate \nRepublicans' concerted effort to undermine the American judiciary \nsystem. The Republican leader and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee are leading an all-out assault on our Nation's courts by \ndepriving them of qualified judges.\n  Americans know of Republicans' unprecedented obstruction of President \nObama's Supreme Court nominee,\n\n[[Page S1842]]\n\nMerrick Garland. Republican gridlock is precluding Judge Garland from a \nhearing and a vote. But that same gridlock is extending to important \nlower court nominees also.\n  Republicans' slow-walking and obstruction of circuit and district \ncourt nominees is so pronounced that it is actually making history, and \nI am not sure it is good history.\n  To date, this Republican-controlled Senate has confirmed only 16 \njudicial nominations. Today will be the 17th. According to the \nnonpartisan Congressional Research Service, that is good enough to make \nthis Republican Senate the worst at confirming circuit court and \ndistrict court judges.\n  Chairman Grassley is running the least productive Judiciary Committee \nsince World War II, measured in both judges reported out of committee \nand judges confirmed. Because of the Republicans' sloth, judiciary \nemergencies have nearly tripled, leaving our courts overworked and \nAmericans without prompt access to their judiciary system. Republicans \nare refusing to do their job, and the American people are suffering as \na result. Republican efforts to cripple our judiciary will reverberate \nfor decades, preventing Americans from obtaining justice.\n  It is time for the Republican leader and the senior Senator from Iowa \nto put an end to this obstruction. It is time they discontinue using \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee as a political arm of the Republican \nleader's office and start doing their job. This should begin by doing \ntheir constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on President \nObama's Supreme Court nominee.\n  The Republican leader and Senator Grassley should give Judge Garland \na hearing and a vote. They should stop stalling, hoping that Donald \nTrump or Ted Cruz will nominate Justice Scalia's successor. This should \ngive even Republicans pause.\n  Then the Republican leader and the Judiciary Committee should move \nthe backlog of qualified judicial nominations who are awaiting \nconfirmation--and there are a lot of them--nominees like Paula Xinis, \nwhom President Obama nominated to serve as a judge for the District \nCourt of Maryland. Ms. Xinis, who is a partner in a renowned Baltimore \nlaw firm, has 13 years of experience as a Federal public defender. For \n5 years she worked as the director of training for the Office of the \nFederal Public Defender in all of Maryland.\n  The Judiciary Committee reported Ms. Xinis 7 months ago. Yet, for \nmore than half a year, Senator Grassley has ignored her nomination.\n  She is not alone. The Republican leader is delaying other qualified, \nconsensus nominations.\n  Edward Stanton was nominated to the Western District of Tennessee and \nis supported by Senator Alexander and, of course, Senator Corker. The \ncommittee reported his nomination in October.\n  Robert Rossiter was nominated to the District of Nebraska and has the \nsupport of both of his home State Republican Senators. The committee \nreported his nomination in October.\n  And there are two nominees to the Western District of Pennsylvania, \nSusan Paradise Baxter and Marilyn Jean Horan, who were recommended by \nSenators Casey and Toomey. But even though it was recommended by a \nRepublican Senator, the committee reported the nominations in January \nbut hasn't done anything since.\n  There are many other nominees whom the Judiciary Committee is \nignoring altogether--not even holding hearings.\n  So why aren't Republican Senators pressing the Republican leader to \ndo his job and schedule votes on these stalled nominations? Why isn't \nthe Judiciary Committee doing their part to get these judges confirmed? \nWhy isn't the chairman of the committee doing his part?\n  This is the same Senator Grassley who in 2008 said this:\n\n       We should get our job done and confirm these nominees \n     because that is what it takes for the judicial branch to get \n     their work done. The judiciary needs to have the personnel to \n     get their job done.\n\n  So let's do what Senator Grassley said a few years ago. Let's get the \njob done.\n  From the Supreme Court down to the district courts, let's get the job \ndone for our Nation's judiciary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/11/senate-section/article/S1842-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last Thursday a Gallup and Healthways survey \nrevealed more good news about the ever-shrinking rate of uninsured \nAmericans.\n  Because of the Affordable Care Act, 91 percent of American adults now \nhave health insurance. ObamaCare has been especially helpful to working \nAmericans. For adults making less than $36,000, the uninsured rate has \nbeen cut by one-third. Ninety-two percent of Americans making between \n$36,000 and $90,000 a year now have health insurance.\n  Every day more and more people who were previously without health \ninsurance are now covered. That is especially true across racial and \nethnic lines, where the uninsured rate is plummeting. According to this \nsurvey, ``across key subgroups, blacks and Hispanics have experienced \nthe largest declines in their uninsured rates since the fourth quarter \nof 2013.''\n  The numbers really bear that out. The uninsured rate for African-\nAmericans has dropped by more than 50 percent, and the uninsured rate \nfor Hispanics has dropped by more than 25 percent. These are the facts. \nAll across the Nation, our constituents are getting the health care \ncoverage they were promised when Congress passed the Affordable Care \nAct.\n  So I think it is time for our Republican colleagues to stop denying \nthe evidence. The evidence is that ObamaCare is working for the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. President, I see no one on the floor. I ask the Chair to announce \nthe business for the remainder of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/11/senate-section/article/S1842-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a number of my \namendments to the FAA reauthorization bill.\n  I filed Markey amendment No. 3467 to protect consumers from \nridiculously high airline fees. In recent years, fees have gone up \ndespite the fact that gas prices and airline choices have gone down. \nRegrettably, the only thing competitive about the current airline \nindustry is the battle for overhead compartment space. Since 2001, 10 \nmajor airlines have become 4, allowing air carriers to charge \nridiculous fees and act in uncompetitive ways. The four major airlines \nnow control 80 percent of the seat capacity in the United States. At \nsome major airports, passengers only have one or two airlines to choose \nfrom.\n  Airline fees have climbed as high as the planes on which passengers \nare traveling. We must stop their rapid ascent to protect the everyday \nairline passenger. According to an excellent report released by Ranking \nMember Nelson last year, three airlines increased checked baggage fees \nby 67 percent between 2009 and 2014 and four airlines increased \ndomestic cancellation fees by 33 percent. One increased its fee by 50 \npercent, and one increased its fee by 66 percent. Airlines should not \nbe allowed to overcharge captive passengers just because they need to \nchange their flight or check a couple of bags. It is just not fair. \nThere is no justification for charging consumers a $200 fee to resell a \n$150 ticket that was cancelled well in advance when the airline can \nthen resell that ticket for a higher fare to a different traveler. \nFurther, airlines such as Delta, United, and American charge as much as \n$25 for the first\n\n[[Page S1843]]\n\nchecked bag and $35 for the second bag even though there appears to be \nno appreciable cost increase for processing the second bag. That is $60 \nto check two bags one-way or $120 round-trip to check two bags.\n  My amendment prohibits airlines from imposing fees that are not \nreasonable and proportional to the costs of the services provided. This \ncommonsense consumer protection does not prevent airlines from charging \nfees; the amendment simply caps airline fees at a fair rate to ensure \nthat passengers are not getting tipped upside down at the ticket \ncounter.\n  I am pleased that Senators Blumenthal and Klobuchar have cosponsored \nmy amendment. I offered this amendment in the Commerce Committee, and \nit received a vote of 12 to 12. It is time to break this tie on the \nSenate floor.\n  Further, my amendment enjoys broad support from several groups, \nincluding the National Consumers League, the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, and Travelers United.\n  Mr. President, I intend to offer my cyber security amendments as \nwell, Markey amendment Nos. 3468, 3469, and 3470.\n  In December, I sent letters to 12 domestic airlines and two airplane \nmanufactures requesting information on the cyber security protections \non their aircraft and computer systems. What I found was startling. \nCurrently, airlines are not required to report attempted or successful \ncyber attacks to the government. Let me say that again. Airlines are \nnot required to report attempted or successful cyber attacks to the \nFederal Government.\n  According to the National Air Carrier Association, which represents \nAllegiant, Spirit, and Sun Country--some of the country's smaller \nairlines--some of their carriers experience several hundred hacking \nattempts into their system every single day, but since there is no \nrequirement to share this information with the FAA, potentially \nvaluable cyber security information may not get to the other airlines, \nmanufacturers, and regulators. My amendments address these concerns by \nmandating that airlines disclose cyber attacks to the FAA, directing \nthe FAA to establish comprehensive cyber security standards, and \ncommissioning a study to evaluate the safety and security risks \nassociated with Wi-Fi on planes.\n  My amendments enjoy broad support from the Association of Flight \nAttendants, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, and the \nInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.\n  Mr. President, finally, on drone privacy, in committee we added a \nrequirement that government operators disclose where they fly drones, \nthe purpose of the flight, and whether the drone contains cameras, \nthermal imaging, or cell phone interceptors. My amendment would extend \nthose requirements to commercial drone operators.\n  I encourage all Senators to support my amendments.\n  I thank the Chair for giving me this opportunity to address the \nChamber.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week the Senate is continuing its \nconsideration of the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration and bringing important improvements in terms of aviation \ninfrastructure and public safety. I am glad the Senate voted--\nnotwithstanding the impression I think people get from the outside that \nall we do is bicker and we don't actually solve any problems. I am glad \nthe Senate has worked in a bipartisan way to move this legislation \nforward. We have a lot of heavy lifting left to do on this legislation \nthis week, and none of these issues is easy, but it is important we do \neverything we can to demonstrate to the American people that our \ninterests are their interests in moving bipartisan solutions forward \nfor their benefit.\n\n\n                  National Crime Victims' Rights Week\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to just take a moment and point out that this \nweek is also a very important week because it is National Crime \nVictims' Rights Week.\n  Too often crime victims in our country aren't treated with the \nfairness and respect they deserve. So often it seems as though we focus \nour attention on those who commit the crime and not nearly enough on \nthose who are victims of crime they had no part in instigating but \nperhaps happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. When we \ndon't show the proper respect for victims of crime, it can lead to \ndistrust in our communities between law enforcement and the public, and \nit can make our country a more dangerous place.\n  The fact is, our law enforcement professionals work best with \ncommunity cooperation. Frequently, the community can be the eyes and \nthe ears for law enforcement and help give them information they need \nin order to prevent crime from occurring in the first place or to make \na show of force to in fact deter the commission of a crime.\n  When I was Texas attorney general, I had the privilege of overseeing \nour State's Crime Victims' Compensation Fund. This is an idea which \nsaid we ought to take the fines and the penalties from people who \ncommit crimes and then use those funds to make grants to the victims of \ncrime and the people who attempt to help them heal and recover from the \nconsequences. Time and time again, I saw that when we don't support the \nvictims of crime, they and their families aren't the only ones who \nsuffer. It can also impede law enforcement efforts when they feel this \ndisjuncture or disconnection between the victims and the law \nenforcement professionals. So it is important for many reasons--out of \nbasic fairness and compassion but also in the interests of law \nenforcement, generally, to make sure we do everything we can to keep \nlaw enforcement and the victims of crime on the same page and the \ncommunities in which they reside.\n  We need to continually look for ways to improve our support for crime \nvictims. One way we can do this is by continuing assistance to State \nand local governments in a variety of ways. We recently had a hearing \non the intersection of mental illness and law enforcement. \nUnfortunately, in our society today--because of the \ndeinstitutionalization of people with mental illness, with no safety \nnet to take its place--many people who suffer from mental illness are \nresiding in our jails, filling our emergency rooms, or simply living on \nour streets. So we need to redirect more than just the 1 percent of \nfunds currently directed by the Federal Government to State and local \nlaw enforcement for support and training. We need to redirect more of \nthat in a targeted fashion to deal with this crisis in mental illness.\n  Here is an anecdote. Recently, I had the chance to meet with some \nmembers of the Major County Sheriffs' Association. The sheriff of Bexar \nCounty, TX, a friend of mine, said: How would you like to meet the \nlargest mental health provider in the United States? I said:\n\n[[Page S1844]]\n\nWell, sure. Who is that? She said: Meet the sheriff of Los Angeles \nCounty.\n  This made a deep impression on me, and it tells me we still have a \nlot to do.\n  Another example of where the Federal Government can play an \nappropriate support role for local and State law enforcement--and I am \nnot suggesting the Federal Government take over State and local law \nenforcement, far from it. Rather, the Federal Government should \nrecognize and support the important role that local and State law \nenforcement play and provide that support, where possible, here at the \nFederal level.\n  Nowhere else have I found that more important recently than our \nefforts to try to audit and test the massive nationwide rape kit \nbacklog. It has been estimated there are 400,000 rape kits collected \nfrom the forensic evidence from sexual assaults that remain untested. \nWe know these rape kits contain vital DNA evidence that can put \ncriminals behind bars, exonerate the falsely accused, and help detect \nthose who commit crimes serially--not just once but over and over and \nover again until they are ultimately caught. As we know, many \ncommunities at the local level simply do not have the resources or \nexpertise to test these rape kits in a timely fashion, so that is an \narea where we can help. That means that while evidence is collecting \ndust on a shelf for years, criminals will remain loose--unless we \ncontinue to act--and make it impossible for the victims of these crimes \nto find closure. I will give just one example.\n  Last year Houston had a backlog of thousands of rape kits going back \ninto the 1980s. Fortunately, due to resources provided by the Federal \nGovernment under the Debbie Smith Act, and with the determination of \nthe local leadership, Mayor Annise Parker, the city of Houston, began \nto work with the State of Texas and the Federal Government to eliminate \nHouston's rape kit backlog. So far they have tested thousands of rape \nkits, resulting in 850 CODIS matches. That is the DNA check system run \nby the FBI, where when people have been arrested for offenses in the \npast, their DNA information is recorded in this data base and then can \nbe matched against that collected in a rape kit or other forensic \nevidence. So just as a result of the city of Houston undertaking this \nmassive effort--again, with the cooperation of the State and Federal \nGovernment--to eliminate its rape kit backlog, they have gotten 850 \nhits in the CODIS system. In other words, by testing the evidence they \nalready had, Houston officials have been able to identify hundreds of \npeople who are perpetrators of crime--because the DNA evidence does not \nlie--and to place them at the scene of a crime. Again, as we find out, \nsadly, people who commit sexual assaults frequently don't do it just \nonce in their life. Many of them do it serially or until they get \ncaught, looking for victims of opportunity--sometimes even children. It \nis terrible.\n  Fortunately, with the tools and resources provided by the Debbie \nSmith Act and something called the SAFER Act, Houston will complete the \ntesting of all backlogged rape kits this year. This is important \nbecause in the past, testing of these rape kits was viewed as mainly a \nway of just confirming the identity of the assailant using DNA \nevidence, but frequently the identity of the assailant is not an issue \nin these cases, and it is expensive to test rape kits. Frequently, the \nassailant is known and the question is one of consent or nonconsent. \nWhat we have found is by testing more rape kits--even where the issue \nof identity is not in question--we can literally tie these defendants \nin criminal cases to other sexual assaults in a way that is a pretty \npowerful and pretty revolutionary way.\n  I am proud of the work Houston and the State of Texas are doing, \nworking with the Federal Government, to end the rape kit backlog, but \nit is going to take a lot more work from us on an ongoing and long-term \nbasis because, first, one of the things we need to do, which Congress \nhas already required, is an audit to make sure we know where all of \nthese rape kits are--whether they are sitting in an evidence locker or \nwhether they are still sitting in a police station in an investigation \nlocker. We need to make sure there is an audit done so we can get our \narms around the size and scope of the problem. Then we need to redirect \nmore of the resources the Federal Government has already appropriated \nmoney for under the Debbie Smith Act to actually test these rape kits. \nThis is very important because we need the survivors of sexual assault \nto know we continue to stand with them in their fight.\n  Thank goodness for brave women such as Debbie Smith and so many \nothers whom I have met along the way who I think demonstrate not only \ntheir own courage but also give other people courage to stand up for \ntheir own rights when they are, through no fault of their own, victims \nof sexual assault.\n  The Crime Victims' Rights Week is more than just about this crime of \nsexual assault. It is about respect for all victims of crime. That is \nwhy I am proud to be working with the senior Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nLeahy, and Congressman Ted Poe of Houston, TX, on the Justice for All \nReauthorization Act. This is comprehensive legislation to increase \nrights and protections for crime victims across the country. It will \nreauthorize the landmark Justice for All Act signed into law by \nPresident George W. Bush in 2004.\n  As part of the reauthorization, it will also increase the collection \nof compensation and restitution for crime victims, it will protect the \nhousing rights of domestic violence victims, and it will strengthen the \nforensic sciences to swiftly put criminals behind bars and to improve \nthe integrity of the forensic testing.\n  Frequently, we know that both the expertise and the equipment used by \nlocal governments and law enforcement are sometimes pretty spotty. In \norder to maintain the integrity of this important and powerful type of \nevidence, it is very importants we provide some guidance--perhaps best \npractices--for forensic sciences. We have the ability to do that \nbecause of the resources of the Federal Government; again, not to \ncommander or mandate but basically to help local and State governments \nimprove their forensic sciences and their testing.\n  This legislation will also improve access to legal and health care \nresources for all victims and will ensure that we are efficiently \nproviding direct services for crime victims on a national basis. This \nlegislation is supported by more than 130 different law enforcement and \nvictim advocacy organizations nationwide, including the Rape, Abuse, \nand Incest National Network--the so-called RAINN organization--the \nNational District Attorneys Association, the National Center for \nVictims of Crime, the International Union of Police Organizations, the \nNational Network to End Domestic Violence, and the National \nOrganization for Women. It is a pretty broad spectrum of organizations \nalong the political or ideological spectrum, and they are all unified \nin supporting this important bill.\n  This Chamber has done what it takes to help victims in the past, and \nwe should continue to build on the legacy of legislation like the \nJustice for Victims of Trafficking Act, a law that is already making a \nclear difference in the lives of victims across the country.\n  One of the best moments in this Chamber last year was when we passed \nthe Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act by a vote of 99 to 0. It was \na rare and welcomed coming together of all Members, from all different \nparts of the country, all across the ideological spectrum, to enact the \nmost important assistance for victims of human trafficking that we have \ndone in basically 25 years, providing for something as basic as shelter \nfor victims of human trafficking, when many of them had nowhere to live \nor to turn.\n  One of the important pieces of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking \nAct was something called the HERO Program. This was primarily inserted \ninto the legislation at the request of the Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nMark Kirk, a veteran of the U.S. Navy himself.\n  Just yesterday, the Army Times ran a story on a program that was \npermanently authorized under the bill known as HERO, which trains \nveterans to work alongside Federal law enforcement officials to go \nafter child predators--in other words, using some of the expertise the \nveterans acquired in their training and their service in the military \nto help victims of child pornography and the predation, unfortunately, \nthat happens too often on the most innocent.\n  So far, according to this article, the program has already trained \nabout 80 different veterans with plans to train\n\n[[Page S1845]]\n\n40 more this year, giving many of these veterans--some of whom have \nbeen seriously injured during the course of their military service--a \nreal purpose in life. Indeed, in the Army Times story I mentioned just \na moment ago, there are some heartrending, touching stories about how, \neven for people who suffered very traumatic injuries during their \nmilitary service, this gives them a new sense of purpose and focus, and \nit is very, very encouraging.\n  I had the chance to see the HERO program in action last year in San \nAntonio, and it is protecting our children and taking criminals off the \nstreet. It is pretty clear that when we set our minds to it, we can \nmake a difference in the lives of crime victims. We proved that with \nthe passage of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, and we can \ndo it again.\n  I encourage all of our colleagues to consider supporting the Justice \nfor All Reauthorization Act. This is a bicameral, bipartisan proposal \nthat would help victims get the support they need and they deserve.\n  As advocates and survivors across the country use this week to \nhighlight the needs of millions of crime victims, let's also remember \nthat we have a responsibility and an opportunity to do something about \nit right here in this Chamber.\n  Mr. President, I don't see anyone interested in recognition, so I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               ZIKA VIRUS\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, the Zika virus is getting very serious. \nToday one of the officials at the Centers for Disease Control said that \n``this is scarier than we initially thought.'' As to a pregnant woman \nwho is infected with the Zika virus, it may not only cause the fetus to \nbe deformed with a much smaller head, but they are finding other birth \ndefects as well as premature births. Normal, otherwise healthy people \nwho become infected with the virus usually have relatively mild flu-\nlike symptoms, but there are devastating consequences when the virus is \ncontracted by a woman who is pregnant. Today the CDC said: ``Most of \nwhat we've learned is not reassuring.'' They also said: ``Everything we \nlook at with this virus seems to be a bit scarier than we initially \nthought.'' That is coming straight from the experts at CDC.\n  When you look at where this virus is, unfortunately, there are more \npeople in my State of Florida who have the virus than in any other \nState in the country. Nationwide, there are multiples of hundreds who \nhave the virus. In the State of Florida, we have identified just under \n100 people who have the virus. Thankfully, of those who were infected \nin Florida, none of them contracted it in Florida; they contracted the \nvirus someplace else.\n  There is a vast amount of traveling that goes on between Florida and \nPuerto Rico. Puerto Rico is one source where the virus is coming from. \nWhen that mosquito bites you, it transmits the virus, and that mosquito \nis quite prevalent in Puerto Rico. So the island is having its own \ntrauma with the Zika virus manifesting there, but there is also a \nsource in other countries throughout Central America, the Caribbean, \nand Latin America.\n  What do we need to do? Well, one little bit of good news I can give \nyou is that the bill we passed in the Senate before the Easter recess \nis now in the House, and it will be taken up by the House tomorrow. \nThey should pass it and send it to the President's desk for signature. \nWhat that bill does is give financial incentive to the drug companies \nby adding Zika as a virus to the list of tropical diseases for which \nthe drug companies have a financial incentive to go and find a cure or \na vaccine. This bill is complicated as far as what the financial \nincentives will be. I could explain that, but for purposes of \ndiscussion here, I just wanted to share that little bit of good news. \nWe are going to have that bill in law, and we want to unleash the \ncreative potential of our pharmaceutical industry to go and find a cure \nor vaccine that will take care of it.\n  The other side of it is what the CDC is saying is scarier than we \nthought, and that is the fact that it is having such devastating \nsocietal and medical consequences for a woman who is pregnant and gets \nthe virus. We can imagine the trauma to that family with a deformed \nchild being born as a result of the virus. We can imagine the expense \nto society of a child who is severely handicapped. As a result, we are \ntalking about major effort.\n  There is something else we can do about it; that is, the President's \nbudgetary request has $1.9 billion specifically targeted for helping to \ndo the research on the Zika virus. It is my hope, and I know I have the \ncooperation and, indeed, the considerable help and energy of my \ncolleague from Florida, Senator Rubio, in wanting to seek this and to \nget successfully in the appropriations bill for the Department of HHS \nthe $1.9 billion to continue the research and all of the ancillary \nexpenses that are coming as a result of it.\n  Down the road, we will find a vaccine. Down the road, we will be able \nto manage this problem. But, in the meantime, there is a great deal of \ntrauma, some extraordinary heartbreak to some families, which should \nbe, again, the warning: If you are pregnant, do not go anywhere \nexposing the skin to a mosquito bite, particularly in those regions \nwith that variety of mosquito that carries the Zika virus.\n  So I hope by this time tomorrow night, we will say one hallelujah \nthat the House bill has passed, the Senate bill has passed the House, \nand it is on the way to the President's desk for signature. Then, let's \ntake up this issue in the appropriations bill when it hits the floor in \nanother few weeks.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/11/senate-section/article/S1845-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1845-S1848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Waverly \nD. Crenshaw, Jr., of Tennessee, to be United States District Judge for \nthe Middle District of Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes for debate only on the nomination, equally divided in the usual \nform.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring quorum calls be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in December of 2014, Judge William \nJoseph Haynes, Jr., of the Middle District of Tennessee, assumed senior \nstatus, creating a vacancy on the Middle District bench. That vacancy \nhas resulted in increased caseloads for the three active Federal \ndistrict judges--Judge Sharp, Judge Campbell, and Judge Trauger.\n  Fortunately, help is on the way.\n  In June, Senator Corker and I had the pleasure of introducing Waverly \nCrenshaw to the Senate Judiciary Committee when it met to consider his \nnomination. I was pleased that the committee agreed with our position, \nand they reported out his nomination by voice vote the following month.\n  It's easy to see why Tennesseans support Mr. Crenshaw and are excited \nabout his nomination--and the prospect that the Senate will confirm him \ntonight. He was born in Nashville, and then he stayed--attending \nVanderbilt\n\n[[Page S1846]]\n\nUniversity for both college and law school.\n  After law school, he clerked for Judge John Nixon in the Middle \nDistrict of Tennessee, the same court where we hope he will soon serve. \nAfter his clerkship, he worked for the Tennessee attorney general \nbefore entering private practice. In 1987 he became an associate of a \nsmall labor and employment law firm in Nashville. In 1990 he joined one \nof our largest firms--Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis--where he is \ncurrently a partner.\n  He is also active in the Nashville community serving as unpaid legal \ncounsel to the Nashville Conventions and Visitors Corporation, the \nTennessee Independent Colleges and Universities Association, and the \nYWCA, among others.\n  The Middle District of Tennessee is fortunate to have such a well-\nqualified nominee. Waverly Crenshaw is a man of good character and of \ngood temperament, and today I encourage my colleagues to vote for his \nconfirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I am glad to join the senior Senator, as I \nhave many times, but I thank him for his comments about this \ndistinguished person whom I hope is going to be confirmed this \nafternoon as a district court judge.\n  When the White House began looking for someone to fill this position, \nI spoke with people, as I am sure Senator Alexander did, across Middle \nTennessee to really find someone who not only would serve in his \nposition well but had, in his current role, been involved in the \ncommunity and had done many other things outside of law to benefit the \ncommunity itself. Certainly, this is someone who has done that.\n  It became very clear that he has distinguished himself not only as a \ntalented attorney but also as a well respected leader in the Nashville \ncommunity. As Lamar has mentioned, he is a lifelong Middle Tennessee \nresident. He received his law degree from Vanderbilt University. He was \nthe first African-American attorney at the Waller law firm, and he has \nbeen a partner since 1994.\n  He served as Tennessee's assistant attorney general from 1984 to \n1987, and as a law clerk, as was mentioned, for the Honorable John \nNixon. This is exactly the branch he hopes to serve in.\n  I am confident he will serve the people of Middle Tennessee in this \nnew role in an honorable fashion. I am proud to be here to support him \nwith our senior Senator and with so many other people, by the way, in \nMiddle Tennessee who want to see him confirmed in this position. I hope \nothers will join us today in confirming him, and I look forward to him \nserving. By the way, it is a place where there is a dire need to have \nsomeone of his capacity. We have many cases that are backed up. This is \none of those places where we not only need someone to fill the role, \nbut we need someone as distinguished as Mr. Crenshaw.\n\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time. This Senator looks \nforward to his confirmation. I hope everyone will join in confirming \nthis nominee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we will finally vote on the \nnomination of Waverly Crenshaw to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in \nthe Federal District Court in the Middle District of Tennessee. This \nvacancy has been open since December 2014, and Mr. Crenshaw was \nnominated over a year ago, on February 4, 2015. He has the support of \nhis two Republican home State Senators, Senators Alexander and Corker. \nHe was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote \nlast summer on July 9, 2015. There is no good reason why it has taken \n14 months to confirm this nominee.\n  Mr. Crenshaw is currently a partner at the law firm Waller Lansden \nDortch & Davis, LLP, in Nashville. Mr. Crenshaw was the first African-\nAmerican partner at Waller, and in his nearly three-decade career in \nprivate practice, he has tried approximately 50 cases to verdict. Mr. \nCrenshaw also served for 3 years in the Tennessee attorney general's \noffice as an assistant attorney general. He has the experience and \nqualifications necessary to serve on the Federal bench, and he should \nbe confirmed.\n  This is our first judicial confirmation vote in 2 months. In the last \n2 years of the Bush administration--with a Democratic majority--the \nSenate confirmed 68 judges. This new Congress, the Republican \nleadership has allowed only 16 judges to be confirmed since they gained \nthe majority last year. This record of obstruction began last year, \nwhen Senate Republicans confirmed the fewest judicial nominees in more \nthan half a century.\n  Senate Republican leadership is failing our Federal judiciary with \ntheir obstruction of judicial confirmations. When Senate Republicans \ntook over the majority in January of last year, there were 43 judicial \nvacancies. Since then, vacancies have dramatically increased more than \n75 percent to 79. Furthermore, the number of judicial vacancies deemed \nto be ``emergencies'' by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts \nbecause caseloads in those courts are unmanageably high has nearly \ntripled under Republican Senate leadership--from 12 when Republicans \ntook over last year to 34 today.\n  After we vote on Mr. Crenshaw's nomination, 19 judicial nominees will \nremain pending on the Executive Calendar. This includes nominees with \nhome state support from Republican Senators, including Robert Rossiter \nfor the Federal District Court in the District of Nebraska; Edward \nStanton for the Federal District Court in the Western District of \nTennessee; and Susan Baxter and Marilyn Horan for the Federal District \nCourt in the Western District of Pennsylvania.\n  We can reduce the empty judgeships in those states if Republican \nleadership would allow timely votes on the pending judicial nominees on \nthe Executive Calendar. All of those nominees were reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee by voice vote. There should not be any further \ndelay in confirming them.\n  Last Thursday, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights \nand 42 other organizations submitted a letter to Chairman Grassley \nexpressing their dismay with the failure of the Judiciary Committee to \ndo its job to process nominees for our Federal trial and appellate \ncourts, creating a growing backlog of judicial nominations. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of this letter \nat the end of my statement.\n  The American people expect Senators to do their jobs. This is true \nwith judicial nominations to the lower courts, but it is even more \ncrucial for the Supreme Court of the United States because no one can \nfill in for the vacant seat on our highest Court. In just the last few \nweeks, the Supreme Court has deadlocked twice, so it was unable to \nserve its constitutional function. Refusing to consider Chief Judge \nMerrick Garland for the Supreme Court is not only unfair to him, it is \nirresponsible and a threat to a functioning democracy.\n  A recent poll shows that nearly 70 percent of Americans--including a \nmajority of Republicans--say that the Senate should hold a hearing for \nChief Judge Garland. That is what the American people are saying, but \nRepublicans are refusing to hear them. Instead of listening to their \nconstituents, they are listening to powerful interest groups.\n  Since public confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominees began in \n1916, the Senate has never denied a Supreme Court nominee a hearing and \na vote. And based on the Senate's precedent for decades, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee should hold a hearing for Chief Judge Garland this \nmonth.\n  A public hearing would allow Americans to engage in the process of \nconsidering the nomination and hear directly from Chief Judge Garland, \nbut Senate Republicans continue to refuse to do their jobs. Instead, \nRepublicans have outsourced their job to political interest groups \nwhose only goal is to raise millions of dollars to launch a smear \ncampaign against the nominee's admirable record of public service. \nThese outside groups are not accountable to the American people. They \ndo not have the American people's interest in mind. They are private, \npowerful groups whose only goal is to advance their own special \ninterests at any cost.\n  These special interest groups are spending millions of dollars in \ndark money to run ads distorting Chief Judge Garland's record. At the \nsame time, Republican Senators are planning to deny Chief Judge Garland \na chance to defend himself at a public\n\n[[Page S1847]]\n\nhearing. It is wrong, it is harmful, and it is unfair.\n  Some Senators have claimed that their unprecedented obstruction \nagainst Chief Judge Garland is based on ``principle, not the person.'' \nBut it is not principled to attack Chief Judge Garland's sterling \ncareer and then refuse to allow him the chance to respond at a public \nhearing.\n  Rather than following the demands of unaccountable interest groups, \nRepublicans should listen to the American people who want to see real \nleadership in Washington. Americans want Republicans to do their jobs \nand consider for themselves the merits of Chief Judge Garland's record \nthrough a public hearing and a vote.\n  I am glad that several Republican Senators have agreed to meet with \nChief Judge Garland. This is a person who has spent almost three \ndecades in public service and has more Federal judicial experience than \nany Supreme Court nominee in history. Those who meet with Chief Judge \nGarland will see what I have seen: that he has an exceptional legal \nmind and a deep respect for the Constitution. His commitment to public \nservice is inspiring, from his days at the Justice Department working \nas a prosecutor on the ground in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City \nbombing to his nearly two decades as a Federal appellate judge.\n  But simply meeting with Chief Judge Garland is not enough. The Senate \nmust act on his nomination. In the last several weeks, the Supreme \nCourt deadlocked twice and was not able to carry out its constitutional \nrole as the final arbiter of our Nation's laws. Where you live will \nimpact what your rights are. That is unacceptable and contrary to our \nconstitutional system. If Republicans' irresponsible obstruction of \nChief Judge Garland does not stop, this will continue at the Supreme \nCourt for two terms.\n  I hope Senate Republicans will listen to the American people, roll up \ntheir sleeves, and do their job. We must carry out one of our most \nimportant and solemn responsibilities and consider the Supreme Court \nnomination before us.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         The Leadership Conference\n\n\n                                    on Civil and Human Rights,\n\n                                     Washington DC, April 7, 2016.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley: On behalf of The Leadership \n     Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the 42 undersigned \n     organizations, we write to express our dismay with the \n     failure of the Judiciary Committee to address a growing \n     backlog of federal judicial nominations. With only 16 judges \n     confirmed so far, the 114th Congress is on pace to have the \n     lowest number of judges confirmed since the 82nd Congress in \n     1951-1952. Even worse, in the face of rising caseloads and \n     continuing judicial emergencies, it appears that the \n     Committee is determined to shut down the confirmation process \n     entirely--putting political considerations ahead of the \n     national interest in a well-functioning judicial branch, and \n     ahead of the constitutional responsibility of the Senate to \n     do its job of providing advice and consent on presidential \n     appointments.\n       While a great deal of public attention has rightly been \n     focused on the pending nomination of Chief Judge Merrick \n     Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court, vacancies on the lower \n     courts must not be lost amidst the debate. This year, \n     President Obama has nominated seven individuals to serve on \n     U.S. Courts of Appeal in various circuits throughout the \n     country, including several in circuits that are currently \n     experiencing judicial emergencies. While some senators have \n     expressed vague and superficial reasons for opposing \n     consideration of individual nominees, the qualifications of \n     these nominees cannot be seriously disputed-- every one of \n     the nominees below has an outstanding background, as well as \n     the widespread respect of those in the legal community who \n     know them best:\n       Rebecca Ross Haywood (Third Circuit): Nominated on March \n     15, Ms. Haywood has spent most of her legal career as an \n     Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Western District of \n     Pennsylvania, including as the Appellate Chief of the Civil \n     Division since 2010. She regularly practices before the court \n     to which she has been nominated--and, if confirmed, would be \n     the first African-American woman to serve there.\n       Lisabeth Tabor Hughes (Sixth Circuit): Nominated on March \n     17, Judge Hughes was appointed to the Kentucky Supreme Court \n     in 2007 by then-Governor Ernie Fletcher and was reelected \n     twice, including without opposition in 2014. She previously \n     served on the Kentucky Court of Appeals (also having been \n     appointed by Gov. Fletcher), and has extensive experience in \n     both private practice and as a trial judge in Jefferson \n     County, Kentucky. She would be the first woman from Kentucky \n     on the court.\n       Donald Karl Schott (Seventh Circuit): Nominated on Jan. 12, \n     Mr. Schott graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School in \n     1980. Since then, he has spent most of his legal career in \n     private practice at Quarles & Brady, where he became a \n     partner in 1987, and has extensive trial and appellate \n     litigation experience, at both the state and federal levels, \n     specializing in securities and business fraud, commercial \n     disputes, health care, and energy-related issues.\n       Myra C. Selby (Seventh Circuit): Nominated on Jan. 12, Ms. \n     Selby spent 15 years in private practice and Indiana state \n     government before being nominated in 1995 to the Indiana \n     Supreme Court. She was the first African American and first \n     woman to serve there, and authored more than 100 majority \n     opinions, before returning to private practice in 1999. Since \n     then, she has specialized in commercial and health care \n     litigation. She would be the first African American from \n     Indiana and the first woman from Indiana on the Seventh \n     Circuit.\n       Jennifer Klemestrud Puhl (Eighth Circuit): Nominated on \n     Jan. 28, Ms. Puhl spent several years in private practice and \n     as a clerk on the North Dakota Supreme Court. In 2002, she \n     joined the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney's Office \n     for the District of North Dakota, where she prosecutes a wide \n     range of criminal cases and specializes in computer hacking \n     and cybersecurity, intellectual property, and human \n     trafficking. She would be the first woman federal judge at \n     any level in North Dakota.\n       Lucy H. Koh (Ninth Circuit): Nominated on Feb. 25, Judge \n     Koh became the first Asian American judge to serve on the \n     U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, \n     having been confirmed in 2010 by a 90-0 vote. Prior to her \n     current position, she worked for the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, held several positions within the Department of \n     Justice, and spent six years in private practice. In 2008, \n     she was appointed as a judge to the Superior Court of \n     California for Santa Clara County by then-Governor Arnold \n     Schwarzenegger. She would be only the second Asian American \n     woman ever to serve on a federal circuit court.\n       Abdul K. Kallon (Eleventh Circuit): Nominated on Feb. 11, \n     Judge Kallon has served on the U.S. District Court for the \n     Northern District of Alabama since 2009, after being \n     confirmed by the Senate by unanimous consent. For the \n     previous fifteen years, Judge Kallon specialized in labor and \n     employment law as a partner at the Birmingham, Alabama firm \n     Bradley Arant Boult Cummings LLP. If confirmed, Judge Kallon \n     would be the first African American from Alabama to serve on \n     the Circuit.\n       In addition, the committee has failed to act on dozens of \n     pending district court nominees--too many to list here--from \n     throughout the country. As with the above appellate nominees, \n     many of these nominees would fill seats in districts that are \n     currently facing judicial emergencies. Many of the district \n     and appellate nominees come from states in which both \n     senators have returned their so-called ``blue slips,'' \n     indicating their approval of the nominees. Normally, this \n     should clear the way for hearings and up-or-down confirmation \n     votes. Instead, these nominees have fallen victim to \n     election-year gamesmanship.\n       The complete obstruction of nominees is unprecedented, and \n     the arguments some are making in defense of this obstruction \n     are wholly unpersuasive. In 2008, the Democratic party-\n     controlled Senate confirmed 22 judges in the last seven \n     months of George W. Bush's presidency, including 10 in \n     September 2008. During Ronald Reagan's presidency, the Senate \n     on average confirmed 16 judges in the second half of \n     presidential election years. There is no legitimate reason \n     why things should be any different in the last year of \n     President Obama's second term.\n       While the Committee refuses to do its job, the American \n     people are left to pay the price. There are currently 32 \n     judicial emergencies nationwide (16 of the pending nominees \n     would fill these seats), and more than 40 total nominees \n     pending in committee or on the Senate floor. Many of the \n     pending nominees would fill vacancies in courts that have \n     been left shorthanded for years. Donald Schott would fill a\n   Seventh Circuit seat that has been vacant for more than six years, \n     and more than 30 of the 46 pending nominees are nominated \n     to seats that have been empty for more than a year.\n       Meanwhile, the inaction is slowing the wheels of justice \n     for all types of parties who are seeking to vindicate their \n     legal and constitutional rights. Numerous judges have \n     explained the consequences they and litigants face: long \n     delays on even the most simple filings and motions, \n     protracted waits for post- conviction sentences, spoiled \n     evidence, witnesses whose memories fade, lost businesses and \n     the jobs that go with them while waiting for trials, and many \n     more. Not only is the situation rife with injustices, but it \n     is also completely unsustainable.\n       The Committee has a constitutional responsibility to \n     provide advice and consent on presidential nominees, and a \n     duty to the American people to simply do its job. In the \n     coming weeks and months, our organizations will continue to \n     make the case until it does.\n       If you have any questions, please contact Rob Randhava, \n     Senior Counsel at The Leadership Conference on Civil and \n     Human Rights at (202) 466-3311, or any of the organizations \n     listed below.

The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3524\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, while we are waiting for members of the \nJudiciary Committee to come and speak to the judicial nomination we \nwill vote on shortly, I want to take the opportunity to talk about a \npending amendment which is being offered by Senator Bennet of Colorado \nand which I would recommend to the Senate that they favorably consider. \nIt is dealing with families traveling on airlines.\n  As you know, things get very specific about seats and how much they \ncharge for the seats. You pay extra for some baggage and other \nservices, and then you get into seats that are getting increasingly \nsmaller. It is even worse for a woman who is pregnant or is traveling \nwith small children.\n  Senator Bennet's amendment is a family-friendly amendment. If a \nparent has a minor child who is going on the plane by themselves, it \nwould require TSA to allow the parent to accompany the child throughout \nthe screening process. To a small child, that can be quite \nintimidating.\n  Secondly, it would require the airlines to provide pregnant women \nwith the opportunity to preboard the flight. How many times have we \nseen everybody queueing up to get on the flight? The special advantage \npassengers get on, the first class passengers get on, the members of \nthe frequent flyer program get on, and here is a lady who is quite \nalong in her pregnancy still standing. That is just common sense. That \nis being gentlemanly about the rules of airlines.\n  Thirdly, the amendment tries to keep families together because it \nwould require the airlines to make sure that at least one adult of the \nfamily who is traveling together can sit next to the child on the plane \nwithout the airlines saying the parent will have to pay an extra fee in \norder to guarantee having a seat next to their minor child. This is \ncommon sense, and it is encouraging family travel.\n  I certainly urge my colleagues to support this amendment as we will \nbe taking up the FAA bill after this judicial nomination confirmation \nvote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield back any remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Crenshaw \nnomination?\n  Mr. CORKER.

Mr. President, we are all concerned about the plight \nright now of Puerto Rico and what is happening over there financially. \nAnd later on this week I will revisit the issue of the 4-year battle of \nVieques that took place from 1999 to 2003. I am very much concerned \nthat we might have an opportunity here to rectify something that was \ndone that should not have been done back in 2002.\n  The island off of Puerto Rico called Vieques had been an integrated \ntraining center for many years--about 60 years--up until 2002. For \npurely political reasons at that time, it became quite an issue. First \nof all, joint training took place on the island of Vieques. Joint \ntraining means you have different branches of the military trying to \naccomplish something together that they couldn't do individually. In \nthe case of Vieques, it was the Marines, the Navy, and the Air Force. \nWe were able to do the type of training we couldn't do anyplace else.\n\n[[Page S1849]]\n\n  It sounds kind of ridiculous, but when they were talking about doing \naway with using Vieques for a military center--what they had been doing \nfor 60 years--it was all around an establishment called Roosevelt \nRoads. Roosevelt Roads was a major naval station. We had about 7,000 \nsailors there. They added something like $600 million a year to the \neconomy of Puerto Rico.\n  Anyway, we found out there was a great effort by a lot of people who \nI will always suspect wanted to ultimately develop that island for \nprivate purposes and to financially gain from that. Consequently, with \nno regard for the contribution it made to our defense, they started a \nmajor problem. One person was killed in 60 years on that island, and \nbecause that happened to have taken place, they used it as a reason to \ntry to shut that down. It became quite a political football at that \ntime. I know Al Gore was very much involved in that, and there were \nsome great benefits, I am sure.\n  From World War II through the operation in Kosovo, our military has \nbeen ready to execute combat operations due to the training they were \nable to get on the island of Vieques. In fact, during Kosovo they used \nthose individuals to conduct successful operations. They were all \ntrained at no place other than Vieques. The reason for that is if they \nwere going into Kosovo, as our Air Force was going in, they would have \nto be able to draw coordinates from a high enough elevation that the \nsurface-to-air missiles would not be able to reach them, for their \nsafety. And if we hadn't had all those guys over there who were trained \nat Vieques, it was speculated that they would not have been successful.\n  Secretary Richard Danzig, who was then the Secretary of the Navy, \nsaid that ``only by providing this preparation can we fairly ask our \nservicemembers to put their lives at risk.'' Admiral Johnson, then \nChief of Naval Operations, and General Jones, then Commandant of the \nMarine Corps, said that Vieques provides integrated live-fire training \n``critical to our readiness'' and that the failure to provide for \nadequate live-fire training for our naval forces before deployment will \nplace those forces at an unacceptably high risk during deployment. \nThose are quotes from those two individuals.\n  Admiral Ellis, then director of operations, plans, and policies on \nthe staff of the commander in chief of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, said \nduring his confirmation hearing--and I was there at that time--to be \ncommander of Strategic Command, ``Those types of facilities, \nparticularly those in which we can bring together all of the naval, and \nthat means both Navy and Marine Corps, combat power for integrated and \njoint training, are particularly useful elements of the overall \nwarfighting preparation.''\n  At the time we felt there was a problem, I personally went around the \nworld to every place that might have been a substitute for Vieques. I \nwent to Cape Wrath--I always remember that--which I think is in \nnorthern Scotland, and I went to Southern Sardinia in Italy, and none \nof those places were adequate and none could provide the same type of \nsupport.\n  Admiral Fallon, then commander of the Navy's Second Fleet, and \nGeneral Pace--remember Peter Pace--the commander of all Marine Forces \nin the Atlantic, testified that the United States needs Vieques as a \ntraining ground to prepare our young men and women for the challenges \nof deployed military operations.\n  GEN Wes Clark, the Supreme Allied Commander at that time, said: ``The \nlive fire training that our forces were exposed to at training ranges \nsuch as Vieques helped ensure that the forces assigned to this \ntheater''--and he was talking about Kosovo. That is when we had to be \nready on arrival to fight and win and survive, which we did.\n  CAPT James Stark, then the commanding officer of Roosevelt Roads \nNaval Station--there were about 7,000 of our sailors there--said:\n\n       When you steam off to battle you're either ready or you're \n     not. If you're not, that means casualties. That means more \n     POWs. That means less precision and longer campaigns. You pay \n     a price for all this in war, and that price is blood.\n\n  Admiral Murphy, then commander of the Sixth Fleet of the Navy, said \nthe loss of training on Vieques would ``cost American lives.'' And it \nhas cost American lives, and that has been since 2002. We are talking \nabout American lives unnecessarily put at risk if they are not fully \ntrained for combat operations.\n  I remember one person back at that time talking about the analogous \nsituation of a football team where you have all the quarterbacks \ntraining over here, all the backs over here, and all the defensive \npeople training over here, but never training together, and then they \ngo and lose. You have to have integrated training. We don't even have \nthat today. We have tried to find and to replicate that effort, and it \nisn't there.\n  This week, I understand--and the reason I came down quite unprepared \nis because I didn't know this was coming up--the House Natural \nResources Committee is going to consider legislation that provides \nbankruptcy powers to Puerto Rico while subjecting it to the authority \nof a Federal oversight board. This is something that is going to become \nvery controversial. There will be a lot of people around saying: Why \nare we doing this? And once you provide these benefits to Puerto Rico, \nthere is no reason why others won't line up and want the same thing.\n  I really am concerned that Puerto Rico, apparently--and I don't know \nif this is true, but they are saying it--owes some $73 billion in \ngovernment debt. In January, Puerto Rico started defaulting on part of \nthat debt.\n  Section 411 of this legislation--we are talking about the legislation \nthat will be discussed tomorrow over in the House--would turn over \napproximately 3,000 acres of Department of Interior conservation zones \nthat were formerly part of Vieques.\n  What happened in 2002 was that the land that had been used for the \ntraining range was turned over to this department. Now they are talking \nabout taking it out, I suppose, for people to develop.\n  I remember so well the time when we were talking about closing \nVieques. I was the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee \nReadiness Subcommittee. Puerto Rico's Governor Rossello came. He is not \nin office anymore. But he made all kinds of threats: It is just a bluff \nthat it would be closing.\n  I made the statement that if we are denied the opportunity to use the \nisland of Vieques for joint training, then we were going to lose \nRoosevelt Roads.\n  Governor Rossello sat there and said: Inhofe is not telling the \ntruth. We are not going to lose that.\n  Of course, they did lose it. So in 2003 the total impact from the \nNavy was estimated to be $600 million a year. The departure of the Navy \nalso impacted business and contracts, as we know.\n  I was visiting with Miriam Ramirez just today. At the time, she was \nin the State Senate in Puerto Rico and was talking about the disastrous \neconomic effects if they closed Vieques. She is still concerned about \nthat, and many of the people who were the strongest opponents of my \nefforts at that time to keep Vieques operating are now saying we should \nhave left it open.\n  So I think any kind of a deal that is made has to include \nconsideration that the training is still available. There is still no \nrange like Vieques anywhere in the Western Hemisphere. What can be done \nin Vieques cannot be done in one location by a joint force. I \nunderstand firsthand both the importance and the significance of having \na range in your home State.\n  I remember a popular TV show at that time called ``Crossfire.'' I was \non the show in May of 2000. Juan Figueroa was the president of the \nPuerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, and we were debating \nthis on live TV.\n  He said: Well, how would you, Inhofe, like to have a live range in \nyour State of Oklahoma?\n  I said: Let me tell you about Fort Sill. They train 360 days out of \nthe year, 24 hours a day, and they make all kinds of noise. It is \nwithin 1 mile of a population of 100,000 people--at that time, Vieques \nwas within 9.5 miles of 9,000 people--and there are all these people \nwho hear this noise down there. They were in town last week. They said: \nWhen we hear that noise, it is the sound of freedom.\n  Here is something interesting. They opened up what is considered to \nbe the most modern, most progressive elementary school. They call it \nFreedom Elementary School. They named it after that phrase: It is the \nsound of freedom.\n\n[[Page S1850]]\n\n  So this is what is happening. I am very much concerned that we are \ngoing to stumble and pass up an opportunity that might still be there. \nWe have an opportunity to actually go back and use that for some of our \njoint training.\n  So later this week I am going to go back and relive the history on \nthe 4-year battle of Vieques. Hopefully, this might be an opportunity \nfor us to save American lives and to have integrated training, which we \nstill don't have today and which we had back in that time.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to an extraordinary \nVermonter, Robert Hawkes Gray. Bob, as he is known to family and \nfriends, grew up in Putney where his parents worked at the Putney \nSchool. His father, Edward, was in charge of buildings and grounds, and \nhis mother, Mabel, ran the kitchen. Ed's ability to fix anything and \nMabel's cooking and way of keeping order are remembered vividly and \nfondly to this day by thousands of Putney graduates.\n  Bob attended Putney where he learned to ski cross-country thanks to \nOlympian skier John Caldwell, the father of cross-country skiing in \nAmerica who taught at the school. Bob went on to run the outdoor work \nprogram at Putney and coached cross-country skiing and running. He \nbecame an Olympian himself, competing in the 1968 and 1972 winter \ngames, and was inducted into Vermont's Ski and Snowboard Museum Hall of \nFame.\n  After skiing, Bob's lifetime passion has been farming. He and his \nwife, Kim, own and manage Four Corners Farm, one of the most successful \nvegetable and dairy farms in Vermont. Located on a beautiful hillside \nthat levels off along the Connecticut River in South Newbury, the \nsprawling acreage of the farm is a model of order and astonishing \nproductivity. Just about anything that will grow in Vermont, either in \nfields or in greenhouses heated by wood stoves, can be found there in \nabundance.\n  Everyone knows that farm work is hard by any standard. It means \nrising before sunrise and long hours of strenuous physical labor that \ncontinues into the night. Anyone who visits Four Corners Farm can't \nhelp but wonder how they do it all. It is a testament to the benefits \nof regular physical exercise, as Bob, now 76, looks closer to 60 and \nhas the strength of someone half his age. It wasn't all due to farming \nthough. It is said that, when Jack Dempsey was the world heavyweight \nchampion, Ed Gray's biceps measured the same diameter. Of course, Ed \nwas an accomplished gardener himself.\n  I could go on about Bob's talents as a farmer. A teacher by instinct, \nanyone who visits the farm may find themselves treated to a lesson in \npruning tomato plants, planting and mulching strawberry seedlings, or \nthe peculiar habits of honey bees. Kim, a former alpine ski racer \nherself, is also a gifted farmer whose stamp on the business can be \nseen everywhere. Neither could have made Four Corners Farm what it is \ntoday without the other.\n  Bob never stopped skiing for fun, but he didn't take up racing again \nuntil the 1990s. This past winter he showed that, if you love something \nenough and give it everything you have got, just about anything is \npossible.\n  At the World Masters cross-country ski races in Voukatti, Finland, \nand at the National Masters at Royal Gorge, CA, Bob won a gold medal, \ntwo silvers, and a bronze. Some might think that, by the time you get \nto be 76, you are probably skiing pretty slowly and there isn't that \nmuch competition in your age group anyway. Let's just say that at the \nMasters no one skis slowly--no one skis anything remotely like slowly. \nThese are the best skiers in the world, and to the rest of us mere \nmortals, there isn't that much difference between them and today's \nOlympians.\n  A March 31, 2016, article in the Valley News, entitled \n``Septuagenarian Gray Skiing His Way to Wins'' tells the story. I \ncongratulate Bob Gray. He exemplifies the very best of Vermont for his \ninspiring work ethic, his ski racing accomplishments, and the example \nhe has set for future generations of Vermont skiers and farmers. I ask \nunanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  \n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Valley News, Mar. 31, 2016]\n\n               Septuagenarian Gray Skiing His Way to Wins\n\n              (By Jared Pendak, Valley News Staff Writer)\n\n       Newbury, VT.--Bob Gray returned to cross country skiing \n     several years ago, primarily as a way to keep his heart \n     pumping. As it turned out, he's more than capable of breaking \n     the hearts of opponents.\n       Gray, 76, recently swept a pair of races at the National \n     Masters Championships in Soda Springs, Calif., winning the \n     Masters 5B (ages 75-79) 10K classic race on March 19 in 33 \n     minutes, 58.6 seconds, more than nine minutes faster than \n     runner up Hans Muehlegger, of Idaho, and good for 20th \n     overall in a field of 53.\n       The next day, Gray placed fifth overall while winning his \n     70-79 age group in the season-ending U.S. Marathon National \n     Championship, finishing the 14K bronze race in 48:12.1--again \n     more than nine minutes ahead of Muehlegger.\n       A two-time Olympian who competed on the U.S. Nordic Ski \n     Team from 1960-74, Gray had also swept both events in the \n     2015 National Masters Championships, held closer to home at \n     the Craftsbury (Vt.) Nordic Center.\n       ``There isn't much competition for my age group in that \n     event,'' said Gray, who co-owns the Four Corners produce and \n     dairy farm in Newbury, Vt. ``I'd like to think part of it is \n     that I'm in pretty good shape.''\n       Gray's competition was stiffer last month at the Masters \n     World Cup in Vuokatti, Finland, where he left with two silver \n     medals and a bronze. On Feb. 6, he bettered 75-year-old \n     Frenchman Daniel Chopard by two seconds for second place in \n     the 10K skate in 33:40, then beat Chopard by 35 seconds with \n     a time of 47:34.1 in the 15K skate Feb. 12.\n       Norwegian Finn Magnar Hagen decidedly won both skate races, \n     finishing the 10K a good 2:40 ahead of Gray and besting him \n     in the 15K by nearly four minutes.\n       ``There was just no catching Finn; he was just gone,'' said \n     Gray. ``On the other hand, me and Chopard had a great time \n     going back and forth. We'd pass each other and say, `All \n     right, I'll see you up ahead on the hill.' ''\n       Neither Hagen nor Chopard competed in the 5K classic on \n     Feb. 8, a race in which the top four were separated by just \n     17 seconds. Russia's Gennady Ushakov won in 18:10.9, followed \n     by Austrian Josef Schniagl, Gray (18:19.7) and Finland's \n     Taplo Wallenkus (18:27.9).\n       ``I think I had a chance to win that race, but my skis just \n     weren't up to par with some of the skis these other guys \n     had,'' Gray said. ``I made one tactical error, started \n     kicking too lightly and it got me off-track. I was still able \n     to make up most of the places I lost and close the gap. It \n     was a close race, a fun race.''\n       Gray, a Vermont Ski & Snowboard Museum Hall of Fame \n     inductee whose wife, Kim, is a former U.S. Alpine skier, \n     competed in the 1968 and '72 Olympic Games. His best finish \n     was 12th place in the 4x1OK relay in the '68 Games in \n     Grenoble, France, complementing three combined top-50s in \n     individual events at Grenoble and the '72 Games in Sapporo, \n     Japan.\n       The Putney, Vt., native also skied four seasons in the FIS \n     Cup (now known as the FIS World Cup), winning national titles \n     in the 15K and 50K and earning the top U.S. ranking in 1973.\n       The Grays opened the Green Mountain Touring Center in \n     Randolph in 1977 while running their first farm in Hartland \n     Four Corners, inspiring the moniker they kept even after \n     moving operations to their plot in Newbury.\n       Bob Gray later had about a 12-year hiatus from the sport \n     while devoted to raising the couple's three children and \n     farming, not strapping on skis again until the early 1990s.\n       He competed off and on in various national and \n     international competitions, capturing bronze at an event in \n     Quebec City in 2001 and two silvers and a bronze five years \n     later in British Columbia. He began refocusing on training \n     and competing in earnest several years ago, motivated equally \n     by the desire to keep his heart rate up as much as keeping \n     his competitive juices going.\n       ``When you get older, if you don't keep moving, you get \n     sick and die,'' Gray said plainly. ``So much of your health \n     is about staying active and exercising. I get some of that on \n     the farm, but I'm much more of a manager type now than I used \n     to be. So (returning to skiing) is a way to keep my heart \n     beating.''\n       Like any snow sports athlete based in the area, Gray faced \n     challenges finding suitable surfaces to train on this winter. \n     He ventured to Craftsbury Nordic Center at times to practice \n     on their manmade trails, but most often settled for dry-land \n     exercises.\n       ``I'd go up (North Haverhill's) Black Mountain, Mount \n     Moosilauke, sometimes Mount Ascutney, always with ski poles \n     to help practice balance,'' Gray said. ``I'd go uphill on\n\n[[Page S1851]]\n\n     paved roads on rollerblades--I like rollerblades better than \n     roller skis. I can go from here up Snake Road to West \n     Newbury, which is about three miles, so that's perfect. The \n     only problem with that is that I'm too tired to skate home \n     after that so I have to have someone come get me.''\n       Gray, who was trained in his youth by former Dartmouth \n     skier and Olympian John Caldwell, would like to see more kids \n     today on Nordic skis. He's given lessons in recent years at \n     Strafford Nordic Center and elsewhere.\n       ``It's a great sport, a great way to get kids off of the \n     couch or away from the computer,'' Gray said. ``Plus, you can \n     do it until you're my age.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/11/senate-section/article/S1851-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MAURICE GEIGER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Maurice Geiger, known \nby family and friends as Maury, an extraordinary individual who, \nalthough a longtime resident of Conway, NH, with his wife, Nancy, is \ndeserving of the title of honorary Vermonter.\n  Maury Geiger's lengthy career began in the U.S. Navy back in the \n1950s, from where he went on to Georgetown Law School and jobs at the \nBureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice. He later served as a \ncounty prosecutor in New Hampshire, founded the Rural Justice Center in \nMontpelier, VT, where I first got to know him, became a national expert \nin court administration, and has provided advice and guidance to help \nreform dysfunctional justice systems in foreign countries for more than \ntwo decades.\n  In no country has Maury devoted more passion, time, and energy than \nHaiti, where justice has long been more of a fantasy than a reality for \nthe majority of the Haitian people.\n  \n\n  Since the 1990s, Maury has traveled to Haiti scores of times, often \npaying out of his own pocket. His purpose was simple: to help improve \naccess to justice for thousands of people caught up in a byzantine \nsystem in which it is common to be detained in squalid, grossly \novercrowded, sweltering prisons rampant with life-threatening diseases, \nfor months and years, without ever seeing a lawyer or judge or being \nformally charged with any crime.\n  Over the years, often against great odds, Maury has worked to train \nnumerous Haitian prosecutors, judges, and other judicial officials and \nto institute recordkeeping systems to improve case management and \nreduce the chance that inmates are forgotten or their case files are \nlost.\n  Maury is not only among a handful of the most experienced experts in \nthe field of court administration; he is a person of exemplary \nintegrity. He has never had the slightest interest in profiting \nhimself, as his modest lifestyle demonstrates, but rather to do \nwhatever he could to provide help and dignity to those who are the \nleast able to help themselves. He has done so, year after year, with \nuncommon compassion and commitment, never losing his wry sense of \nhumor, in a country where the political will for justice reform at the \nhighest levels of government has often been weak or lacking altogether.\n  Maury is in Haiti again this week, and I want him to know that the \nexample he has set of selflessness, of caring, commitment to human \nrights and equal access to justice, and of an unwavering belief in the \nbasic dignity of all people regardless of their station in life, is one \nthat every law student, every lawyer, every prosecutor, every judge, \nand every prison warden should strive to emulate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/11/senate-section/article/S1851-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING POLICE OFFICER SUSAN FARRELL\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Des Moines police officer Susan Farrell \nhad a lifelong dream of a career in law enforcement. At the young age \nof 30, she was living out her dream and on course for a bright career.\n  But on March 26, just five months after joining the Des Moines Police \nDepartment, Officer Farrell lost her life in the line of duty along \nwith fellow officer Carlos Puente-Morales when their vehicle was struck \nby another that was driving the wrong direction on Interstate 80 near \nWaukee. I wish to take a moment to celebrate Officer Farrell's life and \nservice.\n  Early on, growing up in the Des Moines area, Officer Farrell knew she \nwanted a career in public service. She studied criminal justice at \nHamilton College and returned to her home town after graduating to \nbegin living her dream. She worked as a detention officer in Polk \nCounty Jail for several years and was promoted to deputy just a year \nago. She joined the Des Moines Police Department last fall and was \nexcited to expand her education there.\n  Along the way, Officer Farrell quickly earned the respect of her \ncolleagues. She was someone they could always count on to help resolve \nsituations. She also received awards of commendation and lifesaving for \nher work on the response team. One colleague summed up her abilities \nlike this: ``There wasn't a situation where I wouldn't want Susan with \nme.''\n  Officer Farrell will be greatly missed by her family and friends, as \nwell as the Des Moines community that she worked to protect.\n  I express my deepest sympathies to Officer Farrell's family, friends, \nand colleagues and my sincere gratitude for her service to our State \nand for her work to keep our communities safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/11/senate-section/article/S1851-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING POLICE OFFICER CARLOS PUENTE-MORALES\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

I wish to take a moment to celebrate the life and service of \nOfficer Puente-Morales.\n  Officer Puente-Morales served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan in the \nIowa Army National Guard, where he attained the rank of staff sergeant. \nHe served his community as a deputy sheriff for Franklin County and as \nan Ottumwa police officer before coming to Des Moines to be closer to \nfamily. He joined the Des Moines police force just last year.\n  Des Moines Police Chief Dana Wingert has referred to Officer Puente-\nMorales as a loyal servant. I believe this to be a very fitting \ndescription. He was loyal to his family, to his community, to his \ncountry, and he did it with a heart full of love. He was just 34 years \nold when he left us, but his service and the example he set for all of \nus will endure for many years to come.\n  Officer Puente-Morales will be missed by his family and the community \nthat he served.\n  Officer Puente-Morales's mother wisely said, ``We shouldn't wait for \na tragedy to recognize our heroes.'' She is exactly right. On behalf of \nIowans and all Americans, I express my gratitude for Officer Puente-\nMorales's service to community and country.

Today I wish to congratulate my \ndear friend for this recognition and to join people throughout Maine in \nthanking him for his uncommon generosity, vision, and dedication that \nhave made our university's flagship campus a center for the arts and \nhumanities.\n  \n\n  A member of the class of 1950, Leonard received an outstanding \neducation at UMaine and has never stopped giving back. His passion for \nthe arts and commitment to the highest expressions of human ideals are \nevident throughout the beautiful Orono campus. Minsky Recital Hall in \nthe school of performing arts is a marvelous place for students, \nfaculty, and world-class visiting artists to perform. In recent years, \nI have had the pleasure of hearing the University Singers, which \nincluded my niece, perform there.\n  The Minsky Gallery in the Maine Center for the Arts celebrates the \nvisual arts around the world. The Minsky Culture Lab at the Hudson \nMuseum offers interactive, hands-on experiences for Maine \nschoolchildren and UMaine students. With Leonard's support, the UMaine \nMuseum of Art in downtown Bangor features the best in modern and\n\n[[Page S1852]]\n\ncontemporary art, from Andrew Wyeth to Andy Warhol.\n  Leonard's partner in these endeavors is his partner in life, his \nextraordinary wife, Renee. Leonard's service has included leadership \nroles on the university's development council, the Campaign for Maine, \nand the UMaine Board of Visitors. Renee, one of the first volunteer \ndocents at the Hudson Museum, has held leadership roles on advisory \nboards for both the Hudson Museum and the Maine Center for the Arts. \nBoth have been active Patrons of the Arts, the UMaine program that \nsupports tours by university performing arts ensembles and that \nencourages student involvement in the arts through outreach to \nelementary and secondary schools across Maine.\n  The university's Fogler Library, Maine's largest research library, is \nhome to the Minsky Jewish Heritage Collection. This priceless cultural \nand historical resource is a gift from Renee and Leonard Minsky, along \nwith his brother, Norman.\n  For several years, I had the good fortune to live just across the \nstreet in Bangor from Renee and Leonard Minsky. They were wonderful \nneighbors. Since that time, I have been blessed with their friendship \nand inspired by their leadership.\n  Students, faculty, and visitors to the UMaine campus cannot help but \nfeel similarly blessed and inspired. The energy and excitement of the \nUniversity of Maine's arts and humanities community that Leonard Minsky \nhas helped to create enriches our State today and will do so for \ngenerations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/11/senate-section/article/S1852-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TOWN OF KINGFIELD, MAINE\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the 200th \nanniversary of the town of Kingfield, ME. Known today as a gateway to \nthe rugged and beautiful Longfellow Mountains, Kingfield was built with \na spirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the \ncommunity today.\n  Kingfield's incorporation on January 24, 1816, was but one milestone \non a long journey of progress. For thousands of years, the mountains \nand river valleys of western Maine were the hunting grounds of the \nAbenaki Tribe. The reverence the Abenaki had for the natural beauty and \nresources of the region is upheld by the people of Kingfield today.\n  The town's namesake is a central figure in Maine history. In 1807, \nmerchant and shipbuilder William King and his partners purchased lands \nin the wilderness and began attracting settlers. In 1820, Maine \nachieved statehood, and William King, by then a respected statesman and \ndecorated military officer, became its first Governor.\n  The early settlers were drawn by fertile soil, vast forests, and \nfast-moving waters, which they turned into productive farms and busy \nmills. Roads and a railway were built, and the wealth produced by hard \nwork and determination was invested in schools and churches to create a \ntrue community.\n  Among the earliest settlers was Salomon Stanley, whose descendants \nbecame the business, social, and religious leaders of the town. At the \ndawn of the 20th century, his twin sons Francis Edgar and Freelan Oscar \ninvented the groundbreaking Stanley Steamer automobile and were \nrenowned violin makers. Along with their sister, Chansonetta, they \nintroduced many technological and artistic advancements to the growing \nfield of photography. The Stanley Museum, located in a beautiful \ncentury-old Georgian schoolhouse, celebrates the genius of a remarkable \nfamily.\n  When industry in Kingfield began to decline in the 1950s, outdoor \nrecreation rose to prominence, driven by the energy, enthusiasm, and \nvision of the townspeople. Today skiing at Sugarloaf Mountain Resort, \nhiking, golf, and snowmobiling, along with some of the most spectacular \nscenery of the Appalachian Trail, place Kingfield among America's \nfavorite destinations for the outdoor enthusiast. The decision by \nNestle's Poland Spring to open a bottling plant in the town is a \ntestament to the region's pristine environment and diversifying \neconomy.\n  From the valiant service of Colonel William King in the War of 1812 \nto the conflicts of our time, Kingfield is a town of patriots. It is \nsignificant that the town's plans for its yearlong bicentennial \ncelebration include enhancements to the memorials honoring Kingfield \nveterans.\n  Kingfield is also a town of involved citizens. The active historical \nsociety, volunteer fire department, and library are evidence of a \nstrong community spirit. The planning and volunteerism that have gone \ninto the bicentennial festivities are evidence that Kingfield's spirit \nonly grows stronger.\n  This 200th anniversary is not just about something that is measured \nin calendar years; it is about human accomplishment and an occasion to \ncelebrate the people who, for more than two centuries, have worked \ntogether and cared for one another. Thanks to those who came before, \nKingfield has a wonderful past. Thanks to those who are there today, \nKingfield has a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/11/senate-section/article/S1852-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL EDWARD P. ASH\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to my constituent \nLTC Edward P. ``Ned'' Ash for his exemplary dedication to duty and \nservice to the U.S. Army and to the United States of America. \nLieutenant Colonel Ash will retire this summer after more than two \ndecades in the U.S. Army.\n  Entering the Army from Vancouver, WA, Lieutenant Colonel Ash earned a \ncommission from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point with a degree \nin international relations and was commissioned an armor officer in \n1994.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Ash served in a variety of cavalry units and \nassignments during his 22 years of service. As a lieutenant, he served \nas a tank platoon leader, scout platoon leader, troop executive \nofficer, and as a squadron staff officer in the 2nd Squadron, 3d \nArmored Cavalry Regiment. As a captain from 1999 to 2001, Lieutenant \nColonel Ash remained in a hardship assignment with the 2nd Infantry \nDivision for 3 years to serve in Korea. While assigned to the 2nd \nInfantry Division, he commanded Bravo Troop and Headquarters Troop in \nthe 4th Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment. After working at the national \ntraining center, where Lieutenant Colonel Ash trained units that were \npreparing to deploy in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring \nFreedom, he was assigned to the 1st Squadron, 71st Cavalry Regiment. He \ndeployed with this unit to Iraq while serving as the operations officer \nand then to Afghanistan as the squadron executive officer.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Ash spent his last 4 years in the Army as a budget \nliaison in the office around the corner from mine in the Russell Senate \nOffice Building and has become a fixture in the Halls of the U.S. \nSenate. My staff have called on him many times to help with issues \naffecting the soldiers and military families in Washington State and \naround the country. Lieutenant Colonel Ash has approached every inquiry \nfrom my staff, from requisition requests for tents to detailed \nquestions about national strategy, with the same calm wisdom and \nthoughtfulness that puts serving people and getting results above all \nelse. Lieutenant Colonel Ash has also led the teams that supported the \nlogistic requirements for the funerals of two of my colleagues who \nserved in the Army: Senator Daniel Inouye and Senator Frank Lautenberg. \nHis efforts during these funerals helped ensure that they were \nconducted with the dignity befitting the memories of these giants of \nthe Senate. I can confidently say that Lieutenant Colonel Ash's \nleadership has positively impacted his soldiers, peers, and superiors \nthroughout his career.\n  On behalf of a grateful nation, I join my colleagues today in \nrecognizing and commending LTC Edward P. Ash for over two decades of \nservice to his country. We wish Ned and his wife, Jamie Skaluba, all \nthe best as they continue their journey of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/11/senate-section/article/S1852-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1852-S1853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JORDAN HANSON\n\n Mr. ROUNDS.
