Mr. President, No Child Left Behind laid the \ngroundwork for important reforms to our education system. But with its \nauthorization expiring in 2007, and with the previous Senate majority \nfailing to replace it with a serious proposal, many of the original \nrequirements stayed in place anyway and gradually became unworkable.\n  This resulted in a lot of States getting tangled up in endless \nbureaucracy, reducing their ability to focus on boosting achievement \nand school performance. That was certainly true in the Commonwealth I \nrepresent. Kentucky was actually the first State to petition for some \nfreedom from the law's requirements, and with that additional \nflexibility came better results.\n  Kentucky improved its graduation rate, climbing into the top 10 among \nall States. Kentucky increased the number of students who met statewide \nstandards. Kentucky raised the percentage of students entering \npostsecondary education programs, increasing that number from about \nhalf to more than 68 percent in just a few years' time.\n  So this additional flexibility has been good for Kentucky but only to \na point, because the White House began to tack on more and more \nrequirements as a condition of continued relief from the original law's \nmandates, leaving many States in an untenable situation. This is how \nthe White House was able to impose Common Core in many places that \ndidn't necessarily want it. In a sense, the flexibility one hand gave, \nthe other has continually taken away.\n  It is clear that temporary relief, strapped with other Federal \nmandates, is not a workable choice for States. This is why we need \ncongressional action to replace the broken husks that remain of No \nChild Left Behind with reforms that build on the good ideas in the \noriginal law while doing away with the bad ones.\n  That is what the bipartisan Every Child Achieves Act before us would, \nin fact, achieve. It would grow the kind of flexibility we have seen \nwork so well in States such as Kentucky, and it would stop Federal \nbureaucrats from imposing the kind of top-down, one-size-fits-all \nrequirements that we all know threaten that progress.\n  Kentucky has already seen success with the limited and conditional \nflexibility granted to it so far. So just imagine what States such as \nKentucky could achieve when fully empowered to do what is right for \ntheir students. This is how Kentucky education commissioner Terry \nHolliday put it in a letter he sent in support of this bill:\n\n       I can attest based on our experience that the waiver \n     process is onerous and allows too many opportunities for \n     federal intrusion into state responsibility for education. \n     The long-term health of public education in the United States \n     requires reauthorization and an end to the use of the waiver \n     as a patch on an otherwise impractical system of \n     requirements.\n\n  He is, of course, just right, and we have never been closer to \nachieving the kind of outcome our kids deserve. Many thought Washington \ncould never\n\n[[Page S4902]]\n\nsolve this issue, but the bill before us was supported unanimously by \nRepublicans and Democrats in committee. Members of both parties are \nhaving a chance now to offer and vote on amendments to the bill too. We \nhad several amendment votes yesterday. I expect more today. If our \ncolleagues from either side of the aisle have more ideas to offer, I \nwould ask them to work with Senator Alexander and Senator Murray to get \nthem moving.\n  This is what a Senate that is back to work looks like. With continued \nbipartisan cooperation, this is a Senate that can prove the pundits \nwrong again by passing another important measure to help our country \nand our kids.\n  Remember, the House of Representatives already passed its own No \nChild Left Behind replacement just last night, as it has done \nrepeatedly in years past. Now is the time for the Senate to finally get \nits act together after 7 years of missed deadlines on this issue. A new \nSenate majority believes that the time for action and bipartisan reform \nshould be now, and with continued cooperation from our friends across \nthe aisle, it will be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4902-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BURMA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, a few \nweeks ago I came to the floor to discuss the importance of Burma's \nelection this fall. I noted that its conduct would tell us a lot about \nthe Burmese Government's commitment to the path of political reform. I \nsaid that demonstrating that commitment would be critical to reassuring \nBurma's friends abroad and that it could even have consequences for \nfurther normalization of relations with the United States, at least as \nit concerns the legislative branch.\n  So I urged Burmese officials to take every step to ensure an election \nthat would be as free and fair as possible. Yet on June 25, the Burmese \nGovernment took a step backward from the path to more representative \ngovernment.\n  Let me explain. There is little doubt that Burma's Constitution \ncontains numerous flaws that need to be revised if the government is to \nbe truly representative.\n  First, it unreasonably restricts who can be a candidate for \nPresident--a not so subtle attempt to bar the country's most popular \nopposition figure from ever standing for that office. But then it goes \neven further, ensuring an effective military veto over constitutional \nchange--for instance, amendments about who can run for the Presidency--\nby requiring more than three-fourths parliamentary support in a \nlegislature where the Constitution also reserves one-fourth of the \nseats for the military.\n  Let me say that again. The Constitution reserves one-fourth of the \nseats for the military and requires a three-fourths vote to amend the \nConstitution--completely jerry-rigged. It is obvious to see why things \nshould change if Burma is to pursue a path of a more representative \ngovernment.\n  Allowing appropriate constitutional fixes to pass through the \nParliament would have said some very positive things about the Burmese \nGovernment's commitment to political reform. But when the measures were \nput to a vote on June 25, the government's allies exercised the very \nundemocratic power the Constitution grants them to stymie the reform.\n  This stands in stark contrast to the support for reform among elected \nBurmese lawmakers, which is likely higher than 80 percent. So among the \npeople elected by the people, 80 percent favor the reform, and the 25 \npercent inserted into the process by the military guaranteed that no \nreform occurred. So even if the actual conduct of the election proves \nto be free and fair, it risks being something other than, certainly, \nthe will of the people.\n  When the most popular figure in the country is precluded from being a \ncandidate for the highest office in the land, and when approximately 80 \npercent of the people's chosen representatives are stymied by lawmakers \nwho are not democratically elected, it raises fundamental questions \nabout the balloting that is coming up this fall and about the Burmese \nGovernment's commitment to democracy. In fact, at this point it is \nunclear if the opposition NLD Party will even participate in this \nfall's election.\n  We knew that legal, economic, political, and constitutional \ndevelopment and reform would evolve in that country through fits and \nstarts. This is only realistic, given the baseline from which Burma was \nstarting when Congress agreed to lift some of the sanctions.\n  Those of us who have followed Burma for a long time also know that, \ngiven its history, the military fears change, ethnic unrest, and the \nuncertainty that a more democratic government might bring. That is well \nacknowledged, but improving relations with the United States meant both \nsides would have to take some risks. This was a moment for the military \nto take another important step on its end, and it was a missed \nopportunity.\n  In light of the recent defeat of constitutional reform, I believe \nthat steps such as including Burma in the Generalized System of \nPreferences Program should be put on hold until after this fall's \nelection. Only after the ballots have been cast and counted in Burma \ncan an appropriate evaluation be made about the pace of reform in the \ncountry and whether additional normalization of relations is warranted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4902-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heller).

Mr. President, first, I wish to take just a moment to \npraise the good work being done by the chairman and the ranking member \nof the HELP Committee. The senior Senator from Tennessee and the senior \nSenator from Washington have done a remarkably good job to bring this \nreauthorization to the floor.\n  Elementary and secondary education is so important, and we are not \nliving up to the standards that we should have. It is important to \nremember that all of this could have been done a long time ago.\n  On the floor I mentioned yesterday that Senator Harkin--who I said \nwas a legendary Senator who served here for six terms, plus a number of \nterms in the House of Representatives--for quite some time was chairman \nof the HELP Committee, and when he wasn't chairman, he served under the \nguidance and leadership of Senator Kennedy.\n  Yesterday I said that the Republican leader came to the floor and was \nboasting: Oh, we are getting this bill done. It is so great that things \nare working so well in the Senate.\n  I mentioned at that time--yesterday--that Senator Harkin tried to \nbring the bill to the floor. He sent me an email last night, and he \nsaid that he on two separate occasions--2011 and 2013--got a bill out \nof the committee. But what happened? It was blocked coming to the floor \nby the Republicans--the same group of people who are now boasting that \nthings are working so well here.\n  Well, Mr. President, I think it is a shame that people come here to \nthe floor and boast about the fact they have spent the last few \nCongresses trying to ruin Congress and the country. And they have done \na pretty good job of it.\n  We are happy to be on this bill. And there is no motion to proceed, \nsuch as I had to do on virtually every bill we brought to the floor. \nBut let's understand that historically. My friend the Republican leader \nis living in a dream world. In fact, it is fast becoming a theme of \nthis 114th Congress--bringing up legislation that Republicans have \nblocked in the past. Senator Stabenow from Michigan calls it the \nfilibuster makeup.\n  Look at the accomplishments about which my friend the Republican \nleader brags that he has gotten done this year:\n  Terrorism risk insurance. We would have done that at any time during \nthe last Congress--at any time--and he knows it.\n  The Clay Hunt suicide prevention bill. That was a bill which was so \neasy to get done. It was blocked. The Republicans wouldn't let us move \nforward on it.\n  Appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security. We were \nprevented from doing that.\n  The human trafficking bill. We spent a lot of time on it in this \nCongress. We\n\n[[Page S4903]]\n\nwould have done that last Congress easily. We were prevented from doing \nso.\n  The repeal of Medicare's sustainable growth rate. We call it SGR. We \nwould have done that at any time, Mr. President. There are no great \nshakes here. How did we get it done? It wasn't paid for. Why? Because \nit was a budget gimmick in the first place, during the Bush years.\n  So to hear my friend the Republican leader coming and boasting about \nall this stuff getting done, we could have done--most of it could have \nbeen done two Congresses ago. Certainly in the last Congress we should \nhave gotten it done.\n  The extension of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--the \nPATRIOT Act. We knew it had to be done. We tried to get it done last \nCongress but couldn't get it done. We were prevented from doing so.\n  Now it is the same with the elementary and secondary education bill. \nI am glad we are on this and glad to complete this other stuff, but \nlet's not try to rewrite history, Mr. President. These things could \nhave been done easily had they not been filibustered here on the Senate \nfloor. Any one of these bills would have easily passed in the last \nCongress, but every one of them was blocked by Republicans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4903-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MANUFACTURED CRISES\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we hear the phrase ``manufactured crisis'' \nused a lot here lately. Why? The Republican leader gives people plenty \nof reason to use the term. He has singlehandedly turned the entire \nappropriations process into a charade designed to manufacture yet \nanother crisis.\n  Look no further than what Republicans are doing in the interior, \nenvironment appropriations bill. The Republican leader bragged \nyesterday--today is Thursday, so on Wednesday--that he and his \ncolleagues have ``lined the interior appropriations bill with every \nrider you can think of to push back against them.''\n  They have filled that legislation with so-called riders. What is a \nrider? It is an extraneous provision that has nothing to do with the \npurpose of the bill--in this instance, a funding bill. So they have \nfilled that legislation, the interior appropriations bill, and other \nbills that have nothing to do with funding the government with things \nthat are harmful to our country.\n  For example, in the appropriations bill dealing with the interior, \nRepublicans have included language to permanently dismantle efforts to \naddress climate change by blocking Federal enforcement of a nationwide \npolicy to reduce carbon pollution from existing powerplants.\n  Climate change is very hurtful to our economy and hurtful to our \ncountry.\n  I was at an event at the White House two nights ago. The President \nsaid that if we don't do something about climate change by the year \n2100, the seas will have increased by 16 feet. The State of Florida \nwill basically be half underwater.\n  Prior to 2100, it is already getting bad. Talk to the two Senators \nfrom Virginia. Areas that are military installations are now covered \nwith water most of the time. Talk to my friend the senior Senator from \nFlorida, and he will tell you what is happening in Florida now. Talk to \nthe Governor of New York, and he will tell you what happened with \nSandy, the hurricane. It is going to happen again because we are doing \nnothing to prevent climate change from devastating our country. The \nPresiding Officer is from the State of Nevada, as am I. He knows that \nbears--not all bears but many bears are not even hibernating in the \nSierras anymore because it is not cold enough. Talk to one of the \nSenators from New Hampshire. The moose are being devastated. Why? \nBecause the cold weather is not killing the gnats, the fleas on the \nmoose, and they are dying. About a third of them are dead.\n  So climate change is not serious? It is a serious issue. Of course it \nis.\n  Republicans have riders in this bill dealing with clean water. They \nhave stuck in language to permanently block implementation of \nprotections for streams and wetlands that have the greatest impact on \nour Nation's water quality.\n  Ozone pollution is another rider they slipped in there. They slipped \nin language to delay efforts to protect people from lung diseases and \nasthma, among other things.\n  Hazardous waste cleanup--now, this is unique. They stuck language in \nthis bill affecting Superfund sites. This has been a great program. It \nhas been a great program because people who devastate and pollute the \nland are asked to pay to clean it up. Republicans have stuck language \nin here to have the taxpayers clean this up and pay for it. That is \nstunning to me.\n  This is a perfect example of Republicans manufacturing a crisis. They \nhave loaded up a necessary funding measure with dangerous provisions \nthat have doomed these bills. Then when Democrats oppose it, the \nRepublican leader will feign outrage and blame Democrats for its \nfailure, hoping to score some type of political victory.\n  Republicans know an appropriations bill full of riders that roll back \nenvironmental protections will be stopped by us and vetoed by the \nPresident. This scripted performance is the definition of a \nmanufactured crisis. And the Republican leader said as much last year \nin an interview with the Hill newspaper Politico. Here is what he said:\n\n       Obama needs to be challenged, and the best way to do that \n     is through the funding process. He would have to make a \n     decision on a given bill, whether there's more in it that he \n     likes than dislikes. A good example is adding restrictions to \n     regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency. Adding \n     riders to spending bills would change the behavior of the \n     bureaucracy.\n\n  He promised that last year, and he is a man of his word. He is \nruining every one of these appropriations bills with these riders, in \nspite of more asthma, more heart disease, more cancer.\n  Instead of passing appropriations bills that keep our government open \nand funded, the Republican leader is more interested in making \nDemocrats and Republicans not work together and having the President \nand Democrats very uncomfortable. Sadly, this is how Republicans are \ngoverning. This is how they pretend to lead our country. It is \nembarrassing. I believe it is. Look at the poll numbers to see what is \nhappening. The Republican leader's numbers are the lowest they have \never been recorded.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. With the help of a handful of \nreasonable Republicans, we can sidestep this sham and pass meaningful \nlegislation that averts another government shutdown. The first one was \npromoted and engineered by the Republicans.\n  I said yesterday and I repeat, Mr. President, to show how shameful \nthat was, two-thirds of the Republicans in the House voted to keep the \ngovernment closed. I mentioned yesterday how the Republican chairman of \nthe House Committee on Appropriations, Congressman Hal Rogers--whom \npeople call the Dean of the Kentucky delegation--is calling on his \nparty to work with us Democrats on a long-term solution that avoids a \ngovernment shutdown. We need Republicans like him here in the Senate.\n  In just a few months, the government will run out of money. It will \nhave no more money on October 1. Unless we can reach a bipartisan \nbudget agreement, our Nation will face another ridiculous and damaging \ngovernment shutdown. So I urge my Republican friends--especially \nRepublican leaders in both Houses--to listen to Chairman Rogers and \nthose other members of the Committee on Appropriations and work \ntogether. Put aside these nonserious games and get serious about \nkeeping our government open. It is the only way Congress will avoid \nanother manufactured crisis the Republican leader seems so desperately \nto desire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4903-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4903-S4904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WASHINGTON FOOTBALL TEAM NAME\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, finally, yesterday the U.S. District Court \nfor the Eastern District of Virginia affirmed what Native Americans \nhave been saying for decades--the Washington football team name is \ndisparaging. It is racist and morally objectionable, and it should be \nchanged now.\n  U.S. District Court Judge Gerald Bruce Lee sustained the Patent and \nTrademark Office's decision that the Washington football team name \nshould not be protected by a Federal trademark registration. That is \ngood news. But how did the Redskins respond? Sorry to use that name. I \nmade a mistake. How did the Washington football\n\n[[Page S4904]]\n\nteam respond? By saying: Well, our football team is worth a lot of \nmoney, and as part of that value, the Redskins name is worth some \nmoney.\n  I mean, does Daniel Snyder have enough money? I think so, without \ndisparaging the group of Indians we have in Nevada--22 separate tribal \nentities in Nevada. They do not like this. Snyder tried a couple of \nthings--bought them a car and thought they would back off and no longer \nobject. They saw that one coming, and they said: No, you keep the car.\n  What the judge did yesterday is good news. The Federal Government \nshould not protect a team or company that takes pride in hearing a \nracial slur every time their name is mentioned.\n  While the ruling is a step in the right direction, this battle is not \nover. Ultimately, the response will rest with the owner, Dan Snyder, a \nmultibillionaire. The U.S. Government cannot change his team's name; \nonly he can. For far too long, owner Snyder has tried to hide behind \ntradition, but yesterday's ruling makes clear that his franchise's name \nonly fosters a tradition of racism, bigotry, and intolerance.\n  I admire so very much the Republican Governor of South Carolina. She \nhas all the conservative credentials anyone needs, and after that \nterrible incident at a church in her State, she said the Confederate \nflag is going to go. Yesterday, after a long debate, as I understand \nit, the South Carolina Legislature said no more public display of the \nflag. So tradition is not the name of the game. Fairness--not racism, \nnot bigotry, not intolerance--is the game.\n  Dan Snyder should do the right thing and change the team's name. \nThere is no place for that kind of tradition in the National Football \nLeague, and there is certainly no place for it in our great country.\n  Mr. President, I apologize to my friend the chairman of the committee \nfor taking so much time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4904-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds).

The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Democratic leader and the \nRepublican leader have created an environment in which we can succeed \non this bill, and I am grateful to them for that. I listened to their \nremarks this morning about some things that have gone on in the past in \nthe Senate. My late friend Alex Haley, the author of ``Roots,'' used to \nsay: Find the good and praise it. And so what I would like to do is \nthank the majority leader for putting the bill on the floor. Only he \ncan do that and give us a chance to debate it. I thank the Democratic \nleader for creating an environment in which we can have a large number \nof amendments and succeed.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Patty Murray, who suggested \nthe way we proceed today. We fell into some partisan differences in the \nlast two Congresses that made that impossible, and she has, as much as \nanybody, helped solve that problem.\n  We are making good progress. We have adopted a number of amendments. \nWe voted on some others. Some have passed, and some have been defeated. \nPeople have had a chance to have their say. Senator Murray and I have \nreceived a large number of amendments--several dozen, actually, that \nSenators on both sides have offered--that we have agreed to recommend \nto the full Senate we adopt by consent.\n  In addition to that, we adopted 29 amendments in the committee \nconsideration, and many of those were amendments from Democratic \nMembers of the Senate. So I think most Senators--in fact, I haven't \nheard a single one say that they haven't had a chance to have their say \non No Child Left Behind.\n  Yesterday, I put into the Record an op-ed from the Washington Post by \nthe Virginia Secretary of Education Anne Holton, who made the argument \nthat States, like Virginia, are well prepared to accept the \nresponsibility for higher standards, better teaching, and real \naccountability. Over the last 15 years, that has happened in every \nState.\n  It reminds us that this bill we are debating only provides 4 percent \nof the dollars that pay for our 100,000 public schools in the country. \nWe have some other money that the Federal Government spends--4 percent \nor 5 percent more--for those schools, but this bill spends 4 percent. \nMost of the money, most of the responsibility, most of the opportunity \nfor success is with parents, classroom teachers, and others who are \nclose to the children.\n  The consensus we have developed, the bipartisan consensus--again, \nwith the bill Senator Murray and I put together and improved by our \ncommittee and now being improved on the floor--is that while we keep \nthe important measures of the accountability, so we know what children \nin South Dakota and Tennessee and Washington State are learning and not \nlearning, so we can tell if anyone is left behind, that we restore to \nStates the responsibility for figuring out what to do about the tests. \nThat has broad-scale support.\n  Superintendents were in town yesterday from all over the country; \nthey told us that. Governors are calling us; they tell us that. The \nmajor teachers organizations in the country tell us we do not need, in \neffect, a national school board. Those decisions need to be made by \nteachers who cherish the children in their classroom and the parents \nwho put them there and school board members who care for them and \nGovernors and legislators who are closer to home. So this bill isn't \neasy to do, but because of that consensus, we are making good progress.\n  I will submit following my remarks an article from earlier this week \nfrom Newsweek entitled, ``The Education Law Everyone Wants to Fix.'' \nThe House of Representatives said it wants to fix it last night. The \nprogress we are making suggests the Senate wants to fix it. We know all \nacross the country Governors, legislators, teachers, school \nsuperintendents, and parents want to end the confusion and anxiety in \nthe 100,000 public schools.\n  We will be having more votes, hopefully today just before lunch, and \nthen we will continue with the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, the \narticle from Newsweek entitled ``The Education Law Everyone Wants to \nFix'' be printed in the Record.\n  On a different subject, which I will not elaborate on today, I wish \nto also include, following my remarks, an article I wrote for the Wall \nStreet Journal yesterday about the cost of going to college. I think it \nis unfortunate that so many politicians and pundits say that Americans \ncan't afford college when in fact most of them can. It is never easy, \nbut it is important for them to know that for low-income Americans, for \nexample, the first 2 years of college are free or nearly free at a \ncommunity college; and there are many other ways colleges, \nuniversities, the Federal Government, and taxpayers try to make it easy \nfor a larger number of Americans to go to college. That is a debate \nSenator Murray and I are already working on. We will bring the \nreauthorization of the higher education bill before the Senate \nhopefully later this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my op-ed from the Wall \nStreet Journal be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of Senators who wish to come to the \nfloor to speak today. I encourage any Senator who hasn't presented \ntheir amendment to go ahead and do that. I am\n\n[[Page S4905]]\n\nhopeful that soon we will have an agreement to have a number of votes \nbefore lunch.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Newsweek, July 3, 2015]\n\n                The Education Law Everyone Wants to Fix\n\n                            (By Emily Cadei)\n\n       When it comes to setting standards for America's public \n     schools, there's a remarkable degree of consensus: The system \n     the federal government has in place--known as No Child Left \n     Behind--doesn't work. Fixing it, however, is about to set off \n     a new round of fierce political combat in Washington, D.C., \n     and draw in 2016 candidates as well.\n       Both the House and Senate are set to debate the 2001 No \n     Child Left Behind law next week. Passed with bipartisan \n     support--including the unlikely pairing of President George \n     W. Bush and Massachusetts liberal Sen. Ted Kennedy--it sought \n     to set national standards for school and student achievement, \n     and mandated testing to make sure they were keeping up as \n     well as funding incentives to keep schools on track.\n       But the goals that the 2001 law set turned out to be far \n     too ambitious and, the chorus of critics say, too rigid. \n     ``Teaching to the test'' is a refrain heard across the \n     country. Test results have become an end-all, be-all, \n     complain teachers and parents, Democrats and Republicans, \n     alike.\n       No Child Left Behind ``simplified all of school \n     accountability to be a performance on a math test or a \n     reading test,'' says Mary Kusler, director of government \n     relations for the National Education Association, which \n     lobbies on behalf of teachers and other education \n     professionals. That, Kusler says, ``has corrupted the \n     education our children are receiving because it has reduced \n     our schools to this reduce and punish system.''\n       The two parties have very different visions for overhauling \n     the law, however. Those in the middle, the House and Senate \n     leaders that have drafted the legislation, are now faced with \n     walking a tightrope between a measure that will win \n     sufficient Republican support in the House but still get a \n     signature from President Obama. That's no easy task--the law \n     has technically been expired since 2007, but Congress has not \n     been able to muster the political consensus to reauthorize it \n     since then. It's still being implemented, though, because \n     Congress continues to provide funding for the vast majority \n     of its programs.\n       In the Senate, Tennessee Republican Lamar Alexander, a \n     former Secretary of Education, and Washington Democrat Patty \n     Murray have crafted a proposal that passed their Health, \n     Education, Labor and Pensions Committee unanimously in April. \n     Their legislation would maintain the testing regimen put in \n     place by No Child Left Behind but give states more \n     flexibility in how they use test results to measure \n     performance. That's earned the hearty endorsement of teachers \n     and groups like NBA, as well as business associations--which \n     are usually on opposite sides of the education policy debate. \n     In order to get Democrats on board, Alexander dropped one big \n     Republican priority from the bill--a provision that would \n     link federal funding for students from low-income areas to \n     the individual child, rather than the school district in \n     which they reside, which is how the system works now. \n     Republicans argue this ``portability'' measure gives children \n     and their families an opportunity to go to better schools but \n     Democrats say it will just weaken already struggling schools. \n     It's part of a broader fight over ``school choice'' and \n     whether students can use public funds to go to the school \n     they want--even private school--via things like vouchers. \n     That, says Kusler, defeats the whole purpose of the law, \n     which is aimed at improving low-performing schools and \n     ``serving historically underserved populations.''\n       The House bill, sponsored by Minnesota Republican John \n     Kline, includes the portability provision Republicans favor. \n     That prompted a veto threat from the White House in February. \n     But even with that provision, Kline's bill has had trouble \n     winning conservative support. Republican leaders initially \n     planned to hold a vote on it in late February but changed \n     their minds at the last minute when it became apparent they \n     didn't have enough GOP support. Members aligned with the Tea \n     Party argue the overhaul still spends too much money and \n     leaves too much power in the hands of the federal government. \n     They're insisting on a vote on an amendment that would give \n     states the option of opting out of No Child Left Behind \n     requirements entirely, a proposal known in shorthand as A-\n     PLUS.\n       ``There's just no conceivable way they can bring the Kline \n     bill onto the floor without bringing up A-PLUS,'' says Dan \n     Holler, spokesman for Heritage Action for America, the \n     advocacy arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation. \n     Holler's group came out in strong opposition to the bill in \n     February and plans to continue to oppose it unless that \n     provision is included in the House bill. He argues that the \n     House needs to pass the most conservative bill possible, \n     given that they'll then have to negotiate a final text with \n     the Senate.\n       Given how toxic No Child Left Behind has become, 2016 \n     candidates on the campaign trail are going to be hard-pressed \n     to avoid the debate. There could be 100 amendments or more \n     filed in the Senate, which means the four Republican senators \n     running for president will have to weigh in on plenty of \n     thorny questions surrounding education policy as it relates \n     to race, inequality and states' rights.\n       Even those candidates who won't be voting, however, are \n     bound to be questioned on the topic. Education policy has \n     become a litmus test on the Right, with conservatives \n     rallying against any attempts to nationalize what they \n     believe should be state or local decisions. They've mainly \n     focused on plans for a national curriculum, known as Common \n     Core, which is not part of the No Child Left Behind law. But \n     Common Core is indirectly linked, since states have adopted \n     it to meet the testing and accountability standards that No \n     Child Left Behind created.\n       Many Republican governors that initially embraced the \n     Common Core standards, including 2016 long shots Chris \n     Christie of New Jersey and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, have \n     backed away from them amidst the conservative backlash. \n     Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is one of the few (along with \n     Gov. John Kasich of Ohio) who has stood by Common Core. He \n     also once offered the Obama administration support in its \n     efforts to reauthorize No Child Left Behind, according to an \n     email the website Buzzfeed published last month. Those \n     education stands are a big reason for conservatives' \n     simmering distrust of this son and brother of past \n     presidents.\n       The teachers' unions, meanwhile, continue to hold \n     tremendous sway in the Democratic primary, and their \n     endorsements remain up for grabs in 2016. Dark horse \n     candidate Martin O'Malley, the former governor of Maryland, \n     is clearly eyeing that vote, and is scheduled to hold an \n     education event followed by a meeting with the NBA of New \n     Hampshire next week.\n       The presidential race also offers a rationale to \n     conservative holdouts opposed to the No Child Left Behind \n     reauthorization, which would be effective for as long as five \n     years. With the possibility of a Republican sweeping into the \n     White House, some argue it's best to stick to the status quo \n     for now, and tackle a more ambitious overhaul once a more \n     conservative president is in office (they hope).\n       But Kusler, for one, is hopeful that the pressure from all \n     sides to fix an unworkable law will ultimately force a \n     political compromise--opposed to kicking the can down the \n     road further. ``I am entirely optimistic that we will get \n     this done. We have never been so close,'' she says. ``We have \n     created a perfect storm here.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, July 6, 2015]\n\n                  College Too Expensive? That's a Myth\n\n                          (By Lamar Alexander)\n\n       Pell grants, state aid, modest loans and scholarships put a \n     four-year public institution within the reach of most.\n       Paying for college never is easy, but it's easier than most \n     people think. Yet some politicians and pundits say students \n     can't afford a college education. That's wrong. Most of them \n     can.\n       Public two-year colleges, for example, are free or nearly \n     free for low-income students. Nationally, community college \n     tuition and fees average $3,300 per year, according to the \n     College Board. The annual federal Pell grant for these \n     students--which does not have to be paid back--also averages \n     $3,300.\n       At public four-year colleges, tuition and fees average \n     about $9,000. At the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, \n     tuition and fees are $11,800. One third of its students have \n     a Pell grant (up to $5,775 depending on financial need), and \n     98% of instate freshmen have a state Hope Scholarship, \n     providing up to $3,500 annually for freshmen and sophomores \n     and up to $4,500 for juniors or seniors. States run a variety \n     of similar programs--$11.2 billion in financial aid in 2013, \n     85% in the form of scholarships, according to the National \n     Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs.\n       The reality is that, for most students, a four-year public \n     institution is also within financial reach.\n       What about really expensive private colleges? Across the \n     country 15% of students attend private universities where \n     tuition and fees average $31,000, according to the College \n     Board. Georgetown University costs even more: about $50,000 a \n     year. Its president, John DeGioia, told me how Georgetown--\n     and many other so-called elite colleges--help make a degree \n     affordable.\n       First, Georgetown determines what a family can afford to \n     pay. It asks the student to borrow $17,000 over four years \n     and work 10-15 hours a week under its work-study program. \n     Georgetown pays the remainder--at a total cost of about $100 \n     million a year.\n       Apart from grants, work and savings, there are federal \n     student loans. We hear a lot of questions about these loans. \n     Are taxpayers generous enough? Is borrowing for college a \n     good investment? Are students borrowing too much?\n       An undergraduate today can get a federal loan of up to \n     $5,500 his first year. The annual loan limit rises to $7,500 \n     his junior and senior years. The fixed interest rate for new \n     loans this year is, by law, 4.29%. A recent graduate may pay \n     back the loan using no more than 10% of his disposable \n     income. And if at that rate he doesn't pay it off in 20 \n     years, taxpayers forgive the loan.\n       Are students borrowing too much? The College Board reports \n     that a student who graduates from a four-year institution \n     carries, on average, a debt of about $27,000. This is about \n     the same amount of the average new\n\n[[Page S4906]]\n\n     car loan, according to the information-services company \n     Experian Automotive. The total amount of outstanding student \n     loans is $1.2 trillion. The total amount of auto loans \n     outstanding in the U.S. is $950 billion.\n       But a student loan is a lot better investment. Cars \n     depreciate. College degrees appreciate. The College Board \n     estimates that a four-year degree will increase an \n     individual's lifetime earnings by $1 million, on average.\n       What about the scary stories of students with $100,000 or \n     more in debt? These represent only 4% of all student loans, \n     and 90% of the borrowers are doctors, lawyers, business \n     school graduates and others who have earned graduate degrees.\n       About seven million federal student loan borrowers are in \n     default, defined as failing to make a loan payment in at \n     least nine months. That's about one in 10 of all outstanding \n     federal student loans in default--although the Education \n     Department says most of those loans eventually get paid back.\n       Here are five steps the federal government can take to make \n     it easier for students to finance their college education:\n       Allow students to use Pell grants year-round, not only for \n     the traditional fall and spring academic terms, to complete \n     their degrees more rapidly.\n       Simplify the confusing 108-question federal student-aid \n     application form and consolidate the nine loan repayment \n     programs to two: a standard repayment program and one based \n     on their income.\n       Change the laws and regulations that discourage colleges \n     from counseling students against borrowing too much.\n       Require colleges to share in the risk of lending to \n     students. This will ensure that they have some interest in \n     encouraging students to borrow wisely, graduate on time, and \n     be able to pay back what they owe.\n       Clear out the federal red tape that soaks up state dollars \n     that could otherwise go to help reduce tuition. The Boston \n     Consulting Group found that in one year Vanderbilt University \n     spent a startling $150 million complying with federal rules \n     and regulations governing higher education, adding more than \n     $11,000 to the cost of each Vanderbilt student's $43,000 in \n     tuition. America's more than 6,000 colleges receive on \n     average one new rule, regulation or guidance letter each \n     workday from the Education Department.\n       It is vital that more Americans earn their college degrees, \n     for their own benefit and that of the country. A report by \n     Georgetown University's Center on Education in the Workforce \n     tells us that if we don't, we'll fall short by five million \n     workers with postsecondary education in five years.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, making sure our Nation's students get a \nquality education is critical for our ability--our country's ability--\nto lead the world in the years to come, and a good education can be a \nticket to the middle class. It is also important for building an \neconomy from the middle out, not just from the top down.\n  Of course, yesterday the House of Representatives passed their \npartisan bill to reauthorize the Nation's K-12 education bill. While \nthat is another important step in the process to finally fix the badly \nbroken No Child Left Behind law, I am disappointed that House \nRepublicans have chosen to take a partisan approach in their bill that \nis unacceptable to Democrats and will never become law.\n  I appreciate the work that ranking member Bobby Scott put into the \nHouse Democratic substitute. I am looking forward to coming together \nwith him as well as Chairman Kline in a conference. I truly hope House \nRepublicans will be ready to join ranking member Bobby Scott and other \nHouse and Senate Democrats, Senate Republicans, and the administration \nas we work to get this done in a way that works for all students and \nfamilies. I am looking forward to continuing that work here today in \nthe Senate.\n  Again, I truly want to thank my colleague, the senior Senator from \nTennessee, for working with me on our bipartisan bill, and I appreciate \nChairman Alexander's cooperation in working in a bipartisan way through \nthis process. I join him this morning in encouraging our colleagues to \nfile their amendments so we can continue making progress on this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  Our bipartisan bill, the Every Child Achieves Act, is a good step in \nthe right direction to fix No Child Left Behind. It gives our States \nmore flexibility, while also including Federal guardrails to make sure \nall students have access to a quality public education. We are not done \nyet. I want to work to continue to improve and strengthen the bill.\n  One example, today we will talk about an amendment to help shine a \nlight on inequalities in education that still exist in our country. I \nthank Senator Warren for offering her amendment. I look forward to that \ndiscussion. That amendment will help States, districts, and schools \nbetter analyze student achievement data so they can help their students \nachieve. So I hope our colleagues will pass that amendment.\n  I am looking forward to getting started again today to work through \nthis issue and a number of others we have, and I hope to continue to \nwork in a bipartisan way to make sure all students have access to a \nquality education, again, regardless of where they live or how they \nlearn or how much money they make.\n  I look forward to today's discussion. Again, I thank our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle for working with us to fix this badly \nbroken bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the comments of \nthe Senator from Washington. Before she was here, I commented on her \nleadership and on how the Democratic leader as well as the Republican \nleader have created an environment in which we can succeed. We govern a \ncomplex country such as ours by consensus, and I think the way we are \ndoing things is a pretty good example of the way we can do that.\n  I am glad the House of Representatives acted. We have a process for \nthis called conference. We haven't been doing conferences much lately. \nBut she and I both talked with Chairman Kline and Representative Scott. \nIf we should succeed next week, as I believe we will, why then we will \nhave a conference with the House of Representatives, and we will \ndevelop a bill we hope the President will be comfortable signing. We \nare not here just to make a speech. We want to resolve this. As I said \nin the article I put in earlier, this is the education law everyone \nwants fixed. In our constitutional system of government, we don't fix \nit unless the House and Senate agree and the President signs it.\n  So that is our goal, and we are continuing to make steps, thanks to \nthe leadership of Senator Murray and others.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, for the information of Senators, we \nexpect the first four amendments in this series to require rollcall \nvotes, with the rest of the amendments being adopted by a voice vote.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington for working with us to create \nthis agreement.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2094, as Modified\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I wish to speak about my amendment, which \nis part of the unanimous consent agreement that was just agreed to. I \nhave a number of thank yous I need to go through.\n  I will start by thanking the cosponsors of this amendment, starting \nwith Senator Manchin, who has been with me in this battle for a very \nlong time now. But I wish to thank the other cosponsors, including \nSenators McConnell, Alexander, Cotton, Capito, Gardner, Heller, Inhofe, \nJohnson, McCain, Roberts, and Vitter.\n  I am on the floor of the Senate to explain to people what we have \ndone and are going to vote on later today. I believe that this \namendment is very constructive, and I am very optimistic and hopeful \nthis will pass.\n  This amendment is based on a bill that I introduced with Senator \nManchin over a year and a half ago, which was called the Protecting \nStudents from Sexual and Violent Predators Act. I have spoken about \nthis a number of times because I feel very strongly about this. The \nfact is that while the overwhelming majority of our school employees \nacross America are wonderful people and some of the great role models \nof our lives, it is also a fact that there are predators in our \nschools. That is a sad fact, but it is true. We know this for many \nreasons, not the least of which is that last year alone there were 459 \nschool employees arrested across America for sexual misconduct with the \nkids that they are supposed to be protecting.\n  So far this year we are on a path of arresting people at a rate that \nexceeds that of last year. We know this is a huge problem.\n  It came to my attention because of the absolutely horrific story of a \nyoung boy named Jeremy Bell. Sadly, that story began in Pennsylvania, \nwhere a teacher was molesting the students under his charge. He was \nmolesting little boys. The school figured out what was going on and \nreported it to the authorities. But as much as they wanted to, the \nauthorities were never able to assemble enough evidence to mount a \nprosecution. So the school did something despicable. What the school \ndecided to do was to make this predator someone else's problem. So they \nwrote a letter of recommendation and said: You just leave, take this \nletter with you, and find employment elsewhere.\n  Well, this is a pedophile. This is a predator they did this for, and \nof course he left and became someone else's problem. He was hired in \nWest Virginia as a schoolteacher. Eventually, he became principal, and \nof course, he serially molested the children in that school, finally \nculminating in the rape and murder of a little boy named Jeremy Bell.\n  The practice of sending a letter of recommendation on behalf of a \nknown predator is so appalling that most of us can't imagine anyone \nwould do it. But the sad truth is that it has happened so frequently \nthat it even has a name. It is called passing the trash. In prosecution \ncircles and in the circles of people who are advocates for children who \nare victims of these horrendous crimes, they know this all too well. \nPassing the trash is all too common a practice as a way for schools to \nmake these predators someone else's problems.\n  Well, the initial amendment that I filed this bill, mirroring the \nlegislation that Senator Manchin and I introduced, attempted to deal \nwith this problem in two ways. One, in the first place, was to \nestablish a thorough Federal standard for background checks for school \nemployees, and the second was to have a prohibition against passing the \ntrash--to make it illegal for someone to knowingly recommend for hire a \nsexual predator.\n  As for the first part, the background check part, we have had \ndisagreements among ourselves as to how to do that and whether to do \nthat. There have been deep disagreements, and despite many \nconversations with my colleagues, we have not been able to reach an \nagreement on how to proceed on that. I am disappointed that we have not \nreached an agreement, but I understand that we don't have the votes to \npass that portion. So I have agreed to put that aside for now. I have \nnot agreed to abandon this cause of establishing the most rigorous \npossible background checks, but we will have that fight another day and \nhopefully at a time when we have the votes to pass it.\n  What is really terrific news is that we have reached an agreement on \nthe other part of our legislation, the part that prohibits this \ndespicable, horrendous practice of passing the trash--the very action \nthat enabled the predator to get the job that enabled him, in turn, to \nrape and kill young Jeremy Bell. Having reached this agreement, I am \nconfident that we will be able to pass this amendment later today. If \nwe do, it will be the first time that the Senate has established that \nthis despicable practice will no longer be tolerated anywhere in the \ncountry.\n  This is a huge victory for America's children. It is as simple as \nthat. When we pass this in the Senate, and when it eventually becomes \nlaw, which I am confident it will, the fact is our kids are going to be \nsafer. There are a lot of States that already have some legislation \nthat prohibits passing the trash within their State, but no State can \nforce another State to forbid this practice from coming across the line \nand into their State. That is why this always needed a Federal \nresponse, and I am really thrilled that today I think we are going to \nhave that Federal response.\n\n[[Page S4908]]\n\n  I need to thank a lot of folks. I see my colleague from West Virginia \nhas joined us, and I will start with him. Senator Manchin has been a \ngreat partner in this effort since we started over a year and a half \nago. I am sure he will have something to add about this entire process.\n  I also wish to thank the chairman of the committee, Senator \nAlexander, and Ranking Member Murray for all of the help they have \nprovided in getting us to this place. In particular, I have to thank \nSenator Alexander and his staff, together with my staff. I also have to \nmention Dimple Gupta, who has worked tirelessly on this issue.\n  We had many long and often difficult conversations. We started in \nwhat seemed like irreconcilable differences about this topic. But \nbecause we persisted and everybody approached this in a cooperative \nfashion, despite the stiff opposition that there was at times, we were \nable to find common ground.\n  I also need to acknowledge some outside groups that made it possible \nfor us to find this common ground: the National Children's Alliance, \nthe Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, many child advocate groups \nacross Pennsylvania and across the country, law enforcement groups, and \nprosecutors. Even the American Academy of Pediatricians has been \nhelpful in getting us here.\n  I will close with this: This is exactly the way the Senate is \nsupposed to work. This is the way it is supposed to happen. As people \nwho share a common vision, we all want to make sure our kids are in the \nsafest possible environment when they go to school. We started with \nwildly different views about how to get there. When the Senate is \nworking well, it works exactly as it is working now with regular order \non the Senate floor, going through the committee process, and having a \nranking member and a chairman who are willing to work with individual \nMembers on their priorities. People came together to figure out where \ntheir common ground was, how to get this done, and how to put the \ninterest of their constituents, the American people--and in this case \nour kids and grandkids--ahead of political considerations.\n  I am really thrilled that I think we have reached that point on this \nreally important amendment. So I urge all of my colleagues to support \nthis amendment. I hope it will have very broad support. I want to say \nthanks to all of the colleagues who helped to make this happen.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, first of all, let me say to my colleague, \nSenator Toomey from Pennsylvania, that I have enjoyed working with him \non many ventures, if you will, but this is one that is particularly \ngratifying now that we have finally come to an agreement. I think it is \nbipartisan all the way. I think it will pass. It makes all the sense in \nthe world. It was Jeremy Bell from my State of West Virginia who was \nthe victim of this tragic crime that could have been prevented if we \nhad just known. That is what this is all about. As Senator Toomey has \nsaid, we are not going to give up on making sure we can find out who \nthese perpetrators are, if they have a record we can follow and trace \nand keep them out of the school system before they ever begin their \ncareers. That is a situation on which we will continue to be very \nvigilant.\n  Again, I thank Senator Toomey for his commitment and his hard work. \nHis staff and our staff enjoyed working together. We will continue to \nwork on many endeavors that will benefit most importantly the children \nof this great country of ours in our respective States.\n  I thank Senator Alexander and Senator Murray for including my \namendment--another amendment I will be speaking about--to promote \nvolunteerism and community service. This is an issue about which I feel \nvery strongly. I go all over the State of West Virginia and speak in \ndifferent parts of the country, and I speak to young people and ask \nthem if they feel as if they own the country.\n  I say: Do you have ownership? Do you believe this is your country?\n  They look at me very strangely. They really don't feel as though they \nhave ownership.\n  I ask them: In the Constitution and in the preamble where it says a \ngovernment of the people, by the people, and for the people, whom are \nwe speaking about? It is you. It is your government. You own it. What \nhave you done to invest in it? Are you taking care of it? Are you doing \npreventive maintenance?\n  I am often reminded of the five promises that were made, which were \nstarted by Colin Powell and his five promises committee. It is an idea \nthat my wife and I, when I was Governor of West Virginia, endorsed. We \nhave a five promise program that we still support in West Virginia.\n  The five promises are simply these:\n  Every child when they are born into this world should have a loving, \ncaring adult in their life, somebody who unconditionally loves them. \nSometimes, unfortunately, it is not always the biological parents or \nthe biological family, but every child deserves to have unconditional \nlove.\n  Second, every child must have a safe place where harm can't enter \ntheir life, where they know they will be kept safe. Every child \ndeserves that.\n  Third, every child deserves a healthy start. We know that nutrition \nis important and basically the ability to provide good nutrition. \nSometimes, because of economic conditions, the opportunity doesn't \nalways exist. That is a responsibility we have as the greatest country \non Earth, the superpower that we are. Every child should have a healthy \nstart.\n  Fourth, every child should grow to earn a skill, learn a skill, be \nable to obtain a skill that will carry them to be a successful adult in \nlife.\n  I will speak about the fifth promise in just a moment.\n  Giving back to our communities, contributing our time and services to \nimprove our world--this is something everybody can do. We can't use the \nexcuse of ``I am sorry, my family is not wealthy enough for me to do \nsomething''--that is not an excuse--or ``I am sorry, I live in a rural \narea where I just don't have that available to me.'' There is a need \neverywhere in the world. In every part of this great country, there is \na need for people to give something back and do something to \ncontribute, to reach out and help somebody of lesser means, or maybe \nthey don't have any assistance whatsoever in their life. There is an \nopportunity for every person to give.\n  I learned from my grandparents. I watched them open up their home and \nmake sure there was always a bed for a stranger, make sure there was \nalways food, and make sure there were a few rules we had to live by. \nYou couldn't swear when there were too many young children around, you \ncouldn't drink, and you had to work and provide something. If that was \nthe case, then my grandparents took care of you and they wanted to \nshare with you. They are pretty simple rules to live by.\n  Unfortunately, true public service is not there. We for some reason \nhave thought it was somebody else's responsibility to take care of--\njust offer a government program, a Federal or State program. What \nhappened to reaching across the room, if you will, or reaching across \nyour town or your community or your State to help people? Our world is \ndifferent, but our commitment to our neighbors shouldn't be. That is \none value that doesn't change. One person can still have a meaningful \nimpact on another person's life. We know that.\n  My amendment with Senator Shaheen basically aims to counter this \ntrend by giving every school the flexibility to use their Federal \nfunding on programs that promote volunteerism and community service. \nThat is all. It is optional. It is not mandatory. But if one believes \nthat is such an intricate part of our responsibility as an educator, to \nmake sure these young people have a chance to get into a food bank or a \nfood pantry or a homeless shelter or a senior citizen opportunity to \nhelp people in need, or a nursing home--given that chance, they can use \nsome of those resources they will have through this updated bill we are \nabout to pass, which I think is historical and much needed--this \namendment will allow them to do that. That is all we have asked for.\n  I am very appreciative that both Chairman Alexander and Ranking \nMember Murray have accepted this.\n  My amendment today is part of keeping General Powell's fifth promise. \nI\n\n[[Page S4909]]\n\nspoke about the four promises. The fifth promise is this: Every child \nshould grow to be a loving, caring adult and give something back. We \ncan't teach that one. People have to earn that one. People have to \nlearn that for themselves. Sometimes people are able to get it from \nwhere they live, the family they live with, the community around them. \nSometimes people see it and they know it is the right thing to do. This \nis going to provide an opportunity in an educational setting to find \none's lot in life, to be able to give something back, to be able to \ngrow into a loving, caring adult. That is what this is all about.\n  So I believe very strongly in this amendment. I believe very strongly \nthat it is going to help the youth of America to be able to be \nAmericans and what is expected of us as Americans--to help one another.\n  I would say that an investment in community service pays off both for \nour students and our communities. In 2013, that 1 year, U.S. taxpayers \ninvested $1.7 billion in our national service programs that we have to \ndate. The total social return on this investment is estimated to be \n$6.5 billion--almost a 4-to-1 return in the value we receive back as a \nsociety. I don't think we can get a better return on an investment than \nhaving the youth of America being able to give something back and learn \nthat fifth promise to be a caring, loving adult and be able to carry \nthis tradition on.\n  With that, I appreciate very much the chairman and the ranking member \naccepting this amendment. I think it will greatly help the school \nsystems of America to be able to be involved in volunteerism, without \nsocial media but truly hands on. So I think this is something we need. \nI am appreciative, and I thank my colleagues.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from West Virginia. \nHe was just speaking about a need for us to support our young people. \nIn essence, what he was saying is they can use their God-given \nabilities to be able to give back, and that is what the amendment I \nwish to speak to is all about.\n  I appreciate the fact that the chairman and ranking member have \nagreed to take a look at this amendment. In fact, my understanding is \nthat Senator Alexander is going to be offering this amendment later. \nThis amendment has to do with substance abuse. It has to do with our \nyoung people. Unfortunately, we are seeing a younger and younger age of \nfirst use of drugs. We are seeing also, unfortunately, more and more \nyoung people who struggle with addiction.\n  In the legislation and in the underlying law, there are provisions \nfor prevention, and that is incredibly important. If we can get our \nyoung people not to go down this road, we can avoid some devastating \nconsequences to them and to their future, to their families, and to \ntheir communities.\n  If we look at the use today, in my home State of Ohio--I was just \nhome the day before yesterday at a conference on this issue of heroin \nuse and prescription drug use by our young people. It is growing. It is \na huge problem. The No. 1 cause of death now in Ohio is overdose from \nthese drugs. It is no longer car accidents, as it has been in the past. \nWe must focus on this issue, and the most effective way, of course, is \nthrough prevention and education, which I strongly support, and it is \nin the underlying bill.\n  What is not in the bill, though, is to provide support services for \nour young people should they be struggling with addiction. This is \nincredibly important. So the legislation I am offering along with \nSenator Whitehouse simply provides recovery and support services for \nour young people who fall victim to the dangers of drugs. We have a \nresponsibility to do this, in my view, again not just to focus, as the \nunderlying legislation does, on drug prevention and early intervention \nbut also to focus on providing these important recovery services to \nstudents in schools and communities so they could overcome their \naddiction and achieve their God-given abilities and again be productive \nmembers of society, which the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator \nfrom West Virginia were speaking about. I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  The second amendment I wish to speak about that I understand also may \nbe offered later and included in a package--and I appreciate the \nchairman and ranking member taking a look at this--has to do with \nhomeless youth. This is an amendment which basically enables us to \nstreamline the current process, where it is very difficult to establish \nthat somebody is homeless. In fact, under our current law, one has to \ngo through quite a process with HUD, the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development. I am told there are sometimes up to maybe 10 or 12 \ndifferent documents one has to go through. This streamlines the process \nand allows the counselors who are already in the schools to be able to \nmake the determination to help get services to these kids.\n  Homeless youth in America is now at an alltime high. We are told that \n1 in 45 children is homeless each year. By the way, that is 1.6 million \nchildren. So I hope this amendment, which is amendment No. 2087, to \nhelp homeless youth will also be one we will be able to take up here on \nthe floor. Senator Feinstein and I are offering it together. It is one \nthat is bipartisan, and it is one that will help foster greater \ncommunity collaboration between agencies and departments by \nstreamlining the process and allowing these counselors who are already \nin the schools to get the training they need to be able to support \nthese kids, to more quickly identify them and provide the services they \nneed.\n  I thank my colleague from Montana for allowing me to speak about \nthese two very important amendments. I thank Senator Murray and Senator \nAlexander for giving this very serious consideration in the \nlegislation. I hope these amendments can be adopted on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2110 to Amendment No. 2089\n\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask to set aside the pending amendment \nin order to call up amendment No. 2110.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Daines] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2110 to amendment No. 2089.\n\n  Mr. DAINES.

Mr. President, as a fifth-generation Montanan, a product \nof Montana public schools, a husband of an elementary school teacher, \nand the father of four children, including one of them who has a degree \nin elementary education, I understand how important a first-rate \neducation is to our kids' future.\n  As I meet with parents and educators across Montana, they frequently \nshare concerns about the one-size-fits-all student performance and \nteacher qualification metrics that currently dictate Federal funding as \npart of No Child Left Behind. While well-intended, many of these \nmetrics have proven difficult for schools in rural areas to achieve.\n  As the Senate debates the Every Child Achieves Act to reform our \nNation's education policies, one of my priorities will be fighting to \nincrease local control over academic standards and education policies \nand working to push back against burdensome Federal regulations that \noften place our schools in a straitjacket.\n  For example, the U.S. Department of Education has incentivized States \nto adopt common core standards by offering exemptions from No Child \nLeft Behind regulations and making extra Federal education funds \naccessible through programs such as Race to the Top to States that \nadopt common core. However, as are many Montanans, I am deeply \nconcerned that the Federal Government's obvious efforts to back States \ninto adopting such programs is an inappropriate interference in \neducation policy decisions that should be made by the States, should be \nmade by the parents, by the teachers, and local school boards.\n  If we are serious about wanting to make future generations as \nfortunate as ours, it is critical that we prepare our children to excel \nin a globally competitive economy. Our children should\n\n[[Page S4911]]\n\nreceive a well-rounded education that focuses on core subjects, \nincluding reading, writing, science, and math, as well as technical and \nvocational disciplines and training in the arts.\n  It is clear that the Federal Government's one-size-fits-none approach \nisn't working. That is why I am introducing the academic partnerships \nlead us to success amendment, or A-PLUS for short. It is an amendment \nto the Every Child Achieves Act. I thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember, Senator Alexander and Senator Murray, for allowing a vote on \nthis amendment today.\n  This measure will help expand local control of our schools and return \nFederal education dollars where they belong--closer to classrooms. With \nA-PLUS, the States should be freed and will be freed from Washington \nunworkable teacher standards. States would be free from Washington-\nknows-best performance metrics. States would be free from Washington's \nfailed test requirements. States would be held accountable by parents \nand teachers because a bright light would shine directly on the \ndecisions made by State capitals and local school districts.\n\n  With freedom from Federal mandates comes more responsibility, \ntransparency, and accountability from the States. It would empower our \nStates, our local schools, our teachers, and our parents to work \ntogether to develop solutions that best fit the unique needs of each \nchild. The A-PLUS amendment goes a long way toward returning \nresponsibility for our kids' education closer to home and reduces the \ninfluence of the Federal Government over our classrooms.\n  I thank Senators Grassley, Cruz, Vitter, Johnson, Lee, Lankford, \nBlunt, Crapo, Rubio, and Gardner for sponsoring my A-PLUS amendment, \nand I ask my other Senate colleagues to join us in empowering our \nschools to serve our students, not DC bureaucrats, and support this \nimportant amendment.\n  I see my colleague Senator Lee of Utah is here, and I yield my time \nfor his comments on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, the work the Senate is engaged in this week is long \noverdue. The last time the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was \nupdated was 14 years ago. Congress gave the country No Child Left \nBehind, a policy that by all accounts has been a failure. That is why \nin 2012 the Obama administration began offering waivers to States, \nallowing them to opt out of the coercive and ineffective requirements \nthat No Child Left Behind imposed on America's school districts and \nclassrooms. But State and local school boards quickly learned, just as \nparents and teachers did, these so-called waivers didn't solve the \nfundamental problems created by No Child Left Behind; they further \nentrenched that problem. These weren't waivers in any meaningful sense \nbecause they came with a new set of strings attached that only \nreinforced the authority of Washington, DC, to micromanage the policies \nand the curriculum of classrooms all around the country. They did not \ngive State and local policymakers the freedom and flexibility to use \neducation funding in a way that would best meet the needs of students \nand truly empower every child to succeed. No. Instead, they forced \nteachers, school boards, and State officials to choose between the \nlesser of two evils--either, on one hand, abide by the Federal mandates \nof No Child Left Behind or, on the other hand, accept the Federal \nmandates prescribed by common core and Race to the Top.\n  The underlying bill we will vote on next week makes the same mistake, \nand unless it is amended, we can expect it in turn to have the same \ndisappointing results. More kids will be trapped in failing schools, \ntheir opportunities in life predetermined by their parents' ZIP Code \nrather than their God-given talents and their own individual desire to \nlearn and succeed. More teachers can be rewarded on the basis of the \nnumber of years they have been on the job rather than on the basis of \nthe number of kids they have helped to graduate. And more parents will \nregrettably but understandably lose faith in the public education \nsystem, knowing it is designed to serve the ideological whims of \nFederal politicians and Federal bureaucrats instead of the educational \nneeds of their children.\n  That is why I am here this morning to offer my support and to \nencourage my colleagues to offer their support for an amendment to the \nproposed reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nan amendment that would help us avoid the serious mistakes of the past.\n  The basic premise, the basic animating principle behind the bill \nbefore the Senate, as it now stands, and the basic premise, basic \nprinciple behind No Child Left Behind and common core is that when it \ncomes to running the classroom, Washington bureaucrats and politicians \nknow better than America's teachers, parents, and local school boards. \nThe principle behind the A-PLUS amendment is essentially the opposite; \nthat no one is in a better position to make decisions about a child's \neducation than his or her parents, guardians, teachers, counselors, and \nprincipals. If you believe in this principle as I do--and as experience \ninstructs all of us to do--then you must support the A-PLUS Act because \nit empowers every child's parents, guardians, teachers, counselors, and \nprincipals to make the greatest impact on their education and on their \nlives, and it would do so without eliminating any Federal mandates--\ncoercive and ineffective though they may be--and would simply give \nStates the choice to opt out of them, no strings attached.\n  Here is how the A-PLUS act works. If a State's legislators determine \nthat the Federal Government's approach to education reform has not \nimproved academic achievement in their State, they have an alternative. \nThey can submit to the U.S. Department of Education a declaration of \nintent outlining their State-directed education reform initiatives. In \nStates that choose to opt out, education officials will no longer have \nto spend all of their time complying with onerous one-size-fits-all \nFederal mandates. Instead, they will have the freedom and flexibility \nto listen and respond to the needs and recommendations of parents, \nteachers, principals, and school boards. They will be able to make \ntheir education funds go further by consolidating programs and funding \nsources, and they will be able to improve the educational opportunities \nto disadvantaged children by designing their State's policies to be \nmore responsive and more targeted.\n  This amendment isn't about States' rights so much as it is about \nchildren's rights, such as the right to a good education. It would \nsecure those rights by empowering America's teachers and parents to \npursue innovative policies, such as charter schools and school vouchers \nand pay-for-success initiatives that have proven to be successful in \nclassrooms all around the country.\n  The bill the Senate will vote on next week may be well-intentioned in \nits reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, but \nit misdiagnoses the problem of the status quo. Our education system \nneeds to be reformed, not in spite of excessive Federal control but \nbecause of it. The A-PLUS Act recognizes this fact, and it takes \ncritical steps to rebuild our education policy around it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the A-PLUS amendment. The success of \nAmerica's children depends upon it.\n  I thank my friend and distinguished colleague from Montana and yield \nmy time back to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. DAINES. I thank the Senator from Utah for his remarks and his \ninsights to empower schools, parents, and States to have more control \nover their children's future through education. This measure will help \nexpand local control of our schools. It will return Federal education \ndollars to where they belong; that is, close to the classrooms.\n  Just before I came down to the floor to speak, I was in my office \nwith some high school students from Montana from communities like St. \nRegis, Hobson, Missoula, Clyde Park, Stevensville. They are the bright \nfuture of our State. As I chatted with them about this amendment, they, \ntoo, agreed that by shifting control back to the States, to the local \nschool boards, to the parents, that individual and effective solutions \ncan be created to address the multitude of unique challenges facing our \nschools and our students across the\n\n[[Page S4912]]\n\ncountry. Through these laboratories of democracy, Americans can watch \nand learn how students can benefit when innovative reforms are \nimplemented at the local level.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I urge my Senate colleagues to join us in \nempowering our schools to serve their students, not DC bureaucrats, and \nsupport this important amendment.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n          Amendments Nos. 2147 and 2121 to Amendment No. 2089\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Madam President, the academic partnerships lead us to \nsuccess amendment--also called A-PLUS--gives States greater flexibility \nin allocating Federal education funding and ensuring academic \nachievement. Here is what it does. States would be allowed to obtain \nFederal education funding in the form of block grants. States would \nsubmit a declaration of intent to the Department of Education to \nconsolidate Federal education programs and funding and redirect sources \ntoward State-directed education reform initiatives. What this does is \nallow State and local leaders to exercise greater control over the use \nof Federal education funds to address the needs of local students and \ntarget scarce resources to areas of highest need.\n  I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in empowering our schools to \nserve their students, not DC Democrats, and support this important \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, this amendment is well-intentioned, \nunnecessary, won't pass, and undermines the bipartisan agreement we \nreached to try to move in exactly the direction the Senator from \nMontana suggested. In addition, the House of Representatives rejected \nit last night.\n  I recommend instead that my friends who want more local control of \nthe schools vote for our bipartisan agreement, which ends the common \ncore mandate, ends waivers in 42 States, reverses the trend of national \nschool boards, and which, in my opinion, would be the biggest step \ntoward restoring local control to public schools in the last 25 years.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on a well-intentioned, unnecessary idea which \nwon't become law and which might help undermine the bipartisan proposal \nthat has a very good chance of becoming law.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes following the \nfirst vote in this series be 10 minutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this amendment is really very simple. It \nis designed to protect children from sexual predators. We know we have \na problem because every year we arrest hundreds of school employees \nacross the country for the sexual abuse of children who are supposed to \nbe in their care.\n  This measure will help that problem by a very simple requirement that \nStates pass legislation to prohibit knowingly recommending for hire a \nteacher who has abused children. This is common sense.\n  I am very grateful to my colleagues for helping us get here, \nespecially Senator Manchin. He has been a great partner in this effort \nfor a long time now. I want to thank Senator Alexander and Senator \nMurray for their work in helping us find the common ground that could \nget to a great bipartisan solution for a real problem.\n  I yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I appreciate the hard work Senator \nToomey has put in. Our staffs have worked together. I wish to thank \nChairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray for their hard work on \nthis. This young man from West Virginia, Jeremy Bell, was the victim of \na crime that was preventable if we had known. We did not know. This \nperson who basically was a predator was passed down to West Virginia \nwithout West Virginia having any knowledge at all. This will prevent \nthis from happening anywhere in the country.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to please support this piece of \nlegislation. This amendment is most reasonable. It will protect your \nchildren.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask for 30 seconds for Senator \nMurray and me to make a brief comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I want to thank the Senator from Pennsylvania and the \nSenator from West Virginia for working with Senator Murray and me and \nothers to come to a conclusion on this.

Madam President, I rise to speak on amendment No. 2096.\n  CTE is a core academic subject. I grew up working in my dad's iron-\nworking and welding shop. I ran a school that taught kids to be \ncarpenters and welders in Honduras many\n\n[[Page S4915]]\n\nyears ago, and what I learned is that high-quality technical education \nis an important part of the educational spectrum. We downgraded it for \na number of years, but there is a renaissance now.\n  What my amendment would do is it would go into the current Federal \nlaw and specify that career and technical education programs are core \ncurricula. Originally, English, math, and science were. This bill \nbroadens what is a core curriculum to include computer science and \nforeign languages. This amendment would make plain that high-quality \ncareer and technical education is a core academic subject.\n  I wish to thank Senators Ayotte, Merkley, Scott, Baldwin, and Warner \nas cosponsor. I also thank the chairman and ranking member for bringing \nthis bipartisan bill to the floor.\n  This is commonsense and bipartisan. I hope it will pass.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is pretty simple what this amendment would do, and I present \nit on behalf of Senator Portman and myself. It assures that homeless \nchildren have access to HUD housing.\n  Today, we have 1.3 million children homeless in this country. In my \nState, we have 310,000. The problem is getting a clear definition of an \nindividual who is homeless. This bill would allow the appropriate \nauthorities in a school to certify that a youngster is homeless, so we \ndon't have a conflict between the HUD certification and the school \ncertification. It is long overdue. I believe it will be helpful. I am \nvery hopeful this amendment will pass with a very big vote.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank Senator Portman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                            Sanctuary Cities\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to discuss the very significant \nissue of sanctuary cities.\n  Obviously, we have all been startled and saddened by the horrific \nmurder in San Francisco that is a direct result of San Francisco's \nsanctuary city policy. As a result, I will be filing an amendment today \non this bill to address sanctuary city policy.\n  This is not a new idea for me. It is not a new issue. I have had \nlegislation on this topic since 2009. I have tried to get the attention \nof the U.S. Senate and the attention of others on this topic numerous \ntimes since then. I have only been able to get one vote on an \nappropriations bill. Unfortunately, my amendment to try to end \nsanctuary city policy around the country was tabled, with every \nDemocrat, sadly, voting to table the amendment, except my then-\nDemocratic colleague Senator Mary Landrieu.\n  I hope the very tragic murder of Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco--a \nwonderful 32-year-old woman--gets all of our attention and causes all \nof us to focus on this very serious issue. As we all know, her murderer \nwas an illegal alien who was deported five times previously. As we all \nknow, he was an illegal alien who was convicted of felonies seven times \npreviously. As we all know, it is because of San Francisco's sanctuary \ncity law, defying Federal law, that caused local police officials there \nnot to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nofficials to hold this dangerous criminal for further deportation \nproceedings.\n  Obviously, there are a lot of things wrong with our immigration \nsystem that this case illustrates. The fact that he could come back \ninto the country so many times, having been deported, is a real red \nflag. But certainly this also underscores the truly dangerous nature of \nsanctuary cities policy.\n  Unfortunately, San Francisco is not alone in promoting this \nridiculous policy. There are over 200 cities now that\n\n[[Page S4916]]\n\ndefy Federal law and provide this safe haven to illegal immigrants, \nincluding very dangerous illegal immigrants such as the murderer of \nKathryn Steinle. For years, leaders in this city have argued that \nproviding such a sanctuary assists local law enforcement in doing their \njob. Really? Really? We are going to look at this case in San Francisco \nand keep up those ridiculous arguments? Let's get real. Let's call \nthese policies to a halt. They are contrary to existing Federal law, \nbut the problem is we have never put teeth in that existing Federal \nlaw. It is absolutely time we did so.\n  This horrible murder in San Francisco isn't the only one of its kind. \nJust last week, an 18-year-old girl and her 4-year-old son were found \nshot and burned in their car. Right now, the top suspect is the woman's \nboyfriend, an illegal immigrant who was deported in 2014, who illegally \nreentered the country. In my home State of Louisiana, we have \nidentified serious felons who have been released from jail and are now \nfree to roam in Louisiana. We know of these cases.\n  Now, I hope this recent incident in San Francisco does get some \nfolks' attention. There is hopeful evidence about this. In a statement \nfollowing the shooting, Hillary Clinton said that any city should \nlisten to the Department of Homeland Security and fully cooperate with \ntheir law enforcement and deportation work. Even before the incident in \na hearing before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, \nthe Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Sarah Saldana \ndescribed the adverse effects of sanctuary city policy. She said that a \nsignificant factor affecting efforts to deport illegal immigrants ``has \nbeen the increase in state and local jurisdictions that are limiting \ntheir partnership, or wholly refusing to cooperate with ICE immigration \nenforcement efforts. . . . [I]n certain circumstances we believe such a \nlack of cooperation may increase the risk that dangerous criminals are \nreturned to the streets, putting the public and our officers at greater \nrisk.''\n\n  Well, yes, we saw the direct result of that dangerous, reckless \nsanctuary city policy in San Francisco recently.\n  Right now there are nearly 170,000 convicted criminal aliens who have \nbeen ordered deported who remain at large in our country. The question \nfor sanctuary cities is, Are they going to continue to protect those \npeople or are they going to finally cooperate with immigration \nenforcement officials to do something about rounding up those people, \nnot allowing them to roam on our streets?\n  We need to change our stance that allows sanctuary cities to get away \nwith being accessories to murder. Let me repeat that. They are getting \naway with being accessories to murder, and we need to put an end to \nthat.\n  My legislation, first introduced in 2009, would do that by putting \nreal teeth in Federal law, which does not exist now. My amendment on \nthis bill, which I will be filing today, would do that by putting real \nteeth into Federal law, which does not exist now. We need to take this \nup and we need to do something to shut down over 200 sanctuary cities \naround the country that are clearly endangering the lives and well-\nbeing of American citizens.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to come together to support this \ncommonsense policy. We need to act. The tragic events in San Francisco \nprove that we need to act.\n  Six years and waiting on this commonsense proposal from me and others \nis 6 years and waiting way too long. We need to act now. I urge all of \nour colleagues to join me and others in doing so.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, as the Republican leader indicated \npursuant to unanimous consent, I will shortly be offering a motion to \ninstruct conferees on the fiscal year 2016 National Defense \nAuthorization Act regarding the inappropriate use of overseas \ncontingency operations funding in this bill.\n  The motion to instruct I am offering today directs the NDAA conferees \nto ``insist that the final conference report fully fund the President's \nbudget request for the Department of Defense, including $534.3 billion \nin base budget funding and $50.9 billion in Overseas Contingency \nOperations or OCO budget funding, thereby supporting the bipartisan \nview that the funding caps imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011 \nshould be eliminated or increased in proportionally equal amounts for \nthe revised security and nonsecurity spending categories.''\n  This motion to instruct is consistent with the President's fiscal \nyear 2016 budget request for defense, which assumed a resolution to the \nBudget Control Act, or BCA, dilemma that we have been trying to \naddress. If this BCA situation is resolved, we can remove the threat of \nsequestration on both the defense and domestic spending. Unfortunately, \nthe bill had to rely upon a budgetary--and it has been described by \nmany people--gimmick by transferring $39 billion from the base budget \nrequest for enduring military requirements to the OCO budget, leaving a \nbase budget that is just below BCA levels in order to avoid triggering \nsequestration.\n  In the absence of a resolution to the spending caps in the BCA, the \nadministration has stated that any legislation that contributes to \nlocking in massive cuts to nondefense departments and agencies--such as \nthis one--will be subject to a veto.\n  Now one of my concerns is, when we use this device or gimmick this \nyear, it will pave the way to use it next year and the following year \nand year after that. So we will have this enduring imbalance between \nsecurity spending in the Department of Defense and nonsecurity spending \nin non-Defense Department agencies and a full range of governmental \nspending. Abusing OCO is completely contrary to the intent of BCA. The \nBCA was designed to impose proportionately equal cuts on defense and \nnondefense discretionary spending to force a bipartisan compromise. \nThis approach unilaterally reneges on that bipartisan agreement.\n  OCO and emergency funding are outside the budget caps for a reason. \nThey are for the costs of ongoing military operations and to respond to \nother unforeseen events like natural disasters. To suddenly ignore the \ntrue purpose of OCO and treat it as a budgetary device or slush fund to \nskirt the BCA is an unacceptable use for this important tool for our \nwarfighters.\n  Just to highlight how this OCO gimmick skews defense spending, \nconsider the amount of OCO in relation to the number of deployed \ntroops. Most Americans have a very commonsense approach. If we have \nlots of troops engaged in operations overseas in Afghanistan, Iraq, and \nelsewhere, then we need lots of OCO funding as well. In 2008--the \nheight of our nation's troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, over 187,000 \ntroops deployed--we spent approximately $1 million in OCO per troop. \nUnder this bill, we would spend approximately $9 million in OCO for \neach of our deployed troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Simply put, this approach, which circumvents the spirit of the law, \nis not fiscally responsible or an honest accounting nor is it \nconsistent with the notion of why we created OCO in the first place, to \nsupport troops overseas engaged in overseas operations.\n  There is another point. True national security requires that non-DOD \ndepartments and agencies also receive relief from BCA caps. The \nPentagon simply cannot meet the complex set of national security \nchallenges without the help of other governmental departments and \nagencies, including State, Justice, and Homeland Security. In the Armed \nServices Committee, we heard testimony on the essential role of other \ngovernment agencies in ensuring our national defense remains strong. \nThe Department of Defense's share of the burden would surely grow if \nthese agencies are not funded adequately.\n  The BCA caps are based on a misnomer that discretionary spending is \nneatly divided into security and nonsecurity spending. Let's be clear, \nessential national security functions are performed by governmental \nagencies other than the Department of Defense. As retired Marine Corps \nGeneral Mattis said, ``If you don't fund the State Department fully, \nthen I need to buy more ammunition.''\n  With regard to the threat from the so-called Islamic State of Iraq \nand the Levant, or ISIL, Secretary of Defense\n\n[[Page S4917]]\n\nCarter told the Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that ``the State \nDepartment, the Department of Homeland Security, other agencies that \nare critical to protecting us against ISIL and other threats, they need \nresources too. And so that's another reason why I appeal for an overall \nbudget perspective. . . . I really appeal for that, not just for my own \ndepartment, but for the rest of the national security establishment, I \nthink it's critical.''\n\n  According to a poll earlier this year, 83 percent of Americans think \nISIL is the No. 1 threat to the United States. It is notable that of \nthe administration's nine lines of effort to counter ISIL, only two, \nthe security and intelligence efforts, reside within the \nresponsibilities of the Department of Defense and intelligence \ncommunity. The remaining seven elements for our counter-ISIL strategy \nrely heavily on our civilian departments and agencies.\n  For example, supporting effective governance in Iraq. We need our \ndiplomatic as well as political experts at the State Department to \nengage with Sunni, Shia, Kurd, and minority communities in Iraq to \npromote reconciliation in Iraq and build political unity among the \nIraqi people.\n  Building partner capacity. The coalition is building the capabilities \nand capacity of our foreign partners in the region to wage a long-term \ncampaign against ISIL, much of what is being carried out by the State \nDepartment and USAID.\n  Disrupting ISIL's finances requires the State Department and Treasury \nDepartment to work with their foreign partners and the banking sector \nto ensure that our counter-ISIL sanctions regime is implemented and \nenforced.\n  Exposing ISIL's true nature. Our strategic communications campaign \nrequires a truly whole-of-government effort, including the State \nDepartment, Voice of America, USAID, and others. The Republican \napproach to funding our strategic communications strategy is a part-of-\ngovernment plan, not a whole-of-government plan, unless we recognize \nthat we have to make adjustments in the BCA caps for every agency in \nthe government.\n  Another aspect is disrupting the flow of foreign fighters. These \nforeign fighters are the lifeblood of ISIL. Yet the State Department \nand key components of the Department of Homeland Security are facing \nsevere cuts, undermining ongoing work with partner nations to disrupt \nthe flow of foreign fighters to Syria and Iraq and to protect our \nborders here at home.\n  The sixth line, protecting the homeland. The vast majority of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security falls under nonsecurity BCA caps. This \nfurther demonstrates that the Republican plan is a misnomer, a gimmick, \nand an effort to play a game of smoke and mirrors with the American \npeople. They are very critical to our security here at home. Yet they \nare in that ``nondefense'' part of the budget.\n  Humanitarian support is critical. It is even more critical as you \nlook at the papers and see there is a huge number of people coming out \nof Syria. Military commanders will routinely tell you that the efforts \nof the State Department, USAID, the Office of Foreign Disaster \nAssistance is critical to our campaign, none of which are considered \nsecurity activities under the Budget Control Act.\n  Taken together, this proposal, which is embedded in the underlying \nlegislation, could compromise our broader campaign against ISIL and \ndeprive significant elements of our government of the resources we need \nto do the job of protecting the American people.\n  In another respect, adding funds to OCO does not solve and sometimes \ncomplicates the DOD's budgetary problems. Defense budgeting needs to be \nbased on our long-term military strategy, which requires the DOD to \nfocus at least 5 years into the future. A 1-year plus-up to OCO does \nnot provide DOD with the certainty and stability it needs when building \nits 5-year budget. As General Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, \ntestified, ``We need to fix the base budget . . . we won't have the \ncertainty we need'' if there is a year-by-year OCO fix.\n  On Tuesday, Secretary of Defense Carter told the Armed Services \nCommittee, ``It's embarrassing that we cannot, in successive years now, \npull ourselves together before an overall budget approach that allows \nus to do what we need to do, which is . . . program in a multiyear \nmanner, not in a one-year-at-a-time manner.''\n  Abuse of OCO in this massive way risks undermining support for a \ncritical mechanism used to fund the increased costs of overseas \nconflicts. We have to have a disciplined system for estimating the cost \nand funding the employment of a trained and ready force.\n  The men and women of our military volunteer to protect and are \noverseas fighting for American ideals, including good education, \neconomic opportunity, and safe communities. Efforts to support all of \nthese goals will be hampered unless civilian departments and agencies \nalso receive relief from BCA caps.\n  Our young men and women who are sacrificing their lives overseas, not \njust to defeat the enemy in the field but to give opportunity for hope \nand a chance here at home for their brothers and sisters, for their \naunts and uncles. Our servicemembers and their families rely on many of \nthe services provided by non-DOD departments, including veterans \nemployment services, transition assistance, housing and homeless \nsupport provided by various civilian departments and agencies, impact \naid to local school districts administered by the Department of \nEducation, the school lunch program provided by the Department of \nAgriculture, lifesaving medical research on issues such as traumatic \nbrain injury, post-traumatic stress, and suicide prevention, supported \nby the National Institutes of Health, health care for retirees and \ndisabled individuals under Medicare, Medicaid services for parents, \nincluding military parents and children with special needs. All of \nthese programs that benefit directly men and women in uniform and their \nfamilies would be restricted, and I don't think that is why they are \nrisking their lives, to see these programs that are helpful to them \nunnecessarily cut back.\n  Our national security is also inherently tied to our economic \nsecurity. The President underscored this point on Monday when he said:\n\n       The reason we have the best military in the world is, first \n     and foremost, because we have got the best troops in history, \n     but it's also because we've got a strong economy and we've \n     got a well-educated population and we've got an incredible \n     research operation and universities that allow us to create \n     new products that then can be translated into our military \n     superiority around the world. We shortchange those, we're \n     going to be less secure.\n  The NDAA has been accused of not being a funding bill. So we don't \nhave to worry about the budgetary complications. But indeed we do. The \nstated purpose of the bill is to authorize appropriations for fiscal \nyear 2016 for military activities for the Department of Defense. It is \none of the few bills we do every year to directly authorize \nappropriations. So it is intimately tied to the appropriations, to BCA, \nand to all of the issues I have talked about.\n  Indeed, we have said--and the committee has said repeatedly--that we \nare authorizing money. It is not just suggesting things to do but \nactually providing real money to the Department of Defense. If we do \nthat, I think we have to do it in a way that does not use this OCO \nexception this year--and, unfortunately, in the years to come, if we \nlet it happen this year--but that we are transparent, clear, and we put \nthe money in the base budget and we move forward.\n  I think it is clearly within the scope of the conference. That is why \nI will be offering this motion to instruct. Everyone I talk to, on both \nsides of the aisle, with very rare exception, will make an individual \nstrident pitch that we have to fix BCA, that this is not the best \napproach. I heard that this morning when we had General Dunford before \nthe committee--on both sides of the aisle: These BCA caps are not the \nright way to fund our national defense and not the right way to fund \nother elements of government.\n  We can disagree on funding levels, but there seems to be a strong \nconsensus that the BCA is not working for the benefit of the American \npeople and we have to fix it. Yet we are not fixing it in the \nlegislation that is before us nor are we doing things to help leverage \nsuch a discussion and to help us to come together to do what we all \nclaim we want to do, which is to remove those arbitrary caps, avoid \nsequestration, and contribute to a whole-government approach--not just \nto national\n\n[[Page S4918]]\n\nsecurity but to economic prosperity, to educational opportunity. All of \nthat has to be done not by using these budgetary loopholes not designed \nfor the purpose they are being used for but by sitting down and coming \nup with sensible legislation.\n  We did it before with the great work of Senator Murray and \nCongressman Paul Ryan, and we have to do it again. So I will urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor, obviously, when this comes up--this motion \nto instruct--so we send the right message to our conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. May I ask, is the Senate in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on the message to accompany H.R. \n1735.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I come down here every week, as the \nPresiding Officer knows. She is usually in the chair when I am here, \nlistening to my ``Waste of the Week''. I am a little bit later this \nweek than I normally am. But the issue of waste, fraud, and abuse in \nthe Federal Government continues. We have covered a lot of ground on \nserious issues such as tax fraud and misplaced death records, to the \nmore absurd, such as the federally funded rabbit massages and marketing \nsupport for pumpkin doughnuts. Each of those has a pricetag. That \npricetag is paid for by the American taxpayer.\n  I am happy today to be able to announce that one of the items which I \nhighlighted in a previous ``Waste of the Week'' speech has been \naddressed. In May, my 11th ``Waste of the Week'' speech examined ways \nto improve compliance measures for higher education tax benefits. I \noutlined how Congress can fix this problem to achieve $576 million in \ntaxpayer savings.\n  So that is a former ``Waste of the Week''. It is a great benefit to \nuniversities, colleges, and educational institutions across the country \nbecause previous laws required them to provide information even when \nthose applying for the particular aid refused to provide certain \ninformation. It created a nightmare of paperwork and a nightmare of \ncompliance for those colleges and universities.\n  So that provision that we brought forward was incorporated into law \nthat has now been passed, signed by the President, and is operative. We \nnot only have saved the taxpayer $576 million, but we have provided \nuniversities relief from an unnecessary procedure that consumed an \nextraordinary amount of time.\n  Today I want to talk about software licenses. The Federal Government \nneeds to purchase literally millions of these licenses. In order to get \nthe IT, the information technology, working right you have to have the \nright equipment. In fact, the government spent $80 billion last year on \ninformation technology, including these software licenses.\n  Now, the Office of Management and Budget and the 24 Federal agencies \nthat are covered by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 have very \nkey roles and responsibilities for overseeing IT investment management. \nFederal law places responsibility for managing investment with the \nheads of these agencies and establishes chief information officers to \nadvise and assist agency heads in carrying out this responsibility.\n  Now, there are two Executive orders that have been issued that \nprovide information for these Federal agencies regarding the management \nof how they go about procuring and managing these software licenses. \nExecutive Order No. 13103 specifies that agencies must adopt procedures \nto ensure that they are not using this computer software in violation \nof copyright laws.\n  Additionally, Executive Order No. 13589 states that agencies must \nensure that they are not paying for unused or underutilized IT \nequipment, software, and services.\n  Now, the Government Accountability Office has conducted a study, an \nevaluation of how well this is being managed and implemented. What they \nfound is that in many, many cases it is not happening. Specifically, \nthe Government Accountability Office found that the Office of \nManagement and Budget and the vast majority of Federal agencies lacked \nadequate policies for managing their software licenses. Of the 24 major \nFederal agencies that I mentioned before, only 2--only 2 out of 24--had \ncomprehensive policies that included the establishment of clear roles \nand central oversight authority by managing enterprise software license \nagreements.\n  Only 2 out of 24 have lived up to their requirement to manage in the \nway that these executive orders have ordered. An additional 18 agencies \nhad some type of policy in place, but the Government Accountability \nOffice determined that this simply was not comprehensive enough and \neffective enough. Four agencies were found to have no policy at all. \nThey totally ignored the mandates of the executive orders.\n  So these weaknesses in the system result from principally a lack of \npriority in establishing software license management. Now, this is kind \nof a technical thing. I certainly admit that I am not fully \ncomprehensive in terms of how all of this IT stuff needs to work. But \nwe hire people who are talented and have the skills necessary to \noversee this kind of management. Now, the key here is that the result \nof not effectively managing this has racked up a cost estimated at $10 \nbillion over a 10-year period of time.\n  So this is just complying with the executive orders, complying with \nthe procedures that are done by every business in America. But the \nFederal Government has not complied with the necessary steps to achieve \nthe right kind of management and oversight, and that is costing the \ntaxpayer up to $10 billion. So today we add more to our ever-increasing \namount of waste, fraud, and abuse that has been found within the \nFederal system, and we are moving toward our goal of $100 billion.\n  There will be more ``Wastes of the Week'' in the future. We hope to \nreach that $100 billion before we leave here for the August recess, \nwith 3 more weeks before that happens. We are way ahead of schedule. We \nhad hoped to reach the $100 billion by the end of this Congress. But we \nhave determined and found so many examples of waste, fraud, and abuse, \nthat our gauge is climbing much faster than we thought it would.\n  Look, we have major fiscal problems in this country. It is going to \ntake major decisions relative to how we structure how we spend \ntaxpayers' money. We have had numerous efforts to deal with this in a \nmacro way. All of those have come up short. While I was engaged in all \nof that before, I have turned my attention to this: Let's see at least \nif we cannot find savings for the taxpayer in the areas of waste, \nfraud, and abuse, and document it.\n  I am pleased, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, that one of \nthose has just been implemented, saving the taxpayers $576 million and \nsaving our colleges and universities and institutions of higher \neducation from a nightmare of paperwork and compliance requirements \nthat they will no longer have to engage in. So we will continue. We \nwill do serious issues. We will look at some absurd things that cause \npeople to say: Why in the world would we ever spend that money in the \nfirst place? It is just not responsible leadership and governing.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmandatory quorum call with respect to the\n\n[[Page S4919]]\n\ncompound motion to go to conference on H.R. 1735 be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, in just a few minutes, we are going to \ntake a vote on a motion to instruct the conferees on the National \nDefense Authorization Act that would then basically--if these \ninstructions were agreed to, would actually repeal the Budget Control \nAct passed by the Senate. It would be a direct repudiation of what--\nafter many hours of debate, some amendments that were passed by the \nSenate and would, on an authorization bill, require budgetary and \nfiscal measures which are totally inappropriate.\n  Basically, the problem that my friends on the other side of the aisle \nhave is that they want equal reductions. They want restoration of \nfunding for both nondefense and defense that is forced by the Budget \nControl Act.\n  This legislation that is before the body, which is authorized \naccording to the Budget Control Act--and if the instructions to the \nconferees were enacted, which is before the body now, that somehow we \nwould then be able to repudiate the Budget Control Act which was passed \nand we would also be dealing with funding which has nothing to do with \nthe authorization bill.\n  So my friends on the other side of the aisle have a problem with \nOCO--the overseas contingency operations--but they are trying to change \nit on an authorization bill. I wish my dear friends would look at the \nrules of the Senate. If they have a problem with funding, that is what \nthe appropriations bills are all about.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject what is obviously an unworkable and \nunrealistic approach to a problem that I agree is a problem. \nSequestration is harming our ability to defend this Nation. But in \norder to defend the Budget Act--to change the budget that was passed by \na majority and now is part of what guided our appropriations bills--\nthat is where their problems should lie.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject these instructions to the conferees \nwhich would basically--I do not see a way that we could possibly confer \nwith the House after passing these kinds of instructions. So I urge a \n``no'' vote on Mr. Reed's motion to instruct the conferees concerning \nH.R. 1735. Basically, we would have to take approximately $38 billion \nworth of authorization out of the authorization bill. So I urge a \n``no'' vote.\n\n  And I say to my friend and colleague, the Senator from Rhode Island, \nwhom I respect and admire and whose friendship I value, on this issue \nwe simply disagree.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                      Motion to Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I have a motion to instruct conferees which \nis at the desk, and I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed] moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on H.R. 1735 (the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016) be \n     instructed to insist that the final conference report fully \n     fund the President's budget request for the Department of \n     Defense, including $534.3 billion in base budget funding and \n     $50.9 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations budget \n     funding, thereby supporting the bipartisan view that the \n     funding caps imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011 should \n     be eliminated or increased in proportionally equal amounts \n     for the revised security and non-security spending \n     categories.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes of debate equally divided \non the motion.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this motion represents what we have heard \nfrom the Secretary of Defense and all of our uniformed leaders in the \nmilitary who are saying that we should budget appropriately, put long-\nterm defense needs in the base budget--$534 billion--and reserve OCO \nfor what it was intended to be--overseas operations. But because of the \nBudget Control Act, we are using OCO as the device to avoid real \nbudgeting and giving the Department of Defense the real long-term \nresources it needs.\n  Not only does this represent what the Department of Defense desires, \nbut it also represents what we need to defend the American people. We \nneed more than just the Department of Defense. We need Homeland \nSecurity. We need the State Department. We need Treasury. We need \neveryone to defend this country.\n  This approach would begin the discussion and debate, I hope, to get \nrelief from the BCA to move forward and to deal with the threats facing \nthis country in a rational, logical way.\n\n[[Page S4920]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would ask my colleagues to oppose this \nmotion. We have had this discussion a number of times. This defeats the \nbudget, and this isn't the appropriate place to rehash this or to try \nto do something different. Everything we have been working on has been \nbased on this principle. Incidentally, those budget caps were signed by \nthe President of the United States and said this was an allowable use \nwithout breaking the caps and causing sequester.\n  So we can fund defense, and defense needs to be defended and funded, \nand it will be under the principles that we have right now, and we can \nwork on other methods as we work on this and other budgets. So I ask \nthat we vote against this and not put this extra burden on the \ncommittee that doesn't really have the jurisdiction to do all that is \nbeing requested in this motion. We voted it down before. Let's vote it \ndown again.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ninstruct conferees.\n  Mr. CARDIN.

The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the \nimportant bill before us today, the Every Child Achieves Act, which \nreauthorizes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and fixes No \nChild Left Behind.\n  I also rise today to talk about the reauthorization of the Export-\nImport Bank, which is also a very important matter for our country.\n  I thank Senators Alexander and Murray for their great leadership in \ncrafting a bipartisan bill that makes critical updates to No Child Left \nBehind that will help ensure that all students receive a quality \neducation. They worked together from the very beginning on this \nimportant bill, and I think the results show how important it is.\n  I come to the floor to talk about three amendments in this bill. The \nPresiding Officer is a cosponsor on one of the amendments, which is \nabout STEM education. I think we all know that in today's global \neconomy, education is key to our economic prosperity. The Senator from \nNorth Dakota understands that because our two States, North Dakota and \nMinnesota, have some of the lowest unemployment rates in the country. \nWe have exciting economies with technological jobs to fill. We are two \nStates that make and invent products which we then export to the world. \nTo keep doing that, America's next generation of innovators will have \nto be highly trained and highly skilled. We certainly see this in my \nState. According to the Minnesota High Tech Association, Minnesota will \nbe home to nearly 200,000 technology jobs in the next decade. Part of \nthis is getting young people engaged at an early age.\n  Today's high school students aren't just competing against students \nin Milwaukee and Miami, they are competing against students in Munich \nand Mumbai. If America is going to keep its spot atop the world's high-\ntech hierarchy, students in our country must receive the best training \nand education we can provide. That is why Senator Hoeven and I are \nworking to increase the emphasis on STEM education.\n  The Klobuchar-Hoeven amendment, modeled after our Innovate America \nAct, will expand STEM opportunities for more students by allowing \nschool districts to use existing Federal STEM funding to create STEM \nspecialty schools or to enhance existing STEM programs within the \nschools. Our provision will also ensure that the Department of \nEducation is aligning STEM programs and resources with the needs of \nschool districts and teachers. I understand that it is in the managers' \npackage, and I thank the two leaders for that.\n  The second amendment is the improving teacher and principal \nretention. The Every Child Achieves Act includes important reforms to \nimprove the quality of education for students in Indian Country. One \nchallenge that schools serving Native Americans continue to confront is \nthe high rate of teacher and principal turnover and the instability it \ncauses. Turnover hurts school districts with the added cost of rehiring \nand retraining, and it hurts kids as teachers come and go.\n  One way to decrease teacher and principal turnover is to boost the \nprofessional development these teachers receive. Inadequate \nprofessional development and the lack of ongoing support are some of \nthe key reasons why some of our best teachers are leaving. That is why \nSenator Murkowski of Alaska and I have been pushing a provision to \nimprove teacher and principal retention in schools serving American \nIndian and Alaska Native students. Specifically, our amendment adds \nmentoring and teacher support programs, including instructional support \nfrom tribal elders and cultural experts, to improve the professional \ndevelopment that teachers and principals in Indian schools receive. \nThis is also in the managers' package, and we appreciate that.\n  The next amendment deals with chronic absenteeism. We know students \ncan't learn if they are not in school. When I was a prosecutor in \nHennepin County, I developed a major truancy initiative to keep kids in \nschool and out of the courtroom. My office worked closely with local \nschools on a faster, more effective response to truancy problems. That \nis why my provision in the Every Child Achieves Acts will provide \nprofessional development and training to schools to help ensure that \nteachers, principals, and other school leaders have the knowledge and \nskills necessary to address issues related to chronic absenteeism.\n  Truancy is sometimes called the kindergarten of crime because it is \ntruly an early risk factor. I still remember looking at the files of \nserious juvenile offenders--ones who committed homicide and the like--\nand I realized the first indication that there was a real problem was \ntruancy. It doesn't just hit in high school; it actually usually\n\n[[Page S4921]]\n\nhits in sixth and seventh grade. The more we can do to put a focus on \nthis, the better off we will be not only for public safety but, of \ncourse, for the kids' lives.\n  I again thank Senator Murray and Senator Alexander for their \ntremendous work on this bill.\n\n\n                           Export-Import Bank\n\n  Mr. President, the other issue, which is somewhat related, as we look \nat preparing kids for the current economy and the century we are in, is \nabout jobs. It is about moving our economy along. Part of that is \nmaking sure we can compete globally not only with education efforts, \nwhich is what we are doing this week, but also with financing.\n  There are over eighty export-import-type banks in developed nations. \nChina's bank currently funds things at nearly four times the amount \nthat the Unites States does. Yet we are seriously now allowing the \nExport-Import Bank to lapse, and I strongly support reauthorizing the \nBank.\n  I want to thank all of those involved, including Senators Cantwell, \nKirk, Heitkamp, and Graham, for their strong and impassioned leadership \non this issue. I also wish to thank all of my colleagues who have \nspoken about the importance of this Bank.\n  Yesterday, a few of us met with the President and senior White House \nofficials to discuss the importance of reauthorizing the Export-Import \nBank. America needs to be, as I said, a country that thinks, that \ninvents, that builds things, and that exports to nations. That means \nthe bill we are working on this week, but it also means the financing \nso those businesses can keep going.\n  We had a vote here, as we all know, and 65 Senators supported \nreauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank, and in the House, 60 Republicans are \ncosponsoring a bill to do the same. We should get it done. We know that \nwhen 95 percent of the world's customers live outside of our borders, \nthere is literally a world of opportunity out there for U.S. \nbusinesses. We all know that isn't just about Mexico and Canada. It is \nabout the rest of the world, including Asia and the emerging economies \nin Africa. We can just go all over the world to see opportunities.\n  In my own State of Minnesota, the Ex-Im Bank has supported $2 billion \nin exports and helped over 170 companies in the last 5 years alone. \nEvery single year, as the Presiding Officer knows, I have been to all \n87 counties in Minnesota so I am able to see firsthand these \nbusinesses. I may not be going there to talk about Ex-Im. I have rarely \ndone that, although we have had a few Ex-Im events. I am so surprised \nwhen I go to businesses and they say: We have actually grown our \nexports to 15 percent or it is now 20 percent of our business, and we \nwent to Ex-Im and got financing, and we went to the Foreign Commercial \nService and got help. What we are really hurting by letting this lapse \nand not reauthorizing it are the small businesses.\n  In my State, 170 businesses used the services of Ex-Im in the last \nfive years. They don't have an expert on Kazakhstan. They don't have a \nbank down the street in a small town of 3,000 people that is able to \nexplain to them how to get that kind of financing. They rely on the \nexpertise of Ex-Im and, most importantly, they rely on the credit of \nEx-Im.\n  Look at this: Balzar, in Mountain Lake, MN, population of 2,000. As \nthe Presiding Officer knows, we don't have many mountains in Minnesota, \nbut we have a lot of lakes. So we call it Mountain Lake. This is a \nsmall business--74 people in a town of 2,000--that has relied on Ex-Im \nin the past decade to help export its products. Their exports have \ngrown to about 15 percent of their total sales. They export from Canada \nto Kazakhstan, from Japan to Australia. They are exporting to South \nAfrica.\n  Ralco, a small animal feed manufacturer in Marshall, is a third-\ngeneration family business with distribution to over 20 countries \naround the world.\n  Superior Industries in Morris, MN, is a manufacturer of bulk material \nprocessing and handling systems. There are 5,000 people in the town, \nand 500 people in Morris are employed at this company. That would be 10 \npercent of the town. Thanks to the Ex-Im Bank, they are able to export \nto Canada, Australia, Russia, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, and Brazil.\n  We know this is necessary for small businesses. We know this is \nimportant for our country to be on an even playing field. We don't want \nChina to eat our lunch, but if we continue along this way and become \nthe only developed Nation that doesn't have financing authority such as \nthis, we will let them eat our lunch.\n  At the end of last month when the Ex-Im Bank expired, there were \nnearly 200 transactions totaling nearly $9 billion in financing \npending, and many businesses--90 percent of which are small \nbusinesses--are no longer able to use their export credit and insurance \nto its full extent. I have already talked to businesses that literally \nhave been told: When we were trying to make a deal, our competitors on \nthe other side that were trying to make the next deal said: They are \nnot going to get financing. That country let their Ex-Im Bank expire. \nGo to a business from this country. Take our business because you know \nwe have steady financing.\n  This cannot continue.\n  This is why this is a major priority of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \na major priority for small business organizations around the country, \nand a major priority, most importantly, for the workers that work at \nthese companies.\n  It is critical to move forward. We must reauthorize the Export-Import \nBank and make sure our exporters are competing on a level playing field \nin this global market. We do it with education, thanks to the good work \nof Senator Alexander and Senator Murray, but we also do it by making \nsure that our businesses have the financing tools they need to succeed.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Ex-Im Bank and reauthorize this \ncritical agency as soon as possible.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nher contributions to the legislation we are working on. She has been \nvery focused on STEM education and has found creative ways to encourage \nthat, and I thank her for it.\n  We are hoping within a few minutes to be able to agree by consent to \na few bills and call up a few others. So what I would say to the \nSenator from Arkansas, through the Chair, is if he wouldn't mind going \nahead with his remarks and, perhaps, if we are able to, I may ask him \nto yield for 60 seconds and allow us to do that and proceed with a \nunanimous consent request. But I don't want to delay the Senator any \nfurther with moving ahead with his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                            Sanctuary Cities\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, there are certain policies that should not \nbe controversial. It should not be controversial to expect that the \nlaws of this Nation be enforced--equally, fairly, and fully. It should \nnot be controversial to expect local city governments to refrain from \nactively frustrating the enforcement of Federal law. It should not be \ncontroversial to say that an illegal immigrant and repeat felon who has \nbeen deported multiple times should not be set free to again threaten \nlaw-abiding Americans, much less be in possession of a weapon.\n  But in our current debate about immigration, these ideas are indeed \ncontroversial when, in fact, they should be matters of simple common \nsense.\n  I acknowledge that reasonable people can and do differ on issues such \nas border security and enforcement and the status of illegal immigrants \npresent in our Nation. But we should not disagree about the importance \nof the rule of law and the need to protect the safety of the American \npeople. That is why I have introduced an amendment that will withhold \nFederal immigration and law enforcement funds from any State or city \nthat declares itself a sanctuary for illegal immigrants. If a city \ndirects its law enforcement officers to frustrate Federal immigration \nlaw, it should not expect U.S. taxpayers to underwrite that effort.\n  Last week, a young woman, Kate Steinle, was murdered on a San \nFrancisco pier popular with tourists while walking with her father. It \nwas apparently a random crime, one committed by an illegal immigrant--\nJuan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez--with a long rap\n\n[[Page S4922]]\n\nsheet. Lopez-Sanchez was in the United States despite having been \ndeported five times previously, and he should have been deported a \nsixth time. Earlier this year, Lopez-Sanchez was in custody of Federal \nimmigration authorities after he finished a Federal prison sentence, \nand was awaiting deportation after being designated an ``enforcement \npriority.'' Federal authorities handed him over to San Francisco first \nso he could face outstanding drug charges and requested that they be \nnotified if San Francisco planned to release him.\n  San Francisco did in fact release him in April after dropping \ncharges, but it never notified anyone. The city's government simply \nallowed Lopez-Sanchez to walk free. This is because San Francisco has \nproudly deemed itself a sanctuary city. It has passed city ordinances \nbarring its officers from assisting the enforcement of immigration law, \nfreeing itself of the most basic responsibility to cooperate with \nFederal immigration authorities to keep dangerous criminals off the \nstreets and out of the country. Indeed, Lopez-Sanchez has admitted that \nhe goes to San Francisco because it is a sanctuary city.\n  This is an outrage to anyone who respects law and order. One might \nthink that it would draw a strong reaction from the Obama \nadministration. The administration, after all, has unequivocally \ndeclared that the Constitution and our laws do ``not permit the States \nto adopt their own immigration programs and policies, or to set \nthemselves up as rival decisionmakers based on disagreement with the \nfocus and scope of Federal enforcement.'' That is a direct quote from \nthe administration's legal brief to the Supreme Court arguing against \nan Arizona law designed to help Federal officers enforce immigration \nlaws. One would think the administration would be at least as tough on \nsanctuary city laws that openly flout Federal immigration policies and \nendanger law-abiding citizens. Yet the administration has enabled--even \nencouraged--these sanctuary cities for years.\n  Americans have a right to expect that governments at the local, \nState, and national level will carry out their most basic duty to \nenforce the law and protect public safety. We should all be able to \nagree that a family enjoying a public space such as San Francisco's \npiers should not have to fear being shot dead. We should all be able to \nagree that criminals who should be deported under our laws should not \nbe set free with impunity.\n  There should be no sanctuary for hardened criminals in this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Nevada is one of the largest States in the \ncountry--the 7th largest, to be exact--but we have just 17 school \ndistricts. By contrast, California, has over 1,000 school districts.\n  Among our 17 Nevada districts is the Clark County School District \nwith over 300,000 students. It's the Nation's fifth largest district--\nwhere two-thirds of the students are minorities, and one-in-five \nstudents is an English-language learner.\n  For the past decade, Clark County School District has been one of the \nfastest growing districts in the Nation. In some years, Clark County \nwas opening a new school every month to keep up with the growth.\n  But northwest of Las Vegas and Clark County is another one of our 17 \ndistricts--vast, rural Esmeralda County. Esmeralda County School \nDistrict is huge, in terms of land. It covers almost 3,600 square \nmiles, but has just four schools and about 80 students. And Esmeralda \nCounty is not unique in Nevada. There are other rural school districts \nin the State with schools that still have one teacher instructing \nmultiple grades--much like the school I attended as a boy.\n  This diversity of Nevada's school districts makes the State a \nmicrocosm of our Nation. So I understand the issues that overcrowded, \nurban schools face; and I understand the challenges that rural schools \nmust confront. More importantly, I understand that in order to improve \neducation at every school in America, we need a comprehensive approach.\n  The reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nthat is before the Senate is a step in the right direction. This \nreauthorization has been a long time coming.\n  Congress last reauthorized ESEA with passage of the No Child Left \nBehind Act in 2001. That expired in 2007. Despite serious efforts to \npass a reauthorization in 2011 and 2013 under former Senator Tom \nHarkin's leadership, we were not able to overcome real policy \ndisagreements on the best way forward. But thanks to the hard and \ndetermined work of the chairman and ranking member of the Senate HELP \nCommittee, we are able to begin work on the bipartisan Every Child \nAchieves Act.\n  I know it was not easy for the senior Senator from Washington or the \nsenior Senator from Tennessee. I appreciate their efforts. Because of \ntheir work, almost 14 years after the last reauthorization, and 8 years \nafter it expired, we finally have a bipartisan bill to strengthen our \nNation's schools.\n  I have many concerns with current Federal education law. It has \ncaused schools to spend too much time testing and preparing for tests. \nIt has led many schools and districts to reduce or eliminate many \nsubjects--such as social studies, music, the arts, and physical \neducation--that are important parts of a well-rounded education. It has \nled to too many schools--many making real gains in student \nachievement--to be labeled as failing.\n  Despite these real flaws that need to be corrected, there are some \naspects of current law we need to keep and improve upon. Schools, \ndistricts, and States must now make sure all students--including those \nwith disabilities, or those not proficient in English--are making \nprogress. We also have seen real gains in student achievement. Our \nNation's high school graduation rate is the highest it has ever been \nand the achievement gap between minority students and white students is \nnarrowing.\n  This bipartisan bill does build off some of these successes and \naddresses many of the flaws in current law. It maintains annual testing \nrequirements, but includes provisions to consolidate tests--helping \nreduce the number of tests and amount of time students spend taking \ntests. It continues to require student achievement to be reported by \ngroups of children, including by income, race, English-language \nproficiency, and for students with disabilities. It makes early \nchildhood education a priority, with a new grant to improve early \nchildhood education access and quality for low- and moderate-income \nfamilies. It makes important changes to a grant program to help our \nlowest-performing schools. Most notably, this bipartisan agreement also \ndoes not include many of the proposals included in earlier draft bills \nthat would dilute the effectiveness of title I dollars or allow States \nto reduce their support for education.\n  This bill is an important first step in strengthening our Nation's \nschools and ensuring that our children have a world class education. \nAnd it is a true compromise--with both sides making concessions to move \nforward.\n  We all agreed that improvements needed to be made to our country's \neducation laws. Although Democrats and Republicans have vastly \ndifferent approaches, through compromise, Senators Murray and Alexander \nwere able to craft a balanced bill.\n  That is not to say that this bill is perfect. We still have work to \ndo. I know that many Senators will have ideas for improving this \nlegislation. I, for one, think we can do more to ensure that our \nlowest-performing schools make progress, or that we can do more to \naddress schools with persistently low graduation rates. I believe we \ncan do more to expand early learning opportunities and to do more to \nprotect students from bullying. I will also strongly oppose efforts to \nweaken public schools through voucher programs.\n  I look forward to a substantive debate on this important bill. After \nall, helping to ensure that every American child gets a quality \neducation could be among the most important things that the Senate will \ndo during this Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy).

Mr. President, I thank Senators Alexander and Murray for \ncrafting this bipartisan proposal to reform and reauthorize the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, the main source of Federal aid \nfor K-through-12 education.\n  The Every Child Achieves Act takes many important steps to return the \nauthority of K-12 education back to the States and to the local school \ndistricts and directly to those who are best equipped to understand and \nrespond to what it takes to educate our students. Importantly, this \nbill empowers States to develop their own education accountability \nplans. Instead of a one-size-fits-all Federal mandate, this bill \ncharges the States to work with teachers, school districts, Governors, \nparents, and other stakeholders to develop a State-led education plan \nfor all students without interference from Washington.\n  The bill affirms that the Federal Government cannot dictate a State's \nspecific academic standards, curriculum or assessment. I repeat. The \nbill affirms that the Federal Government cannot dictate State-specific \nacademic standards, curriculum or assessments. It affirms local control \nand accountability while maintaining important achievement information \nto provide parents with information on how their children are \nperforming as well as to help teachers target support to those who are \nstruggling to meet State standards.\n  We also recognize that science, technology, engineering, and \nmathematics--or STEM--education continues to play an increasingly \nimportant role in preparing our students for the careers of tomorrow.\n  In North Dakota, STEM education prepares students to fulfill the \nworkforce needs of our dynamic economy, from the high-tech industries \nin the east to the energy fields in the west. For example, we have one \nschool district, the West Fargo school district, which has created a \nSTEM center for students in grades 6, 7, and 8, and is doing an \nexceptional job of integrating STEM teaching into the classroom. This \nschool district program started in 2009 with 150 students in the sixth \nand seventh grades. Since then, it has been expanded to serve eighth \ngrade students as well. They have also created a STEM pathway program \nat the high school level. The approach focuses on project-based \nlearning that connects their school work to solving real world problems \nthrough the engineering and design process.\n  When Senator Klobuchar and I visited the school this spring, we \nwitnessed students working hands-on with a wide range of technologies \nat cooperative lab stations, including drones and flight simulators. \nWest Fargo students have received numerous awards and honors, placing \nfirst in the Nation in a lunar water recycling design competition \nsponsored by NASA to excelling in a number of Web page design and \nrobotics competitions around the country.\n  This education is not just about teaching students more science, math \nor engineering. This approach reaches across subjects to promote \nproblem solving, collaboration, communication, and critical thinking \nskills.\n  The Every Child Achieves Act includes a formula grant aimed at \nproviding State resources to improve STEM education. The Improving STEM \nInstruction and Student Achievement Program provides grants to States \nto improve STEM instruction, student engagement, and increased student \nachievement in STEM subjects. Under this program, States have the \nability to award subgrants to projects of their choice to serve high-\nneed school districts or form partnerships with higher education \ninstitutions. States can also use these funds to recruit qualified \nteachers and instructional leaders in STEM subjects or to develop a \nSTEM master teacher corps.\n  In recent years, North Dakota has chosen to award funds to projects \nthat partner with our State's higher education institutions to provide \nprofessional development opportunities for K-12 math and science \nteachers.\n  I have worked with Senator Klobuchar to craft amendment No. 2138. Our \nproposal will give States the option to award those funds to create or \nenhance a STEM-focused specialty school or a STEM program within a \nschool.\n  STEM-focused specialty schools or STEM programs within a school are \nthose that engage students in rigorous, relevant, and integrated-\nlearning STEM experiences. Allowing funds to go toward a STEM program \nwithin a school will allow successful programs such as those occurring \nin our State to benefit. It will also encourage other school districts \nto begin their own programs.\n  So if a school district would like to better integrate STEM concepts \ninto their teaching practices, this amendment allows those districts to \nsubmit a proposal to the State for resources to carry out that plan.\n  The Klobuchar-Hoeven amendment also requires the Education Secretary \nto identify STEM-specific needs of States and districts receiving funds \nand publicize information about those activities. The Secretary is then \ndirected to align Federal STEM activities with State and district \nneeds.\n  Finally, this amendment directs the U.S. Department of Education to \navoid unnecessary duplication of STEM programmatic activities supported \nby the Department and other Federal agencies. This is important because \nthere are so many disjointed STEM activities and programs throughout \nour government.\n  In a May 2015 report, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service \nstates that despite recent reductions in the number of Federal STEM \nprograms, recent estimates suggest there are still between 105 and 254 \nSTEM programs scattered throughout as many as 15 Federal agencies. \nThese programs account for $2.8 billion to $3.4 billion in spending. \nThese programs have their own distinct requirements and obligations \nthat allow very little collaboration or coordination. We simply want to \nensure that States and schools are aware of the existing efforts \nunderway to best utilize public resources.\n  In conclusion, we believe that this bipartisan amendment should be \nagreeable to both sides and will strengthen the Every Child Achieves \nAct. In fact, I have just been informed that both the chairman and the \nranking member from the HELP Committee and the\n\n[[Page S4927]]\n\nleaders on this Every Child Achieves Act have included our legislation \nin the manager's package with support from both sides of the aisle.\n  I want to thank both Senator Lamar Alexander from Tennessee, who is \nthe chairman of the committee and the sponsor of the bill, as well as \nSenator Patty Murray from Washington, who is the co-lead on this \nlegislation, for their support of this STEM legislation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I also rise in support of the Every Child \nAchieves Act and the good work that is being done in a bipartisan way \nto move elementary and secondary education forward in this country. I \napplaud Senators Alexander and Murray and all HELP Committee members \nand their staff for the good work that has been done on this bill, \nwhich is hugely important to our Nation's children but even more \nimportantly to our economy and our global competitiveness. The fact \nthat we are approaching this in a bipartisan manner creates a lot of \nhope and optimism.\n  I speak from a number of roles. I was well educated in public, \nprivate, and parochial schools myself. My three children have gone \nthrough the Richmond public school system, an urban public school \nsystem in Virginia, during the era of No Child Left Behind. So Federal \neducation policy was coming home in their backpack, crumpled up at the \nend of every day. My wife and I have kind of lived through that with \nthem. My wife is the current secretary of education in Virginia, with \nthe responsibility of carrying out State and Federal education policy. \nIn my own role, as an elected official--as mayor--education was our \nbiggest expenditure, and I visited a school in our city every Tuesday \nmorning. As Lieutenant Governor, in the State budget education was our \nbiggest priority, and I visited schools in all 134 cities and counties \nin Virginia. Then, as Governor, I had the opportunity--the great \nopportunity--to work with our State, our teachers, our PTOs, and other \neducational stakeholders in the Virginia education system, which 50 \nyears ago was one of the weakest in the United States, and I am proud \nto say is now one of the best in the United States.\n  I learned a lot as Governor when No Child Left Behind was being \nimplemented in the schools of my State. I saw the good and the bad of \nNo Child Left Behind, and I certainly saw the reason that we need to \nimprove it. That is what the Every Child Achieves Act does.\n  First, I will speak about the good things of No Child Left Behind. \nThere are two notable good things that, frankly, are critically \nimportant we maintain. No Child Left Behind made us disaggregate \nstudent data so that we couldn't hide behind averages. Averages can be \ndeceiving. Virginia average test scores are great, but that doesn't \nmean they are great everywhere in Virginia. So we had to dig in and \nlook at whether minority students were performing well or whether rural \nstudents were performing well or urban students. No Child Left Behind \nhelped us to do that and not hide behind averages but really make sure \nthat groups of students were not falling behind either statewide or in \nthe individual cities and counties.\n  The second thing No Child Left Behind did--which is pretty amazing--\nwas that before No Child Left Behind there was not a standardized \ndefinition of graduation or dropout rates in this country. So if you \nwanted to know how your own city was doing or your own county was doing \nor your own State was doing, and if you wanted to compare that against \nanywhere else, you couldn't because everybody was using their own \nmeasure. Usually folks would try to fuzz up the data because they were \nafraid of being held accountable around graduation rates and dropout \nrates. No Child Left Behind, together with some pioneering work from \nthe National Governors Association, ended up standardizing the \ndefinition of graduation and dropout rates, which enabled us to compare \nand compete with each other.\n  Not surprisingly, as President Obama discussed in the State of the \nUnion in the early part of 2015, our graduation rates are better than \nthey have ever been because now we can focus on them, we know who is \ndoing well and who is not, and that sense of focus and competition is \nenabling us to move ahead.\n  But No Child Left Behind also had some unintended negative \nconsequences. The intense focus on high-stakes testing, which is \nsupposed to help you diagnose and then lead to educational strategies \ndown the road--sometimes testing has become an end in itself rather \nthan a means to an end: better student performance. That creates all \nkinds of stresses on students and teachers and parents.\n  Similarly, the focus on disaggregating student data which \ndemonstrates that there are achievement gaps in certain communities, \nwhether it be minority communities or rural or urban areas, has often \nhad the perverse consequence, when coupled with high-stakes testing, of \nencouraging some of our best and brightest teachers not to want to go \ninto the schools where they are most needed. If they feel as if they \nwill be punished because the test scores are not as high with poor \nkids, for example, then they will often choose not to go to those \nschools. That is clearly not what we meant to do with No Child Left \nBehind, but that has been one of its perverse consequences.\n  When I was Governor, I had a very funny--now it is funny; it was not \nfunny at the time--argument with the Federal Department of Education. \nThey absolutely insisted that jurisdictions in northern Virginia were \nadministering certain tests wrong to students who don't speak English \nas their first language at home. Indeed, some of my cities and counties \nhad a strategy of phasing students in. If they were coming from a \nbackground where they did not speak English at home, they would be \ntested in special ways for the first couple of years they were in the \nschool system and then mainstreamed even in the way they were tested.\n  The Department of Education said: You cannot do that. You cannot do \nthese tests differently.\n  What I would say to the Department of Education: Hey, let me show you \nthe SAT scores of my Latino students. Let me show you how they are \ndoing when they graduate, that they are some of the highest performing \nstudents in the country. Clearly, if you measure it by the outcomes, we \nare doing it the right way.\n  But the Department of Education said: Outcomes do not matter to us. \nWe worry about the processes and the inputs and the way you provide the \ntests.\n  Well, outcomes should be important. Results should be important. Too \noften, No Child Left Behind was administered in a way where results did \nnot matter. That is not what should happen.\n  I applaud Senators Alexander and Murray for this bill because I \nbelieve the Every Child Achieves Act gives school districts and States \nthe incentive to work for the success of all students but also the \nflexibility they need to close achievement gaps. The bill maintains \ncritical annual testing requirements to allow us to track progress of \nstudents, while letting States set their own goals for improvement. The \nbill invests in early childhood education, which is critical to give \nStates the authority to determine teacher qualifications in those \nareas. I am very glad this bill recognizes there are factors other than \ntest scores that determine whether our students will be successful. I \napplaud this act. I cannot wait to vote for it.\n  I would like to comment on two amendments I have worked with my team \nand my staff member Karishma Merchant, who is superb, to put into this \nbill--some that are already in and some that I think are forthcoming or \nare in the process on the floor.\n  The first is the very important challenge of young people, age 16 to \n24, who are in the most vulnerable time in their lives to being the \nvictims of sexual assaults. A kid age 16 to 24--that is the most likely \nperiod in their life where they would be vulnerable to any kind of \nsexual assault or sexual misconduct. That is whether they are in \nschool, college, the military, the workforce, or whether they are \nsomewhere else.\n  We are spending a lot of time working on this issue, but this bill \ncontains an amendment I proposed called the Teach Safe Relationships \nAct to help tackle this issue. Basically, under the amendment Senator \nMcCaskill and I\n\n[[Page S4928]]\n\nintroduced in February, schools that are receiving title IV funds must \nreport on how they are teaching safe relationship behaviors to \nstudents--communication, understanding what coercion is, understanding \nwhat consent is, understanding how to avoid pressure, understanding \nwhere to go for help. These are matters which we will teach to our \nstudents at a younger age so they can keep themselves safe.\n  I need to give praise on this one--the idea for this came from \nstudents at the University of Virginia. I went and visited with them \nabout sexual assaults on campus in December. They told me: We wish we \ncame to campus better prepared to deal with these issues.\n  I asked them: Well, don't you take sex education classes in high \nschool?\n  They said: Yes, but the classes are about reproductive biology. There \nneeds to be a little more about safe behavior and relationship \nstrategies.\n  I thought, what a great idea. That led to the amendment. The \namendment has now been incorporated. I praise the students at UVA who \nput this on my radar screen. I thank Senators Alexander and Murray, who \nworked with me to incorporate this in the base bill. If we teach young \nkids the right strategies, whether they are in the military or on \ncollege campuses or in the workforce or anywhere else, our young \nstudents, 16 to 24, will be safer.\n  The second series of amendments--some have been included and others \nhave been voted on--one today and one will be voted on on Monday \nnight--are amendments dealing with career and technical education.\n  I was a principal of a school that taught kids to be welders and \ncarpenters. I grew up the son of a guy who ran an iron-working shop. I \nam a huge believer in career and technical education. Every job in this \ncountry does not need the traditional 4-year bachelor's degree. In \nfact, there are many jobs in this country--and the unemployment rate is \nstill too high--there are many jobs in this country that are going \nunfilled. We have to bring welders in on foreign visas and other \nimportant career and technical fields because we don't adequately \npromote and celebrate career and technical education. This is similar \nto the previous speech about STEM.\n  I have formed a Career and Technical Education Caucus, together with \nSenators Portman and Baldwin. We introduced the Career Ready Act. Some \nportions have already been included in the bill, and another portion \nwill be voted on on Monday night. But the idea is basically to make \ncareer and technical education every bit as front-and-center as college \nprep courses because we want our kids to graduate from high school both \ncollege- and career-ready. Career and technical education is an \nimportant part of that.\n  Earlier today, we passed an amendment to make clear that for Federal \npurposes, career and technical education is not elective, it is core \ncurriculum, because it is core, important education. Nations around the \nworld recognize it. We need to as well.\n  I have two additional amendments. We will consider one Monday night--\nthe Career Ready Act, which clarifies and encourages but does not \nrequire the use of accountability indicators in State accountability \nplans to promote readiness for postsecondary education and career \nreadiness. Forty-one States already do this. We will encourage more to \ndo it if we pass the career-ready amendment.\n  Second, I have an amendment that I am still working on and hope to \nget in on the floor. It is bipartisan by introduction. Senator Ayotte \nand I have this. It is to create a middle school career and technical \nexploration program called Middle STEP. Kids in the middle school \nyears, if they get a broader exposure to the careers that are available \nto them, they will be better equipped to start picking curricular paths \nwhen they go to high school.\n  I am so passionate about the need for career and technical education \nbecause I lived it growing up in my dad's business and teaching kids in \nHonduras the value of career and technical fields.\n  Everywhere I go in this country, I have employers who tell me they \nneed workers who are skilled, whether it is allied health \nprofessionals, such as EMTs, or culinary training or welding and iron-\nworking training or computer coding. These career and technical fields \nthat require some postsecondary education but not necessarily a 4-year \ncollege degree are paths to great livelihoods. We do not often \nemphasize them enough. This bill will help us do that.\n  I will close and say this: It has been 13 years since Congress \nreauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It is time to \nupdate No Child Left Behind, and this is good work to do it.\n  President Kennedy said in a message to Congress in 1961--and these \nwords still ring true:\n\n       Our progress as a nation can be no swifter than our \n     progresses in education. Our requirements for world \n     leadership, our hopes for economic growth, and the demands of \n     citizenship itself in an era such as this all require the \n     maximum development of every young American's capacity.\n\n  That is almost a great 20th-century paraphrase of what a Virginian, \nThomas Jefferson, said in the 1780s:\n       Progress in government and all else depends upon the \n     broadest possible diffusion of knowledge among the general \n     population.\n\n  Those words were true then. Senator Kennedy's words are true. \nEducation is still the path to success for an individual or for a \ncommunity and nation. We will advance the cause of education and the \ncause of success if we pass the Every Child Achieves Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to take this time to thank Senators \nAlexander and Murray on the bill that is before our body, the Every \nChild Achieves Act. It is so important that we focus on this area of \neducation.\n  Two important provisions I asked to be included have been included in \nthe bill. I want to specifically talk about those and again thank both \nSenators for including those important initiatives in this important \nbill.\n  One of them is the reauthorization of afterschool programs--something \nI have worked on my entire life in Congress. It goes back a very long \ntime. Another one is on e-cigarettes, which I believe are endangering \nour Nation's youth.\n  Senator Murkowski was very instrumental in the committee, working \nwith Senator Murray to make sure my bipartisan After School for \nAmerica's Children Act was incorporated in the bill. I thank her.\n  In the Senate, I first introduced my afterschool bill in 1997. I \nworked with Senator Ensign at that time. The Federal Government at that \ntime only funded small afterschool pilot programs. When we got to 2001, \nI saw an opportunity to take that pilot program and turn it into a \nreal, funded authorization for afterschool programs. The bill we have \non the floor today and next week will modernize that afterschool \nprogram. It is the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program, \nwhich incorporates afterschool. It will help States support quality \nafterschool programs. It encourages parental engagement and involvement \nand ensures that afterschool activities complement the academic \ncurriculum. Our kids don't stop learning just because the clock strikes \n2 or 3 or 4; they keep learning. So the afterschool activities are very \nimportant.\n  Most important to me is that this bill preserves the stream of \nfunding that is necessary to protect the afterschool programs because, \nto be quite honest, we have had a lot of issues with people trying to \ngrab those funds and use them for something else. Let me tell you why \nwe cannot do that. We now serve more than 1.6 million children of \nworking families every year through this afterschool program. That is \nprogress. Think about 1.6 million children. Think about all of their \nparents and the relief it brings to them to know they have their \nchildren in a quality afterschool program.\n  But there are still 11.3 million children left unsupervised when the \nday ends. In other words, one in five children is unsupervised from 3 \nto 6 p.m. Those are the hours where juvenile crime peaks and risky \nbehaviors are most likely to occur. Law enforcement and mayors have \nbeen telling us for years that afterschool programs reduce crime. It \ntruly is a no-brainer. Our kids need a safe place to go after school. \nOur parents need to make sure their kids are safe after school because \nmost parents work in today's world.\n  No matter what leading candidates for the Republican nomination say, \ntoday my understanding is Jeb Bush\n\n[[Page S4929]]\n\nsaid our workers don't work hard enough. He said that our workers don't \nwork hard enough. Just talk to the parents of these kids. They are \nworking hard, sometimes multiple jobs. They need to know their kids are \nsafe.\n  I want to talk about one student, Gerardo Rodriguez, who grew up in \npoverty in Los Angeles. He dealt with the threat of violence and the \nallure of gang life. While he was at Carson Middle School, he chose to \njoin an afterschool program that was run by the Boys and Girls Club \ninstead of a gang. Gerardo went to an afterschool program instead of \njoining a gang. In statistics, he would be told he was likely to be a \ndropout. Instead, he graduated from Carson High. In 2012, he obtained \n$3,000 in college scholarships. He is in his second year at California \nState University, Long Beach, and he is majoring in engineering.\n  We need to save kids like this. Yes, the parents are working hard, \nmany hours, and they need afterschool help. This bill helps those kids. \nI would like to do more for more children, but I am thankful we are \npreserving this program.\n  Our working families need to know their kids are safe because there \nare more than 28 million parents of school-age children who are \nemployed, including 23 million who work full time. These parents miss \nan average of 5 days of work a year because they don't have afterschool \ncare and their child gets sick. We all know that. We have all gone \nthrough that. Our children have gone through that. So it was 30 years \nago when I started to work on this issue.\n  I again thank Senators Alexander and Murray for preserving \nafterschool care for our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4929-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              E-CIGARETTES\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I also thank Senators Alexander and Murray \nfor including my provisions on a dangerous product that is gaining \npopularity among our children, e-cigarettes. The language in the bill \nallows schools to use their same Federal funding that goes toward \nalcohol, drug, and tobacco education to teach children about more novel \ntobacco products such as e-cigarettes.\n  According to the CDC, youth use of e-cigarettes has tripled in 1 year \nfrom 2013 to 2014. Let me tell you, our kids are not getting accurate \ninformation. There is advertising that is aimed at them that makes it \nsound like this is just a wonderful opportunity for them.\n  What are our children being exposed to? It is not just nicotine--\nclearly, e-cigarettes are a nicotine delivery system--but even more.\n  Now the Surgeon General has said nicotine has a negative impact on \nadolescent brain development. So for God's sake, let us stop our kids \nfrom being able to smoke e-cigarettes on campus. I have an amendment \nthat would do just that, and I hope it will be unanimously accepted \nbecause these e-cigarettes also contain benzene, cadmium, formaldehyde, \npropylene glycol, and nanoparticles that are present in traditional \ncigarettes, according to the California Department of Health.\n  So we need the FDA to finalize their rule on e-cigarettes. But in the \nmeantime, youth use is soaring. We finally are making progress on \nreducing smoking among teens, and yet this e-cigarette situation is out \nof control. That is why I am pleased that in this bill schools will be \nable to teach kids about the dangers of e-cigarettes.\n  In conclusion, again I thank the bill's managers for helping me get \nthe afterschool language in, protecting our kids after school, getting \nsome language in to make sure we can educate our kids against the \ndangers of a new nicotine delivery system called e-cigarettes, but I \nalso have three more amendments that are pending and I hope will pass.\n  The first one I talked about was clarifying that a ban on smoking in \nschools includes all tobacco products such as e-cigarettes. The second \namendment would prohibit advertising e-cigarettes to children. When you \nsee this--I am sorry I didn't bring the charts to the floor--they are \nusing cartoon characters, the same kind of thing that was done by the \nbig tobacco companies. Big Tobacco is behind this, let's be clear. We \ndon't need another epidemic that starts killing our people before we \nfinally turn the corner on regular smoking.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4929-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COLLEGE CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the last amendment I have is a different \nsubject, and it deals with college campus sexual assault. It would \nsimply say that every college campus should have a confidential, \nindependent advocate to help sexual assault survivors every step of the \nway.\n  I am proud to say that my legislation has been voluntarily adopted by \nuniversities in my home State of California, including the University \nof California, the State college system, and the community college \nsystem, to the extent they can deal with it, because there is a lot of \ndiscretion in that particular group of colleges. But I haven't heard \nfrom the private colleges in California.\n  So all we are saying in this amendment is let's make sure every \ncollege campus that gets Federal funds sets up a confidential advocate \nfor women--for men as well who are also victims of sexual assault--so \nthat from the beginning of their complaint they have a friend, they \nhave a confidant, and they have someone who knows their rights with \nthem every step of the way. I would be so proud to see this included.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his endurance on this little talk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4929-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          6-YEAR HIGHWAY BILL\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, next week I hear Senator McConnell may be \ncoming forward with a highway bill. I pray it is a 6-year bill. \nRepublicans and Democrats voted one out of the EPW Committee--I am \nproud to say not one dissenting vote--a 6-year robust bill.\n  I hope we will fund it in a way that doesn't cut other jobs, while we \nare trying to create jobs in the transportation industry, but in fact \nlooks at international tax reform, where we can actually help our \nbusinesses and have a tax system that is reformed. The funds that come \nin to us go to the highway trust fund so we can take care of those \nbridges that are falling done and insufficient--60,000 of them--the \nhighways that need help, and the roads, 50 percent of which are in \ndisrepair. We need help.\n  Our businesses need that help. They call for that help. They are the \nconcrete people, the granite people. They are the general contractors, \nthey are the engineers, our workers, and the construction workers. We \nstill have 200,000 of them out of work since the great recession.\n  We need a 6-year highway bill. We need it now. We need it funded in a \nsmart way that helps our economy keep on growing. So there is a lot of \nwork ahead.\n  I wish to take this opportunity to say thank you to Senator Alexander \nand Senator Murray--and a hopeful request to Senator McConnell that the \nbill that comes to the floor on the highways is one which we can all \nembrace, and we can take care of this great Nation because, I will tell \nyou, there isn't a great nation on Earth that doesn't have an \ninfrastructure to match.\n  You have to move goods, you have to move people, and if you can't do \nthat, we simply can't keep up in this global economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Nelson Mandela once said there can be no \nkeener revelation of a society's soul than the way it treats its \nchildren.\n  Every child deserves a fair chance. If we fail at taking care of our \nchildren, we fail at everything else. So the stakes are high as we work \nto reform the No Child Left Behind Act. Too many children are left \nbehind. The Every Child Achieves Act is a step forward.\n\n[[Page S4930]]\n\n  I thank Senator Alexander and Senator Murray for working so hard on \nthis bill. It is bipartisan, and it is an opportunity for real progress \nin educating our children.\n  My dad used to say get it done, but get it done right. When we say \n``every child succeeds,'' we have to mean it--every child, including \nthose in the poorest and most vulnerable communities. That is what we \nmust do. This is the bill we must pass.\n  I am cautiously optimistic, but I would remind my colleagues, we \ncannot keep playing catchup. I have met with child well-being experts \nin New Mexico and across the Nation. They are very clear. Early \nintervention is key. For too many children, there are too many hurdles \nand too little hope. Our commitment has to begin early and has to stay \nthe course.\n  In New Mexico, almost one in three children lives in poverty. One in \nfive goes to bed hungry. We are ranked next to last in education, last \nin overall child well-being. That is absolutely unacceptable. The \nfuture of my State, for our children and for our economy, depends on \nchanging it.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced the Saving Our Next Generation Act \nfor full funding for programs that work, that work on a daily basis, \nwork in our communities for critical prenatal care, and for Healthy \nStart and Head Start. Too little too late doesn't work. The result is \nwasted opportunity and continued failure. Children need to arrive at \nschool ready to learn and able to realize their full potential.\n\n  That is why I also emphatically support Senator Casey's strong start \namendment for pre-K education for every child. Early learning is \ncritical. Senator Casey's amendment would expand and improve those \nopportunities for children from birth to age 5.\n  We need to ensure all students get the same opportunities. I have \nintroduced an amendment that provides support for Native American \nschools. The Bureau of Indian Education functions as a State education \nagency and has 50,000 students in it, but it is not funded as one. It \noften loses out on grants and other Federal funding. We have to change \nthat.\n  Both sides have worked to improve this bill. I am pleased it has \nseveral measures that I have long fought for. For example, healthy \nchildren are an investment in our future. Their health education should \nbe a priority, not an afterthought. The bill includes my amendment to \nmake health a core subject.\n  In addition, we know that too many students, especially in minority \ncommunities, are not graduating. In my State, one-fifth of high school \nstudents drop out every year. Many who drop out are teen parents. My \namendment provides critical support to these students. We need to do \nall we can to help them stay in school and to raise healthy children \nwhile they do so.\n  The Every Child Achieves Act strengthens STEM education, financial \nliteracy, rural school districts, and 21st century community learning \ncenters. It ensures that tribal leaders can teach native languages in \ntheir schools--something I have long pushed for. It also supports vital \nschool and community public-private partnerships. These are much needed \nreforms and will make a difference to children and families in my \nState.\n  Our goal is clear: to reach all students, especially those who need \nthe most support to succeed in school.\n  In New Mexico, three out of four of our schools are title I schools. \nThey face great challenges. Many students are low income. Many have \nspecial needs. We have to make sure they have the resources they need. \nThis has to be a priority, and it starts with good teachers.\n  We aren't going to recruit great teachers--especially in schools with \nthe greatest need--if we unfairly punish those teachers for poor \nstudent performance. There has to be flexibility, especially early on.\n  Our first obligation is to students--all students. We are accountable \nto them and their parents, and we need to keep applying pressure, while \nproviding support, to States and school districts to ensure that truly \nno child is left behind. But we can't just test for failure; we need to \nplan for success. We should build on what works and leave behind what \ndoesn't. But don't leave behind good students or those teachers who \ndedicate their lives to helping them.\n  Now is the time for reform--to ensure that standards are strong and, \nif not met, efforts are in place to help those students, to make sure \nparents and teachers know how students are performing every year, and \nto give States and school districts the support to succeed.\n  Let's be clear. We face troubling and chronic achievement and \nopportunity gaps. Every school must address this and be held \naccountable. Now is the time to address resource inequities. Now is the \ntime to invest in what works. Now is the time to make sure we are not \ntaking resources away from students, schools, and districts with the \ngreatest need. Parents deserve to know that when children fall behind, \ntheir schools will take action and that we have the resources to do so.\n  But it isn't just schools that must act. So must we act--the \nCongress, parents, and communities. We all have a stake in this, and we \nshare the same goal--to protect at-risk students, to provide \naccountability for taxpayer funds, and to make sure that every child \nhas a fair chance.\n  I want to again commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for \nbringing this legislation to the floor. Working together we can provide \nall students with the education they need.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak concerning the Dodd-Frank \nAct, which mandates the creation of 398 new rules. These rules are \nstill in the process of being implemented, but already we have seen \ncapital moving from productive uses to inefficient and unproductive \nuses as a result of this law. The end result is that every dollar going \nto comply with these rules is a dollar that can't be productively \ninvested in our economy by providing loans or mortgages to customers or \npurchasing machines or, for that matter, hiring new employees. For \nexample, at a recent Senate banking committee hearing, the comptroller \nfor Regions Bank testified to us that the bank now employs more \ncompliance employees than actual loan officers. This is not only bad \nfor Regions Bank, it is harmful for our entire economy.\n  Unfortunately, we see examples of overregulation stemming from \nWashington way too often. Another example of an unnecessary and \nredundant rule that costs businesses capital is the so-called pay ratio \nrule buried in section 953 of Dodd-Frank, and today I come to the \nSenate floor introducing legislation to repeal it, S. 1722. Pay ratio \nrequires the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate a rule \nrequiring companies to calculate the median salary of all their \nemployees and then divide their CEO's pay by that number.\n  According to one prominent organization in support of this rule, the \npurpose of it is to ``shame companies into lowering CEO pay.'' Forcing \ncompanies to move money from productive uses toward re-creating \ninformation that is already available so they can be shamed is a poor \nuse of financial resources. In addition, it is also redundant. CEO pay \nis already public. If anyone is interested in finding the salary of a \nCEO of a public company, that information is easily available thanks to \nalready existing disclosures. Also, both the Bureau of Labor Statistics \nand private economists already track the average salary for a wide \nvariety of jobs. If we know the salary of a company's CEO and we know \nwhat their business does, we can already calculate a company's pay \nratio. In fact, labor unions and private Web sites are already making \nthese calculations.\n  Unfortunately, the result of the pay ratio rule is more than just an \nacademic exercise; according to the SEC, companies will have to spend \n$73 million per year to comply with this rule. And the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce estimates the cost will be higher--as much as $700 million per \nyear or more.\n\n[[Page S4931]]\n\nIf we take those two numbers and split the difference, if we add them \nup and divide them, we get $386 million per year as an average estimate \njust to comply with this one single rule.\n  Taking a look at this rule, let's use our own pay ratio test. In \n2014, the Bureau of Labor Statistics calculated that the annual mean \nwage was $47,230. If we divide $386 million, which is the cost of \ncomplying with the pay ratio rule, by $47,230, which is the mean annual \nwage for workers, we get the number 8,172. This means that on average \nwe could pay 8,172 people their full salary for the amount of money it \ntakes to comply with the pay ratio rule. Remember, this is only one of \n398 such rules found within Dodd-Frank, a number of which have not even \nbeen implemented yet.\n  The money they would use to do this has to come from somewhere to pay \nfor the new compliance systems required to follow this rule, taking \naway much needed capital from businesses that could otherwise invest \nmoney growing their business and creating job opportunities. It is a \nwaste of time, effort, and money.\n  The legislation I introduced yesterday simply strikes this rule in \nDodd-Frank. It does nothing to change any other part of the law. \nRepealing the pay ratio rule would allow companies to find more \nproductive uses for their time and money so they can invest in the \nfuture and create job opportunities.\n  I am committed to relieving Americans from this and other unnecessary \nand burdensome regulations during my time in the Senate. I encourage my \ncolleagues to join me in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4931-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4931-S4934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EVERY CHILD ACHIEVES ACT\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on an amendment that has \ngreat significance for our country. It is about early learning. I will \ngive you the formal name of the amendment so we have it for the record: \nCasey amendment No. 2152, the strong start for America's children \namendment, which is an amendment to the Every Child Achieves Act that \nwill establish a Federal-State partnership to provide access to high-\nquality and public prekindergarten education for low- and moderate-\nincome families.\n  We have had a debate, especially over the last couple of days, about \nour commitment to basic education, so-called elementary and secondary \neducation. As part of that, I think it is the time to finally, at long \nlast, have a debate about early learning on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. It has been a long time since that has happened.\n  I thank the folks who have made it possible for us to get to this \npoint to consider an amendment like this and to have this debate about \nthe larger legislation but also about this amendment, in particular. \nSenator Alexander and Senator Murray were leading the effort to \nconsider the Every Child Achieves Act, but also, in particular, I again \nsalute Senator Murray for her many years, as you might call it, \nlaboring in the vineyards of early learning, as she has done on so many \nother issues--since the first stage, she has been in the Senate working \non early learning. I thank Senator Hirono for her work on this issue as \nwell, in proposing legislation which has come together now after a lot \nof years of work by a number of us in the Senate. We are grateful for \ntheir contribution.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to add Senator Booker as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, what this comes down to is something very \nfundamental. The basic link between learning and earning--if children \nlearn more now or learn more when they are very young, they are going \nto earn a lot more down the road. They are going to do better in \nschool. They are going to succeed in progressing in school in a way we \nwould hope, no matter where they live and no matter what their \ncircumstances, if we make the commitment to those children. Because of \nthat success and progress and learning, they will learn more down the \nroad. We know a more developed education leads to great success in \nschool and also leads to a better job down the road.\n  This isn't simply a commitment to a child. It certainly is that first \nand foremost, but it is also a commitment to our long-term economic \nfuture. If you want higher wages and you want better jobs and you want \na growing economy and you want America not only to compete in a world \neconomy but outcompete and have the best workforce, the best workers in \nthe world, we have to make sure we have the best education system. That \nstarts long before a child gets to first or second grade and even \nstarts before they get to kindergarten. That is why I refer to this as \npre-K or prekindergarten education. If they learn more now, they will \nearn more later. We have to make sure we bear that in mind.\n  As we debate the appropriate role of the Federal Government to ensure \nthat all students in the Nation graduate from high school prepared for \ncollege and career, we cannot forget about this basic piece of the \npuzzle that begins before that child enters kindergarten.\n  In the short term, students enter kindergarten more prepared and \nready for elementary school if we pass legislation like the amendment I \nam proposing. Some studies have even shown high-quality early learning \ncan help double a child's cognitive development. High quality and early \nlearning can double a child's cognitive development.\n  In the long term, high-quality early learning--we want to emphasize \n``high quality.'' I didn't say just any program or any kind of \ncurriculum. We will talk more about that later. High-quality early \nlearning contributes to, among other things, No. 1, a reduction in the \nneed for special education; No. 2, lower juvenile justice rates; No. 3, \nimproved health outcomes; No. 4, increased high school graduation and \ncollege matriculation rates; and, No. 5, increased self-sufficiency in \nproductivity among families. These aren't just assertions. These are \nthe results of many years of study.\n  I will turn to the first chart for today. No. 1, high-quality early \nlearning means children can earn as much as 25 percent more as adults. \nThis is where early learning has a direct and substantial correlation \nto higher wages down the road. No. 2, early learning leads to healthier \nand more productive lives. There is no question about that. Some of the \nbest research on this has been done lately and should be part of the \ndiscussion. No. 3, high-quality early learning also leads to children \nwho are less likely to commit a crime. All the data shows that over \nmany years now. No. 4, high-quality early learning means children are \nmore likely to graduate from high school.\n  We need to get that number up across the country. We hope that will \nlead to more young people finishing high school and getting higher \neducation, but that doesn't always mean a 4-year degree. It might mean \na 2-year degree. It might mean a community college. It might mean a \ntechnical school. They can't get to a community or technical school or \nany kind of higher education unless they graduate from high school. We \nwant to make sure we have programs that do that. Kids learn more now \nand earn more later. That is the first reason to do this. It has a \npositive impact on that child and a substantially positive impact on \nthe economy.\n  The other way to look at this is what would happen in the absence of \nthis kind of commitment, which we don't have right now as a nation. I \nthink it is a strategic imperative that we have a commitment to early \nlearning. But what happens if we don't? We can spend upward of $40,000 \nper inmate on incarceration, thousands of dollars on drug treatment and \nspecial education. Whatever the challenge is, those problems become \nworse the longer we don't make this commitment. That is one option.\n  The other option is to spend a fraction of that $40,000 on high-\nquality preschool and give children the good and smart start they need \nin life. It is that old adage: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound \nof cure.\n  We often have the best testimony from folks in our home State. I want \nto read one of those pieces of testimony. This is a letter I received. \nI will not read the whole letter. I want to refer to\n\n[[Page S4932]]\n\na couple of individuals from Pennsylvania. Heather is from Southwestern \nPennsylvania, and she wrote to us talking about her child. She is \ntalking about the fact that her daughter is enrolled in a high-quality \npre-K program. These are positive testimonials about the impact on the \nchild and on the family. Heather, from southwestern Pennsylvania, wrote \nto us and told us that her daughter is enrolled in a high-quality pre-K \nprogram. These letters are positive testimonials that describe the \nimpact this program has on a child and family.\n\n  Heather says in pertinent part:\n\n       My daughter has blossomed since starting the PA Pre-K \n     Counts program . . . she loves it!! She sings us songs she \n     learns daily and has made lots of friends daily she tells us \n     how much she loves her school and her teachers!\n\n  It goes on from there.\n  Another letter from Dorie D., also from the southwestern corner of \nour State, out near Pittsburgh, says:\n\n       Our daughter has blossomed since starting the PA Pre-K \n     Counts program. Having this program available to us has \n     helped us see how our child learns best.\n\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       She is just so much more animated and open to learning now.\n\n  We get letters like these all the time about the positive impact of \nearly learning. This is testimony from people who are directly affected \nby it.\n  One way to look at this is from the testimony of families. Another \nway to look at it is from the data. One of the best authorities is Dr. \nJames Heckman, the Nobel Prize-winning economist who estimates that the \nreturn on high-quality early learning is as high as $10 for every $1 we \ninvest. Another study of the Perry Preschool Project in Michigan showed \na return of $17 for every $1 spent. So when you spend a buck on early \nlearning, you get 17 bucks in return. This study has been on the record \nfor many years, and unfortunately some elected officials haven't taken \nit to heart.\n  The data of return on investment is overwhelming and indisputable. So \nif we want to measure this in terms of dollars, there is all of the \nevidence in the world. I think the evidence and the testimony from \nparents is even more persuasive, but if we want to do a dollar \ncomparison, there it is--17 bucks returned on 1 buck of investment in \nearly learning.\n  The same research found that children who participated in high-\nquality early learning earned approximately 25 percent more per year \nthan those who did not.\n  So study after study looking at full-day learning programs across the \ncountry have found a positive impact on the future earnings of \nparticipants, and in some cases the benefit just from increased wages \ncould be as high as 3.5 percent per year. So this does have a direct \ncorrelation to wages. My strong start amendment would help more than 3 \nmillion American children have that opportunity for high-quality early \nlearning, and it would give them access to those kinds of programs.\n  My home State of Pennsylvania has made strides in this direction at \nthe State level. That is the good news. The bad news is that they have \nnot made anywhere near the strides we need to make. We are nowhere near \n50 percent of our children in these kinds of programs. So because of \nthat, because of that void or that deficit, the number for Pennsylvania \nin terms of benefits is high. It is estimated that 93,930 children in \nthe State of Pennsylvania could benefit from this amendment being \nenacted into law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the document entitled \n``Five-Year Estimates of Federal Allotments and the Number of Children \nServed By Casey Strong Start Amendment'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to

Estimates\n  were developed using assumptions and some may not be subject to\n  change. Estimates of children served assume the cost of serving each\n  child would be $9,000 per child in every state.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. That is a list of the dollar amounts that States would \nreceive under this. They have to choose to participate, but if they \ndid, they would have not just the dollars for it but the children \nserved. So my amendment would benefit 3 million children across the \ncountry and almost 94,000 children in Pennsylvania. In Ohio, 118,760 \nchildren would benefit from this program. Even a very large State that \nmight not have the investment we would hope, a State such as Texas, has \n299,902 children--let's just round it off and call it 300,000--who \nwould benefit.\n  This chart shows the number of children who would benefit, and I \nbelieve it is long overdue that we made this commitment to our \nchildren.\n  The State would have to match, and that is why I mentioned it at the \nbeginning. This is a Federal and State partnership. And we know if that \nhappens, the full-day preschool would be available for 4-year-olds--\nthat is the age category we are focused on--from families earning 200 \npercent below the Federal poverty level. So if it is a family of four, \n200 percent is a little less than $49,000 of family income.\n  Earlier, I mentioned quality. We don't want to just have programs set \nup around the country--a Federal and State partnership and have a \nprogram. That would be nice, but it won't advance the goal of the best \npossible learning. We want high-quality programs. So we insist that the \nprograms be ones that have teachers with high qualifications who are \npaid comparably to K-through-12 teachers. We would also insist that \nthere be rigorous health and safety standards for these programs, such \nas small class sizes and low child-to-staff ratios, and instruction \nthat is evidence-based and developmentally appropriate. We don't want \nto have just any curriculum; we want to have the best curriculum that \nis based on evidence that it works and also evidence-based \ncomprehensive services for children.\n  This amendment acknowledges that high-quality pre-K programs should \nbe inclusive of services for children with disabilities as well and \nrecognizes the need for increased funding to specifically serve these \nchildren in early childhood.\n  There are other aspects of the program I do not have time to discuss \nright now, but I wanted to address an issue some people have brought to \nmy attention. This program is a new commitment by the United States of \nAmerica, and even folks who say this is a really good idea ask: How do \nyou pay for it?\n  Well, we have a pay-for. There is a change to the Tax Code, which I \nthink a lot of folks would support because of what we have seen over \nthe last couple of years. To pay for this, we would put limits on the \nability of American companies to invert and move their tax domicile \noverseas to reduce their tax liability. That is a long way of saying we \nwould make it more difficult for companies to engage in this so-called \ninversion strategy which allows them, through a loophole, to pay less \ntaxes because they move operations into a smaller company that is \nforeign owned.\n\n[[Page S4933]]\n\nI believe we should make it more difficult for companies to do that. If \nthey want to do that--I don't like when they do that, and not many \npeople like it--we should at least make it a little more difficult. If \nwe make it more difficult for companies to do what we hope they \nwouldn't, that will actually lead to a savings in revenue.\n  It would make a lot of sense for American companies that believe they \nshould move overseas to help us pay for early learning. I think that \nmakes all the sense in the world if we are committed to early learning \nand if we are committed to making sure we can pay for the program. The \namendment itself is paid for by dealing with this loophole or dealing \nwith part of an advantage companies have.\n  This amendment is supported by nearly 40 national organizations, from \nunions, to parent education and early learning groups, disability \nadvocacy groups, and civil rights groups.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the full list of \nendorsing organizations printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n List of Organizations Endorsing Casey Amendment #2152 to S. 1177--The \n             Strong Start for America's Children Amendment\n\n       1.

Zero to Three\n  Mr. CASEY. Just a couple of more points, and I will move on.\n  Even with these recent gains, according to one of the national groups \nthat track this data, the National Institute of Early Education and \nResearch, NIEER, shows that only 4 in 10 American 4-year-olds are \nenrolled in public pre-K and fewer than 2 in 10 3-year-olds. Let's just \nfocus on the 4-year-olds. Four in ten 4-year-olds are in these kinds of \nprograms.\n  I don't know how we can compete and have the best workforce in the \nworld and develop the highest skill level in the world for our future \nif we don't make a commitment to early learning. I don't know how else \nwe can get there over time if we are going to continue to talk a good \ngame about early learning. And to listen to the testimony of parents, \nCEOs, and business owners who come to us year after year, in addition \nto talking to us about taxation and other issues--they say: Please, \nplease make an investment in early learning. Some of the biggest \ncompanies in Pennsylvania and some of the biggest companies in the \nworld have come to us and said that. Whether it is a CEO or a parent or \nan educator, they all believe we have to finally, at long last, make a \ncommitment to early learning as a nation because it is a strategic \neconomic imperative.\n  Even in Pennsylvania, where I mentioned before that we made some \nstrides over basically the last decade or 15 years, we rank 10th in the \namount of State resources invested. That is kind of good news but not \nenough. Pennsylvania is still only able to serve less than 10 percent \nof all 3- and 4-year-olds in State funding for early learning.\n  I think that at the same time we can make the academic arguments--the \narguments by parents and educators and CEOs--we also know that the \nnational data and polling show it is something the American people \nsupport as well. The American people understand the vital importance of \nincreasing investment in early learning.\n  A national poll conducted last year by the bipartisan team at Public \nOpinion Strategies and Hart Research showed that 64 percent of \nAmericans believe we should be doing more to ensure that children start \nkindergarten ready to do their best.\n  Here is another way to summarize it. This chart shows voters who say \nwe should be doing more to ensure that children start kindergarten \nready to do their best, and virtually no one else says we should do \nless. Those who say we should do more to ensure our children start \nkindergarten ready to learn and ready to do their best--64 percent. \nTwenty-seven percent say we should do enough. We have to persuade some \nof those folks in green. Only 4 percent say we should do less. I don't \nknow who those folks are. I hope I can meet them and talk to them. But \nthe overwhelming majority of Americans say we need to do more to give \nchildren the opportunity to be prepared to learn and therefore to have \na strong start in their education and down the road to literally earn \nmore when they are working.\n  This support runs across all parties--55 percent of Republicans, 63 \npercent of Independents, and 73 percent of Democrats.\n  When asked about a similar proposal to the one in my amendment, 7 in \n10 Americans, including 67 percent of Republicans, support it. So it \nhas overwhelming support.\n  I will end with the words of the folks who know the benefit of these \nprograms already--some of the parents who wrote to us. There are two \nmore letters I will cite.\n  The next testimonial is from Beth. She is from Washington County, PA. \nShe expresses gratitude for the Pennsylvania pre-K program. She says:\n\n       My daughter has learned so much. Before the start of PA \n     Pre-K Counts, she couldn't write any of her letters or even \n     recognize them. She has improved so much since the first day \n     of class. It has given her socialization with other kids her \n     age.\n\n  She goes on to tell how much that means to her family and how much \nthat means to her daughter.\n  Finally, Megan, who is from the other end of the State, southeastern \nPennsylvania in Montgomery County, says in part that her son ``came \ninto this program shy and with very little verbal communication. He now \ntalks nonstop and loves learning!''\n  I have only read brief excerpts from letters we have received.\n  Here is the point: If a child enters a program and by the end of that \nis curious about learning, that is a huge success. If a child enters a \nprogram not knowing her letters and by the end of that she is learning \nand achieving, that is something we can all be positive about.\n  The first letter I read talked about the way one mother's child was \nsinging songs that she learns daily. Whatever it is, whether it is \nsinging or learning letters or reading, these children are learning \nbecause of a good program. It didn't just happen by accident. It \nhappened because they are in a high-quality program. It happened \nbecause in some communities they made the decision to invest in the \nfuture of that child and the future of our economy.\n  So let's take a step with this amendment to allow children to learn \nmore now so they can earn more later and help us move into the future \nin a very positive direction for our children, for our families, and \nfor our economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of an \namendment to this underlying bill that addresses resource equity in our \nNation's schools. I am proud to have\n\n[[Page S4934]]\n\nworked across party lines to join my colleagues in supporting this \nbipartisan amendment, particularly to have worked with Senators Kirk, \nReed of Rhode Island, and Brown on this measure. It is an improvement \nto the long-overdue reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act that we have been debating over the course of this week.\n\n  The Every Child Achieves Act importantly focuses on ensuring that \nthose students most in need have access to a high-quality education. It \ncontinues to ensure that title I funds flow to school districts where \nFederal support can make the greatest impact and the most difference. \nIt requires States to report key information that will help us identify \ndisparities such as per-pupil expenditures, school discipline, and \nteacher and educator quality. But I believe we must further strengthen \nthose reporting requirements in order to fully ensure that the range of \ncritical school resources--from quality teachers, to rigorous course \nwork, to well-conditioned and equipped school facilities--is being \nequitably distributed among school districts in a given State. And we \nmust require States to demonstrate how they will act to address \ndisparities among schools.\n  Despite the advances we have seen since President Johnson signed the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act into law 50 years ago, \nsignificant gaps in achievement and opportunity still exist. The U.S. \nDepartment of Education's Office of Civil Rights recently published \ndata from a comprehensive survey of schools across the Nation that \nillustrated the magnitude of the problem. For example, the report \ndescribes how Black, Latino, American Indian, and Native Alaskan \nstudents and English learners attend schools with higher concentrations \nof inexperienced teachers.\n  Furthermore, nationwide, one in five high schools lacks a school \ncounselor, and between 10 and 25 percent of high schools across the \nNation do not offer more than one of the core courses in the typical \nsequence of high school math and science.\n  In my home State of Wisconsin, higher poverty and higher minority \nschool districts remain more likely to have inexperienced teachers. The \nDepartment of Education has data that shows that, for example, in \nMilwaukee, where there are the most high-poverty and high-minority \nschools in our State, 8 percent of teachers are in their first year of \nteaching and 19 percent of teachers lack State certification. The State \naverage is 5.6 percent for first-year teachers and 0.3 percent for \nthose who lack certification.\n  As with the Nation, achievement gaps follow these disparities. \nAccording to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, \nthere are startling differences in student proficiency and graduation \nrates both in Wisconsin and nationally. For example, the average math \nproficiency in low-performing schools in my home State is 12 percent. \nThe average in all other schools in the State is 51 percent. That is a \nhuge gap; it is a 40-percent gap. There is also a 37-percent gap for \nreading and language arts proficiency and a 31-percent gap in \ngraduation rates.\n  We cannot close those achievement gaps if we do not provide all \nstudents with equal access to core educational resources. That is why I \nam pleased to join Senators Kirk, Reed, and Brown in offering this \nopportunity dashboard of core resources amendment. This amendment \nrequires each State to report what key educational resources are \ncurrently available in districts with the highest concentrations of \nminority students and students in poverty. Then it requires them to \ndevelop a plan to address the disparities that are shown to exist. It \ngives States flexibility to develop those plans and lay out a timetable \nwith annual benchmarks for taking action, and it protects a parent's \nright to know about the critical educational resources that are \navailable to his or her child.\n  As we work to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nin its 50th year, we have yet to see its promise of equal access to \neducational opportunity fulfilled for all of America's students. As we \nlook to the next half-century of supporting public education, it is \ncritical that we take steps to ensure that all children have access to \nthe educational resources that will help them succeed, regardless of \nrace, ethnicity, or family income.\n  I understand there may be a vote on this amendment early next week. I \ncertainly hope so. I urge my colleagues to support this very important \nbipartisan effort.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4934-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4934-S4935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EXPERIMENTS IN POLICY\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, when I return home to my State during our \ndistrict work periods--the time when the Senate is not in session--as I \nget a chance to travel my State, as the Presiding Officer does in his, \nI always feel as though I learn something, and I appreciate a little \nbit more how different policies can have a different impact and produce \ndifferent results.\n  As the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin was speaking about the \nimportance of education, I couldn't help but think that we all agree \nwith that, but we have maybe some differences on which policies \nactually produce a better result. I couldn't help but think a little \nbit about that last week as I was visiting some of the ranchers and \nfolks in west Texas in the ag sector who were very interested in what \nwe were doing here in Washington on trade promotion authority, as we \nhave worked with the President on a bipartisan basis to pass this \nstructure by which the next big trade agreement--the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership--will be considered and voted on.\n  I do have a bias. I think experiments in policy are best conducted at \nthe State level, not at the national level. We have seen, for example, \nas the Presiding Officer knows, a huge experiment in health care reform \nwhere, under the Affordable Care Act, one-sixth of our economy was \neffectively commandeered by the Federal Government in a one-size-fits-\nall approach. Of course, the results were much worse than even its most \nardent opponents predicted. Many of the basic promises that were made \nin order to sell the Affordable Care Act simply aren't true. They \nhaven't come to pass.\n  So I think it is helpful to do just the opposite. Rather than \nexperiment at the national level with what kinds of policies actually \nwork, let's try these at the State level. Indeed, on the matter of \ntrade, I would say I come from a State that is the No. 1 exporting \nState in the country, and that is one reason why our economy grew last \nyear--2014--at 5.2 percent. The economy across the United States grew \nat 2.2 percent. There are a lot of reasons for that difference, but \ndon't we think it would make some people curious about whether there \nwere actually policies or practices at the State level that produced a \nbetter result--a growing economy with rising wages and more jobs?\n  This isn't just me being proud of where I come from. I guess people \nare accustomed to Texans being proud of their State and bragging about \nit. That is just kind of who we are, and we accept that. But this is \nmore than that. This is talking about the policies that actually work, \nthat have been embraced and implemented here at the national level, \nonce tested at the State level--we could actually see a better outcome \nfor all of America.\n  For example, Texas farmers and ranchers know from our experience in \nTexas that trade is a good thing. As we begin to explain and explore \nthe importance of trade promotion authority, the idea that we comprise \nroughly 5 percent of the world's population--in other words, 95 percent \nof the world's population is beyond our shores but we represent 20 \npercent of the world's purchasing power--why wouldn't we want to open \nup our goods and services and the things we grow and make to these \nmarkets abroad so that more people can buy the things we grow and raise \nand what we make?\n  I wish to speak about another innovation or at least another practice \nat the State level that has had an impact on the quality of education \nat the State level. As we continue the discussion of the Every Child \nAchieves Act--\n\n[[Page S4935]]\n\nlegislation that will hopefully help improve the results for 50 million \nchildren--I am glad we will be bringing another tried-and-true example \nof what has happened at the State level to the national level.\n  I was happy to cosponsor with the senior Senator from Virginia an \namendment which takes into account the commonsense purpose of \nencouraging the States to conduct efficiency reviews of school \ndistricts and campuses to make sure Federal dollars delivered to each \nclassroom are spent as cost-effectively as possible. This amendment \nbuilds on an incredibly successful program in Texas--one that brings \ngreater accountability to our schools and helps them discern how they \ncan make each dollar go just a little bit further. This program is \ncalled the Financial Allocation Study for Texas, or FAST. It was \ndeveloped by the Texas comptroller, Susan Combs--the immediate past \ncomptroller of the State of Texas--to evaluate the operational \nefficiency of the school districts and campuses across our State. To do \nthat, the comptroller uses data about school finances, school \ndemographics, and academic performance from each school and campus \naround the State to help measure academic achievement relative to \nspending.\n  There is a broadly held fallacy that the quality of educational \noutputs is equal to how much money we put into it. In other words, if \nwe want a better product--education--all we have to do is spend more \nmoney. I would say that is demonstrably false. There are many of our \nparochial schools that do an outstanding job of educating their \nstudents at a fraction of what our public schools do. So I think it is \na fallacy to say that if we want more or better education, all we have \nto do is spend more money. There is a smarter, more efficient way to \ndeal with that, and that is what the financial allocation study is \ndesigned to achieve--to measure academic achievement relative to \nspending.\n  As the senior Senator from Virginia explained earlier, this \nsuccessful Texas model of a fiscally responsible education system \ncaught his eye when he was Governor of Virginia, and fortunately he \nthen implemented a similar program. In Virginia, the savings came from \ncommonsense recommendations--again, as we did in Texas--things such as \nintroducing software programs to improve bus routes, enhancing methods \nof facilities management, and encouraging best practices in hiring and \npersonnel management.\n  While more States have adopted similar programs, these money-saving \nopportunities should be available to all school districts \nnationwide. So now, with the adoption of this amendment just yesterday \nand with the eventual passage of the Every Child Achieves Act, we can \nmake sure school districts all across the country are using their \ndollars for what they are really intended--classroom education--not \nstuck in the back office bureaucracy.\n\n  As many of us have already mentioned, the underlying legislation, the \nEvery Child Achieves Act, is really about putting the responsibility \nfor our children's education back in the hands of parents, local school \ndistricts, and teachers--the people who are actually closer to the \nissue, closer to the problems, and the ones who perhaps know more than \nany bureaucrat in Washington could ever hope to know about what \nactually works at the local level. It is also about flexibility, \nmeaning it is up to individual States, not just the Federal Government, \nto determine how to achieve the best outcome for all of our students. \nImportantly, I should add, that flexibility translates into greater \noptions for schools across the country by giving States additional \nfreedom to create and replicate high-quality charter schools, for \nexample, and giving more parents more choices, as I said, for their \nchildren's education.\n  I am very proud of the good progress we have made across a number of \nissues this year so far--passing the anti-human trafficking laws and \nfinally cracking the code on how we pay physicians under Medicare \nadequately rather than temporarily patching that problem, as we have \nfor so many years. We passed a budget for the first time since 2009 \nthat balances in 10 years. And, yes, we worked with the President of \nthe United States on a bipartisan basis to pass trade promotion \nauthority. Next week, we will conclude this Every Child Achieves Act by \nreforming our early and elementary childhood education system to get \nmore of the power, to get more of the authority out of Washington and \nback to parents, teachers, and the States, where it really belongs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have been living under No Child Left \nBehind, or NCLB, for 13 years. During that time, we have learned a lot \nabout how NCLB works and a lot more about what doesn't work. Students, \nteachers, and parents across the country have been waiting a long time \nfor us to fix this law.\n  As a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, I am proud to have worked on the legislation before us today \nand to have helped to get it this far. The Every Child Achieves Act of \n2015 builds a strong bipartisan foundation to reform our national \neducation system, and I thank Chairman Lamar Alexander and Ranking \nMember Patty Murray for their leadership on this bill.\n  Over the last 6 years, I have met with principals and teachers, \nstudents, parents, and school administrators in Minnesota. These \nconversations have helped me to develop my educational priorities to \nhelp improve our schools, our communities, and our Nation's future. I \nworked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, including the \nesteemed Presiding Officer, to find common ground, and I am very \npleased that many of my priorities to improve student outcomes and \nclose the achievement gap are reflected in the legislation that is \nbefore us today.\n  During my conversations with parents and students, I often speak \nabout children's mental health. At Mounds View school district in \nMinnesota, I met a single mother named Katie Johnson. She told me about \nher son, a 9-year-old boy whose behavior she just wasn't able to \ncontrol. Because this school had a system in place--a mental health \nmodel in place--they were able to identify that he might have some \nmental health problems and get him access to community mental health \nservices. He was diagnosed with ADHD and Asperger's. He was able to get \nthe treatment he needed, and it turned him around. Katie told me that \nher son is now doing well in school and he had taken up Tae Kwon Do. \nKatie told me that her life had been out of control when she couldn't \ncontrol her child. But she pointed to herself--and I will never forget \nthis--she pointed to herself and said: ``Now I am bulletproof. I can do \nanything.''\n  Well, I said, let's do this. So I came here and introduced the Mental \nHealth in Schools Act, and I am proud that over the last couple of \nyears we have gotten $100-plus million extra through the appropriations \nprocess for programs like the one in that bill.\n  I have worked hard to get provisions based on my Mental Health in \nSchools Act into the bill before us today. My provisions will allow \nschools that want to work with community-based mental health \norganizations and mental health providers to use Federal education \nfunding to provide mental health screening, treatment, and referral \nservices to their students by equipping school staff with the training \nand tools to identify what it looks like when a kid has a mental \nillness. Every adult in this school, from the lunch lady to the \nprincipal, from the schoolbus driver to the teacher, was trained to see \nwhat it looked like when a kid might have a serious mental health \nissue, and then they would refer to the professional in the school, the \ncounselor or school psychologist.\n  One of the most common features of successful schools in \ndisadvantaged communities is the presence of an effective school \nprincipal. This should come as no surprise. It is a matter of common \nsense to expect that a successful school or any successful organization \nwould have a strong leader. Research shows that school leadership is \none of the most critical components of\n\n[[Page S4936]]\n\nimproving student learning. Yet, despite its importance, the Federal \nGovernment has not devoted adequate attention or resources to improving \nthe quality of principals in high-need schools. That is why I made sure \nthat there is dedicated funding written into the base bill to create a \npipeline of effective principals for high-need schools.\n\n  I had a roundtable a number of years ago. The roundtable was with \nprincipals from around the Twin Cities. A school had been turned around \nby a great principal. We started talking about testing. One of the \nprincipals referred to the NCLB test as ``autopsies.'' I knew \nimmediately what he meant. Schools had to administer an NCLB test \ntoward the end of the year--toward the end of April--and the school and \nthe teachers didn't get the results until late June, when the kids were \nout of school. So the teachers couldn't use the results of the tests to \ninform the instruction of their kids. I found out that was why in \nMinnesota schools were administering other tests in addition to the \nNCLB test. On top of that, they were giving computer adaptive tests. \nWhat are computer adaptive tests? Well, they are computers--meaning the \nteacher gets the results right away, so he or she can use the results \nof that test to inform the instruction of each child. They are \nadaptive, which means that if a child is getting everything right, the \nquestions get harder; if they are getting things wrong, the questions \nget easier. This is much more descriptive of where the child is and you \ncan pinpoint this. This informs the instruction.\n  These kinds of tests were not allowed in the original NCLB because \nthey said that all tests had to be standardized--standardized, meaning \nhaving the same test for each child--but you get a much better \nassessment with computer adaptive tests. That is why I wrote an \namendment with Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia into the Every Child \nAchieves Act to allow States to use computer adaptive tests. Teachers \nwill now be able to create lesson plans based on how each student \nperforms, starting the next day. They use computer tests to more \naccurately measure student growth, which is something I believe in--\nmeasuring growth and not judging whether a kid meets or what percentage \nof kids meet some arbitrary performance standard or proficiency \nstandard but instead whether the school is helping every kid grow.\n  The only thing I liked about No Child Left Behind was the name. Yet, \nevery teacher started teaching to the middle--teaching to the kids who \nare just below or just above that artificial line of proficiency. That \nwas a perverse incentive not to focus on the kid above the line or \nbelow the line. Every child achieves. That is what we are going for.\n  This amendment will go a long way toward improving the quality of \nassessments used in our schools and will give teachers and parents more \naccurate and timely information about how their kid is growing.\n  Another issue I hear about as I travel around Minnesota--this time \nfrom businesses--is that students graduating from our schools aren't \nready to take on the jobs that are waiting for them. This is called the \nskills gap. It isn't just a problem in Minnesota; I would say it is a \nproblem in every State. We have jobs now that are going unfilled \nbecause our graduates lack science, technology, engineering, and math, \nor STEM, skills. In fact, by 2018 Minnesota employers will have to fill \nover 180,000 STEM-related jobs.\n  So I wrote an amendment to provide funding to support partnerships \nbetween local schools, businesses, universities, and nonprofit \norganizations to improve student learning in STEM subjects. My \namendment says that each State can choose how to spend and prioritize \nthese funds, which can support a wide range of STEM activities, from \nin-depth teacher training, to engineering design competitions, to \nimproving the diversity of the STEM workforce.\n  States can also use these funds to create a STEM Master Teacher \nCorps, which is based on my legislation called the STEM Master Teacher \nCorps. This will offer career-advancement opportunities and extra pay \nto exceptional STEM teachers and help them serve as mentors to less-\naccomplished teachers.\n  Today, it is getting harder and harder for students to pay for \ncollege. That is why the Presiding Officer, the good Senator from \nLouisiana, and I worked--and the way the cameras work, you can't see \nthe Presiding Officer because I am talking; it is Bill Cassidy of \nLouisiana--we worked together to help reduce the cost of college while \nkids are still in high school.\n  Our amendment provides funds to cover the costs of advanced placement \nand international baccalaureate exam fees for low-income students. When \nI did college affordability roundtables, I found students who had taken \nan AP course but were afraid to spend the money for the test in case \nthey did not get the 3, 4 or 5, which gave them a credit. So this will \nhelp those students do that.\n  Our amendment also includes dual enrollment programs and early \ncollege high schools. In Minnesota, we call them postsecondary \neducational opportunities. These are two other models that help \nstudents earn college credit while in high school, and by participating \nand succeeding in these programs, students can save a lot of money \ntoward college by getting college credits.\n  The academic programs I have mentioned are critical to our children's \nsuccess in school, but many kids also need additional support to help \nthem succeed in school. For example, school counselors respond to a \nwide range of student needs, from dealing with the aftermath of \ntraumatic events to school bullying, to the college admissions process \nand career advising. But we have a shortage of school counselors in \nthis country.\n  Unfortunately, the ability of school counseling professionals to \nassess students is often hindered by a high student-to-counselor ratio, \noften two or three times the recommended amount. In Minnesota, we have \n1 counselor for every 700 students. That is unacceptable. So I wrote a \nprovision that addresses this critical need by authorizing the \nElementary and Secondary School Counseling Program in the Every Child \nAchieves legislation.\n  Federal grants like this one will help States and districts address \nthese high ratios between students and counselors and bring more \ntrained professionals into schools. Another critical support for \nstudents is afterschool programs. Senator Lisa Murkowski from Alaska \nand I worked on an amendment together to fund 21st Century Community \nLearning Centers because these afterschool programs play a critical \nrole in increasing student achievement, keeping students safe, and \nhelping out working families.\n  There are over 100 21st Century Community Learning Centers across my \nState of Minnesota, and these centers provide high-quality afterschool \nactivities to help address the physical, social, emotional, and \nacademic needs of the students they serve. Senator Murkowski and I \nworked on another amendment to help American Indian students. Our \namendment would fund Native language immersion programs throughout \nIndian Country because language is critical to maintaining cultural \nheritage. Native students who are enrolled in language immersion \nprograms have higher levels of student achievement, high school \ngraduation rates, and college attendance rates than their Native \nAmerican peers in traditional English-based schools.\n  Again, I am very pleased that with the help of my colleagues, I was \nable to include all of these amendments in the legislation we are \nconsidering today. These provisions will help hundreds of thousands of \nstudents throughout the country reach their full potential.\n  Lastly, I would like to speak in support of Senator Patty Murray's \nand Senator Johnny Isakson's early learning amendment that was included \nin the bill and Senator Bob Casey's floor amendment called strong start \nfor America, which also expands access to early childhood education. \nThis is so important. The achievement gap between disadvantaged \nstudents and their peers is evident before they enter kindergarten.\n  Early childhood programs can help narrow this gap. In fact, high-\nquality early childhood education programs not only help prepare our \nchildren for school, study after study shows there is a tremendous \nreturn on investment in high-quality early childhood education, ranging \nfrom $7 to $16 for every $1 spent. Kids who attend a high-quality early \nchildhood program are less\n\n[[Page S4937]]\n\nlikely to be special ed kids or to need special education programs, \nless likely to be held back a grade. They have better health outcomes, \nthe girls are less likely to get pregnant in adolescence, they are more \nlikely to graduate high school, more likely to go to college and \ngraduate from college and have a good job and pay taxes, and much less \nlikely to go to prison.\n  I have been a big supporter of investing in early childhood programs \nfor years because it is simply just common sense to do. That is why I \nsupport Senator Casey's amendment. More generally, No Child Left Behind \nis long overdue for the right kind of reform. With the leadership of \nChairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray, my colleagues and I on \nthe HELP Committee have worked hard to incorporate the lessons we have \nlearned from teachers, students, parents, and school administrators and \nput them into this legislation.\n  We have made tremendous progress on this bill, but we still have some \nwork to do before it becomes law. We need to close the achievement gaps \nin this country. That means we should expect States to focus on all of \ntheir students, including low-income and minority students. At its \ncore, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, passed first in 1965, \nis a civil rights bill that was intended to improve equality and expand \nopportunity for disadvantaged students.\n  So I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to \nstrengthen the accountability provisions in this bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Every Child Achieves Act of 2015 so we can \nkeep working to support all of our Nation's students.\n  Finally, I want to flag something that is very important to me. I \nhave a pending amendment to Every Child Achieves that I care an \nenormous amount about, the Student Nondiscrimination Act, which will \ngive LGBT--lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students the \nprotection they need and deserve in school. I will come back to the \nfloor to discuss that amendment at length.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4937-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4937-S4938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OBAMACARE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an issue that will \nhave serious negative consequences on the lives and the livelihoods of \nmillions of Americans and threaten our already muddled and beleaguered \nhealth care system. Ever since the partisan and rushed passage of the \nso-called Affordable Care Act, I have come to the floor dozens of times \nto shine a light on the problems associated with this law and to call \nfor a swift repeal and replacement.\n  I have not been alone. Many of my colleagues have been working to \nmake this case as well. Truth be told, this has not been an altogether \ndifficult case to make. Indeed, the data has repeatedly shown that \nObamaCare, despite the many claims of its proponents, simply is not \nworking. We have seen more evidence of this in just the past few days. \nFor example, in a recent New York Times article, we all read about the \ndramatic proposed increases in health insurance premiums due to \nObamaCare's expensive mandates and regulations.\n  Now, many plans are proposing rate increases that average 23 percent \nin Illinois, 25 percent in North Carolina, 31 percent in Oklahoma, 36 \npercent in Tennessee, and 54 percent in Minnesota. I don't know about \nthe Presiding Officer, but my constituents find this unnerving. After \nall, one of the President's chief justifications for his health care \nlaw was that it would actually bring down the cost of health care. Once \nagain, we are seeing that this is just another one of the many empty \nObamaCare promises.\n  But even more frightening than these proposed rate increases are the \nroot causes of the increases. In the recent New York Times article, \nNathan T. Johns, the chief financial officer of Arches Health Plan, \nwhich operates in my home State of Utah, was quoted as saying: ``Our \nenrollees generated 24 percent more claims than we thought they would \nwhen we set our 2014 rates.''\n  This, according to Mr. Johns, led to a collection of just under $40 \nmillion in premiums, while the company had to pay out more than $56 \nmillion in claims for 2014. As a result, Arches Health Plan has \nproposed rate increases averaging 45 percent for 2016 in order to \nremain viable. Now, I know this was not at all the intention of my \nDemocratic colleagues who voted for this bill, but it is because of \nthis and a myriad of other unintended consequences that ObamaCare has \nconsistently polled below 50 percent approval since the day it was \nsigned into law.\n  Indeed, according to a compilation by Real Clear Politics, of the 405 \npolls collected since the law passed in March of 2010, 391 reported a \nmajority of Americans opposing or having negative views toward \nObamaCare. Unfortunately, President Obama seems to be disconnected from \nthis reality. In a recent trip to Tennessee, the President called for \nconsumers to put pressure on State insurance regulators to scrutinize \nthe proposed rate increases. He then suggested that if commissioners do \ntheir job and actively review the rates, his ``expectation is that \nthey'll come in significantly lower than what's being requested.''\n  But as Roy Vaughn, vice president of the Tennessee BlueCross plan \nstated:\n\n       There's not a lot of mystery to it. We lost a significant \n     amount of money in the marketplace, $141 million, because we \n     were not very accurate in predicting the utilization of \n     health care.\n\n  Yet President Obama fails to grasp the simple mathematics of the \nproblem. He is not alone. In response to the President's call for \nscrutiny, the Tennessee insurance commissioner was quoted as saying she \nwould ask ``hard questions of companies we regulate to protect \nconsumers.'' Forgive me, but I fail to understand what hard questions \nthere are to ask. If I own a business that takes in $100 million in \nrevenue but pays out $120 million in expenses, I will not be solvent \nfor very long.\n  What is perhaps most disconcerting to me in all of this are the \nresponses these patients get from officials in the Obama \nadministration. For example, in response to concerns about those \npremium hikes, Health and Human Services Secretary Burwell recently \nargued that patients should not worry because there are tax subsidies \navailable to help cover the cost. She also said they could simply shop \nfor cheaper plans on the exchanges during the next open enrollment \nperiod.\n  Of course, in a world where insurance plans across the country are \nrequesting rate increases of 26--well, 20, 30, 40, or even 50 percent \nor more, one has to wonder just how many cheaper plans will be \navailable and how many sacrifices patients will have to make in their \ncare in order to get significant savings. While many seem to believe \nthe Affordable Care Act received a reprieve from the Supreme Court, I \nthink we are actually witnessing a downward spiral of ObamaCare. I \ncannot help but question what supposed solutions my friends on the \nother side of the aisle will come up with next.\n  Anyone who is being honest and who is listening to the American \npeople should recognize that ObamaCare needs to be replaced with real, \npatient-centered reforms that are designed not to control the \nmarketplace but to actually reduce the costs for hard-working patients \nand taxpayers. I am a coauthor of such a plan, which we have called the \nPatient CARE Act. This legislative proposal, which I have put forward \nalong with Senator Burr and Chairman Fred Upton in the House, will \nreduce the cost of health care in this country without all of the \nexpensive mandates and regulations that are causing these major \nincreases in health insurance premiums.\n  I have talked about our proposal many times on the floor. I will \ncontinue to do so. I know there are other ideas out there, and I think \nwe should consider and evaluate those as well. Put simply, I am willing \nto work with anyone on either side of the aisle to fix our Nation's \nhealth care system and to protect the American people from the negative \nconsequences of this misguided law.\n\n  My hope is that more of our colleagues on the other side will \neventually see what the majority of the American people have seen for \nmore than 5 years: The problems with ObamaCare are not minor flaws that \ncan be fixed with a little regulatory tinkering. They are fundamental \nflaws.\n  The only answer is real reform, which addresses the skyrocketing \ncosts of health care in America.\n\n[[Page S4938]]\n\n  With that, you can see that I am very, very concerned about ObamaCare \nand the fact that it is breaking America. It is not working. Costs are \ngoing up in a rapid basis. People are not being well served. The \nemergency rooms, which were supposed to be spared from all of this, are \njust full of Medicaid and Medicare patients who cannot find doctors \nnow. Doctors are leaving the profession because of ObamaCare, in large \nmeasure, and we can't get help to those who really need the help \nbecause of the many restrictions in ObamaCare.\n  All I can say is that sooner or later we have to get off of our high \nhorse, look at this, and look at it in a very effective, nonpartisan \nway, and either change it or get rid of it and replace it with \nsomething that will work much better and will be something the American \npeople can live with.\n  There were approximately 35 million people who did not have health \ninsurance before ObamaCare. That was a big issue. The President has \ncited that many times. Guess how many don't have insurance now with \nObamaCare--how about 30, 35 million people.\n  So has this just been a big boondoggle so the President can take \ncredit for something that doesn't work or are we going to do the thing \nthat we all should as Members of Congress in the best interests of our \ncitizens and change this bill and get one that really does work?\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4938-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4938-S4940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HONORING VIETNAM VETERANS AND NORTH DAKOTA'S SOLDIERS WHO LOST THEIR \n                            LIVES IN VIETNAM\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, once again we find ourselves on a \nThursday afternoon doing some final business before everybody returns \nhome to meet with their constituents and do that work. I must say how \nmuch I appreciate your kind words and your attention when we have been \ntalking about those North Dakotans who were killed in action in \nVietnam.\n  This week the Senate commemorated that 50-year anniversary, and I \nknow there are so many Members who care deeply. I know the Presiding \nOfficer is among those Members. So I thank the Presiding Officer for \nhis attention and his appreciation for the sacrifices of the men who I \ntalk about weekly.\n  I rise today to speak about the men from North Dakota who died while \nserving in the Vietnam war. We are currently in a 13-year commemoration \nperiod honoring the veterans of the Vietnam war. I had the privilege to \nlearn from families of North Dakotans who died in the war about their \nloved ones--who their loved ones were and who they hoped they would be.\n  Before speaking today about some of the 198 North Dakotans who didn't \nreturn home from Vietnam, I publicly thank Dave Logosz for his service \nto our State and our Nation.\n  Dave is a Vietnam veteran from Dickinson. Dave had plans to become a \nmechanical engineer and enroll at Dickinson State University in art and \nengineering. After his first quarter, he decided to enroll in NDSU \ninstead, but he was drafted before classes in Fargo began.\n  In 1969, he landed in Vietnam in the Army's 25th Infantry Division as \na sniper. He says that his year in Vietnam was a long, tough one. He \nwas injured more than once while serving there.\n  After David returned, he suffered from post-traumatic stress, but he \ndidn't admit it until several years ago. He says the VA counseling that \nhe has received has made a huge difference for him.\n  After his service in Vietnam, Dave worked for over two decades at the \nDickinson plant until it closed, and then he worked for the North \nDakota Department of Transportation. He says he is happily retired now.\n  Dave belongs to every veterans service organization he knows of. A \nfew years ago, he and his wife hopped on Dave's Harley and rode from \ncoast to coast on a veterans memorial bike ride. They ended their trip \nat the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall in Washington, DC--among a total \nof over 68,000 motorcycles and 911,000 people who were there. There \nDave saw for the first time the name of his fellow soldier, Carl \nBerger, also from North Dakota.\n  Dave was with Carl when he was killed in Vietnam, and Dave carried \nCarl off the battlefield. Dave said that the experience of seeing \nCarl's name and visiting the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall was \nemotional and heartwarming, and it gave him an idea. To give something \nback to his own community, Dave decided to build a veterans memorial \nhonoring all servicemembers from Stark County.\n  So 3 years ago, inspired by the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall in \nWashington, DC, he began with his idea for a memorial in Dickinson. He \nexpects to have the memorial completed this summer.\n  The city of Dickinson donated space for the memorial park, and the \nmemorial will consist of concrete and Vermont granite, listing the \nnames of every person from Stark County who has served in the military \nsince the Civil War and will include space for future names.\n  The entire memorial is 100 feet in diameter, includes 14 granite \nbenches, and hundreds of bricks that individuals can personalize. Local \nartist Linda Little sculpted a 6-foot-5-inch bronze statue of a soldier \nsaluting the panels of names.\n  I really can't wait to see this memorial when it is completed and to \nthank Dave for his vision and hard work.\n  Now I wish to talk about Carl Berger and 10 other North Dakotans who \ngave the ultimate sacrifice during their service to our country.\n\n\n                            Carl Berger, Jr.\n\n  Carl Berger, Jr., a native of Mandan, was born August 23, 1948. He \nserved in the Army's 25th Infantry Division. Carl was 21 years old when \nhe died on April 3, 1970.\n  Carl was the youngest of 13 children who grew up on the family farm. \nHis nieces and nephews remember him as their fun-loving uncle. Growing \nup, Carl attended high school at the Richardton Abbey and played the \nFrench horn.\n  Carl's siblings remember having fun on their farm herding sheep and \nworking together in the fields with the cattle and chickens. His sister \nMarian said that Carl was a genuine hard worker, and she is grateful \nthat her children had an opportunity to know a man as wonderful as \ntheir Uncle Carl.\n  Carl was killed in Vietnam less than 2 months after starting his tour \nof duty.\n  The family cherishes the memories of that last Christmas they all \nspent together before Carl went to Vietnam. Carl's parents were \ndevastated by his death, but they were also very proud of their son, \nwho served their country. Carl's funeral was held during a blizzard, \nbut despite that bad weather, the church was full.\n\n\n                            Laurence Zietlow\n\n  Laurence Zietlow, a native of New Salem, was born August 30, 1928. He \nserved as a sergeant major in the Army. Laurence was 39 years old when \nhe died on October 3, 1967.\n  Laurence's desire to join the Army was so strong that he enlisted \nbefore graduating from high school. During his graduation ceremony, his \ndiploma was given to his mother, Sophie Zietlow.\n  Prior to serving in Vietnam, Laurence also spent tours of duty in \nJapan, Germany, and Korea. Laurence's sister Leone said that a lot of \nLaurence's friends have told her how great a guy he was and that he \nwould have given the shirt off his back. Laurence's sister Helen told \nher local newspaper that he didn't talk about many experiences from \nVietnam, but he did describe buying gifts for Vietnamese children \nliving in orphanages.\n  Laurence was killed in Vietnam when a landmine exploded near him. He \nwas recognized with several awards, including the Air Medal, the \nMilitary Merit Medal, the Gallantry Cross with Palm Medal, the Purple \nHeart, and the Bronze Star.\n  In addition to his mother and siblings, Laurence was survived by his \nthree children: Larry, Terry, and Kristi.\n\n[[Page S4939]]\n\n                        Kenneth ``Kenny'' Johner\n\n  Kenneth ``Kenny'' Johner enlisted while living in Noonan, and he was \nborn on December 29, 1946. He served in the Marine Corps' 3rd Marines, \n3rd Marine Division. Kenny died on March 21, 1967. He was only 20 years \nold.\n  Kenny was the third of 15 children. He enlisted in the Marines right \nafter graduating from Noonan High School. He and two of his brothers, \nGene and Jerry, made North Dakota history as the first three brothers \nin the State to enlist in the Marines at the same time. Two other \nbrothers, George and Brian, also joined the Marines later.\n  Their mom Helen says the oldest three boys were so close that one \nwouldn't even go to prom if the others didn't.\n  Regarding his service in Vietnam, Kenny told his mother many times, \n``God has a different plan for me. I am on a special mission and I \nwon't be here very long.''\n  In Vietnam, a few days before Kenny was scheduled to travel to \nOkinawa to meet his brother Gene for R, Kenny was wounded. About 3 \nweeks later, Kenny died from his wounds.\n  In appreciation for the sacrifices he made, Kenny's family has named \na nephew and a grand-nephew after him.\n\n\n                       Ronald ``Cookie'' McNeill\n\n  Ronald ``Cookie'' McNeill was born March 29, 1949, and he was from \nMott. He served in the Marine Corps' 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st \nMarine Division. He was 21 years old when he died on August 4, 1970.\n  Ronald was one of four children and everyone called him Cookie. He \ngot the nickname Cookie as a baby because his older brother Rick \ncouldn't say Ron, so he named him Cookie and the name stuck.\n  Rick said Ronald loved hunting and fishing, and Rick remembers the \ntimes the boys were playing hockey together on a nearby river and ended \nup with 11 stitches between the two of them.\n  Ronald joined the Marine Corps shortly after graduating from high \nschool. He died less than 3 months after starting his tour of duty in \nVietnam.\n  In addition to his siblings, Ronald left behind his wife Beverly and \ntheir son Barry.\n\n\n                             Douglas Klose\n\n  Douglas Klose was from Jamestown, and he was born June 14, 1947. He \nserved in the Army's 1st Infantry Division. Douglas died on October 27, \n1968. He was 21 years old.\n  Douglas--or Doug, as he was known by many--grew up on a dairy farm. \nHe had five siblings. According to his sister Barbara, when he was \nyoung, Douglas walked around the yard picking up ``treasures'' and \nstored them in his pockets. Douglas's uncle gave him the nickname \n``Hunk of Junk'' because he always had junk in his pockets.\n  Douglas's appreciation for his family farm extended into college. He \nattended NDSU and studied animal science. According to his adviser who \nalways spoke highly of him, Douglas did very well in college.\n  His two sisters, Barbara and Renee, remember how soft-spoken and \nhelpful Douglas was. Renee, the youngest in the family, was Douglas's \npet. He always looked out for her and he was a very loving brother.\n  In his free time, Douglas liked to drive around in his father's 1962 \nChevrolet Impala that had a high-performance engine. His brother Dean \nremembers that Doug and his brothers would race the car down the \nstreet, putting the other cars in Jamestown to shame.\n  Dean remembers Douglas being so strong he could lift a John Deere 620 \ntractor with the loader attached to it. For fun, Douglas used his \nextraordinary strength to compete in gymnastics.\n  Douglas had plans to start his own farm outside of Jamestown when he \nreturned from Vietnam, but he was killed when a grenade exploded near \nhim.\n\n\n                             Gregory Lunde\n\n  Gregory Lunde was from Westhope. He was born December 8, 1946. He \nserved in the Marine Corps' 1st Tank Battalion, 1st Marine Division. \nGregory was 21 years old when he died on February 6, 1968.\n  Gregory had one sister, Toni. She said she called him Greg and that \nhe was always happy and clean and meticulous. She is thankful to him \nfor caring for her after their mother died when Toni was 13.\n  After high school, Greg attended business school in Minneapolis to \nprepare himself to return to Westhope and help his father run a \nmeatpacking plant.\n  Toni loved the care packages Gregory often sent her from Vietnam. He \nthought he was pretty funny when he mailed Toni a kimono and joked she \nwould have to lose some weight to fit into it.\n  Gregory was killed in Vietnam when he was shot while riding on a \ntank.\n\n\n                         Gerald ``Gerry'' Klein\n\n  Gerald ``Gerry'' Klein was born April 29, 1946. He was from Raleigh, \nND. He served in the Army's 1st Infantry Division. Gerald died May 4, \n1968, just days after he had turned 22 years old.\n  He was the oldest of five children, and his family and friends always \ncalled him Gerry. He grew up on the family's farm. His siblings said \nthat while growing up, Gerald spent free time either working on the \nfarm or on the family car.\n  While Gerald was home on leave, he became engaged to his girlfriend. \nAfter completing his service in Vietnam, he planned to live on the \nfamily farm with his future wife.\n  His brother Bob said that Gerald was a strong, brave man who wanted \nto be happy. His family appreciates the letters he sent them while \nserving.\n  The day he died, Gerald was injured but chose to continue fighting. \nShortly after, he was shot and killed. He would have only had a very \nfew weeks left of his service in Vietnam.\n  I want to thank the Bismarck High School 11th graders and Gerald's \nfamily who have shared with us these facts about Gerald's life.\n\n\n                              Florian Kuss\n\n  Florian Kuss was from Strasburg, and he was born December 28, 1946. \nFlorian served in the Army's 196th Infantry Brigade, Americal Division. \nFlorian died January 5, 1968, just days after he turned 21 years old.\n  There were seven children in his family. Florian's two brothers, \nVictor and Frank, also served their country in the military.\n  Florian grew up working on his family's farm, where they raised dairy \ncows, chickens, pigs, wheat, oats, corn, and alfalfa. Florian's plan \nafter completing his service was to return to the family farm and \ncontinue his farming career.\n  His brother Art said the family appreciates the time Florian spent \ntaking care of their sick father before Florian was drafted. Their \nfather died less than a year after Florian was shot and killed in \nVietnam.\n  Florian's sister Betty said Florian's death caused a hole in the \nfamily that will never be filled. They think about Florian all the \ntime.\n  Florian was awarded the Purple Heart, the Good Conduct Medal, and the \nBronze Star for Valor in recognition of his service and sacrifice.\n\n\n                              Darel Leetun\n\n  Darel Leetun was from Hettinger, and he was born December 24, 1932. \nHe served as a pilot in the Air Force. Darel was 33 years old when the \nplane he was flying was shot down on September 17, 1966.\n  Growing up, Darel enjoyed sports, 4-H, and spending summers at his \naunt's farm near Fessenden. He was the oldest of four children, and his \nsiblings appreciate how he cared for and supported them and their \nmother after their father died when they were all young.\n  Darel's family said he got along with people well and had great \nleadership skills. His sisters Janelle and Carol said Darel never put \nhimself first.\n  Right after graduating from NDSU, Darel spent time teaching about \nagriculture in India. He then joined the Air Force and was stationed in \nEngland, Japan, and Vietnam.\n  In Vietnam, Darel completed nearly 100 flying missions before his \nplane was hit by ground fire and crashed. The Air Force presented Darel \nwith many awards, including the Air Force Cross, in recognition for his \nextraordinary heroism that day. His Air Force Cross citation read, in \npart:\n\n       Captain Leetun led a mission of F-105 Thunderchiefs against \n     a heavily defended high priority target near Hanoi. Undaunted \n     by intense and accurate flak, deadly surface-to-air missiles, \n     and hostile MiGs, Captain Leetun led his flight through this \n     fierce environment to the crucial target.\n       On the bomb run, Captain Leetun's Thunderchief was hit by \n     hostile fire, becoming a flaming torch and nearly \n     uncontrollable; however, Captain Leetun remained in formation \n     and delivered his high-explosive ordnance directly on target.\n\n[[Page S4940]]\n\n       After bomb release, Captain Leetun's plane went out of \n     control and was seen to crash approximately 10 miles from the \n     target area.\n       Through his extraordinary heroism, superb airmanship, and \n     aggressiveness in the face of hostile forces, Captain Leetun \n     reflected the highest credit upon himself and the United \n     States Air Force.\n\n  Over 39 years later, in 2005, Darel's remains were identified, and he \nwas buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  Darel's widow Janet, son Keith, and daughter Kerri have been honored \nto hear from airmen who flew with Darel who told the family that Darel \nwas one of the best pilots they ever flew with.\n  Darel's son Keith was just 6 years old when his father died. But \nthrough providence, Keith has been connected to his father. He is \nespecially grateful for the day in 1992, at a Virginia golf course, \nwhen he met his father's wingman from the final mission. That wingman's \nname is Mike Lanning. When Mike learned that Keith was Darel's son, \nMike said:\n\n       Your dad was the heart and soul of the squadron. He was my \n     mentor and best friend.\n\n  Mike and Darel's siblings have all told Keith that Darel was always \ngoing to bat for people until the day he died. Darel was not scheduled \nto fly that day but did so because another man couldn't.\n  Keith is currently writing a children's book highlighting how \nsomething as bad as his father's death could turn into something \npositive, such as learning about and telling inspiring stories of \nheroes.\n\n\n                             Ralph McCowan\n\n  Ralph McCowan was from Trenton. He was born April 26, 1948. He served \nin the Army's 41st Artillery Group. Ralph died April 3, 1968, a few \nweeks before he would have turned 20.\n  There were nine children in his family, and his father, brothers, \nsisters, uncles, and nephews also served our country in the military. \nRalph's brother, Gene, said service to our country was deeply rooted in \ntheir family.\n  Ralph told his family he wanted to be a warrior and do his part. He \nwas an unassuming man who had a love for horses and a love for people. \nGene said Ralph had a short life but a good one.\n  Ralph served for 69 days in Vietnam before he was killed at his fire \nbase camp. The family cherishes their memories of their last Christmas \ntogether in 1967.\n\n\n                        Valarian Lawrence Finley\n\n  Valarian Lawrence Finley was born November 17, 1947. He was from \nMandaree. He served in the Marine Corps' Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, \n5th Marines, 1st Marine Division. Valarian was 21 years old when he \ndied in May of 1969.\n  Valarian was the third youngest of 13 children born to Louise and \nEvan Finley. Valarian's family and his friends called him Gus. He had \nplans to run a cattle ranch after returning home from Vietnam.\n  Valarian's siblings are grateful for Valarian's fellow marines \nreaching out to visit them about Valarian and his heroic death and how \nhe saved their lives.\n  Valarian was killed 1 week before his tour of duty was scheduled to \nend, on his brother Bobby's high school graduation day.\n  Bobby also served in Vietnam. Bobby was drafted and served in Vietnam \nshortly after Valarian was killed.

Mr. President, this week we are having a particularly \nimportant debate. Fortunately, it is a bipartisan debate. Great credit \nis owed to Senator Alexander and Senator Murray for their work on the \nEvery Child Achieves Act. This bill is a significant piece of \nlegislation because educational opportunity in America is a right which \nshould start at birth and last a lifetime.\n  As a parent, I know that mothers and fathers want their kids to be \nable to climb the economic ladder throughout their lives. That effort \nbegins with a top-flight education. In my view, the Every Child \nAchieves Act is a good step toward expanding opportunity for students \nnationwide. It is built around the proposition that each school, each \ndistrict, and each community is different. So rather than resorting to \nthe sort of one-size-fits-all policies, this legislation focuses on \ntrying to build on smart ideas, ideas with real promise that are \nactually going to make a big difference in classrooms.\n  I am going to get to several amendments I want to highlight, but I \nwish to start by recognizing some vital components of the legislation I \nhave strongly supported.\n  The most important proposal I have worked on is one that focuses on \nraising graduation rates. This is one of the major economic challenges \nin my home State and many other States across the country. In Oregon, \nmore than 100 high schools with high rates of poverty are blocked from \ntapping into Federal resources that can help important programs--\nprograms such as mentoring, before- and afterschool programs, programs \nwhere there is real evidence that they can make a difference in terms \nof helping these youngsters.\n  This is not an issue just in my State. There are more than 2,000 of \nthese schools nationwide. Because these schools are in a very difficult \nspot when it comes to securing Federal resources, too often the \nstudents suffer, and, in my view, the lack of resources for these \nschools often contributes to sky-high dropout rates.\n  What I will discuss here briefly is how this proposal I have worked \nfor is going to make the school improvement grants easier for middle \nand high schools to obtain and use to help these students, whom we want \nto see graduate and make their way to productive lives as citizens and \nworkers.\n  If a failing school has 40 percent or more low-income students, it \nwould become eligible for assistance. These Federal dollars can be \nused, as I indicated, to fund programs that really work, such as \nextended learning programs, programs that would be available during the \nweekend or perhaps during the summer. The funds can be used to prevent \ndropouts and encourage students who have already dropped out to reenter \nthe educational system. Schools can find other ways to help students \nstay at it and get through to graduation day. This will be a \nsignificant improvement over the status quo. What it does is provides \nsupport where it is needed most, and it will help us get more value out \nof scarce dollars to approach the challenge of helping students who are \ndropping out to get back in the system and graduate.\n  I am also pleased to see the inclusion of several provisions \nchampioned by my colleague Senator Boxer to create more opportunities \nfor students to enroll in afterschool programs and summer learning \nprograms. In today's economy, with so many families walking on an \neconomic tightrope--parents working long hours, multiple jobs--the fact \nis, there can't always be a parent around at 3 in the afternoon when \nkids get out of school or during the summer months. Senator Boxer \nreally took the initiative for the 21st Century Community Learning \nCenters Program and the After School for America's Children Act. Both \nof them are worthy of support because they go to bat for students by \nproviding extra learning opportunities for children both after school \nand in the summer.\n  There are other key elements in this legislation, but the Senate \nought to seize the opportunity in this debate to make some significant \nimprovements. The Every Child Achieves Act can go a lot further to \nraise graduation rates. There are more than 1,200 high schools, serving \nmore than 1.1 million kids, that are failing to graduate a third or \nmore of their students each year. Too often, it is the minority \nyoungsters who live in economic hardship who attend these schools.\n  Senator Warren and I are on the same page with respect to the need to\n\n[[Page S4941]]\n\nmake it possible for more of the young people who go to these schools \nto get to graduation. Her amendment would help identify the struggling \nschools and provide some fresh approaches to help turn them around--a \nsmart idea that I believe warrants bipartisan support.\n  Finally, I have just a couple other approaches that I think are \nparticularly valuable in terms of this debate and particularly how we \ncan use the machinery of the Federal Government to play a constructive \nrole in terms of education at the local level.\n  Senator Booker and I have worked for an amendment that tries to help \nhomeless children and foster youngsters graduate from high school. Once \nagain--and we can see it in kind of what undergirds my remarks here--\nthe focus is on trying to create opportunity for young people who \nconstantly are out there swimming upstream. The hurdles these \nyoungsters face are obviously large. Many of them move frequently, \nconstantly, from one place to another throughout their lives. As a \nresult, it is hard for them to feel any connection to the school, to \nfeel some sense of stability. What Senator Booker and I would seek to \ndo is to make it easier for school districts and policymakers to try to \nhelp those school districts provide additional support for those \nyoungsters who are homeless and those children who are in the foster \ncare system.\n  Finally, Senator Franken has offered an important proposal--the \nStudent Non-Discrimination Act--that provides strongly needed \nprotection for LGBT students. Schools ought to be safe and welcoming \nplaces that assist every child in getting ahead and thriving. If \nschools--particularly for the youngsters I have talked about in my \nremarks--aren't challenging enough, it is hard to imagine how much \nharder it gets for a youngster who faces harassment or discrimination \nbecause of their sexual orientation. The Franken amendment goes a long \nway to protect LGBT students and their friends at school and prevent \nthem from feeling they have to skip class to avoid bullying.\n  In wrapping up, the kinds of proposals I have outlined--starting with \nthe effort to try to prevent students from dropping out and getting up \nthe graduation rates--this is all about helping students get ahead \nthrough education, to expand opportunities for these young people \nthroughout their lives through education.\n  What the focus of the Senate ought to be is to make sure that no \nmatter where a child lives or how much his or her parents earn or what \nobstacles they face--the message ought to be, here in the Senate, with \nevery Democrat and every Republican, picking up on what Chairman \nAlexander and Senator Murray have said, that this bill will help to \ndrive home the principle that hard work in school leads to success. I \nbelieve the Every Child Achieves Act is a good step in that direction. \nI urge my colleagues to support these important amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4941-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RECOGNIZING THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SECRET SERVICE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the U.S. \nSecret Service and to commemorate its 150th anniversary.\n  In 1865, Congress created the Secret Service to combat the production \nand distribution of counterfeit currency in post-Civil War America. At \nthe time, currency counterfeiting was a fast-growing and serious threat \nto our Nation's financial and economic stability.\n  In 1901, following the assassination of President William McKinley, \nCongress further directed the Secret Service to take responsibility for \nthe protection and safety of the President of the United States.\n  Today, 150 years after the Secret Service's founding, the men and \nwomen of the Secret Service continue to serve with quiet confidence \nacross the United States and around the world as they protect our \nNation against threats both foreign and domestic. From ensuring the \nsecurity of the President, other senior government officials, and \nevents of national significance, to protecting the integrity of our \ncurrency and investigating crimes against our financial system, the \nU.S. Secret Service plays a critical role in our Nation's safety and \ncontinued success. The contributions, sacrifices, and achievements of \nthe Secret Service over the last 150 years have made the agency an \nindelible part of our Nation's identity.\n  The five points of the Secret Service star represent the Service's \ncore values of duty, justice, courage, honesty, and loyalty. These \nvalues have been the Secret Service's foundation for the past century \nand one-half and will continue to be the foundation on which the \nService's next 150 years--and the Nation's security--are grounded.\n  On this, the 150th anniversary of the U.S. Secret Service, I call \nupon my colleagues and upon all Americans to recognize the tremendous \ncontributions the Secret Service has made to our Nation's safety and \nwell-being. I also express my thanks to the thousands of dedicated \nSecret Service agents and employees who devote their time and energy to \nkeeping our Nation, and our leaders, safe and secure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4941-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4941-S4942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING PRESIDENT BOYD K. PACKER\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of \nPresident Boyd K. Packer--a man of integrity, kindness, courage, and \ncandor whose commitment to Christ defined a lifetime of service. \nPresident Packer passed away peacefully in his home last week with his \nloving wife and children gathered at his bedside. Along with his \nfamily, I join millions of Christians worldwide in mourning the loss of \na man who served faithfully for many years as the president of the \nQuorum of the Twelve Apostles in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-\nday Saints. As an apostle, President Packer's teachings brought \nstrength to the weary and hope to the hopeless. For those of us who \nmourn, we turn to these teachings to find peace amid the sadness of his \npassing.\n  Even as we grieve the loss of a leader, we celebrate the life of a \nfriend. President Packer was a man whose selfless nature often masked \nhis greatness, but not even his humility could hide a lifetime of \nachievement. From humble beginnings in Brigham City, UT, President \nPacker developed as a teacher and later as a leader in the Church of \nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n  President Packer's upbringing was modest to say the least---his \nfather was a service station operator and his mother was a homemaker. \nRaised against the backdrop of the Great Depression, he learned from an \nearly age never to take anything for granted, especially the freedoms \nwe enjoy as Americans.\n  President Packer would later defend those freedoms when he enlisted \nin the Army Air Corps during World War II. As a pilot serving in the \nPacific Theater, President Packer flew dozens of dangerous missions and \ncontinued to serve after the war when he and his fellow soldiers worked \nto rebuild the shattered nation of Japan. Although President Packer \ndreamed of flying planes as a young boy, it was during his military \nservice that he discovered his true life calling: to become a teacher.\n  When he returned to the United States, President Packer pursued that \ngoal through his studies, eventually earning a doctorate in education \nadministration from Brigham Young University. He quickly distinguished \nhimself as an LDS Seminary teacher and later became the chief \nsupervisor over the Church's seminary programs and Institutes of \nReligion. When President Packer was just 45 years old, he became an \napostle--a calling he would serve in and magnify until the day he died. \nEven as an apostle, President Packer still saw himself as a teacher, \nand he endeavored to expound truth in simple ways that all could \nunderstand. The candor and clarity of his teachings touched the hearts \nof millions, as did President Packer's genuine love for those he \nserved.\n  As a soldier and an educator, an administrator and an apostle, \nPresident Packer served in many different capacities throughout his \nlife. But first and foremost, he served as a husband and a\n\n[[Page S4942]]\n\nfather. For President Packer, fatherhood was a sacred responsibility \nthat took precedence over everything else. He was a father of 10, a \ngrandfather of 60, and a great-grandfather of 103. Neither work nor \nchurch service could keep him from caring for those he loved most. \nPresident Packer always set aside time for his family, and at every \nopportunity, he sought to educate his children and instill in them the \nanchor of faith--the same enduring faith that inspired all who heard \nhis teachings.\n  President Packer's devotion to God was steady and unwavering, but \njust as sure and steadfast as his faith was his wife, Donna, his \nconstant companion and able helpmeet who stood by his side for more \nthan 67 years. In his final address to members of the LDS Church, \nPresident Packer expressed tender feelings for Donna:\n\n       When it comes to my wife, the mother of our children, I am \n     without words. The feeling is so deep and the gratitude so \n     powerful that I am left almost without expression . . . I am \n     grateful for each moment I am with her side by side and for \n     the promise the Lord has given that there will be no end.\n\n  I know Donna finds peace in that promise, and I pray that her family \ndoes too. May God's love might abide with them at this difficult time, \nand may His love be with all of us who mourn the passing of President \nBoyd K. Packer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4942-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4942-S4943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nFIFTY YEARS LATER, RECALLING THE VIETNAM WAR AND THOSE WHO FOUGHT IN IT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this week the United States held a special \nceremony to commemorate one of the longest wars in our Nation's \nhistory--the Vietnam war. It was a ceremony to honor the men and women \nwho served in that long and searing conflict, especially the more than \n58,000 young Americans who did not come home from the battle.\n  The Congressional ceremony was held to commemorate what organizers, \nincluding the Department of Defense, call the 50th anniversary of the \nVietnam war. The milestone is a little ambiguous. You see, it was 50 \nyears ago, on March 9, 1965, that the first U.S. combat forces--3,500 \nmembers of the 9th Marine Expeditionary Brigade--arrived at the port \ncity of Da Nang, in what was then the Republic of South Vietnam.\n  The arrival of those young Marines marked the beginning of a massive \nU.S. military buildup that lasted nearly a decade. But America's \nmilitary presence in Vietnam actually began several years earlier, with \nthe deployment of military advisors to assist the South Vietnamese \narmed forces.\n  All told, 9.2 million Americans served in uniform during the Vietnam \nwar; 7.2 million Vietnam-era veterans are still with us, along with 9 \nmillion families of Vietnam-era veterans.\n  Most of the men who served in Vietnam came home to build successful \ncareers and strong families. More than a few went on to serve in \nCongress and we have benefited greatly from their wisdom and continued \ncommitment to duty.\n  I think of my friend, Senator John McCain, who endured unspeakable \ncruelty for years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. He could have \nbeen released from that hell years earlier but he refused to leave \nwhile other American servicemembers remained captive.\n  Senator McCain has been a powerful voice in calling for America to \nhonor our commitments under the Geneva Conventions to never use \ntorture--to remain true to our word and our values even in war. I \nrespect him deeply for his principled stand.\n  I think of other friends and former members of this Senate who served \nin Vietnam. Bob Kerrey, the former Governor and U.S. Senator from \nNebraska, lost a leg while serving as a Navy SEAL in Vietnam. He was \nawarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n  Chuck Hagel, another Nebraskan, served as an Army sergeant in Vietnam \nalongside his brother Tom. He came home to build a successful business \ncareer, got elected twice to the U.S. Senate, and went on to serve as \nAmerica's Secretary of Defense.\n  John Kerry was a diplomat's son--truly, a ``fortunate son''--who \nserved with distinction in Vietnam as a Navy lieutenant from 1966 to \n1970. When he returned home, he became an eloquent voice among those \ncalling for an end to the war in which he had fought. He went on to \nserve his State of Massachusetts as Lieutenant Governor and then \nrepresented his State for nearly 30 years in this Senate. He now \nrepresents our Nation's interest on the world stage as U.S. Secretary \nof State.\n  One of the bravest men I have ever met served in Vietnam and then \nserved in this Senate. His name is Max Cleland. Max went to Vietnam as \na 6-foot, 2-inch marine. One day in Vietnam he stepped on a landmine. \nThe explosion ripped off both of his legs and one of his arms. Max \nCleland went on to serve in the Veterans Administration under President \nCarter and later as a member of this Senate--an amazing man.\n  In all, more than 153,000 U.S. servicemembers were gravely wounded in \nVietnam--wounded seriously enough to require hospitalization.\n  Others sacrificed even more; 58,220 American servicemembers were \nkilled in action during the Vietnam war.\n  The Americans who died in Vietnam ranged in age from 6 years old to \n62. Six in 10 were just 21 years old or younger. Their names are carved \ninto that sacred slab of black marble, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, \non the National Mall in Washington, DC.\n  In the four decades since the end of the war, thousands more Vietnam \nveterans have died from physical and psychic injuries suffered in that \nwar--dying from causes ranging from cancers caused by exposure to the \ndeadly chemical defoliant Agent Orange, to the agonies of post-\ntraumatic stress.\n  Fifteen years ago, Congress authorized the placement of a plaque near \n``The Wall'' to honor these ``men and women who served in the Vietnam \nWar and later died as a result of their service.'' We remember and \nhonor their service, too.\n  Every American my age and a decade or so younger knows someone who \ndied in Vietnam or a friend whose father, brother or husband never came \nhome. These young men are still missed deeply by their families and \nfriends and remembered by a grateful nation.\n  The city I grew up in, East St. Louis, IL lost 56 young men in \nVietnam.\n  The City of Chicago lost 959 young men in the Vietnam war. Let me \ntell you about one of them: Marine Lance Corporal Mike Badsing. He was \namong those first 3,500 Marines who landed at Da Nang 50 years ago--a \nrifleman in the 3rd Marine Division, 1st Battalion, 9th Marines, C \nCompany. The 1st Battalion suffered the highest casualty rate of any \nMarine battalion in any war--a grim distinction that led North \nVietnam's Communist President Ho Chi Minh to call them ``The Walking \nDead.'' The nickname stuck.\n  Mike Badsing attended St. Edward grammar school, where he played \nfootball, basketball, and Chicago 16'' softball. He was the youngest of \nfive kids. One of his older sisters is a nun today.\n  He left Chicago for Vietnam on Christmas Eve 1964. About 10 months \nlater, Sept. 6, 1965, his platoon came under fire and Lance Corporal \nBadsing was hit in the abdomen by a sniper shot, becoming the first \nChicago-area Marine killed in combat in Vietnam.\n  He was buried in All Saints Cemetery in Des Plaines, IL. A half-\ncentury later, Marines still visit his grave, often drinking a few Old \nStyle beers in their friend's memory.\n  My adopted hometown of Springfield, IL--also President Lincoln's \nadopted hometown--lost 40 young men in combat during the Vietnam war. \nAmong them was an Army helicopter pilot named Captain Michael Davis \nO'Donnell.\n  Mike O'Donnell died on March 24, 1970, when a rescue helicopter he \nwas piloting crashed in dense jungle in Cambodia, 14 miles over the \nCambodia-Vietnam border. He had gone into Cambodia to rescue a Special \nForces reconnaissance team that was about to be overrun by enemy \nsoldiers. He and his crew had gotten all eight members of the Special \nForces team safely on board and were taking off when their ``Huey'' \nhelicopter was hit twice by enemy missiles. It was 1 week before \nPresident Nixon announced publicly that American forces were even in \nCambodia.\n  All 12 men aboard Mike O'Donnell's Huey died, but it wasn't until \n2001 that their remains were identified and returned. Today, they lie \nburied together at Arlington Cemetery.\n  Mike O'Donnell was 24 years old when he died. He was promoted \nposthumously to the rank of major.\n\n[[Page S4943]]\n\n  In addition to being a soldier, Mike O'Donnell was a talented \nmusician and a poet. During his life, he shared his poems with only a \nfew close friends. After he died, soldiers in his unit found a notebook \nhe kept, filled with 22 of his poems, which they saved and brought \nhome.\n  Just as ``In Flanders Fields'' has become the unofficial homage to \nWorld War I, a poem by Michael Davis O'Donnell has become the \nunofficial poem of the Vietnam war. It begins with the words, ``If you \nare able, save them a place inside of you.'' Google that line and you \nwill find nearly 75,000 hits.\n  Mike O'Donnell's poem was carried in combat by untold thousands of \nmen who served in Vietnam. It was read at the dedication of ``The \nWall,'' the national Vietnam War Memorial, in Washington, DC. and it is \netched into many smaller Vietnam memorials across America.\n  Here is the whole poem:\n\n     If you are able,\n     save them a place\n     inside of you\n     and save one backward glance\n     when you are leaving\n     for the places they can\n     no longer go.\n     Be not ashamed to say\n     you loved them,\n     though you may\n     or may not have always.\n     Take what they have left\n     and what they have taught you\n     with their dying\n     and keep it with your own.\n     And in that time\n     when men decide and feel safe\n     to call the war insane,\n     take one moment to embrace\n     those gentle heroes\n     you left behind.\n       Captain Michael Davis O'Donnell\n       1 January 1970\n       Dak To, Vietnam\n\n  Less than 3 months after writing those words, Mike O'Donnell died.\n  Along with the 58,220 Americans who died there, the Vietnam war \nclaimed the lives of more than one million Vietnamese men, women and \nchildren.\n  It is fitting, and it is overdue, for America to thank all of those \nwho served and sacrificed so much in the Vietnam war. But we owe them \nmore than speeches and ceremonies. As President Lincoln told us in his \nSecond Inaugural Address, we have a solemn duty ``to care for him who \nhas borne the battle.''\n  Six years ago I asked my friend, then-Senator Hillary Clinton, if I \ncould introduce a bill she had been working on before she moved on to a \nbigger and better gig. She agreed, and I introduced a bill creating \nwhat is now called the Veterans Caregiver Program, to help the families \nof U.S. servicemembers severely injured in Iraq and Afghanistan. The \nprogram provides family caregivers of post 9/11 veterans who have \nsuffered catastrophic injuries with training and a small stipend so \nthey can care for their loved ones at home, rather than sending them to \nnursing homes. The program helps these families know that they are not \nalone and not forgotten.\n  Today, 20,000 veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan participate \nin the caregivers program. That is more than five times the number the \nVA originally estimated would sign up.\n  The Veterans Caregiver Program doesn't just help those families; it \nhelps American taxpayers. Caring for severely injured veterans in the \ncaregivers program costs the VA $36,000 per veteran, per year. Compare \nthat to the average $332,000 per veteran, per year it costs the VA to \ncare for these veterans in nursing homes.\n  When we started the caregivers program, we had to limit it to post-9/\n11 veterans and their families. But we know now that it works. It saves \nfamilies and it saves taxpayers money.\n  When he chaired the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, our colleague, \nSenator Bernie Sanders said repeatedly that we should expand the \nVeterans Caregivers Program. He was right.\n  So last March--nearly 50 years to the day after those first, young \nMarines landed in Da Nang--Senator Baldwin and I introduced a bill to \nexpand the program to U.S. veterans of all wars. Our bill is called the \nVA Family Caregivers Expansion and Improvement Act.\n  They were young once, but today the average Vietnam veteran is \nretired. Many still struggle with old wounds gained in service to our \nNation.\n  As our Nation and this Congress thank them for their service 50 years \nago, I hope that we can also work together in this Senate to provide \nVietnam veterans the medical care and support that they and their \nfamilies need today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4943-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4943-S4946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget \nscorekeeping report for July 2015. The report compares current-law \nlevels of spending and revenues with the amounts provided in the \nconference report to accompany S. Con. Res. 11, the budget resolution \nfor fiscal year 2016. This information is necessary to determine \nwhether budget points of order lie against pending legislation. It has \nbeen prepared by the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee \nand the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, pursuant to section 308(b) of \nthe Congressional Budget Act.\n  This is the first report I have made since adoption of the 2016 \nbudget resolution on May 5, 2015. I will provide these reports \nperiodically, generally one per work period. The information contained \nin this report is current through July 7, 2015.\n  Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee \nexceeds or is below its allocation under the budget resolution. This \ninformation is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to \nsection 302 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, CBA. For fiscal \nyear 2015, which is still enforced under the deemed budget resolution \nfrom the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, BBA, Senate authorizing \ncommittees have increased direct spending outlays by $7.8 billion more \nthan the agreed-upon spending levels. Over the fiscal years 2016-2025 \nperiod, which is the entire period covered by S. Con. Res. 11, Senate \nauthorizing committees have spent $22 million more than the budget \nresolution calls for.\n  Table 2 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations exceeds or is below the statutory spending limits. This \ninformation is used to determine points of order related to the \nspending caps found in section 312 and section 314 of the CBA. While no \nappropriations bills have been enacted, subcommittees are charged with \npermanent and advanced appropriations that first become available for \nfiscal year 2016.\n  Table 3 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations exceeds or is below its allocation for Overseas \nContingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism, OCO/GWOT, spending. \nThis separate allocation for OCO/GWOT was established in section 3102 \nof S. Con. Res. 11, and is enforced using section 302 of the CBA. No \nbills providing funds with the OCO/GWOT designation have been enacted \nthus far for fiscal year 2016.\n  The budget resolution established two new points of order limiting \nthe use of changes in mandatory programs in appropriations bills, \nCHIMPS. Tables 4 and 5 show compliance with fiscal year 2016 limits for \noverall CHIMPS and the Crime Victims Fund CHIMP, respectively. This \ninformation is used for determining points of order under section 3103 \nand section 3104, respectively. No bills have been enacted thus far for \nfiscal year 2016 that include CHIMPS.\n  In addition to the tables provided by the Senate Budget Committee \nRepublican staff, I am submitting additional tables from CBO that I \nwill use for enforcement of budget levels agreed to by the Congress.\n  Because legislation can still be enacted that would have an effect on \nfiscal year 2015, CBO provided a report for both fiscal year 2015 and \nfiscal year 2016. This information is used to enforce aggregate \nspending levels in budget resolutions under section 311 of the CBA. \nCBO's estimates show that current law levels of spending for fiscal \nyear 2015 exceed the amounts in the deemed budget resolution enacted in \nthe BBA by $8.0 billion in budget authority and $1.0 billion in \noutlays. Revenues are $79.8 billion below the revenue floor for fiscal \nyear 2015 set by the deemed budget resolution. As well, Social Security \noutlays are at the levels assumed for fiscal year 2015, while Social \nSecurity revenues are $170 million above levels in the deemed budget.\n  For fiscal year 2016, CBO estimates that current law levels are below \nthe\n\n[[Page S4944]]\n\nbudget resolution's allowable budget authority and outlay aggregates by \n$886.0 billion and $526.9 billion, respectively. The allowable spending \nroom will be reduced as appropriations bills for fiscal year 2016 are \nenacted. Revenues are $5 million above the level assumed in the budget \nresolution. Finally, Social Security outlays and revenues are at the \nlevels assumed in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2016.\n  CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate's \nPay-As-You-Go rule. The Senate's Pay-As-You-Go scorecard currently \nshows a balance of -$470 million over the fiscal years 2015-2020 period \nand $125 million over the fiscal years 2015-2025 period. Over the \ninitial 6-year period, Congress has enacted legislation that would \nincrease revenues by $2.3 billion and increase outlays by $1.9 billion. \nOver the 11-year period, Congress has enacted legislation that would \nreduce revenues by $5.3 billion and decrease outlays by $5.2 billion. \nThe Senate's Pay-As-You-Go rule is enforced by section 201 of S. Con. \nRes. 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution.\n  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this statement and the accompanying \ntables be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  TABLE 1.

Mr. President, today I wish to speak about the ongoing \ncivil war in South Sudan. July 9 marks the fourth anniversary of South \nSudan's independence. This should be a day of celebration, but it is \ninstead a day marred by violence and suffering. For the last 19 months, \nhostilities between the government and the opposition have brought the \nworld's newest country to the brink of ruin. Regional mediation efforts \nhave failed, and the international community has yet to come up with a \nviable plan to end the violence. Unless we jumpstart diplomatic efforts \nimmediately, this conflict is destined to become another long-running \nwar in Africa that is ignored by the rest of the world.\n  As some of my colleagues may know, ongoing political tensions between \nforces loyal to President Salva Kiir and forces loyal to former Vice \nPresident Riek Machar, coupled with preexisting ethnic tensions, \nerupted in violence on the night of December 15, 2013. Both sides in \nthe conflict have committed and continue to commit serious human rights \nviolations. The nature and scale of the abuses in the first days, \nweeks, and months of the conflict prompted the African Union to \nestablish a Commission of Inquiry in March of last year to investigate. \nHowever the Commission's report, while completed, has never been \npublicly released. We have seen the contents of a version of the report \nthat was leaked in March and the findings are truly disturbing: \nindiscriminate killing of civilians, burning and looting of hospitals \nand humanitarian assets, attacks on United Nations compounds, and rape \non a massive scale. Similar findings have been reported separately by \nthe U.N. and various human rights organizations.\n  Tragically, increased fighting this spring has been characterized by \nan even greater level of brutality. According to the United Nations \nChildren's Fund, UNICEF, as many as 129 children were killed in May in \nUnity State alone--boys were castrated and left to bleed to death, \ngirls as young as 8 years old were raped and killed, some children had \ntheir throats slit or were thrown into burning buildings by government-\nallied militia. This is in addition to the estimated 13,000 children \nbeing forcibly recruited to fight by government and opposition forces. \nThe behavior of armed groups is beyond inhumane.\n  As a result of the war, 1.5 million people are internally displaced. \nMore than 730,000 have crossed borders into Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, \nand Kenya as refugees. The number of people facing severe food \ninsecurity has almost doubled since the start of the year from 2.5 \nmillion to an estimated 4.6 million people, including approximately \n874,000 children under the age of 5.\n  The recent uptick in hostilities has made it extremely challenging \nfor humanitarian organizations to reach populations in need. Aid \nworkers continue to be harassed, detained, and abducted. The Government \nof South Sudan expelled the United Nations Deputy Special \nRepresentative and Humanitarian Coordinator Toby Lanzer in June. His \nexpulsion comes at a time of increasing humanitarian need. The ruthless\n\n[[Page S4947]]\n\nmeans through which troops are executing the war, the parliament's \npassage of an NGO law hinders the delivery of much needed services, the \nexpulsion of the head of the U.N. humanitarian arm and obstruction of \nU.N. peacekeeping operations to protect civilians, and the refusal of \nthe parties to engage in good-faith negotiations to end hostilities all \npaint a picture of two opposing sides that have very little regard for \nthe needs or wellbeing of South Sudanese citizens.\n  In light of the gravity of the situation on the ground, we must \nurgently consider taking several steps: First, we should push for a \nUnited Nations arms embargo on South Sudan to stop the flow of arms to \nall warring factions. We may or may not be successful in convincing all \nof the Permanent Five members of the Security Council to agree with us \non this, but we will never be successful if we don't make the attempt. \nOn July 1, the United Nations Security Council imposed personal \ntargeted sanctions on six South Sudanese generals it believes are \nfueling the fighting. I welcome this move, but I have doubts that this \nalone will prove a game changer. Strangling the supply of arms and \nmateriel of the actors on the ground could prove far more effective \nthan sanctioning military leaders who don't travel outside the country \nor hold assets internationally.\n  Second, we must undertake a review of the military training and \nassistance we are providing to countries in the region to determine \nwhether soldiers we have trained and equipment we have supplied are \nbeing used to either commit human rights abuses in South Sudan or \nprolong hostilities. We should also consider whether extra safeguards \nare warranted to ensure that U.S. security assistance is not being used \nto support the warring factions or otherwise contributing to the \nconflict.\n  Third, we must expand our investments in reconciliation efforts. \nUSAID has joined with international partners and is doing a tremendous \njob on the humanitarian front. But our aid should, to the extent \npossible, be coupled with an increase in peace and reconciliation \nactivities. The vicious nature of the attacks on civilians will make \npost-war, community-level reconstruction efforts and national healing \nenormously difficult. We cannot wait until the war is over to begin to \nbring people together. These programs should also include activities \nthat support justice at the local level so that people who have borne \nthe brunt of the violence can obtain some measure of closure.\n  Fourth, we must begin to look at how we put accountability mechanisms \nin place. During his trip to east Africa in May, Secretary Kerry \nannounced $5 million to support accountability efforts. I applaud this \nmove, and am pleased to hear that we are supporting the collection of \nevidence of gross human rights violations and preserving records for \nuse in the future. We must take each and every opportunity we can to \nmake clear that the United States is committed to bringing human rights \nabusers to justice. However, we can do more. We should push regional \nactors to move forward with efforts to establish the parameters and \nmodalities of a court or other transitional justice mechanism. \nInitiating such mechanisms now--rather than waiting for an end to the \nwar--more adequately demonstrates the international community's \ncommitment to justice for victims than empty statements on the \nimportance of accountability.\n  Finally, I urge President Obama to convene a meeting with the \nSecretaries General of the Africa Union and United Nations while he is \nin Addis Ababa this month to discuss a way forward that involves those \ntwo bodies and members of the Troika. And these talks must involve key \nregional players who could prove spoilers to any process, including \nSudan and Uganda.\n  The cost of this war has been astronomical. The U.N. Mission to South \nSudan has cost over $2 billion in the past 2 years alone. The \ninternational community has provided nearly $2.7 billion in \nhumanitarian assistance. The United States alone has provided more than \n$1.2 billion for those purposes. This is money that should have been \ninvested in building a country that had already been devastated by \ndecades of war with Sudan. However, the real tragedy is not the dollars \nlost--it is in the thousands of lives lost, the seeds sown of ethnic \nhatred and division and the squandering of an opportunity to build a \nnation that could provide a future to millions of people that were \nmarginalized, attacked and abused by Khartoum. We must take action now \nto stop the war and prevent the deaths of thousands more South \nSudanese.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4947-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT KATHRYN ELIZABETH ROSENBERG\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and honor Lieutenant \nKathryn Rosenberg, U.S. Navy, as she transfers from the Navy Office of \nLegislative Affairs.\n  A native of Pennsylvania, Lieutenant Rosenberg was commissioned an \nensign through the Naval ROTC Program upon graduation from George \nWashington University in 2008.\n  Lieutenant Rosenberg, a surface warfare officer, has performed in a \nconsistently outstanding manner under the most challenging of \ncircumstances. Lieutenant Rosenberg served with distinction and gained \nextensive experience in the surface fleet during her first two sea \ntours. While assigned to the USS Stockdale (DDG 106) from June 2008 to \nNovember 2010, Lieutenant Rosenberg served as the pre-commissioning \nauxiliaries officer and combat information center officer while \nobtaining her surface warfare officer pin and engineering officer of \nthe watch qualification. From March 2011 to December 2012, Lieutenant \nRosenberg was assigned to the USS Vicksburg (CG 69), where she served \nas the fire control officer while qualifying as the anti-air warfare \ncommander, force anti-air warfare commander, and force tactical action \nofficer.\n  Since January 2013, Lieutenant Rosenberg has served as a Senate \nliaison officer in the Navy Office of Legislative Affairs. In this \ncapacity, she has been a major asset to the Navy and Congress. Over the \ncourse of the last 2 years, Lieutenant Rosenberg has led 21 \nCongressional delegations to 36 different countries. She has escorted \n54 Members of Congress and 36 personal and professional staff members. \nShe has distinguished herself by going above and beyond the call of \nduty to facilitate and successfully execute each and every trip, \ndespite any number of weather, aircraft, and diplomatic complications. \nHer leadership, energy, and integrity have ensured that numerous \nchallenging Senate overseas trips have been flawlessly executed, to \ninclude an arduous trip to Afghanistan.\n  This Chamber will feel Lieutenant Rosenberg's absence. I join many \npast and present Members of Congress in my gratitude and appreciation \nto Lieutenant Rosenberg for her outstanding leadership and her \nunwavering support of the missions of the U.S. Navy, the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, and others. I wish Lieutenant Rosenberg \n``fair winds and following seas.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4947-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4947-S4948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ACCREDITATION\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a copy of my remarks at the Senate Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions hearing on ``Reauthorizing the Higher \nEducation Act: Evaluating Accreditation's Role in Ensuring Quality.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                             ACCREDITATION\n\n       We're here today to discuss our system for ensuring that \n     colleges are giving students a good education. That's called \n     accreditation.\n       Accreditation is a self-governing process that was created \n     by colleges in the 1800s. The organizations they created were \n     intended to help colleges distinguish themselves from high \n     schools and later, to accredit one another.\n       At this time there was no federal involvement in higher \n     education or accreditation, and right around the end of World \n     War II, about 5% of the population had earned a college \n     degree.\n       Accreditation however took on a new role in the 1950's. \n     After the Korean War, Congress went looking for a way to \n     ensure that the money spent for the GI Bill to help veterans \n     go to college was being used at legitimate, quality \n     institutions.\n       Congress had enough sense to know they couldn't do the job \n     of evaluating the diversity of our colleges and universities \n     themselves so they outsourced the task to accreditation. \n     Accreditors became, as many like to say, ``gatekeepers'' to \n     federal funds.\n\n[[Page S4948]]\n\n       The Korean War G.I. Bill of 1952 first established this new \n     responsibility--it said that veterans could only use their \n     benefits at colleges that were accredited by an agency \n     recognized by what was called the Commissioner of Education, \n     and then after the Department of Education was created in \n     1979, the Secretary of Education.\n       The Higher Education Act of 1965 used this same idea when \n     it created federal financial aid for non-veteran college \n     students. Around this time, about 10% of the population had \n     received a college degree.\n       However, the 1992 Higher Education Act Amendments were the \n     first time the law said much about what standards accreditors \n     needed to use when assessing quality at institutions of \n     higher education.\n       Today, current law outlines 10 broad standards that \n     federally recognized accreditors must have when reviewing \n     colleges: student achievement; curriculum; faculty; \n     facilities; fiscal and administrative capacity; student \n     support services; recruiting and admissions practices; \n     measure of program length; student complaints; and compliance \n     with Title IV program responsibility.\n       The law tells accreditors that they must measure student \n     achievement, but it doesn't tell them how to do it.\n       Colleges and accreditors determine the specifics of the \n     standards--not the Department of Education.\n       For the student achievement standard, colleges and \n     universities define how they meet that standard based on \n     their mission--the law specifically doesn't let the \n     Department of Education regulate or define student \n     achievement.\n       And in fact, in 2007, when the Department of Education \n     tried to do that, Congress stopped it.\n       Still, Congress spends approximately $33 billion for Pell \n     grants each year, and taxpayers will lend over $100 billion \n     in loans this year that students have to pay back.\n       So we have a duty to make certain that students are \n     spending that money at quality colleges and universities.\n       I believe there are two main concerns about accreditation:\n       First, is it ensuring quality?\n       And second, is the federal government guilty of getting in \n     the way of accreditors doing their job?\n       The Task Force on Government Regulation of Higher \n     Education, which was commissioned by a bipartisan group of \n     senators on this committee, told us in a detailed report that \n     federal rules and regulations on accreditors have turned the \n     process into federal ``micro-management.''\n       In addressing these two concerns, I think we should look at \n     five areas:\n       First, are accreditors doing enough to ensure that students \n     are learning and receiving a quality education?\n       A recent survey commissioned by Inside Higher Ed found that \n     97% of chief academic officers at public colleges and \n     universities believe their institution is ``very or somewhat \n     effective at preparing students for the workforce.''\n       But a Gallup survey shows that business leaders aren't so \n     sure--only one-third of American business leaders say that \n     colleges and universities are graduating students with the \n     skills and competencies their businesses need. Nearly a third \n     of business leaders disagree, with 17% going as far as to say \n     that they strongly disagree.\n       Second, would more competition and choice among accreditors \n     be one way to improve quality?\n       Accreditation is one of the few areas in higher education \n     without choice and competition. Today colleges and \n     universities cannot choose which regional accrediting agency \n     they'd like to use. If they could, would that drive quality?\n       Third, do federal rules and regulations force accreditors \n     to spend too much time on issues other than quality?\n       Accreditation may now be ``cops on the beat'' for \n     Department of Education rules and regulations unrelated to \n     academic quality. Accreditors review fire codes, \n     institutional finances (something the Department of Education \n     already looks at) and whether a school is in compliance with \n     Department rules for Title IV. To me, these don't seem to be \n     an accreditor's job.\n       Fourth, do accreditors have the right tools and flexibility \n     to deal with the many different institutions with many \n     different needs and circumstances?\n       Some well-established institutions may not need to go \n     through the same process as everyone else, allowing \n     accreditors to focus on those institutions that need the most \n     help.\n       Finally, could the public benefit from more information \n     about accreditation?\n       All the public learns from the accreditation process is \n     whether a school is accredited or unaccredited. Even at \n     comparable colleges, quality may vary dramatically, yet all \n     institutions receive the same, blanket ``accredited'' stamp \n     of approval. Seems to me that there could be more information \n     provided to students, families or policymakers.\n       We'd better find a way to make accreditation work better.\n       There's really not another way to do this--to monitor \n     quality. Because if accreditation doesn't do it, I can assure \n     you that Congress can't. And the Department of Education \n     certainly doesn't have the capacity or know-how.\n       They could hire a thousand bureaucrats to run around the \n     country reviewing 6,000 colleges, but you can imagine what \n     that would be like.\n       They're already trying to rate colleges, and no one is \n     optimistic about their efforts--I think they'll collapse of \n     their own weight.\n       So it's crucial that accrediting of our colleges improve.\n       Our witnesses have a variety of viewpoints on accreditation \n     and I look forward to the discussion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4948-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               RECOGNIZING THE NORTHWEST ARKANSAS COUNCIL\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I want to recognize the hard work, \ndedication, and achievements of the Northwest Arkansas Council, which \nis celebrating its 25th anniversary. This organization helped transform \nNorthwest Arkansas into an economic powerhouse. In 1990, business and \ncommunity leaders created a cooperative regional business foundation \nwith a focus on what is best for the region. Now, 25 years later, the \ncouncil has strengthened partnerships and achieved many successes.\n  Early on, the council recognized the importance of expanding the \nregion's infrastructure. It planted the seeds for development by \npursuing the construction of a new regional airport, an interstate to \nconnect western Arkansas, and a massive 2-ton water system to serve \nBenton and Washington Counties.\n  These priorities laid the foundation for the expansive growth and \ndevelopment of the region. Northwest Arkansas continues to flourish \nunder the council's encouragement and vision. By focusing on the future \nand on mutually beneficial goals, the council is a leader in \nvisualizing and promoting investments that meet the needs of citizens \nand local businesses. In recent years, the council's goals have \nexpanded toward growing the region's workforce, including increasing \nthe number of high school and college graduates and attracting top \ntalent.\n  This unique partnership encourages communities throughout the region \nto think about long-term goals and creates a strategic plan to \naccomplish them. What is impressive is that the council consistently \nachieves most of its goals, often ahead of schedule.\n  The council is a model for success. Economic development regions \nacross Arkansas and throughout the country use the council as a model, \nwith hopes of achieving similar success. The council has demonstrated \nthe value of cooperation and collaboration, as well as the importance \nof keeping attention focused on common ground and shared interests.\n  I congratulate the Northwest Arkansas Council on its 25-year \ncommitment to growth and development and for continuing to make the \nregion better through infrastructure improvements, workforce \ndevelopment, and regional stewardship. I look forward to continuing to \nwork with the Northwest Arkansas Council and seeing its future \nachievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4948-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4948-S4949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING SHERIFF RALPH LAMB\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today we honor the life and legacy \nof former Clark County Sheriff Ralph Lamb, whose passing signifies a \ngreat loss to Nevada. I send my condolences and prayers to his wife Rae \nand all of Mr. Lamb's family in this time of mourning. He was a man \ncommitted to his family, his country, his State, and his community. \nAlthough he will be sorely missed, his legendary influence throughout \nthe Silver State will continue on.\n  Mr. Lamb was born on April 10, 1927, in a small ranching community in \nAlamo. He was one of 11 children who helped on the family farm and \nworked in the local schoolhouse to support the family. At 11 years old, \nhis father was killed in a rodeo accident, and he was taken in by his \noldest brother Floyd Lamb. Mr. Lamb served in the Army during World War \nII in the Pacific Theater, later returning to Nevada. He became a Clark \nCounty deputy sheriff and soon after was named chief of detectives. In \n1954, he left the Clark County Sheriff's Department to form a private \ndetective agency.\n  It wasn't until 1958 that Mr. Lamb showed interest in returning to \nthe department. He was named Clark County Sheriff in 1961 and served \nunder this title for 18 years, an unprecedented amount of time that \ncontinues to be\n\n[[Page S4949]]\n\nthe longest anyone has held the job. His unwavering dedication to the \ndepartment and the community will always be remembered.\n  Mr. Lamb truly strived to make the department the absolute best it \ncould be. Throughout his tenure, organized crime was prevalent in the \nLas Vegas community. Mr. Lamb worked with the county commission to pass \nthe ``work card law,'' requiring anyone working in the gaming industry \nto be fingerprinted, photographed, and to notify the sheriff if he or \nshe moved jobs. This important piece of legislation helped \nsignificantly in fighting organized crime.\n  He was also a key contributor in transitioning the Clark County \nSheriff's Department into a more sophisticated force and in helping in \nits consolidation with the Las Vegas Police Department, creating \nstability in the law enforcement community with the present \nMetropolitan Police Department, Metro. His administration created the \ncity's first SWAT team and brought the Las Vegas metropolitan area a \nmodern crime lab, including a mobile crime lab. Metro was one of the \nfirst police agencies to utilize semiautomatic pistols and in-car \ncomputers, all driven by the hard work of Mr. Lamb. His many \naccomplishments will benefit future Metro officers for years to come.\n  I extend my deepest sympathies to his family. We will always remember \nMr. Lamb for his invaluable contributions to the local community. It is \nthe brave men and women who serve in the local police department who \nkeep our communities safe. These heroes selflessly put their lives on \nthe line every day. Mr. Lamb's sacrifice and courage earn him a place \namong the outstanding men and women who have valiantly put their lives \non the line to keep our communities safe, and his service will never be \nforgotten.\n  Mr. Lamb fought to maintain only the highest level of excellence for \nthe Clark County Sheriff's Department. The Southern Nevada community \nremains safer because of Mr. Lamb. I am honored to commend him for his \nhard work and invaluable contributions to the Silver State. Today, I \njoin the Las Vegas metropolitan community and citizens of the Silver \nState to celebrate the life of an upstanding Nevadan, Sheriff Ralph \nLamb.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4949-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING HOTEL NEVADA'S 86TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 86th \nanniversary of Hotel Nevada, a historic landmark and important piece of \nthe Ely community. I am proud to honor this hotel that serves as a \nsymbol of Nevada's history and continues to offer quality services to \nguests and locals alike.\n  The city of Ely was originally established as a stagecoach stop and \npost office along the Pony Express' Central Overland Route in 1870 and \nwas designated the county seat in 1887. The city expanded its growth in \n1906 when copper mining dominated the area. The necessity to \naccommodate numerous miners who worked in the area drove the \ndevelopment of the city and kindled the construction of many buildings. \nThe Hotel Nevada was built during this time of the Prohibition era in \n1929 and was deemed the tallest building in the State with six floors \nin the 1940s. It is one of a kind and continues to maintain its \nauthenticity with its original structure, bringing a distinct rural \nWest feel. I am grateful this remarkable site provides visitors and \nresidents a glimpse into Nevada's past. It is truly a staple for the \nEly community.\n  The hotel and gambling hall offers 67 updated rooms to guests. It \nalso provides the only 24-hour restaurant and full-service hotel and \ncasino in Ely. Since its opening, it has received many well-known \nguests, including Wayne Newton, Mickey Rooney, and Lyndon Johnson. Each \ntime my wife and I travel to the city of Ely, we stay at the Hotel \nNevada. I can say from first-hand experience Hotel Nevada offers an \nunparalleled historic experience to its guests. It gives me great \npleasure to see this business celebrate 86 years of success.\n  Hotel Nevada has demonstrated professionalism, commitment to \nexcellence, and true dedication to authenticity since its opening. \nAfter 86 years, it stands a true testament to the City of Ely. Today, I \nask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Hotel Nevada on its 86th \nanniversary. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4949-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4949-S4950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO DR. WILLIAM ``BRIT'' KIRWAN\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to honor the extraordinary \nDr. William ``Brit'' Kirwan, who recently left the post of chancellor \nof the University System of Maryland, USM. Not only am I honored to \nknow him professionally, I am proud to call him a dear friend.\n  Dr. Kirwan will be greatly missed. He has devoted himself to higher \neducation for the past 50 years. How amazing is that? Not only is he an \naccomplished individual, he also throws the coolest Derby parties. I \nlove Dr. Kirwan, and I know Maryland loves Dr. Kirwan.\n  Prior to becoming chancellor of USM, Dr. Kirwan served as president \nof the Ohio State University for 4 years. Before that, he served as \npresident of the University of Maryland, College Park, UMCP, for 10 \nyears. Before becoming president of UMCP, he was a member of the \nUniversity of Maryland faculty for 24 years--where he served as an \nassistant professor, department chair and Provost. Until last month, \nDr. Kirwan served as the chancellor of USM for 13 years.\n  Under his leadership, USM roared into the 21st century. He led 11 \nuniversities, with more than 40,000 undergraduate and graduate \nstudents. He boosted graduation rates while winning lacrosse and \nbasketball games. He made sure that no campus was left out or left \nbehind. He made sure to support the University of Maryland flagship, \nour schools out in western Maryland and on the Eastern Shore--Frostburg \nand Salisbury--and our Historically Black Colleges and Universities, \nHBCUs. He also worked to make sure our professional schools in downtown \nBaltimore remained strong. In fact, downtown Baltimore has some of the \nbest medical, law, nursing and social work schools in the world. \nStudents knew they could count on Dr. Kirwan. He made college more \naffordable by freezing tuition for 4 years. Even faculty knew they \ncould count on him.\n  Dr. Kirwan has so many more accomplishments that it is difficult to \nknow where to begin. Particularly, the accomplishments I am most proud \nof were the ones where we worked together. When Senator Alexander and I \nworked together on the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act in \n2008, we looked at two things: how can we make sure young people get a \nquality and affordable education, and how can colleges and universities \ncontrol their costs. What emerged was the recognition that we needed to \ndo something about burdensome regulations. That is why Senator \nAlexander and I, along with Senators Bennet and Burr, created a task \nforce to look at the issue of duplicative, burdensome higher education \nregulations.\n  Because of Dr. Kirwan's wealth and knowledge of higher education, I \nknew he was the right man for the job to lead this particular task \nforce. What he was able to accomplish is astounding. The task force, \nunder his leadership, put together a comprehensive report that \nidentified the 10 most onerous regulations institutions of higher \neducation were faced with. The report also provided recommendations on \nwhat Congress and the administration could to streamline regulations. \nAs a result of Dr. Kirwan's work, my colleagues in the Senate are using \nhis recommendations to make sure our laws are about smart regulation, \nnot strangulation.\n  While being a national leader in futuristic things like cyber \ntechnology, training the next generation of cyber warriors, making our \neconomy stronger and our country safer, Dr. Kirwan helped changed \nhigher education. He helped change the world--literally changing the \nglobal economy. I would venture to say that we would not have Google if \nit were not for Dr. Kirwan. Now some of you may say: ``Senator Barb, \nwhere does this come from?'' Let me tell you a story.\n  Dr. Kiwan, is not only an able chancellor, he really is a gifted \nmathematician. And in his work as a mathematician, he had the \nopportunity to travel to conferences around the world. At one of those \nconferences in the 1970s, Dr. Kirwan met someone from the Soviet Union \nby the name of Dr. Michael Brin.\n\n[[Page S4950]]\n\n  Then in 1974, Congress passed a little piece of legislation called \nJackson-Vanik, which helped put pressure on the Soviet Union to remove \nits emigration restrictions. When this happened, Dr. Brin reached out \nto Dr. Kirwan and said: ``Do you think you can help me?'' And boy, did \nDr. Kirwan help him out.\n  Thanks to the work of Dr. Kirwan and the USM Board of Regents, not \nonly could Dr. Brin get out of Russia, he was able to come to the \nUniversity of Maryland. With him, Dr. Brin brought his son Sergey. \nSergey was a brilliant little boy--some may even say a bit difficult. \nHe was so smart that he was able to graduate from College Park in 1993 \nat the age of 17. From there, Sergey went on to Stanford where he \nworked out of one of those garages we all hear about.\n  Well, the rest is history. Sergey Brin, of course, is Google. And had \nit not been for Dr. Kirwan meeting Dr. Brin, Congress doing Jackson-\nVanik, the University of Maryland providing a home for Dr. Brin, we \nwould not have Google. I think that is a fabulous story that shows what \ngood immigration policy can do, and also what a gifted, talented, and \ndedicated humanitarian Dr. Kirwan is.\n  Though he changed the world, what has never changed is the man \nhimself. Dr. Kirwan is a man we admire, a man we respect, and a man we \nvalue. It is safe to say that Dr. Kirwan is a man we have such \naffection for, for his passion for education, for his deep concern and \ncaring for our students. For Dr. Kirwan, it was never about building \nbuildings, it was about building a future for our young people and for \nthe great State of Maryland.\n  Dr. Kirwan, there will never be enough ``thank yous'' in the world \nbut: thank you, thank you, thank you for your determination and \ndedication to making Maryland a better place. We will all miss you \ndearly but wish you much success in your retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4950-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING SAFE HAVEN ENTERPRISES\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, small businesses are often on the \nforefront of innovation and safety. American entrepreneurs create and \ntake advantage of opportunities to transform the ways in which we \nsecure our property, aid in natural disasters, and protect our \nfamilies. This week I would like to recognize Safe Haven Enterprises of \nJennings, LA as Small Business of the Week.\n  In 1998, Alta Baker founded Safe Haven Enterprises, SHE, with the \ngoal of providing strong buildings and mobile units that would protect \nfolks and their property in times of disaster. Today, SHE has grown \ninto an enterprise that produces 22 different types of structures \nranging from office complexes to ballistic-resistant doors to first \nresponse units for natural disasters. In order to ensure that SHE's \nmanufacturing can withstand various environments, including hurricane-\nstrength weather and direct RPG attacks, each product has been field \ntested since 2003, providing exceptional security and peace of mind for \nU.S. embassies, government facilities, off-shore oil rigs, electric \ncompanies, and private homes in Louisiana and around the world. Most \nrecently, SHE buildings have been tested in conflict areas in the \nMiddle East--protecting scores of American military personnel and \nproperty.\n  Safe Haven Enterprises is located in a U.S. Small Business \nAdministration Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or HUBZone, \nand has aided the local economy through the creation of high-quality, \ntechnical jobs in Southwest Louisiana. SHE president and CEO Alta Baker \nhas received numerous recognitions, including the 2014 Women in \nConstruction NYC's Outstanding Woman Business of the Year award and the \n2010 U.S. Chamber of Commerce Faces of Trade Award. SHE also holds \nnumerous certifications from institutions such as the U.S. Department \nof State, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Canadian Standards Association \ncertifications for many of its technical structures.\n  Congratulations again to Safe Haven Enterprises for being selected as \nSmall Business of the Week. Thank you for your commitment to producing \nsafe, reliable shelters for the greatest times of need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4950-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4950-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/09/senate-section/article/S4950-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  At 3:36 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 728.

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1730. A bill to enhance civil penalties under the Federal \nsecurities laws, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the Stronger Enforcement of Civil Penalties \nAct, which I am pleased to be introducing today with Senator Grassley \nand Senator Leahy, will enhance the ability of securities regulators to \nprotect investors and demand greater accountability from market \nplayers. Unfortunately, even after the financial crisis that crippled \nthe economy, we continue to see calculated wrongdoing by some on Wall \nStreet. Without the consequence of meaningful penalties to serve as an \neffective deterrent, I fear this disturbing culture of misconduct will \npersist.\n  The existing regime for securities law violations limits by statute \nthe amount of penalties the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, \ncan fine an institution or individual. During hearings I held in 2011 \nin the Securities, Insurance, and Investment Banking Subcommittee, I \nlearned how this limitation significantly interferes with the SEC's \nability to perform its enforcement duties. At that time, the agency had \nbeen criticized by a Federal judge for not obtaining a larger \nsettlement against Citigroup, a major player in the financial crisis \nthat settled with the SEC in an amount that was a fraction of the cost \nthe bank had inflicted on investors. The SEC explained that the reason \nfor the low settlement amount was a statutory prohibition from levying \na larger penalty.\n  The bipartisan bill Senator Grassley and I are introducing updates \nand strengthens the SEC's civil penalties statute. It aims to make \npotential and current offenders think twice before engaging in \nmisconduct by increasing the maximum civil monetary penalties permitted \nby statute, directly linking the size of the maximum penalties to the \namount of losses suffered by victims of a violation, and substantially \nraising the financial stakes for repeat offenders of our nation's \nsecurities laws.\n  Specifically, our bill would give the SEC more options to tailor \npenalties to the specific circumstances of a given violation. In \naddition to raising the per violation caps for severe, or ``tier \nthree,'' violations to $1 million per offense for individuals and $10 \nmillion per offense for entities, the bill would also give the SEC \nadditional options to obtain greater penalties based on the ill-gotten \ngains of the violator or on the financial harm to investors.\n  Our bill also addresses the disconcerting trend of repeat offenders \non Wall Street through two provisions. The first would allow the SEC to \ntriple the penalty cap applicable to recidivists who have been held \neither criminally or civilly liable for securities fraud within the \npreceding five years. The second would allow the SEC to seek a civil \npenalty against those that violate existing federal court or SEC \norders, an approach that would be more efficient, effective, and \nflexible than the current civil contempt remedy. These two changes \nwould substantially improve the ability of the SEC's enforcement \nprogram to ratchet up penalties for recidivists.\n  More than half of all U.S. households own securities. They deserve a \nstrong cop on the beat that has the tools it needs to go after \nfraudsters and pursue the difficult cases arising from our increasingly \ncomplex financial markets. The Stronger Enforcement of Civil Penalties \nAct will give the SEC more tools to demand meaningful accountability \nfrom Wall Street, which in turn will increase transparency and \nconfidence in our financial system. I urge our colleagues to support \nthis important bipartisan legislation to enhance the SEC's ability to \nprotect investors and crack down on fraud.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Ms. Hirono):\n  S. 1731. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to waive the \nminimum period of continuous active duty in the Armed Forces for \nreceipt of certain benefits for homeless veterans, to authorize the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs to furnish such benefits to homeless \nveterans with discharges or releases from service in the Armed Forces \nwith other than dishonorable conditions, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Homeless \nVeterans Services Protection Act of 2015.\n  This legislation would ensure continued access to homeless services \nfor some of our country's most vulnerable veterans who are currently at \nrisk of losing these critical services.\n  The administration set the difficult but commendable goal of \neliminating veteran homelessness. Through tremendous efforts at every \nlevel of government, and with the help of community groups, non-profits \nand the private sector, we have made major progress toward achieving \nthat goal.\n  But we know we have a lot of work to do. Veterans are at greater risk \nof becoming homeless than non-veterans and on any given night as many \nas 50,000 veterans are homeless across the United States.\n  This is unacceptable.\n  Our veterans made great sacrifices while serving our country and our \ncommitment to them is especially important. This commitment includes \nproviding benefits, medical care, support, and assistance to prevent \nhomelessness.\n  Two of our greatest tools are the Department of Veterans Affairs' \nGrant and Per Diem program and the Supportive Services for Veteran \nFamilies program through partnerships with homeless service providers \naround the country.\n  These important and successful programs assist very low-income \nveterans and their families who either live in permanent housing or are \ntransitioning from homelessness. The programs help our veterans with \nrent, utilities, moving costs, outreach, case management, and obtaining \nbenefits.\n  But last year, after a legal review of its policies, VA was forced to \nprepare for a change that would have cut off services to veterans who \ndid not meet certain length of service or discharge requirements, \nchanging policies that homeless service providers had followed for \ndecades.\n  That would be a heartless, bureaucratic move that could have put \nthousands of veterans on the streets--practically overnight. According \nto some of our leading veterans and homeless groups--including The \nAmerican Legion, the National Alliance to End Homelessness the National \nLow Income Housing Coalition, and the National Coalition for Homeless \nVeterans--had the policy been enacted, VA would have had to stop \nserving about 15 percent of the homeless veteran population, and in \ncertain urban areas up to 30 percent of homeless veterans would have \nbeen turned away.\n  The veterans community alerted me to this possible change--and while \nI am proud that we prevented these changes in the short-term--it is \nvery concerning that a legal opinion could be issued at any time to \nundo all of that.\n  There is good reason to reverse this policy for good. A report from \nVA's Inspector General, issued just last week, shows how VA's unclear \nor outdated guidance hurts veterans, and how VA's proposed policy \nchanges work against efforts to help homeless veterans.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee and the \ndaughter of a World War II veteran, I'm proud that the bill I have \nintroduced today would permanently protect homeless veterans' access to \nhousing and services.\n  This bill makes it clear that our country takes care of those who \nhave served, and we don't allow bureaucracy to dictate who gets a roof \nover their head and who doesn't.\n  Many veterans struggle with mental illness, substance abuse, or \nsimply finding a steady job--all factors that can lead to homelessness.\n  And veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are increasingly \nbecoming homeless--numbers that will continue to increase in the coming \nyears unless help is available for them.\n  The idea that any of these veterans returning from service could \nbecome homeless because of these policies is unacceptable.\n  If we ever hope to end veteran homelessness we must do everything we \ncan to reach this goal, and I want to make\n\n[[Page S4957]]\n\nsure that VA's policies are moving us in that direction.\n  I don't just believe that the United States can do better; I believe \nwe must do better for those who've sacrificed so much for our country.\n  Finally I would like to thank Senator Hirono for cosponsoring this \nbill and being a champion of the men and women who have served our \ncountry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Carper, Mr. Cardin, Mr. \n        Brown, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Casey, Mr. Warner, Mr. Reid, Ms. Hirono, \n        Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Whitehouse, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Markey, \n        Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. \n        Leahy, Mr. Franken, Mr. Merkley, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. \n        Shaheen, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Heinrich, Mr. Schatz, Ms. Baldwin, \n        Mrs. Murray, Mr. Coons, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Heitkamp, Mr. Tester, \n        Mr. Booker, Mr. Reed, Mr. Kaine, Mr. Peters, Mr. Donnelly, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Udall, Mr. King, and Mr. Manchin):\n  S. 1740. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthat all provisions shall apply to legally married same-sex couples in \nthe same manner as other married couples, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, the Supreme Court handed down \na wonderful decision recognizing that all Americans have the right to \nmarry the man or woman they love. It was a triumphant movement in the \nmarch toward justice, one I was happy to celebrate at home with a group \nof Oregonians who were truly elated. In my remarks that morning, I \nsaid: Love won and there is more to be done.\n  So, today, along with 36 colleagues, I am introducing the Equal \nDignity for Married Taxpayers Act of 2015. What this legislation does \nis it removes each gender-specific reference to marriage from the Tax \nCode. Now, in his opinion for the Court, Justice Kennedy pointed out \nthe importance of providing equal dignity in the eyes of the law.\n  Our legislation enshrines that equal dignity and respect in our \nNation's tax laws by recognizing a new dawn of liberty for all \nAmericans. In my view, on a more symbolic level, this legislation is \none way to help close the door on an era when too many of our laws \ndenied equality to the LGBTQ community. In my view, this is a \nparticularly important step in the march toward justice. It is a \nstraightforward way to cement the recognition that all Americans share \ncertain unalienable rights--among them, life, liberty, and the pursuit \nof happiness.\n  I was proud to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act in the \nCongress 20 years ago and fight measure 36 a decade ago in Oregon. I \nhave always said--always said--that if you don't like gay marriage, \ndon't get one. This is fundamentally an issue of justice and of \nliberty. I hope all Americans take pride in the wave of acceptance and \nequality that has rolled across our land and this decision embodies.\n  This legislation now has 36 cosponsors. My hope is this body will \nsupport this proposal on a bipartisan basis. I look forward to working \nwith our colleagues to take this next step. It is a step toward the arc \nof justice--the arc of justice that says that all of us--all of us--\nhave to be free. All of us should enjoy true and full equality for all \nAmericans. I am very pleased 36 colleagues are joining me in this \nproposal this morning. I hope the Senate will pass it expeditiously on \na bipartisan basis.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, and Mr. Markey):\n  S. 1743. A bill to provide greater transparency, accountability, and \nsafety authority to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Motor Vehicle \nSafety Act of 2015. I introduce this bill with Senator Blumenthal, the \nRanking Member of the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product \nSafety, Insurance, and Data Security, as well as Senator Markey, a \nvalued Member of the Commerce Committee.\n  Takata airbags. GM ignition switches. Toyota unintended acceleration. \nBy now, we all know the tragic stories: automakers and suppliers hiding \ndangerous defects for years right under the nose of a weak, under-\nresourced regulator. The result? Scores of deaths, hundreds of \ninjuries, and millions of vehicles still under recall that are \nendangering lives both inside and outside the cars.\n  Every year, over 32,000 people die on our roadways--32,000 lives cut \nshort, 32,000 families without a loved one. Car accidents are by far \nthe top cause of accidental deaths. But it doesn't have to be this way. \nCongress can adopt practical solutions to help make cars safer and \nimprove the recall process and, in turn, save lives. That is exactly \nwhat this legislation is designed to do--to take the lessons we have \nlearned from exploding Takata airbags, defective GM ignition switches, \nand several other recent serious recalls to ensure that a company can \nnever again hide a lethal defects from the public, to improve the way \nwe recall dangerous cars, and to harness American innovation and \ningenuity to make vehicles safer.\n  Many of the concepts in today's bill are not new. Indeed, many of the \nprovisions in the bill have passed the Senate before with bipartisan \nsupport. The Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 2015 that Senators Blumenthal, \nMarkey, and I introduce today includes provisions from bills introduced \nby myself, Senators Blumenthal, Markey, Gillibrand, Schatz, Booker, and \nformer Chairman Rockefeller. Like the earlier bills, this legislation \nis predicated on improving four things: transparency, wrongdoer \naccountability, vehicle safety, and recall effectiveness.\n  First, government transparency. The Department of Transportation \nInspector General identified several problems with how NHTSA processes \nearly warning data. This bill seeks to help remedy those problems and \nincrease the transparency of the information the agency receives. For \nexample, the bill would require NHTSA to upgrade its online databases \nto improve searchability and to consider early warning data when \ninvestigating potential safety defects. The bill would also require \nNHTSA to disclose information submitted by manufacturers to NHTSA \nthrough the Early Warning Reporting system unless the information is \nexempt under FOIA. Finally, motor vehicle and equipment manufacturers \nwould have to automatically submit documentation that first alerted \nthem to a fatality involving their vehicle or equipment to NHTSA's \nEarly Warning Reporting database.\n  Second, wrongdoer accountability. The bill would remove the cap on \nNHTSA's civil penalty authority, which is currently at $35 million \nNHTSA's civil penalty authority must be bolstered to deter highly \nprofitable corporations from violating safety laws. Otherwise, we get \nwhat we have now: companies treating NHTSA's civil penalties as a mere \ncost of doing business. Just look at the GM case, where the maximum $35 \nmillion civil penalty represented less than 1/1000 of GM's quarterly \nrevenues, which is over $35 billion. In addition, the bill would impose \ncriminal penalties on corporate executives who knowingly conceal the \nfact that their product poses a danger of death or serious injury. \nCorporate executives who hide serious dangers from the public shouldn't \nget off the hook.\n  Third, vehicle safety. The bill would authorize NHTSA to conduct new \nresearch and implement life-saving standards to make vehicles safer. \nFor example, it would require large commercial trucks to have crash \navoidance technologies, and it would improve car hoods and bumpers to \nreduce pedestrian fatalities and injuries. The legislation also would \ntask NHTSA with evaluating whether technology exists to help prevent \nchildren from being left in hot cars. These changes just make sense, \nand they would save lives.\n  Lastly, recall effectiveness. The major lesson from the Takata, GM, \nand other defect debacles is that we need to improve the recall process \nso that unsafe vehicles get fixed as quickly as possible. This bill \nwould do just that by improving NHTSA's recall authority, asking \ndealers to adopt commonsense practices, and exploring new ways to\n\n[[Page S4958]]\n\nnotify consumers of recalls. First, the Motor Vehicle Safety Act of \n2015 would give NHTSA the authority to expedite recalls in the case of \nsubstantial likelihood of death or serious injury. Second, the \nlegislation would ensure that used car dealers fix cars under recall \nbefore selling them. The fact that used car dealers can still sell \nvehicles under recall without bothering to fix them is appalling--\nseveral individuals who died from exploding Takata airbags had \npurchased used cars that hadn't been fixed. My legislation would also \nrequire authorized dealers to check for open recalls when a car is \nbrought in for any service--something that should already be very quick \nand doable for dealers. Third, the bill would create grant programs to \nallow states to participate in the recall notification process by \nnotifying drivers of open recalls when the DMV sends registration \nrenewals. Finally, NHTSA would have promulgate a rule requiring new \nvehicles have a warning feature--similar to tire pressure monitor or \noil change light on the dashboard--that would notify consumers that \ntheir cars are subject to a safety recall. With innovations like backup \ncameras and connected cars, we've seen how technology improves safety. \nI am very excited about the possibility that technology can also ensure \nthat a driver knows his or her car is under recall and, as a result, \nprevent injuries and deaths from safety defects.\n  The American public demands that we do something meaningful to keep \nthem safe on the road. There will be more recalls in the future--it is \ninevitable. And the consequences can be deadly. But they don't have to \nbe. Improving the recall process can and will save lives. I realize our \nbill may not get us to l00 percent completion of recalls or perfect \nmotor vehicle safety, but I am confident that it would go a long way \ntowards improving recall effectiveness, adding practical safety \ntechnologies to vehicles, and making Americans safer on our nation's \nroads and highways.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Senators Blumenthal and Markey, for \nhelping me on this extremely important bill and for their dedication to \nmaking our roads safer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1743\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, \n     and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016 \n     (S. 1695, 114th Congress) (referred to in this section as\n\n[[Page S4976]]\n\n     the ``proposed appropriations Act''), as reported out of the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the Senate on June 25, 2015, \n     reduces investments in critical middle-class priorities by \n     $3,575,000,000, compared to the appropriation levels enacted \n     for fiscal year 2015.\n       (2) The proposed appropriations Act reduces investments in \n     critical middle-class priorities by $13,231,000,000, compared \n     to the Democratic funding alternative that is consistent with \n     pre-sequester funding levels provided in the Budget Control \n     Act of 2011 (Public Law 112-25; 125 Stat. 240).\n       (3) These funding cuts would bring Federal investments in \n     programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) to their lowest levels since \n     fiscal year 2002.\n       (4) Of the lowest-achieving 5 percent of schools that \n     receive funds under part A of title I of such Act (20 U.S.C. \n     6311 et seq.), about two-thirds of students do not meet grade \n     level standards.\n       (5) The proposed appropriations Act cuts funding for part A \n     of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311 et seq.) by $850,000,000, compared to \n     the President's fiscal year 2016 budget request and the \n     Democratic funding alternative offered in the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate.\n       (6) Research consistently shows that high-quality early \n     education is critical to the educational development of every \n     child.\n       (7) The proposed appropriations Act provides no funding for \n     preschool development grants, a cut of $750,000,000 compared \n     to the President's fiscal year 2016 budget request and the \n     Democratic funding alternative offered in Committee.\n       (8) The education funding cuts in the proposed \n     appropriations Act are largely the result of the artificial \n     and arbitrary spending caps triggered by the lack of a \n     bipartisan budget agreement as envisioned by the Budget \n     Control Act of 2011 (Public Law 112-25; 125 Stat. 240).\n       (9) Congress has previously provided relief from these cuts \n     in the form of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (Public Law \n     113-67; 127 Stat. 1165), which provided relief from \n     sequestration equally for defense and nondefense investments \n     for fiscal years 2014 and 2015.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the fiscal and economic challenges of the United States \n     are a top priority for Congress, and the deep, automatic \n     budget cuts of sequestration remains an unreasonable and \n     inadequate budgeting tool either to address the deficits and \n     debt of the Nation or provide the resources needed to educate \n     our children and grow the economy;\n       (2) this Act was supported unanimously in Committee;\n       (3) fulfilling the promise of this Act will require \n     Congress to provide funding at levels above sequestration;\n       (4) Congress should immediately begin negotiations on a \n     successor to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (Public Law \n     113-67; 127 Stat. 1165) that provides equal relief from \n     sequestration for defense and nondefense investments, \n     including education, for fiscal year 2016 and beyond; and\n       (5) for fiscal year 2016, Congress should provide \n     $18,554,875,000 for key programs under the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 and other education programs, \n     as amended by this Act and consistent with the pre-sequester \n     funding levels called for by the bipartisan Budget Control \n     Act of 2011 (Public Law 112-25; 125 Stat. 240), including--\n       (A) programs under part A of title I of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965;\n       (B) the striving readers comprehensive literacy program \n     under part E of title I of such Act, as such Act was in \n     effect on the day before the date of enactment of this Act, \n     or its successor;\n       (C) the 21st century community learning centers program \n     under part B of title IV of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965;\n       (D) English language acquisition grants under title III of \n     such Act;\n       (E) preschool development grants under title XIV of \n     division A of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of \n     2009 (Public Law 112-10); and\n       (F) investing in innovation grants under such title.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2204.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Many manufacturers and consumers prefer to have the \n     option to provide or receive warranty information online.\n       (2) Modernizing warranty notification rules is necessary to \n     allow the United States to continue to compete globally in \n     manufacturing, trade, and the development of consumer \n     products connected to the Internet.\n       (3) Allowing an electronic warranty option would expand \n     consumer access to relevant consumer information in an \n     environmentally friendly way, and would provide additional \n     flexibility to manufacturers to meet their labeling and \n     warranty requirements.\n\n     SEC. 3.
