Mr. President, when Washington Democrats passed \nObamaCare over the objections of the American people, they were \nconfident Americans would soon warm up to this new law, but more than 5 \nyears later, the American people continue to oppose this unprecedented \nDemocratic attack on their health care. Is it any wonder? When \nAmericans think ObamaCare, they think increased costs, runaway \npremiums, surging deductibles, and tax hikes on the middle class. When \nAmericans think ObamaCare, they think decreased choice, fewer doctors, \nfar-away hospitals, and a frightening scarcity of options for too many \nwhen they get sick. When Americans think ObamaCare, they think broken \npromises and endless failure, imploding State-based exchanges, \ncollapsing co-ops, insurers eyeing the exit door, fewer jobs, and the \nlie of the year: If you like your health care plan, you can keep it. It \nis not as though ObamaCare's structural failures are just going to go \naway. They are baked right into the law. They only seem to get worse as \ntime moves along.\n  Just as we have seen costs rise, choices narrow, and failures mount, \nwe have seen congressional Democrats block attempts to start over with \nreal health care reform. Well, this week we finally have a chance to \nvote to end ObamaCare's cycle of broken promises and failures with just \n51 votes. This week we will take up the Restoring Americans' Healthcare \nFreedom Reconciliation Act of 2015 that already passed the House of \nRepresentatives. It is a bill that will take the first steps necessary \nto build a bridge away from ObamaCare. By building upon the House's \ngood work, this bill will also save billions in spending and eliminate \nmore than a $1 trillion tax burden on the American people.\n  By employing the same tactics Democrats used to help get ObamaCare \nacross the finish line, this bill will not be subject to a filibuster. \nIn other words, it cannot be blocked by defenders of ObamaCare's failed \nstatus quo. In other words, the President cannot be shielded from the \nweighty decision he will finally have to make when this measure lands \nright on his desk. When the President picks up his pen, he will have a \nreal choice to make. He may decide to stick to his rhetoric that the \nlaw is working better than even he intended and veto the bill, but he \nshould instead decide to finally stand with the middle class that has \nsuffered enough from this failed law and actually sign it. We will see. \nIt is a choice the President has never faced before. It is a choice he \nis going to face after Senate action this week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8197-6", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8197-S8198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE NEW SENATE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on another matter, the new Republican \nSenate has been working hard to get Congress back to work over the past \nyear. We have obviously had a lot of success. As I noted yesterday, the \nnew Republican Senate will soon pass two very significant bipartisan \nbills for a second and final time: the bipartisan multiyear highway \nbill and the bipartisan replacement for No Child Left Behind. We will \nsend them to the President for his signature.\n  These are the latest examples of a new Congress that is back to work \non behalf of the American people. They are hardly the only examples we \nwill be talking about. Take another important issue that languished for \ntoo long but passed the new Senate: cyber security. By a vote of 74 to \n21, we ended years of Senate inaction on this issue by passing an \nimportant bipartisan cyber security bill that even the White House has \nendorsed. That bill was the product of a lot of hard work by the top \nRepublican and the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. I am \nglad that the new, more open, and more inclusive Republican Senate made \ntheir cooperation possible because even though the old forces of \ngridlock tried to trip that bill up several times along the way, we \nkept moving forward, and we always knew we were doing the right thing \nfor the American people.\n\n[[Page S8198]]\n\n  My hope is that we can ultimately get this bill into conference and \nsend it to the President closer to its current form because the \nchallenges posed by cyber attacks are real and they are growing. A \ncyber attack can be a deeply invasive attack on personal privacy. The \nvoluntary information sharing provisions in the bill we passed are key \nto defeating cyber attacks and protecting the personal information of \nthe people we represent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8198-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my friend the Republican leader has an \nobsession with the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare. He cannot give up on \nthis obsession. The share of Americans without insurance is at the \nlowest point in history. And one need look no further than renowned \nRepublican--Republican--columnist of the New York Times, David Brooks. \nHere is what he wrote. I am sorry to take so much time reading \nsomething that was written by this man who is a Republican columnist \nfor the New York Times. Here is what he said. Regardless of what the \nRepublican leader may claim, the Affordable Care Act continues to work. \nIt is increasing quality health care coverage and improving care, and \nthere is no question about that. Brooks noted that health care costs \nare rising at the lowest rate in years. He said:\n\n       The good news is that recently health care inflation has \n     been at historic lows. As Jason Furman, the chairman of \n     President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, put it in a \n     speech to the Hamilton Project last month, ``Health care \n     prices have grown at an annual rate of 1.6 percent since the \n     Affordable Care Act was enacted in March 2010, the slowest \n     rate for such a period in five decades--\n\n  Fifty years--\n\n     and those prices have grown at an even slower 1.1 percent \n     rate over the 12 months ending in August 2015.''\n       As a result of the slowdown in health care inflation, the \n     Congressional Budget Office keeps reducing its projections of \n     the future cost of federal health programs like Medicare. As \n     of October, projections for federal health care spending in \n     the year 2020 were $175 billion lower than projections made \n     in August 2010. That would be a huge budget improvement.\n\n  ``Historic lows'' and hundreds of billions of dollars saved by the \nFederal Government tell me that ObamaCare is working.\n  Enough of this haranguing about ObamaCare from my Republican friend. \nOne need only go home and people come up to you and say: You know, \nObamaCare is so good.\n  My daughter, who could never get health insurance because she was a \ndiabetic--now she can get it. No one with a preexisting disability can \nbe denied insurance. Young men and women struggling to finish their \ncollege education can stay on their parents' health insurance until age \n26. That is important. That is part of ObamaCare. Community health \ncenters around this country are booming. Why? Because of the Affordable \nCare Act, we put $11 billion in there to provide for those essential \ncommunity health centers.\n  I will have more to say about this because I am sure the Republican \nleader is going to come and talk about what a great victory it was on \nthis reconciliation, which is an anomaly that we face every year. They \nare passing something that is just to satisfy the haranguing about \nObamaCare. It means nothing substantively. It will pass and go to the \nPresident. He will veto it in about 10 seconds, and, of course, the \nveto will certainly be sustained.\n  Even in Kentucky--here is what one article said in Kentucky:\n\n       In a state of 4.4 million people, 500,000 people gained \n     coverage because of [ObamaCare in that State]--4 in 5 through \n     Medicaid. The effects were particularly dramatic in one \n     Appalachian county, where many coal jobs have vanished and \n     the poverty rate is 23 percent. From 2013 to 2014, the \n     proportion of residents lacking health coverage plummeted by \n     half--from 13 percent to 6.6 percent.\n\n  Half a million Kentuckians are using the Affordable Care Act. That is \nmore than 10 percent of the State's population.\n  There are all kinds of personal accounts of how this has literally \nsaved people's lives. One account is of an uninsured mother and \ndaughter. This is from a news article:\n\n       Amid the coal fields of eastern Kentucky, a small clinic \n     that is part of the Big Sandy Health Care network furnishes \n     daily proof of this state's full embrace of the Affordable \n     Care Act.\n       It was here that Mindy Fleming handed a wad of tissues to \n     Tiffany Coleman when she arrived, sleepless and frantic, with \n     no health insurance and a daughter suffering a 103-fever and \n     mysterious pain. ``It will be all right,'' Fleming assured \n     her, and it was. An hour later, Coleman had a WellCare card \n     that paid for hospital tests, which found that 4-year-old \n     Alexsis had an unusual bladder problem.\n\n  Quoting another Washington Post story:\n\n       [Dennis Blackburn] has a hereditary liver disorder, \n     numbness in his hands and legs, back pain from folding his 6-\n     foot-1-inch frame into 29-inch mine shafts as a young man, \n     plus an abnormal heart rhythm--the likely vestige of having \n     been struck by lightning 15 years ago in his tin-roofed \n     farmhouse.\n       Blackburn was making small payments on an MRI he'd gotten \n     at Pikeville Medical Center, the only hospital in a 150-mile \n     radius, when he heard about Big Sandy's Shelby Valley Clinic. \n     There he met Fleming, who helped him sign up for one of the \n     managed-care Medicaid plans available in Kentucky.\n\n  So the facts never seem to get in the way of my Republican friend \nwhen it comes to ObamaCare--anything he could do to denigrate this \nsystem that is helping 17 million people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8198-4", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8198-S8200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, one need only watch the news to see how our \nNation is facing threats abroad. We are doing the best we can, but as \nthe world grows more dangerous, Senate Republicans continue to block \nand obstruct the President's national security. They are blocking the \nvery people who could help us respond to these threats.\n  Take, for instance--for week after week after week--Azita Raji, who \nhas been nominated to be our Ambassador to Sweden. Nearly 300 Swedish \ncitizens have left to fight in Syria or Iraq, making this nation the \nsecond largest country of origin per capita for foreign fighters in \nEurope. The Swedish Government is on heightened alert for an attack. \nYet the United States doesn't have a Senate-confirmed Ambassador to \nrepresent us in Stockholm.\n  Similar to Sweden, Norway is also dealing with the growing threat of \nterror, and some of their citizens have joined the radical ranks of \nforeign fighters, but due to Republican obstruction, our Nation does \nnot have a confirmed Ambassador in Norway.\n  Sam Heins, a Minnesota attorney nominated by President Obama, has \nbeen pending on the floor since July. We are now in December. So I \npersonally applaud the Presiding Officer today for finally removing the \nholds on these two good people. I appreciate it very much. He and \nothers have held up these nominees, and it is unfortunate. It is gone. \nI am pleased. In the wake of the Paris attacks and threats across the \ncontinent, it is imperative that we have Ambassadors working with \nEuropean governments at the highest levels.\n  Perhaps the most egregious example of Republican obstruction is the \nnomination of Adam Szubin. This man would lead--if he were approved in \nthe Senate--a team within the Department of State that disrupts \nterrorist financing networks, cutting off money for terrorists so they \ncannot finance their attacks. Hand in hand, they work with the Treasury \nDepartment. You would think that such an important nominee would be \nquickly confirmed, but Mr. Szubin's nomination has been pending\n\n[[Page S8199]]\n\nfor more than 200 days. Remember what he does--remember what he would \nlike to do, I should say. He would lead a team that disrupts terrorist \nfinancing networks, cutting off money for terrorists so they can't \nfinance their own evil deeds.\n  The chairman of the banking committee, the senior Senator from \nAlabama, has previously called this position ``a vital position in the \neffort to combat terrorist financing,'' but in spite of this, the \ncommittee on banking continues to block Szubin, despite his \nqualifications. I am sorely disappointed so many Republican Senators \nhave decided that scoring political points is more important than \nconfirming these national security nominations.\n  Two weeks ago, I asked the senior Senator from Iowa to put an end to \nhis partisan investigation of Secretary Clinton. For months, the senior \nSenator blocked more than 20 Foreign Service promotions. In fact, for a \nday it was some 600 nominations, just simply people who were in the \nForeign Service who were entitled by law to a promotion. Well, he \nblocked these people for a long time, talking about how he wanted more \ndocuments from the State Department. I told the senior Senator that I \nthought it was a mistake to target career promotions, so I was \nsurprised, happily so, when he appeared to change course and allow \nthese good public servants to get the promotions they earned and \ndeserved.\n  Unfortunately, though, just as he took one step forward, he \nimmediately took another step back. Although he allowed the list of 20 \nForeign Service promotions to proceed, he doubled down on his \nobstruction by placing a hold on Tom Shannon, President Obama's nominee \nto serve as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, an \nextremely important position that is not filled now. Ambassador Shannon \nis a career member of the Foreign Service, with more than 30 years of \nexperience. He served as our Nation's Ambassador to Brazil, he worked \non the National Security Council in the last Bush administration, and \nhis experience will help the State Department strategy in combatting \nISIS, but he can't do that because we were not able to approve him \nbecause of the holds.\n  The Senator from Iowa continues to block other important nominees, \nsuch as David Robinson to be Assistant Secretary of State in the Bureau \nof Conflict and Stabilization. He is a 30-year veteran of the Foreign \nService. This is a man who has served the Nation in Afghanistan, \nBosnia, and many other places around the world.\n  Brian Egan has been nominated to be the State Department Legal \nAdvisor, their lawyer. He has been a senior member of the legal team in \nthe State Department, Treasury, and the National Security Council at \nthe White House, but he has been held up since June without a vote, all \nbecause of Republican obstructionism.\n  Remember, it would be nice if the State Department had a lawyer, but \nas the senior Senator from Iowa will tell you, he has nothing against \nTom Shannon, David Robinson or Brian Egan. Senator Grassley has \nexpressed no substantive objections to these nominees or questions \nabout their capabilities. Senator Grassley is blocking these important \nnominations for the sake of his committee's political crusade against \nformer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton--who as we all know is \nrunning for President. This good woman scares Republicans because she \nwill likely win. It is all part of the disturbing trend of the \nJudiciary Committee to politicize the oversight process.\n  It appears the constitutional duties of the Senate are taking a \nbackseat to a political hit job on a Democratic candidate for \nPresident. Just look at what he and his committee are doing; that is, \nthe chairman and his committee. They are requesting transcribed \ninterviews from the Clinton staff. They have asked for timesheets. The \ncommittee investigation has gone so far as to ask for the maternity \nleave records of one of Secretary Clinton's closest aides, Huma Abedin. \nIt appears that until the senior Senator from Iowa gets the maternity \nleave records he has requested and everything else he has requested, he \nis going to continue to block State Department nominees. I am \ndisappointed my friend from Iowa refuses to do what I believe is the \nright thing. He should drop these unwarranted holds. I am disappointed \nhe continues--under the guise of oversight--his anti-Hillary Clinton \ncrusade, which is hurting American security. Each day this \ninvestigation continues, we can see what a waste of taxpayer resources \nthis has become.\n  Last month, when given the opportunity, my friend from Iowa refused \nto address the significant amount of resources his committee is \nspending to investigate Secretary Clinton. Why? If he is so confident \nof the work his committee is doing, why not readily acknowledge the \namount of taxpayer resources that are being used? But aside from the \nwasting of taxpayer dollars, I am troubled by the way his committee \nstaff is operating. The press reports have suggested the Republican \nJudiciary Committee staffers are selectively leaking confidential \ninformation. For example, in September, the State Department gave the \ncommittee information that Senator Grassley requested, with specific \ninstructions that the documents remain confidential. That is because \nthe information shared with the Judiciary Committee contains sensitive \ninformation or other personal information from State Department \nemployees. Included in the State Department's response to Senator \nGrassley was a big warning in bold capital letters across the page--in \nvery large bold letters: ``US DEPARTMENT OF STATE PRODUCTION TO THE \nSENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ONLY; NOT AUTHORIZED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE.''\n  The email reproductions from the State Department also contained a \nwatermark in red capital letters saying the emails were not for public \nrelease. It was across the entirety of that document. It had the \nwatermark and the large bold letters.\n  Within 24 hours, that information was public and reporters began \ncalling with questions. Within 48 hours, stories were published based \non the emails given to the Judiciary Committee that falsely created the \nappearance of impropriety by Ms. Abedin--and I mean false. A reporter \nforwarded the watermark emails meant only for the Judiciary Committee \nto her and to her legal team for comment. How did the reporter get \ndocuments that were solely in the possession of the Judiciary Committee \nstaff?\n  As I have said before, Ms. Abedin is an American success story. She \nhas reached the highest levels of politics, as an aide to Secretary \nClinton for decades, through her hard work and loyalty. Senator John \nMcCain said that Ms. Abedin is ``an honorable woman, a dedicated \nAmerican, and a loyal public servant.'' She doesn't deserve the \ntreatment that has come from the Judiciary Committee. Republican \ninvestigators on that committee cannot stop their fixation on Ms. \nAbedin, even going so far to request her maternity leave records. As a \nresult, her personal information, including Social Security number and \npayroll records, has been given to the press.\n  Violating the privacy of hard-working staff members--and in \nparticular a staff member--to score political points against Secretary \nClinton is unbecoming of the world's greatest deliberative body. The \nSenate has been through difficult times in the past when confidential \ninformation has been leaked. Senator Grassley and I were both here in \nthe 1990s when then-Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell came to the \nfloor to address this disturbing trend. He said:\n\n       The unilateral decision by a Member or employee to release \n     confidential committee information is inconsistent with the \n     Senate's practice of making such decisions openly and \n     collaboratively. Arrogation of this responsibility by \n     individuals can destroy mutual trust among Members and be \n     harmful to this institution.\n\n  That is an understatement. Senator Mitchell's quote gets to the heart \nof the matter. Leaking information undermines the institution of the \nSenate and the trust between its Members. In the Republican fervor to \ntarget Secretary Clinton over Benghazi, we should not lose sight of the \nrules that govern our behavior in the Senate. The Benghazi report on \nher is now over $5 million. It is wrong to target a former Clinton aide \nwith invasive requests about her maternity leave and pass her personal \ninformation on to members of the press.\n  It is wrong to politicize the legitimate oversight role of Congress \nahead\n\n[[Page S8200]]\n\nof the 2016 Presidential election. Sadly, the improper disclosure of \nsensitive materials related to Secretary Clinton's aides only \ndemonstrates the underlying political position of the Judiciary \nCommittee's oversight. Going forward, I hope my Republican colleagues \nwill exercise greater restraint in the relentless pursuit of Secretary \nClinton, but, more importantly, I hope Senate Republicans take their \nconstitutional responsibility more seriously to offer their advice and \nconsent on the Presidential nominees. I hope they take them very \nseriously. It is shameful that the Republicans are blocking critical, \nnational security nominees for political purposes. I would ask them to \nplease change course because the American people are watching.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8200-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ROSA PARKS AND MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 60 years ago today Rosa Parks boarded a city \nbus in Montgomery, AL. She had worked hard all day. She was riding a \nbus. She was asked to give up her seat by the busdriver, who was a \nWhite man. She was sick of having to give up her seat and she was \ntired, but she refused to give up her seat, so she was arrested.\n  On that day at that moment of courage, Rosa Parks sparked a movement \nthat would end the legal segregation of public transportation, the \nMontgomery Bus Boycott. That boycott lasted from December 5, 1955, to \nDecember 20, 1956--almost 1 year, becoming the first large-scale \ndemonstration against segregation in our country's history. The Supreme \nCourt ultimately ordered Montgomery to integrate its public bus \ntransportation system.\n  Rosa Parks went on to become a pillar of the civil rights movement, a \nlifelong freedom fighter who changed the course of history.\n  In 2013, a bronze statue of Ms. Parks was unveiled in Statuary Hall \nin the Capitol. In the decades since Rosa Parks refused to give up her \nseat on that bus, our Nation has made tremendous progress in the \ndefense of civil rights for all Americans, but we have much more to do. \nToday, 60 years after Rosa Parks took a stand for equality, the fight \nfor equal justice rages on. Just like Rosa Parks, many Americans across \nthis country are very upset with the status quo, and they are taking a \nstand against injustice and discrimination.\n  As we remember the valiant actions of Rosa Parks, may we be inspired \nby her character and her determination. May we follow her example and \ncontinue the work of the civil rights movement.\n  Mr. President, what do we have the rest of the day?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8200-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

COUSINS\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, last Thursday was Thanksgiving in \nAmerica. Like every Member of the Senate and every American, I paused \nto give thanks for the many blessings we have in the country, the \nblessings I have as a father and grandfather, and the blessings we \nenjoy from all those who serve in harm's way around the world who keep \nus safe and in peace.\n  I also took a second to participate in some charitable activities for \nthose less fortunate and, in doing so, stopped to pause and give thanks \nfor those people who on the day of Thanksgiving were giving of their \ntime and their money to make the lives of those less fortunate better.\n  One of the people in my State I want to talk about who has done \nexactly that for five decades is a man by the name of Thomas G. \nCousins, a real estate developer greatly renowned in Atlanta and, \nreally, around the world, and who amassed millions and millions of \ndollars in the Cousins Foundation and invested that money in trying to \nsolve the problems of poverty, crime, unemployment, and health care.\n  Thomas G. Cousins founded the Cousins Foundation to see to it that \nAtlanta, GA, and the State of Georgia were a better State. But he \nbecame frustrated. He recognized that of the 72 million children in the \nUnited States of America, 40 percent of them lived in poverty. He \nbecame frustrated because he found that isolated neighborhoods of \nconcentrated poverty created unemployment, poor performance by \nstudents, and greater crime rates in the city of Atlanta. Worst of all, \nhe found that the entrepreneurial gifts of charity trying to alleviate \nthese problems often got consumed but never made a fundamental change. \nHe thought it was time for his charitable money to become \nentrepreneurial, not just a giveaway. So in the decade of 1990, Tom \nCousins decided to do something about making the Cousins Foundation \ninvestment make a meaningful difference in the lives of Americans \naround the country. He did exactly that.\n  He heard Dr. Todd Clear, a professor at Rutgers University, give a \nspeech in New York City, where he had done research on the prison \npopulation of the State of New York and researched where they came from \nto find, amazingly, that three out of every four prisoners in the New \nYork State prison system came out of eight neighborhoods in New York \nCity. Concentrated poverty created concentrated crime and concentrated \ncriminals. There was a never-ending cycle of crime, poverty, and poor \neducational performance in those neighborhoods.\n  So Tom Cousins decided that, instead of giving his money away in \nsmall, incremental bits to make a minor difference, he would become a \ncharitable entrepreneur. He would go to a neighborhood of concentrated \ncrime and poverty and try to make a meaningful difference. He found a \nneighborhood called East Lake Meadows in the 1990s in Atlanta, GA. It \nwas the home of Bobby Jones and Charlie Yates, famous golfers of the \n1920s, but had gone to seed, was dilapidated, and became a neighborhood \nof crime. In fact, it had become known as the Little Vietnam of \nGeorgia. Police would not enter the area because of the crime rate. \nDrew Elementary School was the worst performing elementary school in \nthe State of Georgia.\n  Tom Cousins came to the State board of education--and I know this \nbecause I was the chairman--and asked us to go to the city of Atlanta \nto get them to issue a charter for Drew Elementary School and a 99-year \nlease to the Cousins Foundation. Tom Cousins went in and built a new \nDrew Elementary School, hired Georgia State University to bring in a \nprofessor to be the principal there and manage the education of those \nchildren. Drew Elementary School went from being one of the worst \nperforming schools in the State of Georgia to one of the best.\n  But he didn't stop with the school. He improved the neighborhood. He \nimproved the facilities. He built a YMCA. He took a holistic approach \nto East Lake Meadows and turned it into a shining city once again in \nthe State of Georgia. But he didn't do it just because he gave money. \nHe did it because he invested his money in the lives of these people.\n  I will give some idea of the changes made in East Lake Meadows and \nDrew Elementary School. Drew Elementary went from 5 percent of its \nfifth graders reading and performing in math levels where they should, \nto where 90 percent of the fifth graders exceeded the math standards of \nthe State of Georgia. Where the median income of the families in East \nLake Meadows was $4,536 when Tom Cousins went in, 15 years later it was \n$17,260. There was a 90-percent reduction in the crime rate, to the \npoint where it was 50 percent lower than the city's overall crime rate. \nHe transformed the neighborhood because he invested his money \nentrepreneurially in trying to solve the problems and the poverty of \nthese people.\n  He went to Warren Buffett, a leading entrepreneur of America, and \nformed a new organization called Purpose Built Communities, which is \nbased on three fundamental discoveries they made at East Lake Meadows. \nNo. 1, it can be done. How many times have people walked by declining \nneighborhoods of poverty, crime, and failing schools, and said: There \nis nothing we can do; we\n\n[[Page S8201]]\n\ncannot solve that problem. Tom Cousins proved that any problem, no \nmatter how great, is solvable if you are willing to dedicate yourself \nto doing so.\n  Second, it takes a holistic approach--not just schools, not just \nplaygrounds, not just housing, not just jobs but everything. The \ntransformation of East Lake Meadows was a holistic approach for the \nentire community. Lastly, mixed-income housing was important to bring \nemployed people back into the neighborhood. So they had mixed-use \nhousing all throughout East Lake Meadows.\n  The result was a purpose-built community that is now home to the PGA \nFedEx Championship, a restored East Lake Golf Club, and a community \nthat is proud of itself and one of the shining stars of the city of \nAtlanta.\n  Because a man with purpose, Thomas G. Cousins, invested his money, \npublic purpose-built communities are now all over the country being \nstarted as renovation projects in Indianapolis, New Orleans, and in \ncities around the United States of America.\n  So we should all pause to give thanks for those who have done so much \nto make our States and our country better. I pause to thank Thomas G. \nCousins for the great investment he made in the city of Atlanta, the \nchildren of our State, and the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week the Republican-led Senate will \nkeep a promise we made to the American people. If they entrusted us \nwith the leadership and the majority in the last election, we told them \nwe would vote to repeal ObamaCare--the largest Federal overreach in \nrecent history. It has been disastrous to thousands, if not millions, \nof people.\n  Unfortunately, the President's ill-advised health care law and the \npartisan push that made it law came with a lot of burdensome \nregulations. Both the law and those regulations have hobbled the \nAmerican economy because they simply added additional burdens onto the \nsmall businesses that we depend upon to create the jobs so people can \nfind work and provide for their families. It has hobbled those small \nbusinesses by burdening them with unmanageable costs, and it has failed \nthe American people at every turn.\n  When the President said ``If you like what you have you can keep \nit,'' that was not true. Millions of Americans lost their preferred \nhealth insurance providers and the doctors who accepted that coverage. \nInstead of providing people with more affordable access to health care, \nmillions of people faced higher premiums and higher deductibles. For \nall practical matters, the higher deductibles that come along with most \nObamaCare health care policies make millions of Americans effectively \nself-insured.\n  More than 5 years after it became law, it is no surprise that a \nrecent poll found that only 37 percent of the respondents approved of \nObamaCare. ObamaCare is a textbook example of how bigger government \ndoes not necessarily lead to more choices or real solutions. Indeed, \nwhat it demonstrates is that it can lead to higher costs, inefficient \nhealth care delivery, and millions of Americans being let down by a \nsystem that was a partisan vote here in the Senate.\n  I remember being here on Christmas Eve in 2009 at 7 o'clock in the \nmorning when Senate Democrats pushed through the ObamaCare legislation \nin the Senate. Again, without any sort of bipartisan commitment to \nactually improve health care choices and make health care more \naffordable for the American people, it was purely a partisan \nundertaking.\n  This bill that we are voting on to repeal ObamaCare will not only \nprovide relief and more choices and the opportunity for the market to \ngive people the health care they want at a price they can afford, but \nit also represents keeping a promise we made to the American people \nthat we would deliver on if they gave us the majority. We will do that \nthis week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8201-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8201-S8202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               HUMANE ACT\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, there is another subject I want to raise \nbecause it is a matter of great concern. It is not only because I come \nfrom Texas and we see thousands and thousands of unaccompanied minor \nchildren continuing to cross our border, but you will recall in the \nsummer of 2014, I believe the President himself talked about the \nhumanitarian crisis as a result of the thousands and thousands of \nunaccompanied children--some with a single parent--who were streaming \nacross the border in an overload of the capacity of local communities \nin the Rio Grande Valley and elsewhere to be able to deal with these \nchildren in a humane and acceptable sort of way.\n  While the memory here in Washington, DC, may have faded about this \nhumanitarian crisis, I can tell you that most Texans remember it \nvividly. The picture was stark: tens of thousands of unaccompanied \nchildren coming from Central American countries that had set out to \ncross Mexico and to cross the border into the United States. Virtually \nall of these children had seen their lives placed in the hands of \nviolent criminals to get here. To say the journey was a perilous one is \na gross understatement.\n  We recently had a hearing of the international drug enforcement \ncaucus in the Senate. I asked one of the witnesses: Isn't it the case \nthat the same criminal organizations that smuggle people into the \nUnited States for economic reasons are the same people who smuggle \nchildren for human trafficking purposes, that these are the same people \nand the same organizations that smuggle illegal drugs and perhaps \ndangerous and other hazardous materials into the United States? Without \nhesitation, the witness said yes.\n  It may have been some bygone era when an individual coyote, as we \ncall them in South Texas, smuggled people in for the fee they could \ncharge, but now this is big business. This is a business model that is \nbeing exploited day in and day out by the transnational criminal \norganizations, but that all seems to be lost on the administration.\n  I saw how this tragedy was unfolding firsthand in McAllen where I \nvisited these children who made the journey--sometimes alone--only to \nend up here in this country by themselves, looking for a friendly face \nor somebody who might help them. It was heartbreaking to see young \nchildren without their parents and extremely heartbreaking to hear the \nhorrific stories about the trips they made. Again, coming from Central \nAmerica, across Mexico, perhaps on the back of a train they called The \nBeast, physically assaulted, some murdered and many robbed and \notherwise mistreated.\n  The pressing question in that summer of 2014 was, Why now and why \nhere? Why was all of this happening? How could we stem the tide of this \nseemingly endless migration of unaccompanied children from Central \nAmerica?\n  You don't have to look much further than the President's own \nDepartment of Homeland Security. One internal memo analyzing the surge \nof child and female migrants flooding the southwest border stated: \n``The main reason the subjects chose this particular time to migrate to \nthe United States was to take advantage of the `new' U.S. `Law' that \ngrants a `free pass' or permit.'' I think they call them permisos in \nSpanish. In other words, they came here because of the widespread \nperception that these unaccompanied children and women traveling with \nchildren would be allowed to stay here in defiance of our immigration \nlaws, even after they crossed the border illegally.\n  A similar study by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of \nScience and Technology Directorate concluded that the unaccompanied \nminors ``are aware of the relative lack of consequences they will \nreceive when apprehended at the U.S. border.'' Apparently, at the time, \nthese minors and their parents believed there would be no or little \nconsequence to illegally\n\n[[Page S8202]]\n\ncoming into the United States, and tragically, sadly, they were right.\n  In the wake of that crisis last summer, it became clear that the \nPresident's failed immigration policies, including his deferred action \nprogram and his overall lack of seriousness when it came to immigration \nenforcement, played a role in inducing thousands of families to risk \ntheir lives to travel to the United States.\n  Until recently, we had perhaps been lulled into the misconception \nthat this flood of migrants had stopped. But over the weekend, I was \nstartled by news reports--perhaps I shouldn't have been surprised but I \nwas--that suggest this downward trend has started to reverse and in a \nbig way. According to these reports, smugglers were again bringing \nhundreds of women and children into the United States across the Rio \nGrande.\n  One from the New York Times noted that according to official data, \n``border Patrol apprehensions of migrant families . . . have increased \n150 percent'' from last year. The number of unaccompanied children has \nmore than doubled.\n  The bottom line is that, clearly, there is virtually nothing being \ndone to deter these children and their families from illegally crossing \nthe border and little or no consequences when they do.\n  I have to point out that the administration has done virtually \nnothing to make sure these children are not exposed to the same \ncriminal organizations operating in this country. In fact, current law \nrequires these children to be released by the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to sponsors without any assurance or systemic \nprotections that they are being sent to a safe environment. There are \nno criminal background checks. They are not required to be actual \nfamily members, and they could well be some extension of the same \ncriminal organizations that smuggled them into the United States in the \nfirst place.\n  It is shocking to me that the Senate would not be moved to act on \nthis because, of course, we passed a large anti-human trafficking law \nthis last spring with a 99-to-0 vote. But to sit quietly while these \nchildren continue to stream across our border and are placed in the \nhands of potentially dangerous individuals is unacceptable.\n  Earlier this year, four individuals were indicted for their \ninvolvement in a trafficking ring that smuggled unaccompanied \nGuatemalan children into the country and forced them into slave labor \nat a farm in Ohio. These children were not only forced to work long \nhours, but they were abused and threatened and exploited. Many of them \ncould have been spared if the Federal Government and Health and Human \nServices had an adequate system for screening and vetting the sponsors \nof these unaccompanied minors.\n  We have to do a better job of protecting these children, which is why \nI recently joined a letter with the chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee demanding answers from the Department of Homeland Security \nand the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  It is clear that the Federal Government needs to step up and create a \nmore effective review process before releasing these children to \nstrangers and perhaps criminals. Our government has a duty to protect \nthem once they are here and to ensure that they are no longer preyed \nupon by criminals and human traffickers.\n  Given the administration's inability to deter illegal immigration and \nthe Federal Government's failure to deal with them reasonably, \nrationally, and humanely when they get here, we have every reason to \nbelieve that illegal immigration surges of this nature will continue \nand will grow until we reform this system. That is why I intend to \nintroduce a piece of legislation called the HUMANE Act, which will \nreform the system to end the practice of automatic catch-and-release to \nnongovernmental sponsors. It would enhance the screening of these \nchildren to determine if they are victims of crime or in need of some \nspecialized care. It will make sure they get a swift and fair court \ndetermination on whether or not they are eligible for any protected \nstatus under our immigration laws.\n  The HUMANE Act would also help ensure that if these children are in \nneed of humanitarian assistance, they will never be released to sex \noffenders, criminals, or others who will seek to harm them. Of course, \npreventing these surges is not just a humanitarian issue; it is a \nnational security issue as well. By tying up our law enforcement, \ncustoms, and other security officials with humanitarian care \nobligations, the cartels and other transnational criminal organizations \ncreate an environment where it is much easier to traffic drugs, \nweapons, and other contraband.\n  We know there are increasing ties between terrorist organizations and \ndrug cartels, so the threat that they will work together to exploit \nanother humanitarian crisis is very real. For instance, last year \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee, SOUTHCOM's commander, John \nKelly, stated that he was ``troubled by the financial and operational \noverlap between criminal and terrorist networks in the [Central \nAmerican] region.''\n  He went on to say: ``Although the extent of criminal-terrorist \ncooperation is unclear, what is clear is that terrorists and militant \norganizations easily tap into the international illicit marketplace to \nunderwrite their activities and obtain arms and funding to conduct \noperations.''\n  I am not just talking about economic migrants. I am talking about \nimmigrants from around the world who can potentially get through our \nsouthern border virtually at will. I am talking about transnational \ncriminal organizations determined to spread violence and import \nnarcotics into the United States.\n  I hope the administration will take these most recent reports \nseriously, before we experience once again the horrifying humanitarian \ndisaster we experienced in 2014. But nothing short of real improvements \nto border security and our laws will work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to call for urgent action to \nprevent widespread violence and mass atrocities in Burundi. Let us not \nallow Burundi to become the next Rwanda or Darfur. We are at a critical \njuncture. I call upon the Burundian Government and opposition to \nrespect the spirit of the 2000 Arusha agreement and immediately stop \nall violence, disarm militias, including youth militia aligned with the \ngovernment, and urge all legitimate stakeholders to agree to \nparticipate in an inclusive dialogue to determine a path forward for \ntheir country.\n  As my colleagues may know, the country has been in turmoil since \nApril, when President Pierre Nkurunziza decided to run for a third \nterm. His decision, which many feel violated the spirit of the very \nagreement that ended the Burundi 12-year civil war and the Burundian \nConstitution itself, has led to widespread violence. An attempted coup \nin May revealed an alarming split in the militia's military ranks, and \nI came to the floor in June to discuss my concern that the situation \ncould escalate. Unfortunately, I was correct. It has. At that time, \n90,000 people had fled the country, and now there are over 200,000 \nrefugees. In June, an estimated 21 people had died during the protest. \nThe U.N. now estimates that nearly 250 people have been killed since \nApril, some at the hands of the security forces and others in a series \nof tit-for-tat targeted assassinations and killings.\n\n  The violence has taken on troubling overtones. Bodies of those who \nhave been clearly victims of execution-style killings are found daily \nin the streets of Bujumbura, Burundi's capital. The families of \npolitical opponents are now being targeted and killed. Government \nofficials have been murdered.\n  In November, Burundian officials engaged in alarming rhetoric \nreminiscent of language used to incite and carry out the genocide in \nRwanda. The government was forced to issue a letter that claimed that \nthe statements made by the President and the president of the senate \nwere not intended to foment such actions. Intended or not, such \ncomments are deeply disturbing.\n  The international community has engaged, but I fear our efforts may \nnot be enough. I was very pleased to see the African Union Peace and \nthe Security Council's October 17 communique, which urged dialogue, \ncalled for deployment of additional human rights monitors, and \nthreatened targeted\n\n[[Page S8203]]\n\nsanctions against those who contribute to the escalation of violence \nand act as spoilers to a political solution. It sent a strong message \nto all parties that continued violence will not be tolerated and that \nan inclusive dialogue--one that includes the Burundian opposition that \nhas taken refuge outside the country--is the only way to restore \nstability. The United Nations Security Council took a much needed step \nby approving a resolution in late November. The European Union has been \nforward leaning, imposing sanctions on government officials and \nrequesting a dialogue with the government to discuss the current \nsituation under the provisions of the Cotonou Agreement related to \ndemocracy and human rights.\n  The United States has been actively engaged in preventive action and \ndiplomacy for some time. On November 23, President Obama issued an \nExecutive order sanctioning four individuals whose actions have \nthreatened the peace and security of Burundi. He also announced that as \nof January, Burundi will no longer be eligible for preferential trade \nbenefits under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Our Special \nEnvoy for the Great Lakes, Tom Perriello, has been in the region \nnumerous times. High-ranking officials, including our United Nations \nAmbassador and the Secretary of State have raised Burundi with our \ninternational partners on numerous occasions. Ambassador Power has \ntraveled there herself, and I applaud the administration's consistent \nattention to the concerns of Burundi.\n  However, the violence continues. We must redouble our efforts to \nsupport a political solution to this current crisis. Let me be clear. \nThere is no substitute for a commitment by the Burundians themselves \nwhen it comes to finding a way forward. They themselves must choose the \npath of peace, but I firmly believe we, in cooperation with our \ninternational partners, can provide the right incentives for them to do \nthat. We can take other meaningful actions in pursuit of an agreement.\n  First, we must help the African Union to finalize contingency plans \nfor an African-led mission to prevent widespread violence in the \ncountry.\n  Second, I call upon the AU to convene a meeting with special envoys \nfrom the United Nations, African Union, United States, European Union, \nand Belgium, as well as representatives from the East African \ncommunity, to discuss coordination among donors, the United Nations, \nthe AU, and the Security Council's recommendations and to identify ways \nthat the international actors can support the increased number of human \nrights monitors and military observers authorized by the AU in October.\n  Third, it is imperative that we help put in place mechanisms for \naccountability for those who have engaged in extrajudicial killings \nduring this period of time. Those who have committed these atrocities \nmust be held accountable. The international community must be firm \nabout this. We cannot allow those who perpetrate these crimes to go \nunpunished.\n  The United States has made a promise to actively prevent the \ncommission of mass atrocities. As the unrest continues, people are \nsuffering in refugee camps or living in fear in their homes, afraid to \ngo out. Violence is on the rise, the economy is in a downward spiral, \nand civil space is closed. Every day that goes by without a civil \nsolution the probability of atrocities increases. Preventing widespread \nviolence and mass atrocities is everyone's business. Diplomatic \nengagement to prevent political violence that has the potential to \nbecome ethnically based killing is exactly what we and the rest of the \ninternational community must focus on addressing.\n  I submit to you that acting to prevent this from happening is all of \nour collective business, and I urge continued action to do so.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 5 years ago, days after President Obama \nsigned the Affordable Care Act into law, the senior Democratic Senator \nfrom New York went on ``Meet the Press'' to discuss the bill. He told \nthe host: ``Well, I think as people learn about the bill, and now that \nthe bill is enacted, it's going to become more and more popular.'' I \ndon't need to tell anyone that never happened.\n  Five years after ObamaCare was enacted, a majority of Americans \ndisapproved the law, and that is a pattern we have seen since the law's \npassage. Why has the law failed to earn the support Democrats \npredicted? For one simple reason: The law is just not working as \nPresident Obama promised it would. The Affordable Care Act was supposed \nto lower health care premiums. It didn't. It was supposed to reduce \nhealth care costs. It didn't. It was supposed to protect the health \ncare plans that Americans wanted to keep. It didn't. The law was sold \nas a health care solution, but it turned out to be yet another health \ncare problem.\n  Five years after the law's passage, here is where we are: Americans \nwith job-based insurance are paying more for their health care, with \nthe average employee seeing a $400 increase in his or her deductible \nsince 2010. Small business employees have fared even worse, with \naverage deductibles now close to $2,000. And Americans are paying more \nfor their premiums as well. An average annual premium contribution for \nfamily coverage is currently $12,591, up from $9,773 in 2010. That is \nnearly $3,000 in additional premium costs or another $250 a month. For \nmany families, that comes on top of an increase in their deductible. \nMeanwhile, thousands of part-time workers have lost their job-based \ninsurance thanks to ObamaCare mandates that encouraged several large \nemployers to stop offering health benefits to part-time employees.\n  The situation with the exchanges is no better. Exchange premiums will \nrise once again this year, with many Americans facing rate increases in \nthe double digits.\n  Over the past few months, I have heard from numerous constituents \nwondering how they will be able to afford the massive premium increases \nthey are facing. One constituent in Wessington, SD, wrote to tell me \nthat her and her husband's health care plan is going from $17,194 this \nyear to a staggering $25,370 next year. That is an annual increase of \nmore than $8,000. What family can afford an $8,000 increase in expenses \nfrom one year to the next?\n  Another constituent of mine wrote to tell me this:\n\n       We just received our rate increase for our family health \n     insurance. We have been paying $1,283 a month and the $557.45 \n     increase will bring it up to $1,841.26. This amount has gone \n     from 26 percent to 37 percent of our income. It is over twice \n     of our house payment. . . . After having insurance coverage \n     for the past 38 years, we are faced with dropping coverage, \n     which is ironic since that is not the purpose of the \n     Affordable Care Act. We are considering dropping insurance \n     and facing the penalty just so we can continue to live in our \n     house, pay our bills, and buy groceries.\n\n  That is from a constituent of mine in South Dakota.\n  I have received far too many letters like these from individuals who \nare facing enormous premium increases.\n  Another constituent wrote to me and said they are facing a 69-percent \npremium increase--69 percent. She and her husband are facing a $22,884 \ninsurance bill. She could buy a brand-new car for less than that.\n  So it is no surprise that a recent survey from the Robert Wood \nJohnson Foundation found that nearly 80 percent of uninsured Americans \nwho have looked for insurance report that they cannot find or cannot \nafford to buy health insurance. The grim reality for millions of \nAmericans is that the Affordable Care Act is anything but affordable.\n  Unfortunately, higher health care costs are just one of the problems \nwith this law. ObamaCare has already reduced Americans' health care \nchoices. Faced with expensive ObamaCare mandates, insurance companies \nhave chosen one of the few methods left to them to control costs, and \nthat is restricting consumers' choice of doctors and hospitals. \nAmericans were promised they could keep the doctor they liked, but for \nmany Americans, that is not true.\n\n[[Page S8204]]\n\n  Then there are the taxes imposed by the law. Because the \nadministration did its best to hide the true cost of ObamaCare, many \nAmericans don't realize that the law hiked taxes by $1 trillion. In \nfact, the law imposed almost a dozen new taxes, including an annual tax \non health insurance that is passed on to consumers in the form of \nhigher premiums, a tax increase on flexible spending accounts and \nhealth savings accounts, and a tax on wages and self-employment income. \nPresident Obama promised not to raise taxes on those making less than \n$250,000, but, as we all know, he broke that promise many times over \nwhen ObamaCare was signed into law. Many of these taxes directly impact \nlow- and middle-income families.\n  Additionally, the law's tax on the makers of lifesaving medical \ndevices, such as pacemakers and insulin pumps, which went into effect \nin 2013, has already eliminated jobs in the medical device industry and \ndriven up the price of essential medical equipment.\n  The medical device industry is not the only industry in which \nObamaCare is costing jobs. ObamaCare's requirement that employers \nprovide their workers with government-approved insurance or pay a tax \nhas made employing full-time workers more costly, which has discouraged \nemployers from hiring. Workers in the retail and restaurant industries, \nmany of them younger, less skilled workers, have been hit particularly \nhard. In all, the Congressional Budget Office has predicted that \nObamaCare will result in the equivalent of 2 million fewer full-time \njobs in 2017 and 2.5 million fewer full-time jobs by 2024. That is not \ngood news for our already sluggish economy.\n  All Americans remember the President's claim that under ObamaCare, \n``If you like your plan, you can keep it''--a claim that was named, \ninterestingly enough, PolitiFact's ``Lie of the Year'' in 2013 after \nObamaCare eliminated the health care plans of 4 million Americans. Now \nhundreds of thousands of Americans will be losing their ObamaCare \nhealth care plan after a number of the health insurance co-ops \nestablished under the law proved unsustainable. In all, 12 of the 23 \nhealth care co-ops established by the President's health care law have \ncollapsed, resulting in the loss of billions in taxpayer dollars, in \naddition to the loss of Americans' health plans. Taxpayers have also \nlost more than $1 billion spent on failed or failing State exchanges, \nsuch as the failed exchanges in the States of Oregon, Hawaii, Vermont, \nMaryland, and Massachusetts.\n  Four years after telling ``Meet the Press'' that ObamaCare would \nbecome ``more and more popular,'' the senior Senator from New York \nadmitted that the Democrats had made a strategic error by focusing on \nObamaCare. Americans, he admitted, were ``crying out for an end to the \nrecession, for better wages and more jobs; not for changes in their \nhealth care.'' The senior Senator from New York is right.\n  Americans didn't want ObamaCare then, and they certainly don't want \nit now. ObamaCare is broken, and Americans know it. It is time to \nrepeal this law and start moving toward the kind of health care reform \nAmericans are actually looking for: an affordable, accountable, \npatient-focused system that gives individuals control of their health \ncare decisions.\n  This week the Senate will take up a repeal bill that will begin the \nprocess of lifting the burdens ObamaCare has placed on Americans. I \nlook forward to debating the bill and working with my colleagues to \nbegin building a bridge to a better health care system for hard-working \nfamilies across the country. It is time to give the American people the \nreal health care reform they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8204-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8204-S8206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             AMERICAN SECURITY AGAINST FOREIGN ENEMIES ACT\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the American \nSecurity Against Foreign Enemies Act of 2015. This act was passed by \nthe House shortly before we recessed for Thanksgiving--an act dealing \nwith the refugee crisis from Syria and Iraq. It is an act that is sort \nof pending before the body now as we try to decide whether to take up \nthe House bill or take up the topic of the House bill as part of the \ndeliberations in which we are engaged.\n  First, I think everyone in this body and everyone in the House \nacknowledges the security needs of America in this challenging time as \nwe are engaged in a battle against ISIL. As we have seen in recent \nweeks, the reach of ISIL--whether it is a passenger aircraft in Sinai, \na neighborhood in southern Beirut, or multiple neighborhoods in Paris, \nISIL's strength is expanding and mutating, and we have to take those \nconcerns seriously.\n  I applaud the work that has already been done to try to make sure the \nvetting process for refugees who entered the United States is pretty \nintense. Four million refugees left Syria during the course of the \nSyrian civil war. Of those 4 million who have left and registered with \nthe U.N., after a fairly extensive review process, the U.N. has \nreferred 20,000 to the United States for possible consideration to be \nrefugees. Of those 20,000, after an 18-month vetting process, we have \nallowed approximately 2,000 into the United States. So the vetting \nprocess for refugees is pretty intense. If we can make it better, we \nneed to do that, but it is already fairly significant. I also applaud \nefforts the administration announced yesterday and that other \ncolleagues, including the Presiding Officer, are working on to ensure \nthat the visa waiver program we currently have, which allows citizens \nfrom 38 countries to come to the United States without visas, is tight. \nWe have to do our best in a careful and deliberate way to make sure our \nsecurity in the midst of this battle against ISIL is strong.\n  I rise today to speak particularly about this act because I think it \nis problematic, and I think it is problematic from the very title of \nthe act. I think it raises some questions we have to be very careful \nabout.\n  Syrian and Iraqi refugees are not foreign enemies. Refugees are not \nthe enemies of the United States. We have an enemy. The enemy is ISIL. \nWe are coming up on the start of a 17-month war against ISIL that \nCongress has been unwilling to debate, vote on, and declare. ISIL is an \nenemy, and we would all acknowledge that, but the refugees who are \nleaving Syria and Iraq are not our enemies. They are victims. They are \nvictims. I think before we go down the path of quickly--and this bill \nwas passed in the House in just a couple of days--painting with a broad \nbrush as our enemies these poor people who have suffered so much, we \nreally need to reflect on what they have been through.\n  This refugee crisis in Syria has been called by most NGOs and other \norganizations like the U.N. the greatest humanitarian crisis since \nWorld War II.\n  In a country of between 25 and 30 million people, 4 million have had \nto flee because of the atrocities of the Assad regime and the \natrocities of the civil war carried out by ISIL and other terrorist \norganizations.\n  Four million had to leave their homes and 8 million more had to leave \ntheir homes and move to other places in their country where they would \nprefer not to live because their homes are unsafe because of the civil \nwar.\n  Nearly 300,000 Syrians have been killed in this civil war, and the \natrocities are horrible. The Assad regime uses barrel bombs in civilian \nneighborhoods to kill innocents without any rhyme or reason as to where \nor when they are going to fall, creating psychological terror as well \nas physical danger. ISIL in Syria is carrying out beheadings and the \nforced subjugation of people and selling them into sexual slavery. It \nis the oppression of religious minorities, virtually any religion other \nthan that of the Sunni extremists who would fit within ISIL's narrow \ndefinition of who they think true believers are. This is what people \nare fleeing from.\n  This Senator emphasizes this point: Refugees are not our enemies. \nThey are not foreign enemies. They are victims who deserve compassion.\n  This is a fairly famous photograph from a suburb of Damascus, \nYarmouk, that is filled with Palestinian refugees who have been waiting \nfor food. The Assad regime had cordoned them off and would not allow \nhumanitarian aid because they thought there were opponents to the \nregime in this neighborhood.\n\n[[Page S8205]]\n\n  This was a photo that was taken in January of 2014 when the U.N. \ncould finally come in to try to deliver humanitarian food aid to these \nfolks. You can see the tens of thousands of people who are waiting in \nthe midst of their bombed-out neighborhood for a delivery of basic food \naid, which has been very episodic during the course of this war. This \nneighborhood has gone back under blockade, and it has been extremely \ndifficult to get them the food they need.\n  These are not enemies; these are people who are worthy of the \ncompassion of any person and especially of a nation as compassionate as \nthe United States.\n  More recently, we were all stunned to see this horrible photograph of \na 3-year-old Syrian boy who, with his family and a group of 12 Syrians, \ntried to make it across water to Greece, fleeing atrocities in the \nbattle between Kurds and ISIL in northern Syria. Twelve members of this \nfamily in a boat were killed and drowned, including this 3-year-old and \nhis 5-year-old brother. These are not enemies.\n  To have an act that purports to deal with this refugee crisis and to \ncall this an act that is an act about foreign enemies--they are not \nenemies. There is no way we should allow the kind of tar brush approach \nthat would paint these poor unfortunates who are victims of the worst \nhumanitarian crisis since World War II as if they are somehow enemies. \nWe should have a compassionate response that protects American security \nbut is nevertheless compassionate.\n  These photographs really grab me, and the rhetoric surrounding these \nrefugees--that they are enemies--when this act passed really grabbed \nme. I found myself thinking about it not so much even in just a policy \nway--what is the right policy, what is the right mixture of things to \nkeep the country safe? That is very important, but these pictures make \none think about something more fundamental: Why does this happen?\n  Since the beginning of time, human beings have asked: Why is there \nsuffering of this kind? Why must hundreds of thousands be huddled into \na bombed-out neighborhood and be nearly starved to death to wait for a \ndelivery episodically from the United Nations? Why would a family have \nto flee from their home, with their children killed, to try to get away \nfrom atrocities? If you are a student from California State University, \non a semester-abroad program in Paris, sitting in a cafe, why are you \ngunned down by ISIL terrorists? If you are a tourist coming back from a \nvacation in the Sinai with your family, why is your plane suddenly \nbombed out of the sky?\n  Humans have asked this question since the beginning of time. Why do \nthese things happen? There are two conventional answers to the question \nof why these things occur, and there is a nonconventional answer that \nis a challenging one that we as a body and as a country really have to \ngrapple with. The two conventional answers as to why there is horrible \nsuffering such as this is obviously there is evil in the world and \nthere is evil within. There is evil out in the world and there is evil \nwithin and we make mistakes. Clearly there is evil in the world. ISIL \nis evil. Refugees are not evil.\n  I think it is interesting that one of the bodies here could come up \nwith a piece of legislation, draft it, debate it, and vote on it in a \ncouple of days to label refugees as ``foreign enemies'' when we have \nbeen at war for 17 months against ISIL and we haven't been able to have \na debate in this body to authorize military force and declare that they \nare an enemy. There is evil in the world, and part of what we must do \nis call it out and be willing to stand against it.\n  The great Irish poet Yeats talked about a situation where the best \nlack all conviction and the worst are filled with passionate intensity. \nI worry that this legislative body has not shown the conviction to call \nout evil in the way that we should call it out, and mistakenly we are \ncalling people evil who aren't evil but who are deserving of \ncompassionate help from us and from other nations. That is the first \nexplanation of why evil occurs. There is evil out in the world, and \nISIL is evil, the atrocities of Assad are evil, and we ought to call it \nout.\n  The second explanation is our own weakness. When bad things happen, \nwhether to yourself or to your country, you have to look in the mirror \nand ask: Did we do anything wrong? And I have a concern that when the \nchapter on the Syrian refugee crisis is written, neither the United \nStates nor other nations are going to look that good. It is going to be \nlike looking into the 1990s and looking at why the United States was \nable to intervene and stop atrocities in the Balkans and chose not to \nin Rwanda. The answer to why we did in one instance and not the other--\nI don't think that looks good in retrospect. I worry with respect to \nthis refugee crisis, the 4 to 8 million killed, these children and \ntheir families--we have to look in the mirror and ask ourselves whether \nwe have done enough or whether we can do more.\n  Last, there is a nonconventional explanation of why suffering like \nthis occurs that is a challenging one. It is in the Book of Job. There \nis a Bible on the Presiding Officer's desk. It is there because it is a \nbook of wisdom. I know you know the story. It is an interesting story, \nas we grapple with suffering like this and we have to ask why it \noccurs. Job was an upright and righteous man. He was a blameless \nperson, a person of integrity.\n  The story was written in about 500 BC and posits this debate between \nGod and Satan. God is talking about how great Job is. Satan says that \nhe is great because he is wealthy and has a great family, and if he \nlost that, he would cease being so faithful.\n  God says: I think he would be faithful anyway.\n  Satan says: Let's have a wager and see what happens.\n  That is how the Book of Job begins. This upright and blameless man \nwho has everything proceeds to very quickly lose everything. He loses \nhis wealth, he loses his family, he loses his health--not because of \nhis own sin, his own weakness, or his own error, his own mistakes, and \nnot because of evil in the world; he suffers because he is being \ntested. That is the reason he suffers.\n  As the story goes on, he is tested. He is tested. He argues with God, \nhe fights with God, he fights with the faith, but he doesn't let go of \nhis faith. At the end of the story, this Book of Job--and this is a \nbook which is not only in the Old Testament and studied by Jews and \nChristians alike, this is in the Koran. This is a story which all the \nAbrahamic faith traditions have grabbed on to because it has a \nfundamental piece of wisdom to it.\n  Sometimes when suffering such as this occurs, it is not just because \nthere is evil in the world or because of our own sin, it is because bad \nthings happen to test us as individuals. Bad things happen and \nsometimes test us as a country.\n  I look at this refugee crisis as a test. It is a test on whether we, \nlike Job, will be true to our principles or whether we will abandon \nthem. Job was true to his principles, and things came back to him \nmultiplied. Are we going to be true to our principles?\n  My State of Virginia began when the English who were starving were \nhelped out by Indians down near Jamestown Island. There was the \nextension of a hand to strangers in a strange land that enabled them to \nsurvive, unlike earlier parties who had been wiped out by starvation or \nbattles with Indians.\n  My people came from Ireland in the 1840s. They were chased out by \noppression. They were chased out by hunger. My people have the same \nstory that virtually everybody who came to the United States has. Some \ncame under much worse conditions, brought over in slavery and \nservitude.\n  The nation of France recognized the United States for what it was--a \nbeacon of liberty for people from around the world--when France gave to \nthe United States the Statue of Liberty, which we planted in New York \nHarbor right next to Ellis Island, where so many people came into this \ncountry. Nobody who came here had it easy. People faced signs that said \n``No Irish need apply'' or they faced discrimination or oppression, but \nthey didn't face a door being shut in their face and being told they \nwere foreign enemies when they were really refugees looking for a \nbetter situation in life.\n  As I think about what we are grappling with and what we may be called \nto vote on in the next 10 days in this body, I think about this massive \nscale of human suffering that is going on\n\n[[Page S8206]]\n\nwith respect to Syria, and I think about that wisdom from the Book of \nJob, which is that sometimes suffering and adversity is to test us. Are \nwe going to abandon our principles? Are we not going to be the Statue \nof Liberty nation? Are we not going to be the nation that will extend a \nhand of welcome or friendship for those who suffer? Are we going to be \ntrue to our principles?\n  Again and again in our Nation's history and in the history of \nnations, it has been shown that if you are true to your principles--\nespecially true to them during times of adversity--then you are worthy \nof respect. You teach important lessons to your kids and to the \ngenerations that follow, and usually things work out. I think our \nNation's principles are solid. They are rock solid. In the heat of the \nmoment, we shouldn't abandon them, and we shouldn't abandon people who \nhave suffered and are suffering with the kind of hot legislative \nlanguage that would label them as ``foreign enemies'' when they are \njust refugees in the same way that people throughout history have been \nrefugees needing a compassionate response from others.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto complete my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8206-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8206-S8208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RELIGIOUS LIBERTY\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, last week families across the Nation \ngathered in gratitude to celebrate Thanksgiving--the holiday we \ncommemorate in remembrance of our Pilgrim ancestors. With humble \nappreciation, we venerate the sacrifice of America's early settlers. We \nremember their fortitude in leaving family and home to colonize a new \nwilderness. Facing disease, starvation, and even death, these brave men \nand women endured tremendous hardships to secure the blessings of \nreligious liberty.\n  Freedom of religion--so precious and so prized by our Pilgrim \nforebears--is the legacy we enjoy as a result of their sacrifice. \nToday, I wish to honor the Pilgrims' legacy by speaking once again on \nthe topic of religious liberty. Over the past several weeks, I have \naddressed this subject at length. In so doing, I have explained the \ncritical importance of religious freedom and its centrality to our \nNation's founding. I have also debunked the erroneous notion that \nreligious liberty is primarily a private matter that has little place \nin the public domain. More recently, I have detailed the many ways \nfreedom of conscience is under attack--both at home and abroad.\n  You might wonder why I devote so much time and attention to this \nvital subject. After all, this is the seventh in a series of speeches I \nhave given on the topic of religious liberty. When there are myriad \nother issues facing our country, why do I feel so compelled to speak \nout about religious freedom? Because, Mr. President, no other freedom \nis so essential to human flourishing and to the future of our Nation. \nIndeed, religion is not only beneficial to society but also \nindispensable to democracy.\n\n  I begin by discussing the most tangible benefits religion brings to \nsociety. History provides many examples. Indeed, many of our Nation's \nmost significant moral and political achievements are grounded in \nreligious teachings and influences.\n  First, consider the role of religion in the formation of our most \nbasic rights. America's Framers were well versed in both religion and \nphilosophy, and in drafting our Founding documents, they drew \ninspiration from both sources.\n  Take for example, the unalienable rights identified in the \nDeclaration of Independence: life, liberty and the pursuit of \nhappiness. These rights are a synthesis of both religious and \nphilosophic teachings. The rights themselves stem from the theories of \nthe philosopher John Locke, but the concept of inalienability--the idea \nthat these rights are inviolable because they are ``endowed [to men] by \ntheir Creator''--is religious in nature.\n  By invoking the divine and linking our rights to a moral authority \nthat lies above and beyond the state, America's Founders insulated our \nfreedoms from government abuse. Philosophy helped articulate our \nfundamental rights, but religion made them unassailable. Thanks to the \nmoral grounding provided by religion, we exercise these rights free of \nstate control.\n  In addition to undergirding the establishment of our God-given \nrights, religion directly benefitted American society by catalyzing the \ntwo greatest social movements in our Nation's history: abolition and \ncivil rights.\n  Abolition traces its roots to the Second Great Awakening, when \npreachers such as Charles Grandison Finney and Lyman Beecher rose to \nprominence with their revivalist teachings on social justice and \nequality. Many of the earliest pro-abolition organizations coalesced \naround Christian evangelical communities in the North. Emancipation was \na religious cause first and a political movement second.\n  Most abolitionists were deeply religious themselves, including two of \nthe movement's most vocal leaders, William Lloyd Garrison and John \nGreenleaf Whittier. The Christian doctrine of moral equality was \nespecially crucial in generating the grassroots support that eventually \nmade emancipation possible.\n  Religion was equally influential in guiding the civil rights \nmovement. We speak today of Dr. Martin Luther King, but we sometimes \nforget that before he was a doctor he was a reverend. In 1967, the year \nbefore his death, Reverend King proclaimed:\n\n       Before I was a civil rights leader, I was a preacher of the \n     Gospel. This was my first calling and it still remains my \n     greatest commitment. . . . [A]ll that I do in civil rights I \n     do because I consider it a part of my ministry.\n\n  Reverend King recruited other religious leaders to his cause when he \nconvened a meeting of more than 60 black ministers in what would \neventually become the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. This \ncoalition of evangelical leaders was instrumental in organizing both \nthe Birmingham campaign and the March on Washington. For these \nministers and many other men and women who participated in the civil \nrights movement, religion provided the initial impetus for their \nadvocacy.\n  Today, religion continues to benefit society by contributing to our \nNation's robust philanthropic sector. The importance of charity and \nhelping the poor is nearly universal across all faiths. Every year, \nreligious organizations throughout the United States feed the hungry, \nclothe the naked, give shelter to the homeless, and care for the sick \nand afflicted.\n  Without these religious groups, our government welfare system would \nbe overwhelmed.\n  Charitable organizations are irreplaceable because they often step in \nwhere the state cannot. Consider some of the largest, most well-\nrespected religious charities in operation today, such as the Salvation \nArmy, Catholic Charities, World Vision, or LDS Humanitarian Services. \nThese organizations are motivated by more than a mere humanitarian \nimpulse; they are driven by a sense of duty both to God and to man. \nEvery year, they lift millions from despair, offering not only material \nassistance but also spiritual direction to help individuals lead more \nprosperous lives. This is a critical service that no government program \ncould ever provide.\n  It is clear that religion has benefitted our society in several \nmeaningful ways. First, as a result of religious teachings, we have \nunfettered claim to the natural rights delineated in our Nation's \nfounding documents. Second, thanks to religious leaders from John \nRankin to Martin Luther King, we freely exercise civil rights today \nthat were once denied millions of Americans. Third, by virtue of \nreligious teaching on charity, we have a humanitarian sector that is \nunparalleled in its ability to respond to crisis, bless the poor, and \nlift the needy.\n  But my purpose in speaking today is not merely to recite a list of \nblessings brought about by religious liberty. Religion is not simply \nbeneficial to society; it is an indispensable feature of any free \ngovernment. Without religion, liberty itself would be in danger and \ndemocracy would devolve into despotism.\n  The nexus between religion and democracy involves the relationship \nbetween morality and freedom. Freedom\n\n[[Page S8207]]\n\nis a double-edged sword; it can be used for good or for evil. Statesmen \nmay use freedom to defend justice, but tyrants can abuse it for their \nown corrupt ends. Morality is necessary to ensure that individuals \nexercise their freedom responsibly.\n  Religion provides free individuals with the moral education necessary \nto exercise freedom responsibly. It instills the very virtues that lead \nto an engaged citizenry, including a concern for others, the ability to \ndiscern between right and wrong, and the capacity to look beyond the \nmere pursuit of present pleasures to the good of society.\n  President George Washington identified the link between morality and \nreligion. According to Washington, ``Reason and experience both forbid \nus to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.'' For Washington, morality presupposed religion, \nand both virtues cultivated a healthy society. Perhaps this why he said \nthat ``[o]f all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports.'' That \nwas George Washington.\n  John Adams was of the same mind. He argued that without religion and \nmorality, our government could not stand because, ``[a]varice, \nambition, revenge and gallantry would break the strongest cords of our \nConstitution, as a whale goes through a net''; hence, his most famous \nobservation that the Constitution ``was made only for a moral and \nreligious people.''\n  For Washington, Adams, and many others who helped to establish our \nconstitutional system of self-government, religion, morality, freedom, \nand democracy are necessarily interlinked. Without the moral \nsensibilities that religion that can provide, freedom is all too easily \ncorrupted, endangering the very foundation of democracy.\n  Our Founding Fathers were not alone in calling attention to the \ninextricable connection between religion and a healthy democracy. The \nrenowned political philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville offered his own \nanalysis on the subject. After spending several months observing \nAmerican Government and society, Tocqueville wrote his famed \n``Democracy in America'' in an attempt to explain American political \nculture to his French counterparts. When Tocqueville published his work \nin the early 19th century, the United States was a burgeoning democracy \nand unique as one of the only countries in the world that guaranteed \nreligious liberties to its citizens.\n  At this intersection of democracy and religion, Tocqueville made his \nmost compelling observations. Like Washington and Adams, Tocqueville \nbelieved that religion was essential to the success of the American \npolitical experiment. Without the moral strictures of religion, the \nNation's democracy would collapse on itself. In Tocqueville's own \nwords:\n\n       Despotism may be able to do without faith, but freedom \n     cannot. . . . How could society escape destruction if, when \n     political ties are relaxed, moral ties are not tightened? And \n     what can be done with a people master of itself if it is not \n     subject to God?\n\n  In other words, Tocqueville asked how the experiment of self-\ngovernment could succeed if individuals refused to submit to any moral \nauthority beyond themselves. By posing this question, Tocqueville \nargued that democracy needs religion and morality to ensure that \ncitizens exercise their freedom responsibly. Democracy needs religion \nto help refine the people's moral responsibility and instill the \nvirtues of good citizenship that make democracy possible in the first \nplace.\n  Tocqueville also taught that democracy needs religion to temper the \nmaterialistic impulses of a free-market society. By setting our hopes \nand desires beyond imminent, temporal concerns and turning our hearts \ninstead toward those in need, religion engenders charitable behavior \nand saves democracy from its own excesses.\n  In Tocqueville's view, the free exercise of religion is not just a \ncondition of liberal society; it is a precondition for a healthy \ndemocracy. Without religion and the moral instruction it provides, \nfreedom falters, and democracy all too easily dissolves into tyranny.\n  In this regard, religion is not merely a boon to democracy, but a \nbulwark against despotism. Laws alone are incapable of instilling order \nand regulating moral behavior across society. As LDS Apostle Dallin H. \nOaks has observed, ``Our society is not held together just by law and \nits enforcement, but most importantly by voluntary obedience to the \nunenforceable and by widespread adherence to unwritten norms of right . \n. . behavior.''\n  Of course, religion and a basic sense of morality help induce such \nvoluntary obedience to the unenforceable that Elder Oaks describes. \nGeorge Washington conceded that individuals may find morality without \nreligion, but political society needs the spiritual grounding that only \nreligion can provide. In this regard, religion complements law in \ncultivating a moral citizenry.\n  Both law and religion are necessary to engender good citizenship. As \nthe influence of religion diminishes, governments must enact more laws \nto fill the void to maintain a moral citizenry. So the consequences of \nless religious activity are not greater human freedom but greater state \ncontrol.\n  Religion, then, acts as a check on state power. It cultivates \nmorality so governments don't have to through the cold, impersonal \nmachinery of law.\n  By acting as a shield against state overreach, religion is a friend \nto both democracy and freedom. Expanding religious freedom empowers \ndemocracy, but limiting religious freedom weakens our democratic \ninstitutions. In the most extreme case, eliminating religious freedom \naltogether results in tyranny and human suffering on a massive scale.\n  Consider the catastrophic state of affairs in countries that have \nexplicitly outlawed religion. The Soviet Union, Communist China under \nMao, the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, and North Korea are prominent \nexamples. In each of these countries, leaders committed unspeakable \natrocities to enforce their own godless morality. In the absence of \nfaith, there was no religious horizon to keep political ambitions \nwithin limits. Unencumbered by the moral restraint of religion, \ndictators systematically killed millions of their own people to \nestablish their own secular vision of Heaven on Earth. These \nillustrations of totalitarianism, torture, and genocide demonstrate \nthat a society without religion is a society without freedom.\n\n  I raise these grievous examples to reiterate my initial point: \nReligion is central to human prosperity. Society needs religion to keep \npolitical ambitions in check, and democracy needs religion to maintain \nmorality so that freedom can flourish.\n  I had the privilege of serving for 2 years in three States--Ohio, \nIndiana, and Michigan--as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ \nof Latter-day Saints. We served without pay, without compensation. I \nlived on $55 to $65 a month, and I traveled all over those three \nStates, helping other missionaries be able to teach the Gospel of Jesus \nChrist. I am glad I had the freedom to be able to serve that mission in \nthree States in this beautiful, wonderful country, where religious \nfreedom is a revered right and a heralded concept.\n  Those 2 years were the most important years of my life because they \nled to a wonderful marriage with Elaine, 6 children, 23 grandchildren, \nand 16 great grandchildren, and those are all I know about at this \ntime. I have to say that they led to a better life in every way, even \nthough my life has been hard.\n  I was raised in Pittsburgh, PA. My father was a building tradesman. \nSometimes there wasn't work. We lost our home shortly after my birth. \nIt was a little band-box frame home in Homestead Park, PA. My dad \nborrowed $100 to purchase an acre and then tore down a burned-out \nbuilding to build us a home that was black on three sides, and the \nfourth side had a Meadow Gold Dairy sign that he had apparently torn \ndown and put up just exactly the way it was. We didn't have indoor \nfacilities.\n  It was an acre of ground, and we raised quite a bit of our food. We \nactually raised chickens. I was in charge of the chickens, taking care \nof the chicken coop, feeding them, cleaning up after them, collecting \nthe eggs every day, selling the eggs, and delivering the eggs, from 6 \nyears old on. I am glad I had that experience.\n  I am glad that my family went to church and was religious. The Mormon \nChurch at that time in Pittsburgh was very small, but the people were \nall patriotic and loved America. Why did they? Many of them were from \nother\n\n[[Page S8208]]\n\ncountries. They loved America because they were free. I didn't know any \nbetter, but I knew I was free, and that was important--not just to me \nbut to my parents and to many others as well.\n  Elaine and I are so grateful that we have been able to raise our six \nchildren, all of whom are married now, all of whom have children, and \nmany of whom have our great-grandchildren.\n  The thing that tied us together more than anything else was religion \nin this freest of all nations. I am so grateful for this country. I am \nso grateful for the freedoms that we all take for granted. I am so \ngrateful for my parents, who were just humble people, neither of whom \nhad received any education beyond the eighth grade, but both were \nbrilliant in his or her own way. The thing they taught us was religion \nand doing good to our fellow men and women.\n  I am so grateful for this great country. I am so grateful for all of \nthe many blessings we have from religious freedom, and I don't want to \nsee us lose that in the realm of political correctness.\n  In closing, I urge all of my colleagues to consider the state of \nreligious liberty in the United States today. Only by strengthening \nthis fundamental freedom can we secure the future of our own democracy \nand keep the rest of our freedoms alive and viable.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am here for my now 28th ``Waste of the \nWeek.'' I have been coming to the floor of the Senate for 28 weeks \npointing out government waste.\n  Some in this Chamber say we can't cut a penny more. We are down to \nthe bone. We are far from it. This is just a small effort, having been \nshot down, in terms of anything larger to do to deal with our fiscal \nsituation, because the White House simply does not want to engage in \nit. We at least ought to be able to take steps as a body to eliminate \nthe kind of wasteful spending that takes place on a daily basis in \nWashington.\n  I have come down once a week to do this. I could come down every day, \nI could come down every hour and point out something in this vast array \nof Federal Government that never stops growing that simply falls in the \ncategory of waste, fraud, and abuse. So far we are well over our $100 \nbillion goal of accumulated waste. Today, this is No. 28. Specifically, \nthis particular waste of the week is facilitator fraud in the Social \nSecurity disability insurance fund.\n  What is the facilitator fraud? Facilitator fraud is when individuals \nwith specialized knowledge use system as a means to fraudulently, \nillegally qualify people to receive SSDI benefits. They look for \nclaimants either by putting out ads or using social media or word of \nmouth: Look, you too can get checks from the Federal Government even if \nyou are not disabled because we have figured out how to qualify you. We \nwill help you process these forms. We have connections with doctors and \nmedical providers who will be able to give us written information, even \nthough it is fraudulent and illegal, that you can use to justify with \nthe Social Security Administration to qualify for Social Security \ndisability.\n  Then, when those payments start, the facilitators get a percentage of \nthat or they have worked out some kind of agreement that you will pay \nus this amount of money if we can get you the claim. Once disability \npayment is made, financial compensation to the facilitator is in place, \nand there is a vicious cycle of fraud and abuse. So instead of robbing \nPeter to pay Paul, Peter and Paul are robbing the Federal Government \ntogether and reaping the benefits.\n  Over the last 5 years, the Social Security Administration has seen an \namazing increase in fraudulent activity associated with facilitators. \nThe estimate is potentially 1 percent and perhaps even more--we haven't \ntied this down yet--of SSDI payments are affected by facilitator fraud. \nWe have taken a rough estimate of what this would amount to over a 10-\nyear period of time and dropped $.4 billion. We think at least $10 \nbillion over 10 years is a conservative estimate of the waste of \ntaxpayers' dollars through fraudulent, illegal means.\n  Last month the Social Security inspector general, Patrick O'Carroll, \ntestified before the Joint Economic Committee, which I chair, and \nshared his concerns about this question. He said, ``There are people \nout there in positions of trust that the agency relies on for \ninformation. . . .'' as to determining whether a claim is a legitimate \nclaim for coverage. He said, ``And if those people [whom we rely on] \ndecide to defraud the government''--by sending in false claims, backed \nup by false medical support, the taxpayer is being taken to the \ncleaners. ``We have found that in some cases the former Social Security \nemployees''--that have left the employment of the Federal Government--\n``that understand the way the system works then go into conspiracies \nwith unscrupulous medical providers and attorneys, where they will use \nimproper information and facilitate getting in so that a person will \nget on benefits,'' and they get the payment and the rewards.\n  Last year, a San Diego-area psychologist confessed to charging his \npatients $200 each to fabricate medical evidence to support their \ndisability claims.\n  Imagine getting up in the morning, going to your desk, you have the \ncredentials of a doctor--in this case a psychologist--to issue an \nopinion as to what the claimant's medical condition is, and then \nparticipate in this cycle of fraudulent activity and be paid for it. \nThat is his job. That is what he does every day. Fortunately, we caught \nhim, and that is how we know about this.\n  In August of 2013, Federal law enforcement officials and the Puerto \nRico Police Department arrested 75 people in Puerto Rico and dismantled \na large-scale disability fraud scheme involving physicians and a \nclaimant representative who is also a former Social Security \nAdministration employee.\n  So not only are individuals doing this, but there are groups of \nindividuals who are working through a system. These are just two small \nexamples of what is happening. To give some credit, the discovery of \nthis has produced some progress in terms of addressing this problem. \nThe most recent budget deal reached in the Senate included increased \nfunding for what is called the Cooperative Disability Investigation \nUnits, which investigate suspicious disability claims and hopefully \nprevents fraud before it happens. Additionally, the Social Security \nAdministration's regional Disability Fraud Pilot Program works \nspecifically on facilitator fraud across the country trying to identify \nthose high-dollar, high-impact cases involving third-party facilitators \nconspiring with claimants to defraud the Social Security \nAdministration. It is a pilot program. I don't know why we haven't had \nthat program in place from its very inception. Every agency \ndistributing funds for individuals should have as a component of that \nagency an investigative process for fraud, waste, and abuse because--\nyou name the program writing checks to claimants, and I believe we will \nbe able to find those that are fraudulently taking money out of \ntaxpayers' wallets.\n  We are going to keep coming here every week putting the spotlight on \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. Today we add another $10 billion to the total, \nwhich keeps growing and growing. Now it is a total of $128,812 billion \nof documented waste, fraud, and abuse. This is not something we make \nup. This is not something we read about in the paper. This is something \nwhere agencies of the Federal Government, which have accountability and \nresponsibility to try to dig in and find this abuse, provide \ninformation on a regular basis, but it is something taxpayers simply \ncannot afford, should not be obligated to pay, and highlights the fact \nthat we have a government growing beyond its means.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Governor Olene \nWalker, Utah's 15th Governor, who passed away on Saturday, November 28, \n2015, at the age of 85. She was the first woman to serve as Utah's \nGovernor, worked as Lieutenant Governor for over 11 years, and was a \nmember of the Utah Legislature for 8 years.\n  Olene Walker will be remembered and revered by Utahns not because of \nthe many firsts she pioneered in politics but for her commitment to \nleave a legacy of public and, more importantly, private service based \non principles that truly last. Olene Walker's life and career were \ncentered in the principles of lifelong learning, selfless service, and \nmaking a difference through civil discourse and meaningful dialogue.\n  Governor Walker believed that the best way to open a mind was to read \na book. Immediately upon becoming Governor, she launched her Read With \na Child Program, focused on getting adults to read with a child for 20 \nminutes every day. She knew that 20 minutes of daily reading would not \nonly transform children across the State by getting them to read at or \nabove grade level, but it would transport them to magical places, big \nideas, and brighter futures. Because she became Governor at the age of \n73--and as a grandmother--I think she also recognized that 20 minutes \nof reading with a child would inspire the adults in the State of Utah \nas well.\n  Governor Walker was never far from a book or a group of children to \nread to, often choosing her personal favorite from Dr. Seuss, ``Oh, the \nPlaces You'll Go!'' Governor Walker went many places in her public \nservice but sent thousands and thousands of Utah children on adventures \nnever to be forgotten in the wonderful world of good books. She was \nliving proof that books expand the mind and that a mind expanded, \nespecially the mind of a child, could never return to its original \nstate. I was inspired when reading her obituary that the last line, in \ntypical Olene Walker style, stated: ``In lieu of flowers, please read \nwith a child.'' Her commitment to the principle of lifelong learning is \na legacy in and of itself.\n  Governor Walker also understood that it didn't really matter where \nshe served, but how she served. Whether working alongside her husband \nin the family's snack business, in the legislature or in the Governor's \noffice, Olene Walker knew that her time on this Earth would never be \nmeasured by the titles she held but by the impact and influence that \nshe had on others. She understood and lived by the adage: ``We are to \nlive our lives not by days, but by deeds, not by seasons, but by \nservice.'' After leaving the Governor's mansion, she participated in \nliteracy forums, served an LDS mission with her husband in New York, \nand at an age when most people slow down, Olene Walker took on a new \nand, many would say, daunting challenge of leading dozens of 3- to 11-\nyear-old children for 2 hours every Sunday in her LDS congregation.\n  Governor Walker served with confidence, charisma, and charm that was \nelevating and at the same time enlightening. National political \nplayers, rural farmers, business executives, and children were equally \ninspired by her energetic approach, and they responded to her \ninvitation to engage because they sensed that what they were about to \nexperience was not about Governor Walker; it was about them.\n  In an age of egomaniacs and narcissists, Olene Walker's example of \nselfless service in high office is a model for all to follow--a model \nthat all people should try to emulate. Governor Walker also understood \nthe principle that mean-spirited arguments produce little, while \nmeaningful dialogue creates much. She was known for her disarming style \nand for her corresponding ability to pull people into a conversation. \nShe believed and lived by a motto that my office is committed to. The \nsolution to any and every problem begins when someone says: Let's talk \nabout it. Olene Walker challenged political candidates, elected \nofficials of both parties, and young people in particular to transcend \nthe talk-radio style bombast in personal attacks in favor of civil, \nserious, and substantive discussions. The Olene S. Walker Institute of \nPolitics & Public Service, at her beloved Weber State University, is a \ntestament to her commitment to make a difference through a more \nmeaningful and deeper dialogue.\n  A picture of Olene Walker taken inside the Governor's mansion \ncontains an interesting image that illuminates much of what Olene \nWalker was really all about. Resting on a desk in the background of the \npicture is a statue of a vibrant, energetic, pioneering Brigham Young. \nHe is walking swiftly, leading with staff in hand, eyes set on a bright \nfuture as he began the audacious endeavor of being the first to \nestablish a lasting legacy in the tops of the Rocky Mountains. In the \npicture, the statue of Brigham Young almost appears to be trying to \nkeep up with Governor Walker. Only Olene Walker could get a \ntrailblazing Brigham Young to pick up the pace. Governor Walker, \nlikewise, was a pioneer and a trailblazer, moving swiftly, leading with \na clear vision of a better society, and guided by her principles of \nlifelong learning, selfless service, and civil dialogue. Her life of \nmany firsts will be celebrated and emulated for generations to come \nbecause it was founded on and inspired by such principles--principles \nthat will truly last.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8209-4", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8209-S8210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRAGEDY AT PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINIC IN COLORADO SPRINGS\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I am here to reflect on the tragedy that \noccurred in Colorado Springs last week. There, a gunman attacked a \nPlanned Parenthood clinic, killing three people and injuring nine \nothers. Colorado is mourning the losses of the three who were murdered, \nall of whom were parents in the prime of their lives and all of whom \nrepresented the best of our State.\n  Officer Garrett Swasey was one of the first officers to arrive at the \nscene. He had served as an officer at the University of Colorado \nColorado Springs Police Department for 6 years. Garrett had been \nmarried to his wife Rachel for 17 years. He leaves behind his two \nchildren--Faith, who is only 6, and Elijah, who just turned 11 on \nSunday. His wife said:\n\n       His greatest joys were his family, his church, and his \n     profession. We will cherish his memory, especially those \n     times he spent tossing the football to his son and snuggling \n     with his daughter on the couch.\n\n  She went on to note:\n\n       Helping others brought him deep satisfaction and being a \n     police officer was a part of him. In the end, his last act \n     was for the safety and well-being of others and was a tribute \n     to his life.\n\n  Officer Swasey's actions last Friday spoke to his extraordinary \ncourage and selflessness. As a university police officer, he wasn't \nunder any obligation to respond when he first heard of the incident \nthrough emergency radio. He could have looked the other way. Yet he was \none of the first to arrive at Planned Parenthood, which is 4 miles away \nfrom the university.\n  His good friend and copastor said that Officer Swasey often responded \nto dangerous calls off campus and that he put other people's lives \nbefore his own.\n\n[[Page S8210]]\n\nThe University of Colorado Colorado Springs police chief said:\n\n       There was no way any of us could have kept him here. He was \n     always willing to go. . . . He had an enthusiasm that was \n     hard to quell.\n\n  Officer Swasey is truly a hero in every sense of the word. Before \njoining the university police force, Officer Swasey was a Junior \nNational Champion ice skater. Upon hearing the news of the tragedy, his \nskating partner, with whom he won that championship, observed:\n\n       Garrett was selfless, always there to help me, always my \n     wingman. He was my brother and my partner. I could always \n     count on him.\n\n  After his competitive career, Officer Swasey continued to teach \nskating. He also served as a copastor at Hope Chapel, which he and his \nfamily attended since 2001. At church he led care groups and taught \nScripture and guitar. At services on Sunday, a fellow pastor at the \nchurch described how he felt. ``You don't realize how much you love \nsomeone until you can't tell him anymore.''\n\n  Our State is also mourning the loss of Ke'Arre Marcell Stewart. He \nwas only 29 years old. Here is how his family and friends have \ndescribed Ke'Arre: ``a good friend and an amazing listener''; ``one of \nthe most caring men I've ever met''; ``someone you could just sit and \ntalk to about life''; ``caring, giving, funny and just a damn good \nperson.''\n  Those traits were on display Friday when he was at Planned Parenthood \naccompanying a friend. He served our country in the Army and was \ndeployed to Iraq between 2005 and 2006. Last week he died as he was \ntrying to save others. According to reports, after being shot outside \nof the building, Ke'Arre ran back inside to warn others to seek safety. \nHis family credits his military training and instinct for how he \nresponded. Ke'Arre wasn't a native of Colorado. He was born in Texas, \nwhere he was a three-sport athlete, playing football, basketball, and \nrunning track. His friends say he moved to Colorado because he was \nstationed at Fort Carson and stayed, like so many of us, because he \nloved our beautiful State. Ke'Arre had two children, both daughters. \nThey are 11 and 6 years old. His friend observed that ``he loved his \ndaughters to death. He would do anything for them.''\n  Finally, the third victim, Jennifer Markovsky, was also accompanying \na friend to the clinic on Friday. Jennifer grew up in Hawaii, where she \nmet her husband who was serving in the Army at the time. About a decade \nago--in a story similar to Ke'Arre's--they moved to Colorado when he \nwas reassigned. Jennifer's family described her as a loving wife and \nmother to a young son and daughter. Her sister-in-law told the Colorado \nSprings Gazette: ``She lived for her kids.'' She said Jennifer often \ntook her children, who are 10 and 6, on hikes and spent time with them \nbaking and working on crafts. Her father, who had just wished her a \nhappy Thanksgiving one day earlier, called her ``the most lovable \nperson . . . kind-hearted . . . always there when I needed her.''\n  Yesterday her husband said:\n\n       She was a very caring and compassionate person and patient \n     and understanding parent. She was deeply loved by all who \n     knew her. She was always helping the kids do homework and \n     reading books with them. We will miss her; her cooking, \n     crafting and adventurous spirit.\n\n  Three young parents who woke up last Friday morning with long, bright \nfutures ahead of them, with the chance to raise their children and \nwatch them grow and learn, with the chance to contribute, as they had \nbefore, to our community and our country but instead whose lives were \nviolently ended in a hail of gunfire--three strangers to each other, \nnow joined together in our fondest memories. Nine others were wounded, \nand our thoughts and prayers are with them and their families as well.\n  We should also honor and thank the Colorado Springs Police Department \nand other local law enforcement agencies that responded so swiftly and \neffectively. Five officers were wounded in the attack.\n  I wish to also recognize the employees at Planned Parenthood who \nworked tirelessly during the extended shooting and hostage incident to \nensure that their patients were kept safe.\n  This is not the day to talk about how our country begins to emerge \nfrom this season of killing and violence, but let me simply say in \nrecent years too many of our children and parents have had their lives \nstolen, and too many of the rest of us have lived to pursue the \nordinary course of our lives--going to school, going to work, seeking \nhealth care--in the shadows of the question: Whose child will be next? \nWhose mom and dad will be next?\n  What we need today--instead of charged rhetoric and political \ntactics--is to find a way to at least begin figuring out how we can \ndeal with these problems that we need to solve, how we can make things \nbetter.\n  I thank my colleagues for their comforting words this week, and I \nhope we will all take time in the days ahead to think of the families \nand victims involved in this tragedy. Take a moment to think of the \nkids who lost their mom or dad.\n  I have no doubt that the Colorado Springs community and our State \nwill come together to heal during this difficult time. We could all \ntake a cue from that here.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

At the end of the \nprocess there could be another vote-arama if there are a lot of \namendments left over. This is an amendable bill. It has quite a few \nrules that fall under the budget process that make this a bit more \ndifficult than just a wide-open bill, so there are rules that have to \nbe met in order for an amendment to not affect the outcome of the bill.\n  Many of you have heard of the expression, I am sure, ``caveat \nemptor,'' which means buyer beware. The President and the Democrats in \nCongress should have heeded this warning before forcing the country to \npurchase ObamaCare, which still remains unworkable, unaffordable, and \nmore unpopular than ever. For millions of Americans the law today \nrepresents nothing more than broken promises, higher costs, and fewer \nchoices.\n  It is no surprise that a Gallup poll published last month, more than \n5 years after the law was passed and several years into actual \nimplementation, shows that most Americans still oppose this \nunprecedented expansion of government intrusion into health care \ndecisions for hard-working families and small businesses. Another poll \nI found interesting showed that more people were concerned about what \nhas happened with health care than they do about climate change. That \nis appropriate for this week.\n  The law is saddling American households with more than $1 trillion in \nnew taxes over the next 10 years. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, ObamaCare will cost taxpayers more than $116 billion a year. In \nfact, on average, every American household can expect more than $20,000 \nin new taxes over the next 10 years because of this bill. ObamaCare's \ncrushing regulations mean smaller paychecks for families while holding \nback small businesses from expanding and hiring new workers. For every \nAmerican, ObamaCare has meant more government, more bureaucracy, and \nmore rules and regulations, along with soaring health care costs and \nless access to care.\n  When we were debating this bill 5 years ago, I remember talking about \n30 million people in the United States being uninsured. Today there are \n30 million people in the United States uninsured, it is just a \ndifferent 30 million people. The ones who couldn't be insured are \ninsured and the ones who were insured can't afford the insurance. Of \ncourse, there was a lot of talk about health care companies gouging the \ninsured. We put in risk corridors so those who were making an excess \nprofit would put in money that would go to those who didn't figure on \nthe right number of people or how healthy the people would be who they \ninsured. We\n\n[[Page S8211]]\n\nnow know that didn't work. The amount of money that went into the fund \nwas rather insignificant, so those who undercharged aren't getting much \nand companies are going out of business.\n  Today we take a crucial step forward in beginning to lift the burdens \nand the higher cost of this law that has been placed on all Americans. \nAs I mentioned, this is a special budget operation that only requires \n51 votes. The House has already passed a bill with more than a \nsignificant majority.\n  By the time we are done, the legislation the Senate passes will \neliminate more than $1 trillion in tax increases placed on the American \npeople while saving more than $500 billion in spending. Most \nimportantly, this bill begins to build a bridge from the President's \nbroken promises to a better health care system for hard-working \nfamilies across the country.\n  Let's talk about the broken promises. As a Presidential candidate, \nthen-Senator Obama promised Americans they could keep their health plan \nif they liked it. When he was in office and the bill was there, he \nsaid: If you like your plan, you can keep it. Millions soon learned \nthey can't. This is because ObamaCare has drastically reduced America's \nchoice among health care plans through a Federal Government takeover of \nthe insurance marketplace. In fact, the President's promise, ``If you \nlike your plan, you can keep it,'' was named PolitiFact's ``Lie of the \nYear'' in 2013 after the health care plan cancellations were mailed to \nover 4 million Americans.\n  Let's talk about the higher costs. Americans were also promised lower \nhealth care costs, but even the administration admits ObamaCare is \nfailing to address costs and said average premiums are expected to rise \nby 7.5 percent this year. Recent headlines from across the country \nactually show much more dramatic increases.\n  In Minnesota insurance policies on the exchange have rate hikes in \nthe double digits--between 14 and 49 percent. In Oregon premiums for \nthe benchmark plan on the exchange will go up about 23 percent. In \nAlaska the premium hike will be more than 31 percent for the benchmark \nplan. In Oklahoma the second lowest cost silver plan premiums will \nincrease more than 35 percent. In Utah plans on the federally run \nexchange will be 22 percent higher next year.\n  The President of the United States himself promised that this bill \nwas not a tax. In fact, this was one of the law's top selling points \nbecause Democrats knew it would never pass if they said it was a tax, \nbut while they got the bill passed and signed into law, the Supreme \nCourt later ruled it is a tax. This law was deceptively sold to the \nAmerican people and now these hidden taxes are being passed on to hard-\nworking families in the form of higher fees and costs. It is time for \nDemocrats in Congress and the President to admit that ObamaCare is a $1 \ntrillion tax hike that families and employers simply can't afford.\n  We can talk about fewer choices. ObamaCare's mandates and taxes on \nemployer-sponsored health care plans are not only leading to higher \nout-of-pocket expenses but also fewer choices and services for 150 \nmillion Americans who have relied upon job-based health benefits for \ndecades. It eliminated some of the competition, and competition is the \nreal way to bring down prices.\n  I remember when we did Medicare Part D. I was a little concerned \nbecause there were only two companies that were providing the \npharmaceutical benefit in Wyoming, and I thought they would maybe drop \nout of the program, but Medicare Part D increased competition. What did \nincreased competition do? It brought down the price of the \npharmaceuticals by 25 percent before it even went into effect.\n  ObamaCare didn't provide for more competition. According to the \nnonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, employees who have job-based \ninsurance have witnessed their out-of-pocket expenses, on average for \nan individual, climb from $900 in 2010 to $1,300 in 2015. Employees \nworking for small businesses now have deductibles of over $1,800. Since \nObamaCare became law, several large employers have stopped offering \nbenefits to part-time employees, including Walmart, Target, Home Depot, \nand Trader Joe's. The premiums have gone up and the deductibles have \ngone up. There are fewer choices and higher costs.\n\n  So this was supposed to build a bridge to better care. Over the past \n50 years, our Nation has made great strides in improving the quality of \nlife for all Americans, but these transformative changes were always \nforged in the spirit of bipartisan compromise and cooperation. These \nqualities are essential to the success and longevity of crucial \nprograms such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Shortly before he retired in 2001, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a \nDemocrat from New York, said:\n\n       Never pass legislation that affects most Americans without \n     real bipartisan support. It opens the doors to all kinds of \n     political trouble.\n\n  Senator Moynihan correctly noted that the side that didn't support \nthe law will focus on each and every misstep. More importantly, he \npredicted that the measure's very legitimacy would always be in doubt \nand that the majority of Americans would have trouble supporting it in \nthe long run unless it unquestionably achieved all of its goals.\n  We have seen each of these scenarios play out over the past 5 years \nas the health care law has polarized America like nothing before.\n  Bipartisan support, of course, means that both sides get some things \ninto the mix of the bill. That did not happen even though we had a very \nextensive amendment process in committee and on the floor. Essentially, \nthe Republican ideas were all thrown out. Both sides weren't included, \nso it was not a bipartisan bill.\n  After passage of the bill, we had a special time at the Blair House \nwhere there were half Republicans and half Democrats who got to speak \nwith the President for a day. The amazing thing at that meeting was \nthat every time a Republican mentioned an idea, the President blasted \nit immediately. When the Democrats suggested an idea, those were all \ngood. At the end of the day, it turned out to be very much a waste of \ntime because not a single idea was even considered that was brought up \nat that time by the Republicans.\n  We still need health care reform, but it has to be done the right \nway--not comprehensive. In my opinion, ``comprehensive'' means so large \nthat nobody can understand it, and that is kind of what happened with \nthis bill. We have to do it step by step. They can be pretty big steps, \nbut if we do it step by step, we can bring the American public along. \nThey can understand it, and they can tell us the unintended \nconsequences, and those can be fixed. It would be correctable. This \nbill hasn't been correctable. We have known the flaws. The President \nhas put waivers on to keep us from noticing them sooner. We have \noffered to make corrections but have never been taken up on our offer.\n  Providing access to high-quality, affordable health care is something \nI am confident that Democrats and Republicans should be able to do. It \nis time to build a bridge from the broken promises to better health \ncare for each and every American once and for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8211-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, I rise in strong opposition to the budget reconciliation \nbill we are debating today. In fact, this bill should tell every \nAmerican just how far removed the Republican leadership here in \nCongress is from the realities of American life and the needs of the \nAmerican people.\n  At a time when the United States is the only major country on Earth \nthat does not guarantee health care to all people; when 29 million \nAmericans today have no health insurance and even more are \nunderinsured, with high\n\n[[Page S8212]]\n\ndeductibles and high copayments; when we pay the highest prices in the \nworld for prescription drugs and when one out of five Americans is \nunable to fill the prescriptions written by their doctors because drug \nprices are so high, what this legislation does is move us in exactly \nthe wrong direction. It would throw more than 17 million Americans off \nof health insurance by gutting the Affordable Care Act. So we have a \nhealth care crisis, and this bill makes the crisis much worse.\n  Every other major country on Earth guarantees health care for all of \ntheir people as a right, but this bill would add 17 million more \nAmericans to the ranks of the uninsured, creating a situation in which \nwe would have 46 million Americans without any health insurance at all.\n  I think any sensible person would ask an obvious question: What \nhappens to people who lose their health insurance? How many of those \npeople will get much sicker than they otherwise would have because they \nare unable to go to a doctor when they need to go? How many of those \npeople will not be able to get the prescription drugs they need? In \nfact, how many of those people will die? Let's be frank. When we throw \n17 million people off of health insurance, people will die because they \ndon't go to a doctor when they should and they don't go to the hospital \nwhen they should.\n  We know that before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, 45,000 \nAmericans died each year because they lacked health insurance and \ndidn't get to a doctor in time. I have talked to many doctors in \nVermont and throughout this country who tell me that yes, of course, \npeople walk into their door much sicker than they should have been.\n  When the doctor asks, ``Why didn't you come 6 months ago when you \nwere sick?'' patients say, ``I didn't have any health insurance and I \ncouldn't come.'' By the time they walk in the door, too often it is too \nlate. That is not what should be happening in America, but that is what \nwill increasingly happen if this legislation were to pass.\n  In the United States of America, when a person is sick, that person \nshould be able to access health care and see a doctor. That is not a \nradical idea. And when a person goes to the hospital, that person \nshould not end up in bankruptcy.\n  Instead of throwing 17 million Americans off of health insurance, \nwhat we should be doing is expanding on the improvements of the \nAffordable Care Act to make health care a right of all people, not just \na privilege.\n  Further, let's be clear--and I think everybody here in the Senate \nunderstands this--the bill we are debating today is a complete waste of \ntime. This is just another reason why the American people have so \nlittle respect for the Congress. There are major crises facing our \ncountry, and the Republican leadership is once again attempting to \nrepeal ObamaCare. I kind of lost track of how many times this effort \nhas been made. I think in the House it is over 50. I don't know how \nmany it is here in the Senate. Let me break the news to my Republican \ncolleagues, although I am sure they already got the news: President \nObama is not going to sign a bill repealing ObamaCare. I think that is \nnot likely to happen. And what we are doing today is just a waste of \ntime.\n  Let's also be clear--this bill doesn't just gut the Affordable Care \nAct, it also eliminates funding for Planned Parenthood, which provides \nhealth care services to nearly 3 million women each and every year.\n  Last week three people were killed and nine were wounded at a \nshooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, CO. While \nwe still don't have all of the details as to what motivated the \nshooter, what is clear is that Planned Parenthood has been the subject \nof vicious and unsubstantiated statements attacking an organization \nthat provides critical care for millions of Americans and, in fact, \nprovides very high quality care.\n  I, for one, strongly support Planned Parenthood and the work it is \ndoing. In my view, instead of trying to defund Planned Parenthood, we \nshould be expanding funding so that every woman in this country gets \nthe health care she needs.\n  It is also my sincere hope that people throughout this country, \nincluding my colleagues here in the Senate and across the Capitol in \nthe House, understand that bitter, vitriolic rhetoric can have serious, \nunintended consequences.\n  Now is not the time to continue a witch hunt for an organization that \nprovides critical health care services--from reproductive health care, \nto cancer screenings and preventive services--to millions of Americans. \nNo one is forced to seek care at Planned Parenthood. It is a choice--a \nchoice millions of women make freely and proudly.\n  This legislation is not only bad legislation and it is not only a \nwaste of time because if it passes, it will be vetoed, but what it also \ntells the American people is that the Republican leadership is not \nprepared to discuss or to address the major crises facing our country.\n  Just today a report came out stating that the top 20 wealthiest \npeople in this country own more wealth than the bottom half of the \nAmerican people--20 people on one side and 150 million people on the \nother. The level of wealth inequality in America is grotesque and \nunacceptable. Not one word in this bill addresses that issue.\n  Today in America, millions of our people are working longer hours for \nlower wages. They are working two or three jobs just to survive. Yet 58 \npercent of all new income created is going to the top 1 percent. Is \nthere anything in this legislation that would raise wages for millions \nof American workers who are struggling to keep their families solvent?\n  This is a bad piece of legislation. It is a piece of legislation that \nis not going to go anyplace because it is going to be vetoed, and it is \na piece of legislation that I think speaks to why the American people \nare giving up in so many ways on the political process. People are \nstruggling all over this country. They are hurting. They are working \nlonger hours for lower wages. They can't afford to send their kids to \ncollege. They can't afford childcare. They are worried about high \nunemployment. This bill attempts to repeal ObamaCare. That is where we \nare.\n  I hope very strongly that this bill is defeated. If it is not \ndefeated, I hope and expect the President will veto it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 30 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me take my colleagues back 5\\1/2\\ \nyears to February 25, 2010, and the White House health care summit at \nthe Blair House--the same place where Senator Arthur Vandenberg sat \ndown with George Marshall. They met privately to discuss the postwar \nplans after World War II. The result of that discussion became the \nMarshall Plan. It was the perfect setting--it is the perfect setting \nfor a serious, bipartisan discussion for how to improve health care for \nAmericans.\n  Thirty-six Members of Congress went to the Blair House that day at \nthe invitation of President Obama. We were there to discuss the health \ncare bill passed by the Democrats, what is now known as Obamacare. We \nstayed there all day. The President stayed there too. It was televised \ncontinuously. Both then-Minority Leader Boehner and Republican Leader \nMcConnell asked me to lead off in speaking for Republicans.\n  I said to the President that day that I was there not only to \nrepresent the view of Republicans but that I was there also as a former \nGovernor and that I would like to have a chance to speak for the \nGovernors as well because Governors managing States had a big stake in \nall of this.\n  I also said that I was at the summit to represent the views of a \ngreat many of the American people who have tried to say in every way \nthey knew how--through town meetings, through surveys, through \nelections in Virginia and New Jersey and Massachusetts--that they \noppose the health care bill that was passed in the Senate in the middle \nof a snowstorm on Christmas Eve.\n  I warned the President then about the unfortunate consequences of \nObamacare for millions of Americans. I said to the President that this \nwould send an unfunded Medicaid mandate to States. I said:\n\n\n[[Page S8213]]\n\n\n  \n\n       ``It will cut Medicare by about half a trillion dollars and \n     spend most of that on new programs. . . . It means there will \n     be about a half trillion dollars of new taxes in it. It means \n     that for millions of Americans, premiums will go up, because \n     when people pay those new taxes, premiums will go up, and \n     they will also go up because of the government mandates.''\n\n  That is what I said 5\\1/2\\ years ago. I said directly to the \nPresident then that instead of this partisan plan passed without the \nsupport of a single Republican in the Senate, we Republicans were \nprepared to work with him to reform health care. I said 5\\1/2\\ years \nago to the President that we need to start over and go step-by-step in \na different direction toward the goal of reducing health care costs. I \nsaid then that this means working together in the way that General \nMarshall and Senator Vandenberg did following World War II, and it \nmeans going step-by-step together to re-earn the trust of the American \npeople. Those were my words to the President of the United States at \nthe health care summit 5\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  The President and the congressional Democrats listened all day, but \nthey didn't take any of my advice and hardly any of the advice of my \nRepublican colleagues about what the disastrous outcomes of Obamacare \nwould be. So now, 5\\1/2\\ years after the law was passed and 2 years \ninto its implementation, we can say one thing without question: The \nunfortunate reality for the American people is that they are struggling \nwith Obamacare and that 5\\1/2\\ years ago Republicans were right.\n  Obamacare was and is an historic mistake. Republicans agreed with the \nPresident and his party that our health care system was broken. We \nagreed that it needed to be fixed, but we argued that the President was \nmoving in the wrong direction. What Obamacare did was to expand a \nbroken system that everyone knew was too expensive. Republicans said so \nat the summit in February of 2010, and the facts today show we were \nright.\n  Let's take a closer look at what Republicans said then, nearly 6 \nyears ago, and what unfortunately came true. Let's look also at what \nDemocrats predicted back then--or better put, what they promised--and \nwhich of their predictions and promises came true. Let's go through \nthem one by one.\n  First, Medicaid. During my opening remarks at the Blair House at the \nsummit, I said this: ``Nothing used to make me madder as Governor than \nwhen Washington politicians would get together, pass a bill, take \ncredit for it, and send me the bill to pay.'' That is exactly what \nObamacare does with the expansion of Medicaid. In addition, it dumps 15 \nto 18 million low-income Americans into a Medicaid program that none of \nus would want to be a part of because 50 percent of the doctors won't \nsee new patients. So it is like giving someone a ticket to a bus line \nwhen the bus runs only half the time.\n  That is what I said 5\\1/2\\ years ago. Medicaid had already always \nbeen one of the Federal Government's biggest unfunded mandates, and \nexpanding that mandate on States would only wreak more havoc on State \nbudgets that, especially at that time during the height of the \nrecession, were already struggling. Our former Tennessee Governor Phil \nBredesen, a Democrat, said that the proposed Medicaid expansion under \nObamacare would represent ``the mother of all unfunded mandates.''\n  When I was Governor of Tennessee in the 1980s, Medicaid made up only \nabout 8 percent of Tennessee's State budget. By last year it was 30.6 \npercent. States paying more and more to expand Medicaid means having \nless to spend on other priorities like higher education, roads, and \nschools. In 2012, I said that over the prior 10 years, Tennessee's \nMedicaid costs had gone up 43 percent, forcing the State to decrease \nits funding to colleges and universities by 11 percent. As a result, \ntuition went up 120 percent over those 10 years.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the law will add $14 \nmillion new beneficiaries to struggling State Medicaid programs by \n2025, at an extra cost of $46 billion to States and $847 billion to \nFederal taxpayers by 2025. Why is that so bad? I said at the time--and \nit is still true today--Medicaid's reimbursement rates are so low that \nonly about one-half of the doctors will even see Medicaid patients and \nmany of those aren't accepting new ones. It is not hard to see why \nexpanding a failed program isn't good for Americans who need better \nhealth care.\n  Another thing to consider is that States still haven't had to pay yet \nfor covering the new Medicaid enrollees under the expansion. The \nFederal Government promised to pay 100 percent for the first few years, \nbut starting in 2017--in just a couple of years--States will have to \nstart paying 5 percent and eventually up to 10 percent in 2020. That \nmay not seem like much in Washington terms, but it is a lot of money in \nState budgets. States may have to start raising income taxes or gas \ntaxes or find some other place to find the money. Regardless of how it \nis paid for, expanding Medicaid puts a huge dent in State budgets. Does \nthat mean less money for teachers' salaries? Does that mean tuition is \ngoing to have to go even higher at community colleges and State \nuniversities?\n  Tennessee hasn't expanded Medicaid, but in its proposal to expand the \nprogram called Insure Tennessee, Governor Haslam anticipated an \nadditional $35.6 million in costs to the State in 2017. In Illinois, \nMedicaid expansion will cost the State $208 million in 2020. In \nKentucky's expansion, the State will have to pay $74 million in 2017 \nand an estimated $363 million in 2021. Governor-elect Bevin hasn't \nstarted looking for ways to pay for that increase yet because he plans \nto try to repeal it. If you look at the figures you can see why he is \nthinking about it. We were right about Obamacare's enormous impact on \nMedicaid and in turn Medicaid's huge negative effect on State budgets.\n  Second, higher premiums. When my turn came at the White House summit, \nthis is what I said directly to the President: ``The Congressional \nBudget Office report says that premiums will rise in the individual \nmarket'' as a result of Obamacare. The President turned to me and said \nI was wrong about that.\n  A little bit later in the day, I gave the President a letter from the \nCongressional Budget Office showing that they predicted I would be \nright, that new non-group policies would be about 10 to 13 percent \nhigher in 2016 than the average for non-group coverage in that same \nyear under the current law. In that same letter, I reminded the \nPresident, that his own Chief Actuary for the Centers for Medicare & \nMedicaid Services agreed with the Congressional Budget Office.\n  You might be thinking that things would have turned out better than \nwhat I, the Congressional Budget Office, the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, and the Chief Actuary for CMS had predicted, but we all, \nunfortunately, were right. We were all right. Obamacare's premiums were \nand are higher for Americans with individual health care plans. We are \ntalking about nearly 16 million Americans who purchase these individual \nplans. They buy these policies for themselves, and the cost of these \nplans is going through the roof.\n  On June 1, 2015, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \nannounced that nearly 700 individual and small-group health plans in 41 \nStates plus the District of Columbia had requested double-digit premium \nincreases for 2016. In Tennessee, the rate hike was 36 percent; in \nMaryland, 26 percent. On average, 2016 premium increases for Oregon's \nbiggest insurer on the State health exchange will be over 25 percent; \nfor some smaller providers, more than 30 percent; for South Dakotans, \nthe will pay 63 percent higher premiums for health insurance through \nthe exchange. The list of States experiencing health care spikes goes \non.\n  A recent report of the National Bureau of Economic Research confirmed \nthis, going back to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which \npredicted in 2010 the premiums would go up. They said recently that \npremiums on the Obamacare exchange will increase by 6 percent on \naverage every year between 2016 and 2024. Yet 5\\1/2\\ years ago, the \nPresident and congressional Democrats told Republicans time and time \nagain during the debate that we were wrong, that the law would decrease \npremiums, when in fact our predictions, the administration's own \nestimates, estimates from the National Bureau of Economic Research and \nthe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, all confirmed premiums for \nindividual policies are going through the roof.\n  Third, Republicans said 5\\1/2\\ years ago that Obamacare would \nincrease taxes.\n\n[[Page S8214]]\n\nIt did. Obamacare added 21 tax increases to the Tax Code. That is $1 \ntrillion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. A \ndozen of these target middle-income Americans, in clear violation of \nwhat the President had promised.\n  Then there was our fourth prediction: Obamacare will cost jobs. A few \nyears after the law passed, I met with a large group of chief \nexecutives of restaurant companies in America. The service and \nhospitality industries are the largest employers in our country. \nUsually their employees are low-income, usually minority Americans.\n  In the meeting, the chief executive of Ruby Tuesday, Inc., which has \nabout 800 restaurants, said to me--and said he didn't mind being \nquoted--that the cost to his company of implementing the new health \ncare law was equal to or more than his net profit for that year, and as \na result, he wasn't planning to build any new restaurants in the United \nStates.\n  An even larger restaurant company represented at the meeting said \nthat because of their analysis of the law, instead of operating their \nstore with 90 employees, their goal would be to operate it with 70 \nemployees. That means fewer employees and fewer jobs because of \nObamacare.\n  More recently, another franchise business which has 550 employees \ntold me: We have already begun cutting the hours of our employees to \nget well below the 30-hour threshold, and all of our new job postings \nare for part-time employees.\n  This has a bad effect on the employer-employee relations, and, as \nmany Tennesseans have told me, 30 hours of work isn't enough to support \na family. Those lost hours are because of Obamacare.\n  These are just a few examples of basic economics. It heaps costs on \nemployers. They have less money to expand, so there is less money to \nhire workers. They heap on even higher costs. They cut hours. With \nhigher costs, they lay off employees. We have seen all three as a \nresult of the employer mandate that says employers with more than 50 \nfull-time employees need to provide health insurance.\n  What is more, Obamacare went a step further and for the first time in \nour history defined ``full time'' as a 30-hour workweek. I asked the \nformer Democratic chairman of our HELP Committee: Where did that come \nfrom? France? Nobody knew where that came from. Full-time work in the \nUnited States has not been typically considered 30 hours, but it is in \nObamacare. It is causing large numbers of employees to work only 28 or \n29 hours because their employers can't afford to hire them as full-time \nemployees.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has projected that Obamacare will \nresult in 2 million fewer jobs in 2017 and 2.5 million fewer full-time \njobs by 2024. At least 450 employers across the Nation, including 100 \nschool districts, have said Obamacare forced them to cut positions or \nreduce worker hours.\n  What we Republicans said would happen years ago was this: that \nMedicaid would destroy State budgets--it did; that premiums and taxes \nwould go up--they have; and that jobs would be lost--they have. It has \nall, unfortunately, come true.\n  What did President Obama and congressional Democrats promise us about \nthis law at about the time of the health care summit 5\\1/2\\ years ago? \nWere they right or were they wrong? One of the most infamous promises, \nwhich PolitiFact named--and I will use their words--as the 2013 ``Lie \nof the Year,'' was the President's ``If you like your plan, you can \nkeep it.''\n  When Obamacare was fully implemented in 2014, millions of Americans \nlearned very quickly that they wouldn't be able to keep the plans they \nliked.\n  In October 2013, I received a letter from a woman, Emilie, whom I \nmet. She lives in Middle Tennessee, and she has lupus. She was one of \n16,000 Tennesseans who were part of a plan called CoverTN. She wrote me \nabout her chronic illness. She said she was deemed uninsurable and that \nthe only way to insure her was through CoverTN. She was glad to have \nthat coverage, and she was glad to hear about Obamacare. Then she \nlearned the truth:\n\n       ``I cannot keep my current plan because it does not meet \n     the standards of coverage. This alone is a travesty. CoverTN \n     has been a lifeline [for me].\n       With the discontinuation of CoverTN, I am being forced to \n     purchase a plan . . . that will increase [my costs] by a \n     staggering 410%. My out of pocket expense will increase by \n     more than $6,000.00 a year. Please help me understand how \n     this is `affordable.' ''\n\n  This was Emilie in Middle Tennessee.\n  We could spend all day telling stories of Americans who liked their \nhealth care plans but weren't able to keep them under Obamacare.\n  In November 2013 that looked as if it might be as many as 5 million \nAmericans. The administration then did some last-minute regulatory \nfixes and lowered that number. But still, many Americans lost their \nplans, as Emilie did.\n  The President also said:\n\n       ``Medicare is a government program. But don't worry: I'm \n     not going to touch it.''\n\n  The problem was he did touch it; $700 billion worth was taken from \nMedicare to finance Obamacare.\n  I said during the debate in 2009 that Obamacare would cut ``grandma's \nMedicare to spend on somebody other than grandma--a new entitlement \nprogram.'' I said Obamacare would do that at a time when the Medicare \ntrustees have told us that Medicare is going broke if we don't fix it. \nThat is their job to tell us that. I said then: ``I think what they are \nsaying to us is if you are going to cut grandma's Medicare, you ought \nto at least spend it on grandma instead of spending it on somebody \nelse.''\n  Again, the President went against the promise he repeated over and \nover and raided a program that serves over 55 million older Americans.\n  In summary, unfortunately Republicans were right when we said 5\\1/2\\ \nyears ago that Obamacare would force spikes in State Medicaid spending, \nincrease premiums and taxes, and hurt jobs. As right as we were, the \nDemocrats were wrong. They said that you could keep your plan if you \nliked it, and they were wrong about that. They said Medicare wouldn't \nbe affected, and they were wrong about that.\n  Finally, we all agreed that health care needed to be fixed. So how \ndid we end up with a law that was such an historic mistake? Well, one \nbig reason is the debate over Obamacare wasn't really a debate. If it \nhad been, we might not find ourselves in a mess today.\n  The Senate Democratic leader then had a filibuster-proof majority. He \ndidn't think he needed Republican ideas; so they didn't take them. They \npassed a Democratic bill. They voted for it; we voted against it. We \nsat here in a snowstorm on Christmas Eve when they had 60 votes, and \nthey unveiled a bill filled to the brim with items from each Democratic \nMembers' wish list.\n  Along with our warnings about what would happen, we offered a lot of \nthoughtful ideas about how to fix the health care system in a way that \nwe thought would lower costs and expand access, while making sure \npatients didn't lose control over their own health care. But Democrats \nalso had a majority in the House. They had a Democratic President. They \ndidn't need our ideas, and so we got Obamacare.\n  So what do we Republicans have to offer Americans?\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator has 9 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Presiding Officer. I will wrap up. I see \nthe Senator from Washington on the floor.\n  Throughout the Obamacare debate, Senator McConnell, who was the \nminority leader at the time, was criticized for not coming up with a \ncomprehensive plan of his own. We told the President and the \ncongressional Democrats not to hold their breath waiting for \n``McConnell Care.'' Don't hold your breath waiting for Senator \nMcConnell to come down to the Senate floor with a wheelbarrow filled \nwith a 2,700-page bill of his own, because that is not how we believe \nthe health care system ought to be fixed. We are policy sceptics. We \ndoubt that anyone in Washington--Republicans, Democrats, Independents--\nhave the wisdom to fix such a complex system everywhere in America all \nat once.\n  The wisest course would be to try to fix our health care system step \nby step in a way that emphasizes more choices and lower costs. This \napproach to health care reform is not something\n\n[[Page S8215]]\n\nthat Republicans cooked up last month. In fact, if you examine the \nCongressional Record, you will find that Republican Senators proposed a \nstep-by-step approach to confronting our Nation's health care problems \nand other challenges 173 different times on the floor of the Senate \nduring the year 2009. Some 173 times we talked about our step-by-step \ndifferent direction for health care--almost none of which was included \nin Obamacare because they had the votes and they didn't need our ideas.\n  I had hoped the President would listen to us and work with us at \nBlair House, emphasize more freedom, more choices and lower costs. But \nthat didn't happen. We suggested allowing individuals to buy a health \ncare plan in any State that meets their needs. We suggested reducing \njunk lawsuits against doctors, which only increase costs. We suggested \nexpanding health savings accounts and other mechanisms, allowing \nindividuals to control how they spend their own health care dollars. We \nsuggested returning power to the States to regulate their own markets \nand lower costs. We suggested allowing small businesses to assist \nemployees in purchasing the insurance and look at other ways to support \nemployers offering health care benefits to their employees. We had \nspecific legislative proposals to do these things. We suggested \nlowering barriers at the Food and Drug Administration so that \ninnovative drugs and devices could get to the market faster and putting \nthe health sector in charge of health information technology. We \nsuggested insuring Americans with pre-existing conditions in a way \nthrough high-risk pools and other insurance incentives. And there are \nmany other ideas that we thought then and we think now we could work \ntogether on in a bipartisan way to lower costs, to increase access, and \nto put patients back in charge of their own health care.\n  This week, though, we are talking about repealing Obamacare, but for \nthe last 6 years we have also been talking about a completely different \npath of providing health care at a lower cost to more Americans. Those \nsteps were outlined in 2009, 2010, and 2011, and they are the same \nsteps that we should be taking today.\n  I have been saying since 2009 that the historic mistake with \nObamacare was that we had deliberately expanded a broken health care \nsystem that already cost too much instead of moving step by step to \ncreate a system where millions of Americans had choices of plans that \nfit their needs and fit their budgets.\n  The way we should accomplish this is the same way we passed Medicare, \nthe same way we passed Social Security, the same way the Congress \npassed the Civil Rights Act, and in the same way--I hope and the \nSenator from Washington hopes--we will pass a broad reauthorization of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act in the next couple of weeks. \nNone of this is done by cramming a bill down the throats of the \nAmerican people with 60 votes during a snowstorm on Christmas Eve.\n  I renew our invitation to the President of the United States, and if \nhe doesn't accept our invitation, to the next President of the United \nStates.\n  To our colleagues on the other side of the aisle: Let's forget about \nparty; let's forget about this side or that side. Let's side with the \nAmerican people whose premiums have gone up, who lost plans they like, \nwhose Medicare has been raided, whose State budgets have been \ndestroyed, and whose jobs have been lost. Work with Republicans in \nCongress to fix the damage Obamacare has done to health care in \nAmerica. Work with us to replace Obamacare with real reforms at lower \ncosts so more Americans can afford to buy insurance.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nmy comments at the health care summit in February of 2010 and the \nletter that I handed to President Obama following our debate at the \nhealth care summit in 2010.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [Thursday, February 25, 2010]\n\n  Alexander Gives Republican Health Care Remarks at White House Summit\n\n\n Outlines Republican Steps to Fix Health Care, Challenges Democrats to \n                   Take Reconciliation Off the Table\n\n       Washington.--U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), \n     chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, today delivered \n     the following opening remarks on behalf of Republican members \n     of Congress attending the White House health care summit:\n       ``Mr. President, thank you very much for the invitation. \n     Several of us were a part of the summits that you had a year \n     ago, and so I've been asked to try to express what \n     Republicans believe about where we've gotten since then. As a \n     former governor, I also want to try to represent governors' \n     views, because they have a big stake in this; I know you met \n     with some governors just in the last few days. We also \n     believe that our views represent the views of a great number \n     of the American people who have tried to say in every way \n     they know how--through town meetings, through surveys, \n     through elections in Virginia and New Jersey and \n     Massachusetts, that they oppose the health care bill that \n     passed the Senate on Christmas Eve.\n       ``And more importantly, we believe we have a better idea. \n     And that's to take many of the examples that you just \n     mentioned about health care costs and make that our goal: \n     reducing health care costs. We need to start over and go step \n     by step toward that goal. And we would like to briefly \n     mention--others will talk more about it as we go along--what \n     those ideas are.\n       ``I would like to begin with a story. When I was elected \n     governor, some of the media went up to the Democratic leaders \n     in the legislature and said, `What are you going to do with \n     this new young Republican governor?' And they said, `We're \n     going help him, because if he succeeds, our state succeeds.' \n     And they did that--that's the way we worked for eight years. \n     But often, they had to persuade me to change my direction to \n     get our state where it needed to go. I would like to say the \n     same thing to you. I mean, we want you to succeed. Because if \n     you succeed, our country succeeds. But we would like \n     respectfully to change the direction you're going on health \n     care costs, and that's what I want to mention here the in \n     next few minutes.\n       ``I was trying to think if there were any kind of event \n     that this could be compared with. And I was thinking of the \n     Detroit Auto Show, that if you had invited us out to watch \n     you unveil the latest model that you and your engineers had \n     created, and asked us to help sell it to the American people. \n     When we look at it, it's the same model we saw last year. We \n     didn't like it, and neither did they, because we don't think \n     it gets us where we need to go, and we can't afford it. As \n     they also say in Detroit, `We think we have a better idea.'\n       ``Your stories are a lot like the stories I heard when I \n     went home for Christmas after we had 25 days of consecutive \n     debate and voted on Christmas Eve on health care. A friend of \n     mine from Tullahoma, Tennessee, said, `I hope you'll kill \n     that health care bill.' Then before the words rattled out of \n     his mouth, he said, `But, we've got to do something about \n     health care costs. My wife has breast cancer. She got it 11 \n     years ago and our insurance is $2,000 a month. We couldn't \n     afford it if our employer weren't helping us do that. So \n     we've got to do something.' That's where we are, but to do \n     that, we have to start by taking the current bill and putting \n     it on the shelf and starting from a clean sheet of paper.\n       ``Now, you have presented ideas. There's an 11-page memo--I \n     think it's important for the people to understand that \n     there's not a presidential bill; there are good suggestions \n     and ideas on the web. It's a lot like the Senate bill. It has \n     more taxes, more subsidies, more spending. So what that means \n     is, when it's written, it will be 2,700 pages, more or less. \n     It will probably have a lot of surprises in it. It means it \n     will cut Medicare by about half a trillion dollars and spend \n     most of that on new programs, not on Medicare and making it \n     stronger, even though it's going broke in 2015. It means \n     there will be about a half trillion dollars of new taxes in \n     it. It means that for millions of Americans, premiums will go \n     up, because when people pay those new taxes, premiums will go \n     up, and they will also go up because of the government \n     mandates. It means that from a governor's point of view, it's \n     going to be what our Democratic governor calls the `mother of \n     all unfunded mandates.'\n       ``Nothing used to make me madder as a governor than when \n     Washington politicians would get together, pass a bill, take \n     credit for it, and send me the bill to pay. That's exactly \n     what this does, with the expansion of Medicaid. In addition, \n     it dumps 15 to 18 million low-income Americans into a \n     Medicaid program that none of us want to be a part of, \n     because 50 percent of doctors won't see new patients. So it's \n     like giving someone a ticket to a bus line where the buses \n     only run half the time.\n       ``When fully implemented, the bill would spend about $2.5 \n     trillion a year, and it still has sweetheart deals in it--one \n     is out, some are still in. What's fair about taxpayers in \n     Louisiana paying less than taxpayers in Tennessee? What's \n     fair about protecting seniors in Florida and not protecting \n     seniors in California and Illinois and Wyoming?\n       ``Our view, with all respect, is that this is a car that \n     can't be recalled and fixed, and that we ought to start over. \n     But we'd like to start over. When I go down to the Senate \n     floor, I've been there a lot on this issue, some of my \n     Democratic friends will say, `Well, Lamar, where's the \n     Republican comprehensive bill?' And I say back, `Well, if it\n\n[[Page S8216]]\n\n     you're waiting for Mitch McConnell to roll in a wheelbarrow \n     with a 2,700-page Republican comprehensive bill, it's not \n     going to happen because we have come to the conclusion \n     Congress doesn't do comprehensive well.' We have watched \n     the comprehensive economy-wide, cap and trade; we have \n     watched the comprehensive immigration bill, we have the \n     best Senators we have got working on that in a bipartisan \n     way; we have watched the comprehensive health care bill. \n     And they fall of their own weight.\n       ``Our country is too big, too complicated, too \n     decentralized for Washington to write a few rules about \n     remaking 17 percent of the economy all at once. That sort of \n     thinking works in a classroom, but it doesn't work very well \n     in our big, complicated country. It doesn't work for most of \n     us and if you look around the table--and I'm sure it's true \n     on the Democratic side--we have got shoe store owners and \n     small business people and former county judges and we've got \n     three doctors. We've got people who are used to solving \n     problems, step by step.\n       ``That's why we said `step by step' 173 times on the Senate \n     floor in the last six months of last year in support of our \n     step-by-step plan for reducing health care costs. I would \n     like to just mention those in a sentence or two:\n       First, you mentioned Mike Enzi's work on the small business \n     health care plan. That's a good start. It came up in the \n     Senate. He will explain why it covers more people, costs \n     less, and helps small businesses offer insurance.\n       Two, helping Americans buy insurance across state lines. \n     You've mentioned that yourself. Most of the governors I've \n     talked to think that would be a good way to increase \n     competition.\n       Number three, put an end to junk lawsuits against doctors. \n     In our state, half the counties' pregnant women have to drive \n     to the big city to have prenatal health care or to have their \n     baby, because the medical malpractice suits have driven up \n     the insurance policies so high that doctors leave the rural \n     counties.\n       Number four, give states incentives to lower costs.\n       Number five, expanding health savings accounts.\n       Number six, House Republicans have some ideas about how my \n     friend in Tullahoma can continue to afford insurance for his \n     wife who has had breast cancer; because she has a preexisting \n     condition, it makes it more difficult to buy insurance.\n       ``So there're six ideas--they're just six steps. Maybe the \n     first six, but combined with six others and six more and six \n     others, they get us in the right direction.\n       ``Now, some say we need to rein in the insurance companies; \n     maybe we do. But I think it's important to note if we took \n     all of the profits of the health insurance companies entirely \n     away, every single penny of it, we could pay for two days of \n     health insurance for Americans. And that would leave 363 days \n     with costs that are too high. So that's why we continue to \n     insist that as much as we want to expand access and to do \n     other things in health care, that we shouldn't expand a \n     system that's this expensive, that the best way to increase \n     access is to reduce costs.\n       ``Now, in conclusion, I have a suggestion and a request for \n     how to make this a bipartisan and truly productive session. \n     And I hope that those who are here will agree, I've got a \n     pretty good record of working across party lines, and of \n     supporting the president when I believe he's right, even \n     though other members of my party might not on that occasion. \n     And my request is this: before we go further today, that the \n     Democratic Congressional leaders and you, Mr. President, \n     renounce this idea of going back to the Congress and jamming \n     your bill through on a partisan vote through a little-used \n     process we call reconciliation.\n       ``You can say that this process has been used before, and \n     that would be right, but it's never been used for anything \n     like this. It's not appropriate to use to rewrite the rules \n     for 17 percent of the economy. Senator Byrd, who is the \n     constitutional historian of the Senate, has said that it \n     would be an outrage to run the health care bill through the \n     Senate like a freight train with this process. The Senate is \n     the only place where the rights to the minority are \n     protected, and sometimes, as Senator Byrd has said, the \n     minority can be right.\n       ``I remember reading Alexis de Tocqueville's book Democracy \n     in America, in which he said that the greatest threat to the \n     American democracy would be the `tyranny of the majority.'\n       ``When Republicans were trying to change the rules a few \n     years ago, you and I were both there. Senator McCain was very \n     involved in that--getting a majority vote for judges. Then-\n     Senator Obama said the following, `What we worry about is \n     essentially having two chambers, the House and the Senate, \n     who are simply majoritarian, absolute power on either side. \n     That's just not what the founders intended.' Which is another \n     way to saying that the founders intended the Senate to be a \n     place where the majority didn't rule on big issues.\n       ``Senator Reid in his book, writing about the `Gang of 14,' \n     said that the end of the filibuster requiring 60 votes to \n     pass a bill `would be the end of the United States Senate.' \n     And I think that's why Lyndon Johnson, in the '60s, wrote the \n     civil rights bill in Everett Dirksen's office, the Republican \n     Leader, because he understood that by having a bipartisan \n     bill, not only would pass it, but it would help the country \n     accept it. Senator Pat Moynihan has said before he died that \n     he couldn't remember a big piece of social legislation that \n     passed that wasn't bipartisan.\n       ``And after World War II, in this very house and in the \n     room back over here, Democratic President Truman's Secretary \n     of State, General Marshall, would meet once a week with \n     Senator Vandenberg, the Republican Chairman of the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee, and write the Marshall Plan. And \n     General Marshall said that sometimes Van was my right hand, \n     and sometimes he was his right hand.\n       ``And we know how [Congressmen] John Boehner and George \n     Miller did that on No Child Left Behind. [Senators] Mike Enzi \n     and Ted Kennedy wrote 35 bills together; you mentioned that \n     in your opening remarks. You and I and many other others \n     worked together on the America COMPETES Act. We know how to \n     do that--and we can do that on health care as well.\n       ``But to do that, we'll have to renounce jamming it through \n     in a partisan way. And if we don't, then the rest of what we \n     do today will not be relevant. The only thing bipartisan will \n     be the opposition to the bill, and we'll be saying to the \n     American people--who I've tried to say this in every way they \n     know how--town halls and elections and surveys--that they \n     don't want this bill, that they would like for us to start \n     over. So if we can do that--start over--we can write a health \n     care bill. It means putting aside jamming it through. It \n     means working together the way General Marshall and Senator \n     Vandenberg did. It means reducing health care costs and \n     making that our goal for now, not focusing on the other \n     goals. And it means going step by step together to re-earn \n     the trust of the American people. We would like to do that, \n     and we appreciate the opportunity that you have given us \n     today to say what our ideas are, and to move forward. Thank \n     you very much.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 25, 2010.\n     Hon. Barack Obama,\n     President, The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President, During today's discussion on health \n     care, you and I disagreed about whether the health care bill \n     that passed the Senate on a party-line vote on December 24 \n     would cause health insurance premiums to rise even faster \n     than if Congress did not act. I believe premiums will rise \n     because of independent analysis of the bill:\n       On November 30, the non-partisan Congressional Budget \n     Office (CBO) wrote in a letter to Senator Bayh that ``CBO and \n     JCT estimate that the average premium per person covered \n     (including dependents) for new nongroup policies would be \n     about 10 percent to 13 percent higher in 2016 than the \n     average premium for nongroup coverage in that same year under \n     current law.''\n       When you asserted that CBO says premiums will decline by 14 \n     to 20 percent under the Senate bill, you are leaving out an \n     important part of CBO's calculations. These reductions are \n     overwhelmed by a 27 to 30 percent increase in premiums due to \n     the mandated coverage requirements in the legislation. CBO \n     added those figures together to arrive at a net increase of \n     10 to 13 percent--as shown in their chart in that same \n     letter.\n       In that same letter, CBO wrote, ``The legislation would \n     impose several new fees on firms in the health sector. New \n     fees would be imposed on providers of health insurance and on \n     manufacturers and importers of medical devices. Both of those \n     fees would be largely passed through to consumers in the form \n     of higher premiums for private coverage.''\n       On December 10, the chief actuary for the Centers for \n     Medicare and Medicaid Services--who works for your \n     administration--concurred with the CEO. In his analysis, the \n     actuary said, ``We anticipate such fees would generally be \n     passed through to health consumers in the form of higher drug \n     and device prices and higher insurance premiums.'' He also \n     said, ``The additional demand for health services could be \n     difficult to meet initially with existing health provider \n     resources and could lead to price increases, cost-shifting, \n     and/or changes in providers' willingness to treat patients \n     with low-reimbursement health coverage.''\n       For these reasons, the Senate-passed bill will, indeed, \n     cause Americans' insurance premiums to rise, which is the \n     opposite of the goal I believe we should pursue.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                  Lamar Alexander.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, like many of my colleagues I am deeply \ndisappointed that Republican leaders have dedicated this week to \npartisan, political attacks rather than working with us to deliver \nresults to the families we represent. So I wish to take a few minutes \ntoday to talk about the work we could and should be doing and make \nclear again that Republican efforts to undermine families' health care \nare nothing but a dead end.\n  I am pleased that over the last few months Democrats and Republicans\n\n[[Page S8217]]\n\nhave been able to work together on some very important issues. We \npassed another bipartisan budget deal. We have worked on a bill \ntogether to fix the No Child Left Behind law that is broken, and \nRepublicans and Democrats are now working to pass a transportation bill \nthat would do a lot to help fix our crumbling infrastructure. But there \nis certainly a lot more that we should be doing to boost wages, to \nexpand opportunity, and to make sure our economy is growing from the \nmiddle out, not from the top down. I would hope that we would be \nworking on a way to raise the minimum wage or ensure that working \nparents can earn paid sick days or make higher education more \naffordable and accessible for our students.\n  With the holidays just around the corner, we should be focused on \nwhat struggling families need to make ends meet. Those are the kinds of \nissues I would like to be working on and many more, but instead \nRepublican leaders are insisting on tilting at tea party windmills by \ntrying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act for the umpteenth time.\n  This bill is not going to be signed into law. As we all know, this is \njust a political gesture here. But I want to be very clear about what \nit would mean for millions of men, women, and children across the \ncountry if this were to be signed into law. The policies that are being \nput forward could cause millions of people to lose their health care \ncoverage, make premiums skyrocket, increase costs for our hospitals and \nfor our providers, cut off support for important public health programs \nby repealing the prevention fund, and take us back to the bad old days \nwhen insurance companies, not patients, had all of the power.\n  Democrats believe strongly that while the Affordable Care Act was an \nhistoric step forward, the work did not end when the law passed--far \nfrom it.\n  We are willing to work with anyone on either side of the aisle who \nhas good ideas about how to build on the progress that has been made so \nfar and continue making health care more affordable, expanding \ncoverage, and improving quality of care for our families.\n  So it is very disappointing that Republicans instead continue to \ninsist that when it comes to health care, politics--not families--comes \nfirst. This is especially because--again to be very clear--this \nlegislation has no chance of becoming law. The very same is true when \nit comes to this latest attempt to cut off women's access to health \ncare.\n  After years of trying to turn back the clock on women's \nconstitutionally protected rights and to undermine Planned Parenthood, \nRepublicans should have gotten their fill of political attacks on \nwomen's health. Clearly, they have not.\n  In the wake of the tragedy in Colorado Springs last week, I have \nthought a lot about how important it is that we do more to insure \ncommunities are protected from that kind of violence and that we \ncontinue to stand with Planned Parenthood as it helps so many people--\nwomen and men--get the care they need.\n  So it is very frustrating that my Republican colleagues are doubling \ndown this week on their efforts to defund Planned Parenthood and get in \nbetween women and their health care. If Republicans were to succeed in \nthe bill they have before us in defunding Planned Parenthood--our \nNation's largest women's health care provider--with the legislation we \nare debating today, they would undermine a critical source of health \ncare that one in five women have relied on for cancer screenings, for \nHIV tests, and for so much more. They would make it harder for women to \nexercise their constitutionally protected right to make their own \nchoices about their own bodies and their own doctors.\n  By dismantling critical health care reforms, this proposal would \ncause millions of women to lose their health care coverage and access \nto everything from birth control to prenatal care. That is simply not \ngoing to happen--not on my watch, not on Democrats' watch, and not on \nPresident Obama's watch. Republicans may want to go back to the days \nwhen being a woman was a preexisting condition. They may see this \nentire bizarre effort as nothing more than a great opportunity to \npander to their extreme tea party base by attacking health care and \nPlanned Parenthood. But for millions of women and families, the \npolicies we are debating today are no political exercise; instead, if \nenacted, they would represent a deeply harmful step backward--a step \naway from building a health care system that is affordable, accessible, \nand high quality, one that contributes to economic security and \nopportunity.\n\n  Women and families have seen these extreme Republican attempts many \ntimes before, and, frankly, I think they have had enough. They don't \nwant Congress fighting over whether to roll back a law that has helped \nmillions of people get health care coverage and bolstered our Nation's \nhealth care system, a law that has been upheld time and time again by \nthe Supreme Court, and they believe firmly that politicians in Congress \nshould have better things to do than interfere with women's \nconstitutionally protected health care choices. I am sure they would \nrather see us working to actually improve health care and the many \nother challenges our country faces.\n  Democrats agree with that. We want to move health care forward, not \nbackward, for women and families, and we want to do the other important \nwork across the aisle to strengthen our economy and grow our middle \nclass. So today, as my Republican colleagues double down on their \npartisan political pandering, we on this side are going to continue to \nstand up for family health care and stand up for women and their rights \nevery step of the way. I hope my Republican colleagues will finally \ndrop the politics and join us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to address ObamaCare repeal. As I \nwas thinking about what I was going to say today, I went back and \nlooked at a speech I made on the House of Representatives floor on \nMarch 21, 2010. The previous speaker talked about the partisanship that \nshe perceives now. I thought it interesting. I am going to read just a \ncouple quotes from my speech then: ``[We are thinking about] this bill \nas a blanket, a blanket of health care legislation that may be draped \nacross America and its population in the coming years,'' which it has \nfor the last 4 years. I talk about how ``its cloth has been cut behind \nclosed doors and its color is tinged by partisan hands.'' That is the \nObamaCare legislation and the ObamaCare plan we have today. ``The huge \nholes will not protect the cold winds of job loss, new taxes, \ngovernment bureaucracy, and increased health care costs. . . . All of \nAmerica will feel the weight of this uncomfortable burden.'' Those were \nmy words on March 21, 2010, in the House of Representatives.\n  Today and later this week, the Senate will consider a bill to repeal \nthat bill, ObamaCare, a costly disaster that 4 years--5 years later we \nsee has cost countless people access to their doctors, access to the \nhealth care plan of their choice, and thousands of West Virginians from \nmy State have lost or had to change their coverage. We ought to ask the \nindividuals and families whose premiums and deductibles have \nskyrocketed and the small businesses that have been forced to cut hours \nand employees.\n  Let's consider the exchanges that are folding and the hospitals that \nare facing unmanageable costs. Even the Nation's largest health \ninsurance provider has threatened to pull out of ObamaCare, citing high \ncosts and growing risks. Just today, the CEO of that company said that \njoining ObamaCare was ``a bad decision.''\n  There has to be a better way, and we need to find it.\n  In the bill we are considering this week, the Senate will do two \nmajor things: It will repeal significant portions of the health care \nlaw that are not working. It will also provide a bridge to replace this \nlaw with an improved health care system. This ObamaCare repeal bill \nwill eliminate enforcement of the individual and employer mandates. It \nwill repeal $1 trillion--$1 trillion--in onerous taxes. It will save \nand strengthen Medicare. It will also dedicate resources to fight the \ngrowing drug epidemic that is sweeping across this country. Certainly \nin our\n\n[[Page S8218]]\n\nState of West Virginia we have had many difficulties, as many of our \nfellow Americans have.\n  ObamaCare has upended our health care system and has broken many of \nthe President's own promises. Headline after headline in recent weeks \nhas called attention to the increasing premiums Americans will face \nnext year. Across the Nation, rates for one out of every three \nObamaCare plans will double in the year 2016.\n  For plans that are not seeing huge premium increases, rising \ndeductibles are placing an excessive burden on patients--but not just \non patients; let's think about our health care providers, our \nhospitals, for example. When a patient has a high deductible and comes \nin for an expensive surgery, that patient has to pay a $4,000 or $5,000 \ndeductible. That is unaffordable for a lot of people, and that hospital \nis stuck with that bill.\n  The situation in my State is even worse. West Virginia is the only \nState in the country with only one insurer participating on the \nexchange. Remember, the President promised us choice and the ability to \nmake decisions for ourselves. We have one choice in West Virginia. \nHighmark Blue Cross Blue Shield has been the only company in the West \nVirginia exchange through the first 2 years of ObamaCare, and we \nrecently learned that it almost pulled out of the exchange for 2016. \nThat would have been disastrous for our constituents. And why are they \npulling out? Because they are losing millions of dollars on a health \ncare plan that was promised to be a blanket, to blanket all of us, as I \nsaid in the speech I gave in 2010. It has turned out to be a blanket \nwith huge holes.\n  With only one provider, choices and accesses are already limited, but \nfor many Americans, the exchanges set up under ObamaCare have become \ntheir only option. Because of increasing costs, many are now unable to \nafford the health insurance without subsidies.\n  While Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield--the exchange insurance in West \nVirginia--did remain in West Virginia, premiums are set to increase \nthis year or next year by 24 percent. These increases are well beyond \nthe financial reach of most West Virginians. Our unemployment in West \nVirginia has skyrocketed because of the President's energy policies, \nand now we are looking at hard-working West Virginians and telling them \ntheir health care that was supposed to be affordable and accessible is \ngoing up 24 percent. That is unconscionable.\n  As one of my constituents pointed out, ``This represents a \nsignificant challenge to our family budget as my husband's pay has not \nincreased at the rate that our health care costs continue to rise.''\n  What about ObamaCare's promise to lower the cost of health care? The \nreality is really quite different.\n  As another West Virginian put it, ``The law remains a failure by the \nadministration's own metrics, and its harmful impact continues to make \nlife more difficult for millions across the country.''\n  By repealing ObamaCare, we can revisit the problems caused by the \nhealth care law and the problems that existed before, replace them with \nreforms that work, and protect those whose coverage has been disrupted.\n  In order to ensure individuals do not lose access to current \ncoverage, this ObamaCare repeal bill will provide a 2-year transition \nperiod. This period will give us time to enact alternative reforms that \nwill provide access to quality, affordable care without disrupting \ncoverage. Health care reform should give States and individuals \nchoice--remember, in my State we don't have a choice; we have one \nprovider, no choice--while reducing health care costs over the long \nterm. Premiums are going up 24 percent, and deductibles are \nskyrocketing. That is not containing costs over the long term.\n  Americans deserve a health care system that works for them, and we \nknow ObamaCare is not it. There is a better way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, am I correct that we are in morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to talk about a \npiece of legislation that a number of us have filed. There will be \nseveral Senators speaking here later this afternoon about the Seniors \nAnd Veterans Emergency Benefits Act. It is a very important piece of \nlegislation to help millions of Americans who depend on Social Security \nbenefits to make ends meet. I want to emphasize that point. Much of the \nAmerican population does not realize that there are senior citizens \nwhose sole existence depends on the check they get from Social \nSecurity. Unfortunately, we have seniors who are facing the situation \nthat the price of food or some of their medicine unexpectedly goes up. \nHow could this be, in America in the year 2015? But it happens among \nsome of our senior citizens. In the last Congress I had the privilege \nof chairing the Special Committee on Aging. We held a number of \nhearings on this issue. It will break your heart, but that is going on \ntoday.\n  To add a little more drama and heartache to this, in October the \nSocial Security Administration announced that for the third time in the \npast 40 years, there will not be a cost-of-living adjustment for 2016. \nThat is under a formula, and it is legal. Since 1975, the cost-of-\nliving adjustment has ensured that the purchasing power of the Social \nSecurity benefits stays the same, regardless of rising prices or \ninflation. When we get to a point that the formula says no cost-of-\nliving adjustment for a senior citizen, that becomes a fairly big deal \nbecause 65 percent of all senior citizens depend on Social Security to \nprovide the majority of their cash income. It is real money that they \ndepend on to help make the basic expenses.\n  In my State, we have a higher percentage of the population who are \nsenior citizens--4 million Floridians that are categorized as senior \ncitizens because of their age. When there is not an adjustment on the \ncost-of-living adjustment, these folks are starting to feel the squeeze \nand are forced to sacrifice on something.\n  What a group of Senators are going to talk about and what I am \nsharing is that we are going to offer an opportunity to act before this \nno cost-of-living increase would take effect in January because 20 of \nus have sponsored legislation introduced by Senator Warren to fix the \nfact that there is a lack of a cost-of-living adjustment. I am glad to \nsee that Senator Warren is here. I could not join the distinguished \nSenator later on, so I took the liberty of going ahead and telling from \nmy point of view how this legislation is going to give to about 70 \nmillion Americans a one-time payment of approximately $580 to help them \nhave money for the basic needs, such as food or rent.\n  Nearly 4.5 million people in Florida--a little less than a quarter of \nthe State's population--would be eligible for that lump sum payment. \nNine million veterans who receive Social Security benefits would \nreceive a benefit under the bill. In my State, 323,000 veterans and \ntheir family members would get that benefit.\n  Forty percent of the seniors in the United States have incomes below \nthe poverty line if they do not have Social Security assistance. That \nis a shocking statement. Let me say that again. Forty percent of our \nsenior citizens in this country would have incomes below the poverty \nline if they did not have Social Security assistance. Therefore, this \nlegislation that we are filing would lift over 1 million people out of \npoverty.\n  To some, a benefit of $580 may seem insignificant, but in reality, it \nis going to make a difference to millions. It may not seem like a big \ndeal to a lot of people that there is no COLA, but if that senior \ncitizen does not have the money to pay for the rent, a utility bill, a \ntrip to the doctor or the groceries they need for their nutrition, that \n$580 is the difference.\n  Many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck and are forced to make\n\n[[Page S8219]]\n\nthese tough decisions. We ought to be making it easier for them. That \nis our job. There are no excuses. I intend to work with our colleagues \nto see if this is a possibility.\n  While Senator Warren is here, I wish to engage the Senator from \nMassachusetts and yield to her for an answer. As we sat on the Special \nCommittee on Aging, we heard the testimony of how dire, on the line, \nand on the razor's edge the income is for senior citizens with these \nSocial Security benefits. When that does not keep up with the cost of \nliving--surely there is a cost-of-living increase in one year over the \nother, but if their Social Security checks don't reflect that, does \nthat not invite a tremendous hardship on that elderly person?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, the answer is yes, it does. Senator Nelson \nhas put his finger on a very serious problem; that is, every year \nbecause of policies made here in the Senate, we do a calculation of \ncost-of-living changes for Social Security. The problem is that \ncalculation for cost-of-living changes is based on only about one-\nquarter of the population. It is not based on the whole population, and \nit is certainly not based just on those who receive Social Security.\n  We know from independent analysis that costs have gone up for \nseniors, but because of the policies made here in Congress, there will \nbe no cost-of-living increase for seniors this year. That means they \nface high costs. Yet, at the same time, they are going to have a flat \nincome.\n  The proposal here to give them a one-time payment of about $581 is \nenough to pay 3 months' worth of food bills for the average senior. It \nis enough to help cover the costs of prescription drugs that are not \ncovered by Medicare. These are significant differences for seniors who \nmost need it, and I appreciate Senator Nelson coming here early to talk \nabout and raise this important issue. He is exactly spot on about the \ndifficulty with this issue.\n\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Florida has \nexpired.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Therefore, I conclude by resting the case. If the cost of \nevery person's daily living is in fact going up and yet our formula \nshows that they get no cost-of-living adjustment, is that not putting a \nburden upon the ones who we should be respecting and protecting that \nshould not be there? We can do that with this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, soon we will be debating the future of \nObamaCare. The American people have told us they want Congress to \nrepeal this so-called health care law. They told us to start over with \nreal health care reform. This actually shouldn't be a very \ncontroversial vote. It is clear, even to the law's supporters, that the \nObama health care law has not worked out in any way they had \nspecifically expected. The ObamaCare health care law is collapsing, \nwhether the President wants to admit it or not.\n  Democrats should really be eager to join us to help fix the damage \nthat has been done by this law. So far they have been much more focused \non protecting President Obama's legacy than on protecting the American \npeople and the health of the American people from ObamaCare.\n  Last month President Obama did a radio show in which he was asked \nabout the law and about problems with the law because people all across \nthe country are seeing significant problems with the law. The President \nwould not admit to a single problem with this law. He insisted: ``It \nhas been a success.''\n  Well, I go home to Wyoming every weekend. I am a doctor. I practiced \nmedicine in Wyoming for 25 years, and the people whom I talk to--my \npatients, my neighbors, people all around the State, and the people \nwhom I run into in my travels--do not consider ObamaCare a success.\n  Democrats come to the floor and say: It is OK that insurance rates \nare rising. Remember when the President said they would go down by \n$2,500 per family? The Democrats say it is OK that the insurance rates \nare rising because they say the rates also went up before the law. What \nthey won't tell you is that premiums aren't just going up a little; \nthey are going up a lot next year. Actually, they are going through the \nroof.\n  There was a study by the McKinsey Center for U.S. Health System \nReform. They found that the median increase for the bronze plans went \nup 13 percent from this year to next year. That is just the average. \nThat means for half of the people, they are going to pay more than \nthat. The silver plan is up 11 percent, the platinum plan is up 12 \npercent, and the gold plan is up 15 percent. These double-digit price \nincreases are not a success.\n  Democrats have come to the floor and have talked about some of the \npeople who have gotten insurance coverage since the law took effect. \nWhat they won't tell you is that having insurance coverage is not the \nsame thing as getting medical care.\n  The New York Times ran an article about 2 weeks ago with this \nheadline: ``Many Say High Deductibles Make Their Health Law Insurance \nAll But Useless.'' They don't even call it health insurance. They call \nit health law insurance because it is insurance to comply with the law \nand not to actually give you the health care. It is astonishing. Even \nthe New York Times calls it health law insurance.\n  The article tells the story about David Reines from Jefferson \nTownship, NJ. He is 60 years old and has a history of chronic knee \npain. This man says: ``The deductible, $3,000 a year, makes it \nimpossible to actually go to a doctor.'' He says: ``We have insurance, \nbut can't afford to use it.''\n  President Obama, this is not a success. Democrats who support the \nhealth care law say that it created these marketplaces where people can \nshop for insurance. What they won't tell you is that companies have \nbeen pulling out of the marketplaces and exchanges all across the \ncountry. More than half of the State co-ops have gone out of business \nand have failed. The largest health insurance company in America says \nthat it may drop out of the program entirely next year.\n  In Wyoming, there is just one company participating in the ObamaCare \nexchange. That is the choice on the Wyoming exchange--one. Does \nPresident Obama consider that a success? Democrats say a lot of people \nlike their insurance plans. Well, they won't tell you about the Gallup \npoll last month that found that the American people are far from happy. \nJust 33 percent of Americans said that the health care coverage in this \ncountry is either excellent or good--one out of three. Only one out of \nfive is satisfied with the total cost of their health care.\n  Now, both of these numbers are worse than they were when President \nObama took office. When asked: How are you going now compared to where \nyou were when Barack Obama moved into the White House, people will tell \nyou that when it comes to health care, it is worse.\n  Another survey last month by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that \njust 38 percent of Americans have a favorable opinion of the health \ncare law. Is that the way President Obama measures success? Is that \nwhat he calls a success?\n  Why won't the Democrats come to the floor and talk about these \nsurveys? Democrats come down to the floor and say that ObamaCare has \nput millions of people on Medicaid. I am not sure how many of them have \na full understanding of Medicaid. As a doctor who practiced medicine \nfor 24 years, I can tell you a lot about Medicaid. They won't say \nanything about this failed program. They won't admit to the fact that \nMedicaid is a failed program.\n\n[[Page S8220]]\n\n  A new study last month found that cancer patients with Medicaid in \nCalifornia--we have 2 Senators from California who voted for this law--\nare less likely to get recommended treatment and they have a lower \nsurvival rate than people with other types of insurance. The Democrats \ncelebrate the fact that they have all of these new people on Medicaid. \nThis is not a success. Democrats don't want to talk about any of this.\n  Nobody on this side of the aisle is denying that there are people who \nhave been helped by the health care law. Why won't any Democrat come to \nthe floor of the Senate and admit that for every person who has \nbenefited, someone else may have been harmed and may have suffered? Why \nwon't Democrats admit and the President admit that the law has not \nlived up to their promises?\n  Why did we need a 2,000-page law that upended the entire health care \nsystem in this country basically to expand the broken Medicaid program? \nNone of this had to happen. None of this is what people were asking for \nwhen Democrats wrote their law behind closed doors back there. It is \ncertainly not what people are asking for today. This health care law \nhas been expensive, disruptive, and devastating. It is headed for \ncollapse, and if Democrats won't admit it, then they are just kidding \nthemselves.\n  Republicans are ready to move on with a better approach. We will work \nto lower costs and make insurance affordable for all Americans. We will \nmake sure that people who need insurance can actually get usable \ninsurance. That means making coverage equal care. That is what it \nshould do. Coverage ought to equal care. We will give people freedom, \nflexibility, and choice to allow patients to make the decisions that \nare best for them and their family--not Washington and President Obama \ntelling them what is best for them and their family. Those people will \nbe making those decisions for themselves. We will protect consumers by \nmaking insurance predictable and stable so people don't have to switch \ntheir coverage and their doctor every year.\n  Finally, we are going to fix Washington by making Medicare and \nMedicaid stronger for people who will absolutely rely on these \nprograms.\n  President Obama and Democrats in Congress do have a choice. They can \njoin with Republicans in accepting the inevitable. They can act now to \nreform our health care system in a way that works or they can stand by \nand watch as the wheels continue to come off of ObamaCare. The program \nis collapsing, and it is unavoidable. Congress should not allow this \nhealth care law to harm the American people for one day longer. \nDemocrats should work with us to create a replacement that actually \ndelivers care, not just unusable coverage.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the clock is ticking. Exactly 1 month from \ntoday, on January 1, approximately 70 million seniors, veterans, \nAmericans with disabilities, and others who depend on Social Security \nand other benefits will get their first check of the new year. For \nthose 70 million Americans--that is 1 in 5 Americans--January 1 is \nsupposed to be a day of relief. This is the day when the Federal \nGovernment boosts their checks just a little bit to help with the \nrising costs of housing, food, and medical care. But unless Congress \ndoes something right now, for just the third time since 1975, seniors \nand veterans won't be receiving any cost-of-living increase on January \n1--not one penny more.\n  Look at who gets left out in the cold. Two-thirds of seniors depend \non Social Security for the majority of their income. For 15 million \nAmericans, Social Security is all that stands between them and poverty, \nbut not one of these Americans will see an extra penny next year, and \nmillions of other Americans whose benefits are pegged to Social \nSecurity--millions who receive veterans' benefits, disability benefits, \nand other monthly payments--won't see an extra penny either.\n  Times are tough, but not for everyone. Last year, the CEOs at the \nbiggest 350 American companies received, on average, a 3.9-percent pay \nincrease. How much money is that? Since the average CEO at one of those \ntop 350 companies made a cool $16.3 million, a 3.9-percent raise landed \nthem an additional half million bucks each. Everything is just great \nfor America's top CEOs, who got huge raises, while 70 million seniors, \nveterans, and others who worked hard will be left with nothing. Why? It \nis not an accident. It is not inevitable. It is the result of \ndeliberate policies made right here in Congress.\n  Social Security is supposed to be indexed to inflation so that when \nprices go up, benefits go up. But Congress's formula looks at the \nspending patterns of only about a quarter of the country, and the \nformula isn't geared to what older Americans actually spend their money \non. In fact, official estimates show that the cost of core goods and \nservices has increased, but seniors won't be getting a raise. Costs go \nforward while Social Security falls behind all because of the way that \nCongress says to calculate COLAs.\n  Skyrocketing CEO pay is also, in part, the result of policies set \nright here in Congress. Taxpayers subsidize CEOs' huge pay packages \nthrough billions of dollars in tax giveaways, including a crazy \nloophole that allows corporations to write off gigantic bonuses as \nbusiness expenses. Sure, companies should make their own decisions on \nhow much to pay their executives, but because of laws Congress has \npassed, American taxpayers are forced to subsidize these multimillion-\ndollar pay packages.\n  These two decisions--how to calculate Social Security raises and \nwhether to give tax breaks for multimillion-dollar CEO bonuses--are \nmade right here in Congress, and right now Senators bow and scrape for \nhighly paid CEOs while they turn their backs on retirees and vets. We \nare here because it is time for Congress to make different choices.\n  Representative Tammy Duckworth and I have introduced the Seniors And \nVeterans Emergency Benefits Act, or the SAVE Benefits Act, to give \nretirees, veterans, and Americans with disabilities a one-time payment \nof about $581. That is the equivalent of a 3.9-percent increase over \nthe average Social Security benefit--the same percentage raise CEOs \nreceived just last year.\n\n  Where would the money come from? Well, we can pay for it by closing \nthe tax loophole for CEO bonuses that exceed $1 million. In fact, \naccording to the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration, \nclosing just this one loophole will create enough revenue to give a \n$581 raise to seniors and vets and still have billions of dollars left \nover to help boost the Social Security trust fund for the future.\n  The SAVE Benefits Act would give seniors, vets, and the disabled an \nextra $581 a year. That $581 a year may not mean much to a CEO, but \nthat money will cover almost 3 months of groceries for seniors or a \nyear's worth of out-of-pocket costs on prescription drugs for someone \non Medicare. For seniors and vets, that $581 means a lot.\n  Already, 21 Democratic Senators have signed on as cosponsors. Dozens \nof organizations--Social Security Works, the AFL-CIO, MoveOn.org, the \nNational Organization For Women, VoteVets, the National Council of La \nRaza, and I could go on and on with this list--have already endorsed \nthe bill. Across the country, more than 400,000 people have signed \npetitions urging Congress to pass the SAVE Benefits Act.\n  This is about money, but it is also about values. For too long, we \nhave listened to a handful of the rich and powerful insist that we cut \ntaxes for those at the top and leave everyone else behind. And now, \nacross this country, people are saying: Enough. Taxpayers should not be \nforced to subsidize millionaire CEOs while seniors and vets have to \nfight for whatever scraps are left behind.\n  The clock is ticking. It is time for Congress to step up. The money \nis there--either way. It can go for a payment to 70 million Americans \nwho need it and who have earned it or it can go to CEOs and the \nwealthiest corporations.\n  Let's vote on the SAVE Benefits Act. Let's show everyone where we \nstand--whether we stand up for tax breaks for\n\n[[Page S8221]]\n\nthe country's most highly paid CEOs or whether we work for the seniors \nand vets who worked their hearts out to build this country.\n  Senator McConnell, brings this bill to the floor and let us vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, last month I joined Senator Warren and \nothers in introducing the Seniors And Veterans Emergency Benefits Act, \nalso known as the SAVE Benefits Act. This legislation is needed because \nfor the first time in over 40 years, our seniors, veterans, and people \nwith disabilities won't receive a cost-of-living adjustment, or a COLA, \nfor 2016. We are here again to urge our colleagues to support this much \nneeded legislation that would provide a 3.9-percent COLA increase next \nyear. There is a reason we hit upon the 3.9-percent number as the \nappropriate increase. I will get to that.\n  Many of our people who rely on Social Security and other Federal \nbenefits are on fixed incomes. Every extra dollar helps them buy basic \nnecessities. These Americans worked hard and earned modest benefits. \nHowever, based on the current benefit formula this year, they are out \nof luck. They won't see any increase in their income.\n  But here is the thing. That is not the case for our Nation's top \nCEOs. According to analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, CEOs of \nsome of America's biggest, richest corporations not only earn an \naverage of $16 million per year, but they received a 3.9-percent salary \nbump in 2014; hence our 3.9-percent COLA increase for recipients of the \nSAVE Benefits Act.\n  What does a 3.9-percent increase mean to these CEOs? About $635,000 \nmore a year in their pockets--far more than most workers who rely on \nSocial Security saw in 1 year or 10 years or perhaps even in their \nlifetimes. By contrast, what does a 3.9-percent increase mean to most \nseniors in Hawaii? About $580 more a year. Again, focusing on Hawaii, \nthat is about enough for a Hawaii senior to buy almost 3 months of \ngroceries or cover the average cost of a year's worth of prescription \ndrugs. So $580 is a big deal for a lot of people in Hawaii.\n  This bill would help about 19 percent of Hawaii's population, or \n268,000 people. They include seniors, children, and disabled workers \nwho rely on Social Security to make ends meet. It includes 24,000 \nveterans and their family members, who would receive an increase to \ntheir well-earned benefits. That extra payment of $580 would help to \nprevent some 2,000 people in Hawaii from falling into poverty.\n  We are hearing from people all across the country about what will \nhappen next year without the COLA increase.\n  One woman from Lanai City in Hawaii wrote:\n\n       I feel it is deplorable that Social Security did not \n     receive a COLA increase. Many Seniors and poor people rely on \n     this money to help them make it through the month and \n     although I am not one of them I still want to speak for them \n     as I feel it is important.\n\n  This person from Lanai said this is a deplorable situation, and I \nagree. That is why we need to pass the SAVE Benefits Act.\n  This bill is paid for by closing a tax loophole that benefits the \nwealthiest CEOs. Remember that $600,000-plus salary increase they got? \nWell, some of that is paid for by taxpayers because of this tax \nloophole.\n  This bipartisan idea of closing this tax loophole was even included \nin the former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee's 2014 tax \nreform proposal.\n  We only have a few days left for Congress to act before the end of \nthe year. I urge my colleagues to join me in letting seniors in Hawaii \nand across the country know that we are on their side by cosponsoring \nthe SAVE Benefits Act. Let's just think about the disparity--$600,000-\nplus increases for CEOs making over $16 million a year versus the \nmillions of seniors and veterans and disabled people who rely on Social \nSecurity and who need and deserve this COLA increase.\n  I urge my colleagues to bring the SAVE Benefits Act to the floor for \na vote, vote on it, and send it on to President Obama for his \nsignature.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, today I wish to join my colleagues in \nstrong support of the SAVE Benefits Act. I wish to commend the \nexcellent work done by my friend and the Senator from Massachusetts, \nMs. Warren.\n  Millions of seniors and veterans deserve a little more money in their \nSocial Security checks at the beginning of every year to help pay for \nthe ever-increasing costs of rent and medicine and groceries. They \nearned it. The SAVE Benefits Act would provide a fair and well-deserved \npayment to our seniors receiving Social Security and veterans receiving \nFederal benefits who will not see a cost-of-living adjustment in their \nbenefits next year. You see, next year there will be no official cost-\nof-living adjustment or COLA chiefly because the formula that \ndetermines it is heavily tied to the price of gasoline, which is low, \nbut all the other cost-of-living indicators are up, including rent, \nmedicine, and groceries. These are the costs our seniors are juggling \nmost often.\n  I talk to seniors. They say: What is this? There is no inflation? My \nlife costs me more each year--considerably more.\n  But because there was no official COLA even as those costs are going \nup, Social Security benefits will not increase by a single dime in \n2016. And about two-thirds of seniors rely on Social Security for over \nhalf of their income.\n  If we don't help offset the increase in costs with an increase in \nthese modest benefits, many people will be left with one of these \nexcruciating choices: Do I buy more groceries or pay the rent this \nmonth? Can I afford putting off taking my medication for another day or \nanother week or even another month?\n  In the past, when we had years without an official COLA, Congress \nstepped in. In 2009 there wasn't a COLA. We were in the throes of \nrecession. But Congress stepped in and passed a law I strongly \nsupported--the ARRA--to provide a one-time $250 payment to Social \nSecurity recipients and veterans to help them get through those tough \ntimes. Next year, we should do the same. But I hasten to add--I don't \nlike to be partisan--in 2009 the House and Senate were Democratic, \ncaring about Social Security. In 2015 the House and Senate are \nRepublican, and we are getting no relief for seniors. Well, I hope that \nwill change. The SAVE Benefits Act would change it. It would provide a \none-time check of approximately $580 for our veterans and our seniors \nand fully pay for it by closing a loophole that benefits corporate \ncompensation packages over $1 million. To boot, it would provide this \nbenefit while also using some of the revenue to extend the life of \nSocial Security.\n  In my State, over 4 million people would benefit--nearly 1.5 million \nwomen over the age of 65, a quarter of a million children, and half a \nmillion disabled workers in New York alone.\n  If we think about it in real terms, that $580 is almost 3 months of \ngroceries or the average annual out-of-pocket expenses that a senior \nhas for prescription drugs for Medicare.\n  This is the right thing to do. Social Security and veterans' benefits \nshould rise to keep pace with prices, but unless Congress acts, our \nseniors and our veterans will not see any increase in their own \nbenefits next year. It is time to fix that.\n  I want to ask who on the other side would say millionaires should \ncontinue to get to deduct their bonuses while senior citizens get no \nCOLA. What percentage of Republicans in America would say that? What \npercentage of Independents?\n  This should not be a partisan issue. We should just pass it and help \nthe seniors as we did in 2009 when the Congress was under different \ncontrol. This is a real test of who cares for the seniors, who \nunderstands their struggles, and who understands the sweat seniors \nbreak out in when they have to pay the bills and they don't have enough \nmoney to pay basic expenses. Well, those who cosponsored this bill \nunderstand. Those who support this bill understand. I would like to \nhear from my colleagues who don't support it what their alternative is.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side to join us in extending to our \nseniors and our veterans a fair increase in benefits that they earned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S8222]]\n\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer, my neighbor \nin New Hampshire.\n  I also want to thank Senator Warren for her leadership on a matter of \ngreat importance to millions of Americans. In October, Social Security \nbeneficiaries received some upsetting news. I know it is upsetting to a \nlot of Vermonters, as I have talked to them in grocery stores, on \nstreet corners, and even coming out of church on Sunday. For the third \ntime in 40 years, the Social Security Administration announced that in \n2016, Social Security payments will not include a cost-of-living \nincrease. Unless Congress acts, seniors and others who receive Social \nSecurity benefits will not see an additional dime in payments in the \nnew year.\n  For the nearly two-thirds of beneficiaries who depend on Social \nSecurity for at least half of their income, and for the 24 percent of \nthose where Social Security is the sole source of income, this news is \nnot just distressing, it is devastating.\n  I will not take the time here, but I could tell so many stories of \nwhat Vermonters have told me, and I share their concerns. In order to \naddress this issue, I am proud to stand with thousands of Vermonters \nand millions of Americans to support Senator Warren's bill to provide \nSocial Security recipients, those who receive disability benefits, and \nveterans, among others, a one-time payment next year. This payment \nwould be equivalent to the average increase of 3.9 percent--\nincidentally the same pay increase top CEOs in the United States saw \nlast year.\n  Many in Congress have turned a blind eye to the problems facing \nSocial Security, arguing the idea that we as a country cannot possibly \nafford to spend resources on our seniors, but every year hard-working \nAmericans subsidize billions of dollars in tax subsidies for corporate \nCEOs. By no longer allowing corporations to receive tax deductions for \nperformance pay packages for their executives, we could give a one-time \nemergency payment to our Nation's seniors, and we could increase the \nsolvency of the Social Security trust fund without adding a penny to \nthe deficit. It is a win-win. It is a matter of priorities.\n  Are we as a country going to support the millions of Americans who \ndepend upon Social Security to make ends meet? Or are we going to \ncontinue to allow the country's top CEOs, whose average salary in 2014 \ntopped $16 million each, to continue to rake in billions of dollars \nthanks to the performance pay tax loophole? The choice should be clear. \nIf these CEOs want to make more money, fine, but don't do it using a \nspecial tax loophole.\n  Social Security is an immensely important program, one that has \nhelped millions of Americans stay out of poverty once entering \nretirement. This program has always represented a strong commitment to \nour Nation's seniors. Ever since Ida May Fuller of Vermont received the \nfirst Social Security check issued, vulnerable seniors have had a \nsafety-net to fall back on in retirement or to supplement individual \nretirement savings or pensions. Support for this bill represents a \ncontinuing commitment to our Nation's seniors and also those with \ndisabilities in an uncertain economy.\n  I hope we can redouble our commitment to seniors, veterans, and those \nwith disabilities in this country by passing this important \nlegislation. It is the least we can do.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Thank you, Madam President, very much.\n  I am very proud to be a cosponsor of the SAVE Benefits Act. I think \nwe owe an enormous debt of gratitude to Senator Warren, my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts, for the legislation she has introduced because she \nis going to make sure the Social Security benefits for seniors, for \nveterans, and for those who are disabled will be protected, and I \napplaud her for the enormously innovative way she has framed this \ndebate for our Nation.\n  The Social Security Administration has recently determined that \nseniors will not receive an increase in their benefits for the next \nyear. That means approximately 70 million American seniors, veterans, \nand the disabled will not receive any increase in their benefits, \nincluding the 1.4 million people in Massachusetts who are dependent \nupon these benefits. That is completely unacceptable. What Senator \nWarren has done is to say that for these seniors, for many of them, \nSocial Security is their sole basis for having any income at all, and \nfor most seniors it is the majority of their income in their \nretirement. Those seniors depend on these benefits to pay for food, \nrent, medicine, and the electricity bill. In their world, prices for \nfood, clothing, and medicine are not going down, they are going up. \nThese are the necessities of life, and our seniors should not have to \nchoose between eating and heating.\n  We have a simple question to ask ourselves: Who contributed most to \nour country over the last generation? Is it a small handful of CEOs who \nare now paid exorbitant salaries or is it every American who got up \nevery morning to build us into this incredible country we now live in? \nI think it was grandma and grandpa. Those are the people who got up \nevery day. Those are the people who built this great country. Right now \nwe are being told that their standard of living is going to stay the \nsame or go down. There will be no increase for them.\n  Well, unfortunately CEOs in America make about 273 times what the \naverage American worker makes. Last year America's CEOs saw their pay \nincrease by about $635,000 to an average of $16 million. A family in \nthe top 1 percent has a net worth 288 times higher than the typical \nfamily. That is unacceptable and it must change.\n  Shouldn't our seniors--shouldn't grandma and grandpa who built this \ncountry receive an additional benefit from the economy which they \ncreated--this incredible wealth which they created in our country. When \ndo they get their raise? They got up every morning.\n  My father worked for the Hood Milk Company. He got up every morning. \nHe worked as hard as a human being can work, and so have hundreds of \nmillions of Americans. They built this country with their hard work. \nThey deserve a Social Security raise. They deserve a wage if they now \nhave disabilities. If they are veterans, they not only got up and \nworked every single day, but they also saved our country, many of them \noverseas protecting us against our enemies. So that is what Senator \nWarren's very wise piece of legislation focuses on. We know grandma and \ngrandpa deserve a raise. We know the system that has been created \nallows those in the upper 1 percentile to continue to receive per year, \non average, $685,000 in raises--up to an average of $16 million for \nsalary. And we are saying to people who did the work: You don't get a \nraise at all.\n  I think for their sacrifice, for their hard work every single day, \nthey deserve something. They built the greatest country in the history \nof the world. So let's give our seniors the 3.9-percent raise that \nSenator Warren has proposed. Let's give them the kind of comfort they \ndeserve for a lifetime of hard work, and let's thank Senator Warren for \nreminding all of us of the obligation we have to those great Americans, \nso we don't forget them when it comes time at the end of the year to \nhand out bonuses. They deserve bonuses in the same way we know CEOs \nacross our country, from Wall Street to Silicon Valley, are going to \nreceive every year. We shouldn't turn our backs on those seniors.\n  Thank you, Senator Warren, for all your great work.\n  Madam President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, we are just 1 month away from the new \nyear 2016, which will bring a lot of good new things, I hope. The one \nthing it will not bring is a cost-of-living increase for seniors, \nveterans, and for people with disabilities. Despite the fact that the \ncosts of health care, prescription drugs, and housing are increasing, \nthe size of a Social Security check will not go up 1 cent on January 1, \nunless we act--unless Congress acts.\n  That is why Senator Warren, my colleagues, and I have introduced the \nSenior And Veterans Emergency Benefits Act or SAVE Benefits Act. The\n\n[[Page S8223]]\n\nSAVE Benefits Act is a one-time payment to seniors and veterans \nreceiving their earned benefits so they can better meet their basic \nliving expenses.\n  The stagnant level for benefits in 2016 and its damaging effects are \npart of the bigger problem. Too many of our seniors are feeling the \nsqueeze and just aren't secure enough in their retirement. Today's \nSocial Security benefits are not enough to live on, and other \nretirement savings aren't filling the gap. You see, the share of \nprivate sector workers with pensions has fallen precipitously in recent \nyears, and yet half of all Americans don't have retirement accounts or \n401(k) plans or IRAs.\n  So without sufficient pensions or retirement accounts, many seniors \ndepend on Social Security. Social Security benefits comprise over 90 \npercent of income for the poorest 25 percent of retirees. Social \nSecurity comprises 70 percent of income for the middle 50 percent of \nretirees. With the cost of things seniors have to spend money on \nincreasing, the absence of a cost-of-living increase in Social Security \nbenefits is especially damaging.\n  I have heard from many Minnesota seniors who are worried about the \nsqueeze that no increase in Social Security will put on their budgets. \nJeff from Minneapolis wrote: ``Food prices are up and my rent is up 4 \npercent in 2015 and will be up again in 2016.'' He continues: ``I lost \nmost of my IRA earnings in the 2008-2009 debacle and now I rely almost \nentirely on Social Security.''\n  If we want Minnesotans like Jeff--and millions of Americans across \nthe country facing similar situations--to have a secure retirement, we \nneed to increase these benefits. That is what the SAVE Benefits Act \ndoes. Under our bill, seniors and veterans have a 3.9-percent \nincrease--the same percentage increase that CEO pay went up from 2013 \nto 2014. For the average beneficiary, a 3.9-percent raise would come to \nabout $580 a year.\n\n  While that $580 may not sound like a lot compared, of course, to the \nraises that CEOs are getting, $580 can make a big difference to the \naverage American, especially the average senior. The $580 may cover \nseveral months of groceries or out-of-pocket costs for prescription \ndrugs for a senior on Medicare who has gone into their doughnut hole.\n  Some may ask if we can afford to give seniors and veterans a raise \nright now. Too often the ideas we have heard for ``fixing'' Social \nSecurity focus on cutting benefits, such as reducing cost-of-living \nincreases by using chained CPI or raising the retirement age, but I \nthink that is the wrong approach. We shouldn't cut our way to solvency. \nWe need to strengthen our Social Security System by protecting and \nenhancing the benefits that seniors and veterans have earned, and that \nmeans improving Social Security's finances. A good place to start is by \nremoving special provisions to the wealthiest Americans in our current \nTax Code.\n  Right now, individuals making millions of dollars a year still pay \npayroll tax only on the first $118,500 of their income. Over the long \nterm, that is the sort of thing we need to address in order to \nstrengthen Social Security.\n  This bill proposes to pay for the one-time increase of Social \nSecurity benefits in the same spirit--rebalancing our Tax Code by \nending a tax deduction for CEO pay that doesn't make sense and allows \ncorporations to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. CEOs and big \nbusinesses will still do just fine under this bill.\n  At the same time, the SAVE Benefits Act will provide critical \nassistance to Americans struggling to meet their expenses. In fact, \nthis increase in benefits will lift about 8,000 Minnesotans out of \npoverty and thousands more in every State of our Union.\n  Ultimately, the debate over this bill comes down to priorities. What \nis more important to us--protecting high pay for the wealthiest \nAmericans or tax deductions for corporations on that high pay or \nensuring that veterans, seniors, and people with disabilities have the \nincome security they need to pay for health care, prescription drugs, \nand housing?\n  As this year comes to a close, it is time to get our priorities \nstraight and to stand up for our seniors and our veterans. They need a \nraise in 2016.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am here to join the chorus for \nproviding some additional help to our seniors on Social Security. What \ncan I say? Here we go again. In 2010 and in 2011, America's seniors \nwere told by the Social Security Administration there would be no cost-\nof-living adjustment, no increase for them, and now it is happening a \nthird time. We all know that the price of the things seniors actually \nbuy has continued to go up, and yet no COLA.\n  In 2010 and 2011 we tried to remedy that with Senator Sanders' \nEmergency Senior Citizens Relief Act. We did not succeed. There was \nopposition from the other side.\n  We did succeed at getting a one-time $300 payment to seniors under \nthe Economic Stimulus Act in 2008, back in the depths of the great Wall \nStreet recession, and another $250 under the Recovery Act. So we have \ndone this before, and it has helped. I strongly encourage that we do \nit.\n  There is a flaw built into the Social Security COLA, which is that \nthe CPI measures things that a lot of seniors don't buy. It measures \nlaptops, it measures flat screens, and it measures a lot of technology, \nbut seniors in Rhode Island who make a little over $1,200 from Social \nSecurity on average aren't buying a lot of flat screen TVs and they are \nnot buying a lot of laptops. What they are buying is fuel, medicines, \nfood, and maybe something for the grandchildren at Christmastime, and \nall of that keeps going up.\n  We should fix that formula. There should be a CPI-E, a CPI for \nelderly folks that tracks what they actually spend and not some \nhypothetical CPI that spreads across all age groups. That would be the \nultimate fix, but in the meantime, we should do this. I think it is \npaid for very sensibly.\n  I commend Senator Warren. We established as a country that beyond $1 \nmillion in executive compensation, it wasn't going to be tax deductible \nany longer. If you are a big corporation and you want to pay your CEO \nmore than $1 million--fine, you still do that, but you don't get to \nhave the American taxpayer kick in for the more-than-$1 million salary.\n  So what did corporate America do? They took it out of salary and they \nmoved it over to bonuses. Now you have those big bonuses over $1 \nmillion. They dodged that exemption, and now the American taxpayer is \nback on the hook again to kick in for a $1 million-plus compensation \npackage for a corporate CEO. Come on. We ought to be able to get beyond \nthat.\n  So we have a way to pay for it that is fair, sensible, and consistent \nwith the policy that we have already agreed on as a nation, which is \nthat above $1 million in compensation, taxpayers shouldn't be kicking \nin any longer to help the company pay those exorbitant salaries. I \nthink we have a very good way to spend those resources, which is \nhelping seniors who now--for the third time since I have been in the \nSenate--are getting a zero COLA while everything goes up around them.\n  I commend Senator Warren for taking the lead, and I am pleased to be \na cosponsor on her bill.\n  I am delighted to yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I appreciate the colleagues who came to \nthe floor today to talk about the SAVE Benefits Act.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as the Presiding Officer knows well, \nevery week that I am here and the Senate is in session, I come to the \nfloor to remind us of the damage carbon pollution continues to do to \nour atmosphere and oceans. Today I rise for the 120th time to urge my \ncolleagues to\n\n[[Page S8224]]\n\nwake up to the threat of climate change. I am not alone, although it \nsometimes seems a bit lonely here.\n  We have an advertisement today in the Wall Street Journal--we will \nfind it here in 1 second; well, I seem to have mislaid it--that has a \nconsiderable number of American companies that have called upon the \npublic and called on the readers of the Wall Street Journal to support \na strong outcome in Paris. It matches another Wall Street Journal full-\npage advertisement--this one went back to October 22--which was \n``Republicans and Democrats Agree: U.S. Security Demands Global Climate \nAction.'' That had 23 Republican former officials, including Senators \nCohen, Coleman, Danforth, Hagel, Lugar, Kassebaum, Smith, and Snowe, \nSecretaries of Commerce, State, Treasury, members of the National \nIntelligence Council, Homeland Security advisers, and Trade \nRepresentatives. In total, 33 Republican and military officials were \ncalling on us to get serious about it. So a lot of people out there, \nincluding Republicans, are interested in getting something done.\n  I wanted to build my remarks this week around something interesting \nthat Pope Francis said this past weekend about the upcoming climate \ntalks in Paris. He said: ``It would be sad, and dare I say even \ncatastrophic, were special interests to prevail over the common good \nand lead to manipulating information in order to protect their own \nplans and interests.''\n  ``Sad,'' and ``even catastrophic''--let's look at that part. The fact \nis, we have changed the composition of our atmosphere, pushing the \nconcentration of carbon dioxide beyond the range it has been in for at \nleast 800,000 years, longer than our species has been on the planet. \nFor 8,000 centuries, humans have inhabited an Earth with an atmosphere \nbetween 170 and 300 parts per million of CO2. Concentrations \nhave now hit 400 parts per million, farther out of the range than the \nmidpoint of the range, and that trend continues to rise. By the way, \nthat is measurement. That is not somebody's theory. That is not a \ncomputer-model run. We have measured that.\n  Last year was the hottest year since we began keeping records in \n1880, a dubious distinction. According to the World Meteorological \nOrganization, the last 5 years are now the warmest 5-year period in \nhuman history. This year is on track to be another recordbreaker, \nexpected to reach the both symbolic and significant milestone of 1 full \ndegree Celsius above the average temperature of the preindustrial era.\n  Many scientists agree that 2 degrees above the precarbon-era norm \nwill likely mean irreparable harm to our planet and to our current way \nof life. So it would, indeed, be sad and perhaps ultimately \ncatastrophic if we were to do nothing.\n  Yet we in Congress continue to do nothing, which brings me to the \nnext of Pope Francis's words in that opening quotation: ``special \ninterests prevail[ing] over the common good.'' Well, doing nothing is \njust fine by the big polluters because they make more money when we do \nnothing. To keep their profitable racket running, the polluters spend \nhuge sums on lobbying and on politics, particularly right here in the \nCongress. As one author has written, and I will quote him: ``[R]ivers \nof money flowing from secret sources have turned our elections into \nsilent auctions.'' And the polluters get what they pay for. With the \nCongress of the United States distracted and deceived by their \nmischief, the effects of climate change just keep piling up.\n  This problem got worse in 2010 when the big polluters got a gift. \nThey got handed a big, new political weapon. Thanks to five Justices on \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, all of them Republican appointees, the big \npolluters can now threaten lawmakers with the cudgel of unlimited, \nundisclosed Citizens United money. So we do nothing, and the polluters \noffload onto everyone else the costs in damage from their fossil fuel \nproduct, the costs of heat waves, of sea level rise, of ocean \nacidification, of dying forests, of worsening storms and more. The \npolluters happily dump those costs onto everybody else. They suck up \nhundreds of billions of dollars in effective public subsidy, according \nto the International Monetary Fund, and of course they fight \ndesperately to protect their favored status.\n  Pope Francis had it right--special interests indeed prevail over the \ncommon good. And that brings us to the Pope's words about them \n``manipulating information in order to protect their own plans and \ninterests.''\n  I have spoken on this floor about the decades-long, purposeful \ncorporate campaign of misinformation on climate change. The fossil fuel \nindustry and its allies gin up doubt about the dangers of carbon \npollution through a smokescreen of misleading public statements, \nsophisticated marketing, and polluter-funded front groups. The mission \nof these well-organized and mightily funded deniers is to manufacture a \nproduct--uncertainty, doubt. The polluters spend huge amounts on a big, \ncomplex PR machine to churn out doubt about the real science. It is a \nfraud. It is a deliberate pollution of the public mind.\n  We know that a network of front organizations with innocent-sounding \nnames has emerged to propagate that baloney science. This network has \nbeen well documented by Dr. Robert Brulle at Drexel University and Dr. \nRiley Dunlap at Oklahoma State University, among others. Professor \nBrulle's follow-the-money analysis, for instance, diagrams the complex \nflow of cash to these front groups, a flow that the fossil fuel \nindustry persistently tries to obscure.\n  A new study was released just last week, a study by Dr. Justin \nFarrell at Yale University. His work examines how corporations have \nused their money to amplify the voices of climate deniers and to \nexaggerate scientific uncertainty. Dr. Farrell used computers to \nperform a comprehensive quantitative analysis of more than 39 million \nwords written by 164 climate denial organizations--yes, there are 164 \nof them; this is a big beast--over a 20-year period. His study compared \ncorporate-funded groups to the rest.\n  Professor Farrell's stated purpose was to uncover empirically the \nactual social arrangements within which large-scale scientific \nmisinformation is generated and the important role private funding \nplays in shaping the actual ideological content of scientific \ninformation that is written and amplified. He describes the climate \ndenial apparatus as a complex network of think tanks, foundations, \npublic relations firms, trade associations, and other groups that are \n``overtly producing and promoting skepticism and doubt about scientific \nconsensus on climate change.'' Farrell describes the function of the \nnetwork as, one, ``the production of an alternative contrarian \ndiscourse,'' and two, ``to create ideological polarization around \nclimate change.'' Why polarization? Because ``it is well understood \nthat polarization is an effective strategy for creating controversy and \ndelaying policy progress particularly around environmental issues.''\n  So the polarization we see in this building on this issue is a \nproduct created by a network of corporate-funded climate denial front \ngroups. We are the living proof of the success of this scheme. \nCorporate backing created a united network, said Farrell, within which \nthe contrarian messages could be strategically created. That is right, \nclimate denial is ``strategically created.''\n  Farrell's data show particularly that donations from ExxonMobil and \nthe Koch family foundations signal what he calls entry into a powerful \nnetwork of influence, and that corporate funding influences the actual \nlanguage and thematic content of polarizing discourse. And, of course, \none of the areas of distinct corporate-funded polarizing discourse \nproduced by this network was questions about the scientific veracity of \nlong-term climate change. Again, it is the product of a scheme.\n  Professor Farrell made another comparison. He has made the same \ncomparison that others have made with tobacco. I will quote him:\n\n       Well-funded and well-organized ``contrarian'' campaigns are \n     especially important for spreading skepticism or denial where \n     scientific consensus exists--such as in the present case of \n     global warming, or in historical contrarian efforts to create \n     doubt about the link between smoking and cancer.\n\n  To create doubt about the link between smoking and cancer. That echos \nthe telling sentence from the tobacco denial campaign: Doubt is our \nproduct.\n  Just as Pope Francis said, the denial machinery is ``manipulating \ninformation in order to protect their own plans\n\n[[Page S8225]]\n\nand interests.'' The actions of the climate denial machine have been so \neffective, they have made it ``difficult for ordinary Americans to even \nknow who to trust,'' says Farrell. Doubt is still their product.\n  Every generation of Americans has faced its challenge, and each has \nrisen to its challenge. Some generations left bloody footprints in the \nsnows of Valley Forge to secure our independence. Some generations were \ntorn to pieces by cannon fire in the great battles of the Civil War. \nSome generations endured mustard gas and trench warfare in World War I. \nSome secured the world's freedom from the Axis powers in World War II. \nSome rebuilt the American economy after the Great Depression. Some were \nbeaten, bombed, and burned as they struggled to secure the civil rights \nwe now enjoy. We are the generation whose duty it is to face down the \nclimate crisis that threatens our planet and face down the folks behind \nthis vast climate denial scheme. All we have to do to rise to our duty \nis to resist all the dark money, all the fossil fuel-funded threats and \nintimidation Citizens United made possible.\n  Let me read from an opinion that was in my clips today from David \nBrooks, a conservative columnist. I see him at American Enterprise \nInstitute gatherings. He is a self-identified Republican conservative \nwho was writing about climate change and the upcoming Paris conference. \nHe says this as if he is communicating with Alexander Hamilton. He \nobviously is not, but that is his rhetorical device. He said, ``So I \nseanced up my hero Alexander Hamilton to see what he thought'' about \nthe Paris climate conference. Here is what he said:\n\n       First, [Alexander Hamilton] was struck by the fact that on \n     this issue the G.O.P. has come to resemble a Soviet \n     dictatorship--a vast majority of Republican politicians can't \n     publicly say what they know about the truth of climate change \n     because they're afraid the thought police will knock on their \n     door and drag them off to an AM radio interrogation.\n\n  That is a conservative Republican economist talking about this.\n  We can get through this. We simply need conscientious Republicans and \nDemocrats to work together in good faith on a common platform of \nestablished science, clear facts, and basic common sense. If we do \nthat, we can protect the American people, the American economy, and our \nAmerican reputation from the harm of the looming effects of climate \nchange. It is on us. It is on us. We simply need to shed the shackles \nof corrupting influence and rise to our duty, as other generations \nalways have. We do not have to be the generation that failed. Yes, we \nare headed down a road to infamy now, but it doesn't have to be that \nway. We can leave a legacy that will echo down the corridors of \nhistory, so the generations that follow us will be proud of our efforts \nthe way we are proud of those who did great things for our country \nbefore us. But sitting here doing nothing, yielding to the special \ninterests, won't accomplish that.\n  This new analysis out of Yale is an important addition to the \nincreasing body of academic research and journalism that is shining \nsome much needed sunlight on the shadowy enterprise of phony science \nand phony doubt that props up climate denial. It is time we all caught \non to this deceptive enterprise. Being suckers down a road to infamy is \nnot a good legacy. It is time to wake up.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the advertisement \n``Business Backs Low-Carbon USA'' in the Wall Street Journal and the \narticle by David Brooks, ``The Green Tech Solution,'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                           PAID ADVERTISEMENT\n\n                     Business Backs Low-Carbon USA\n\n                            lowcarbonusa.org\n\n\nWE ARE SOME OF THE BUSINESSES THAT WILL HELP CREATE THE FUTURE ECONOMY \n                         OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       We want this economy to be energy efficient and low carbon. \n     We believe there are cost-effective and innovative solutions \n     that can help us achieve that objective. Failure to tackle \n     climate change could put America's economic prosperity at \n     risk. But the right action now would create jobs and boost \n     competitiveness.\n       We encourage our government to\n       1. seek a strong and fair global climate deal in Paris that \n     provides long-term direction and periodic strengthening to \n     keep global temperature rise below 2  deg.C\n       2. support action to reduce U.S. emissions that achieves or \n     exceeds national commitments and increases ambition in the \n     future\n       3. support investment in a low-carbon economy at home and \n     abroad, giving industry clarity and the confidence of \n     investors\n       We pledge to continue efforts to ensure a just transition \n     to a low-carbon, energy-efficient U.S. economy and look \n     forward to enabling strong ambition in the U.S. and at the \n     Paris climate change conference.\n\n       Autodesk, Inc.; The Coca-Cola Company; Unilever; Adidas \n     Group; Johnson Controls, Inc.; Clif Bar & Company; Intel; \n     Kingspan Insulated Panels; Microsoft; Qualcomm; Sprint; \n     Colgate-Palmolive Company; Smartwool; The Hartford; Volvo, \n     Volvo Group North America; Burton; Snowbird; eBay; Seventh \n     Generation; Johnson & Johnson Family of Companies; Vail \n     Resorts; Levi Strauss & Co.; EMC; New Belgium Brewing \n     Company; Squaw Valley Alpine Meadows; Annie's; Alta; General \n     Mills; Dignity Health; BNY Mellon; Jupiter Oxygen \n     Corporation; Hewlett Packard Enterprise; Outdoor Industry \n     Association; Procter & Gamble; Ben & Jerry's; Schneider \n     Electric; Xanterra; Nike; The North Face; Symantec; JLL; \n     Powdr Corporation; Gap Inc.; Owens Corning; EnerNOC; Hilton \n     Worldwide; VF Corporation; Guggenheim; Timberland; L'Oreal; \n     IKEA; Aspen Snowmass, Aspen Skiing Company; Vulcan; Eileen \n     Fisher; DuPont; CA Technologies; Nestle; Pacific Gas and \n     Electric Company; Catalyst; Sealed Air; National Grid; \n     Saunders Hotel Group; Hewlett Packard; Kellogg's; Teton \n     Gravity Research; Dell; Mars, Incorporated; NRG; Ingersoll \n     Rand\n\n\n                    Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2)\n\n       Ameristar SolarStream, Big Kid Science.

I was sad to be reminded that he doesn't \n     actually talk in hip-hop, but he still had some interesting \n     things to say.\n       First, he was struck by the fact that on this issue the \n     G.O.P. has come to resemble a Soviet dictatorship--a vast \n     majority of Republican politicians can't publicly say what \n     they know about the truth of climate change because they're \n     afraid the thought police will knock on their door and drag \n     them off to an AM radio interrogation.\n       This week's Paris conference, I observed, seems like a \n     giant Weight Watchers meeting. A bunch of national leaders \n     get together and make some resolutions to cut their carbon \n     emissions over the next few decades. You hope some sort of \n     peer pressure will kick in and they will actually follow \n     through.\n       I'm afraid Hamilton snorted.\n       The co-author of the Federalist papers is the opposite of \n     naive about human nature. He said the conference is nothing \n     like a Weight Watchers meeting. Unlike weight loss, the pain \n     in reducing carbon emissions is individual but the good is \n     only achieved collectively.\n       You're asking people to impose costs on themselves today \n     for some future benefit they will never see. You're asking \n     developing countries to forswear growth now to compensate for \n     a legacy of pollution from richer countries that they didn't \n     benefit from. You're asking richer countries that are facing \n     severe economic strain to pay hundreds of billions of dollars \n     in ``reparations'' to India and such places that can go on \n     and burn mountains of coal and take away American jobs. And \n     you're asking for all this top-down coercion to last a \n     century, without any enforcement mechanism. Are the Chinese \n     really going to police a local coal plant efficiently?\n       This is perfectly designed to ensure cheating. Already, the \n     Chinese government made a grandiose climate change \n     announcement but then was forced to admit that its country \n     was burning 17 percent more coal than it had previously \n     disclosed. The cheating will create a cycle of resentment \n     that will dissolve any sense of common purpose.\n       I countered by pointing out that policy makers have come up \n     with some clever ways to make carbon reductions more \n     efficient, like cap and trade, permit trading and carbon \n     taxing.\n       The former Treasury secretary pointed out that these ideas \n     are good in theory but haven't worked in reality. Cap and \n     trade has not worked out so well in Europe. Over all,\n\n[[Page S8226]]\n\n     the Europeans have spent $280 billion on climate change with \n     very little measurable impact on global temperatures. And as \n     for carbon taxes, even if the U.S. imposed one on itself, it \n     would have virtually no effect on the global climate.\n       Hamilton steered me to an article by James Manzi and Peter \n     Wehner in his favorite magazine, National Affairs. The \n     authors point out that according to the United Nations \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the expected \n     economic costs of unaddressed global warming over the next \n     century are likely to be about 3 percent of world gross \n     domestic product. This is a big, gradual problem, but not the \n     sort of cataclysmic immediate threat that's likely to lead \n     people to suspend their immediate self-interest.\n       Well, I ventured, if you're skeptical about our own \n     policies, Mr. Founding Father, what would you do?\n       Look at what you're already doing, he countered. The U.S. \n     has the fastest rate of reduction of CO2 emissions \n     of any major nation on earth, back to pre-1996 levels.\n       That's in part because of fracking. Natural gas is \n     replacing coal, and natural gas emits about half as much \n     carbon dioxide.\n       The larger lesson is that innovation is the key. Green \n     energy will beat dirty energy only when it makes technical \n     and economic sense.\n       Hamilton reminded me that he often used government money to \n     stoke innovation. Manzi and Wehner suggest that one of our \n     great national science labs could work on geoengineering \n     problems to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. \n     Another could investigate cogeneration and small-scale energy \n     reduction systems. We could increase funding on battery and \n     smart-grid research. If we move to mainly solar power, we'll \n     need much more efficient national transmission methods. Maybe \n     there's a partial answer in increased vegetation.\n       Hamilton pointed out that when America was just a bunch of \n     scraggly colonies, he was already envisioning it as a great \n     world power. He used government to incite, arouse, energize \n     and stir up great enterprise. The global warming problem can \n     be addressed, ineffectively, by global communiques. Or, with \n     the right government boost, it presents an opportunity to \n     arouse and incite entrepreneurs, innovators and investors and \n     foment a new technological revolution.\n       Sometimes like your country you got to be young, scrappy \n     and hungry and not throw away your shot.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8226-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8226-S8227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 POLICY ISSUES AND APPROPRIATIONS BILLS\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I rise to visit for a moment with my \ncolleagues, both Republican and Democratic, about the ongoing debate we \nare having over the appropriateness of having policy issues debated and \nthen decided in appropriations bills.\n  We are now at the stage in our legislative process in which it looks \nas if we are going to complete our work on the final spending bill for \nthe fiscal year that ended a few months ago and that by December 11, \nwhen the continuing resolution concludes, we very well may have an \nappropriations bill that takes us into the new year completed.\n  There are some in the Senate who have argued that within this \nappropriations bill there is no place for policy riders, for provisions \nin that bill that direct in a more specific way how we spend money. I \nwould say that is a terrible mistake on the part of Members of the \nSenate to reach that conclusion, and I would say it is wrong for our \ncountry. It is wrong based upon the Constitution of the United States \nthat creates three coequal branches of government.\n  In the legislative branch, we know that our role is to legislate, to \ncreate the laws, to appropriate the money. There cannot be a \ndistinction between legislating and appropriating money. They end up \nbeing the same thing. When we appropriate money, we are directing an \nadministration to conduct itself according to that appropriations bill. \nParticularly in this case, we have a few Democrats who are arguing that \nthere shouldn't be any policy riders included in that appropriations \nbill. I doubt that we would hear that from Democrats if this were a \nRepublican President and a Democratic Congress. In my view, it ought \nnot to be any different. Congress's role is to make decisions about how \nmoney is spent. For too long, Congress has given up the power of the \npurse strings.\n  This is a significant development in our constitutional history \nbecause in giving up the power of the purse strings, we authorize the \nexecutive branch--that branch of Government that is to execute the \nlaws, to administer the laws--to have significantly more power. The \nAmerican people and our Constitution are harmed when any Executive--\nthis President, previous Presidents, future Presidents--exceeds the \nauthority granted to them by the U.S. Constitution. Sometimes I think \nwe end up supporting Presidential decisions that we agree with and \noppose those, obviously, that we disagree with. But the reality is that \nif those decisions are unconstitutional, if they exceed the authority \nthat Congress has granted an executive branch, they ought to be denied, \nregardless of whether we agree with those decisions or not. In other \nwords, the Constitution should trump.\n  In my view, this Congress and many who preceded us have taken the \nopportunity to be in the back seat, granting authority or allowing \nPresidents to consume additional power well beyond the Constitution. I \nam here to encourage my colleagues--Republicans and Democrats--to \nreexert our constitutional grant of authority to legislate. We ought \nnot to pay undue deference to an executive branch, whether the \nPresident is a Republican or a Democrat.\n  I would say that in the time I have been a Senator, in this first \nterm of my term in office, we have seen an executive branch that has \ncontinued to increase its power and authority and exceeded, in my view, \nits constitutional grant of authority and in so many instances has \nexceeded the authority granted to them by a statute--a piece of \nlegislation passed by the House, passed by the Senate, and sent to the \nPresident.\n  The President should only be able to do those things which are \ngranted to him or her by the Constitution or by legislative enactment \npursuant to the Constitution. That seemingly has been forgotten during \nthe recent history of our country. Congress holds the power of the \npurse strings.\n  There are many of us--Republicans and Democrats--who would like to \ndirect the executive branch in how money is spent. The appropriations \nbill ultimately will determine how much money is spent. But in addition \nto that, we have the ability to direct whether that spending can occur, \nshouldn't occur or how it should occur. I think all of you have heard \nme speak previously, and some of you may remember about a particular \nprovision that I wanted included in the Interior and Environment \nappropriations bill related to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service--the \ndesignation of the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species.\n  We have had this conversation. In fact, in a bipartisan way, that \nissue was voted on here on the Senate floor. It was approved, but the \nlegislation it was attached to did not become law. Now the opportunity \nto instruct a Federal agency arises as we appropriate the money for \nthem to operate. There are five States in the middle of the country--\nNew Mexico, Texas, Colorado, Kansas, and Oklahoma--that have felt the \nconsequences of a decision made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nto list the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species. The issue \nthat is so troublesome to me is that those five States have come \ntogether to solve this problem on their own without the heavy hand of \nthe Federal Government. Conservation practices were being put in place. \nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture was providing technical and \nfinancial assistance for conservation efforts to landowners to provide \nthe incentives to put voluntary conservation practices in place across \nthose five States. In my view, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service only \npaid lip service to those conservation efforts. Their actions spoke \nlouder than the words, and they listed the lesser prairie chicken as \nthreatened.\n  This decision at that point in time didn't provide enough time for \nlocal plans to prove their effectiveness, and the reality is the \nproblem in our State and across that region of the country was that we \ndidn't have moisture. We didn't have adequate snowfall. We don't have \nadequate rainfall. When you have little or no rain, you have little or \nno habitat. You can't solve that problem without moisture. Now the \nrains have returned. Over the last 2 years, just as you would predict \nand as common sense would tell us, if there is more rain, there is more \nhabitat and there are more birds.\n\n[[Page S8227]]\n\n  The most recent census of the lesser prairie chicken indicates that \nin the last 2 years, the population of that bird has increased by 50 \npercent. Again, common sense tells us if there is rain and if there is \nmoisture, there is habitat and the birds return. As the rainfall has \nreturned, the habitat is growing, and it is healthy again. Local \nsurveys indicate what we would expect: The bird's population is again \nincreasing.\n  Therefore, one might think it would be useful to take a second look \nat the listing. Despite our request of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService, they dismissed with little thought that as the species has \nreturned, maybe it should no longer be listed. The opportunity that I \nand others have to rein in decisions that we believe are poorly made, \nlack common sense, and are unreasonable occurs in this appropriations \nprocess. My guess is that all of my colleagues have certain issues on \nwhich they want to direct a Federal agency about how to behave, what \nrules and regulations are appropriate, where we believe they have \nexceeded their authority or where they simply lack the common sense or \nsound science to have made an appropriate decision.\n  There are some who say you shouldn't legislate on an appropriations \nbill. An appropriations bill is a legislative effort, and it would be \nwrong for us not to take the opportunity to direct agencies on behalf \nof the American people, on behalf of the constituents--in my case of \nKansas--who feel very strongly about this issue and have suffered the \nconsequences of the listing of the lesser prairie chicken by the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service.\n  Despite the practical reasons that this listing should be reversed, \nthe agency is not listening, and we ought to take the opportunity to \ndirect their behavior in a legislative way. Whether or not an amendment \nis approved is decided here in the Senate by a majority vote. I would \ntell you that in the case of this issue, the amendment was offered in \nthe Appropriations Committee. It is included in the Interior \nappropriations bill. The House has adopted similar language in their \nappropriations bill. So for those who say this is inappropriate, this \nis the legislative process as it should be. This is the Senators and \nthe Members of the House of Representatives speaking on behalf of their \nconstituents in a very constitutional and appropriate way.\n  It is important for us to utilize our authority as Members of \nCongress to make decisions that benefit our country as we see best, and \nwe ought to work together to accomplish that. There will be riders--\nprovisions that are offered that are included in an appropriations \nbill--that I will disagree with, but the appropriations process ought \nto work. As a member of the Appropriations Committee and as a Member of \nthe Senate, I want to see us get back to the days in which the power of \nthe legislative branch is able to be utilized and we make certain that \nwe make decisions on how we spend the money.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to be on the Senate floor today to speak \nas we move next week toward the appropriations bill and its conclusion. \nI wish to say that in a bipartisan way, we ought to work together to \nfind opportunities to solve the problems that our constituents and \nAmericans face. The legislative process is a way that we can do that. \nIt is not inappropriate. In fact, it is the constitutional response to \nan abuse of power in an executive branch. Whether it is a Republican \nexecutive branch or a Democratic executive branch, we ought to work \ntogether as Members of Congress in utilizing our constitutional \nauthority to make appropriate decisions for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8227-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. MORAN.

Madam President, throughout my time as ranking member and \nnow chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, finding money for surface \ntransportation infrastructure has been a persistent and seemingly \nintractable problem. Even as we went into this year with a new \nRepublican majority in the Senate, none of us could have imagined that \nwe could find a way to provide 5 years of solvency and stability for \nthe highway trust fund. Yet, with today's announcement of the completed \nconference report, that is precisely where we are right now.\n  The conference report for the Fixing America's Surface Transportation \nAct will hopefully be enacted within a few days' time. As the very \nfirst member of the conference committee to sign the report, I want to \nbriefly talk about the process by which the legislation came about and \nhow we got to where we are now.\n  Immediately before the Memorial Day recess, there was an unsuccessful \nattempt to put together a package to possibly get the highway trust \nfund through the rest of 2016. The agonizing difficulty we faced at \nthat time in dragging ourselves through another 18 months gave us a \ndesire to think bigger than we had before. This is why I was determined \nto help find a way out of the cycle of short-term infrastructure bills \nand why I believed it was necessary for us to think outside of the \nproverbial box and look everywhere for potential offsets.\n  Generally, the Finance Committee is responsible for the financing \ntitle of any highway bill that goes through the Senate. Usually, we do \nour best to work within our committee's jurisdiction to identify \noffsets. However, because those resources have been quickly drying up, \nwe had to look elsewhere for this package.\n  After the committee spent weeks examining numerous options and \nalternatives, I was able to present our distinguished majority leader \nwith a list of offsets that, while not necessarily ideal, would allow \nus to put together a long-term highway bill without raising taxes or \nincreasing the deficit.\n  I am very pleased with the work we were able to do there as that list \nof offsets formed the basis of the funding for the long-term deal we \nwill likely be voting on in short order. As we continued on, by the end \nof July, the Senate had managed to pass a bipartisan infrastructure \nbill with 3 years of solvency, funding, and certainty for the highway \ntrust fund. Though we were required to enact another short-term \nextension before the August recess, momentum had begun to build in both \nChambers for a long-term highway bill.\n  Common practice on highways over the past few years has been to enact \nshort-term extensions and then go and complain about the dysfunction in \nCongress before moving on to the next order of business. The offset \npackage produced by the Senate showed that we could do things \ndifferently and, for the first time in almost two decades, a long-term \ntransportation bill was actually possible.\n  After the August recess, the House began working off of the Senate \nbill as a template for their own legislation. After they passed a \nremarkably similar bill in November, the conference committee came \ntogether to produce the legislation announced today.\n  While I am not one who likes to count chickens before they have been \nhatched--no pun intended--I am optimistic that the bill will pass with \na strong bipartisan vote. Putting these offsets for this long-term bill \ntogether has truly been a group effort. As I mentioned, we searched far \nand wide for offsets that required a number of chairmen and committees \nto work together. I commend my colleagues for their efforts and their \nwillingness to do so and their willingness to do what it took to make \nthe endeavor successful.\n  I especially want to thank Senator Thune and the commerce committee, \nwho assisted these efforts by providing for the transfer of certain \nmotor vehicle safety penalties to the highway trust fund. I also \nappreciate the work done by the House Financial Services Committee and \nCongressman Randy Neugebauer, chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial \nInstitutions and Consumer Credit. He was able to identify a new and \nimportant offset for the infrastructure bill, a feat which few\n\n[[Page S8228]]\n\nhave been capable of. While, as is often the case around here, some are \nvery quick to throw out criticisms of individual offsets and were less \nwilling to offer suggestions for suitable alternatives, Congressman \nNeugebauer, in response to concerns about an item in the original \noffset package, came forward to produce a viable and scorable \nalternative that was able to garner bipartisan support and ultimately \nbroaden the overall support for this long-term deal.\n\n  Back in July, when the Senate first proposed a long-term bill, many \nsaid we couldn't do it without raising taxes. When we passed our first \nbill, these same people claimed that it stood no chance of passage in \nthe House. Now, just a few months later, both Chambers are a few days \naway from considering the conference report built upon the foundation \nlaid by that same Senate bill.\n  This legislation provides a longer extension than the vaunted \nSAFETEA-LU extension, which many had long viewed as a model for a \nmultiyear highway bill. In fact, you would need to go back at least to \nthe late 1990s--actually, to the early 1990s--to find a highway \nreauthorization of comparable duration.\n  As I said, this major bicameral success was unthinkable a few months \nago.\n  While I do acknowledge that we still face the problem of outlays from \nthe highway trust fund outpacing the dedicated revenues, this bill will \ngive us a much needed 5-year break from the deadlines and cliffs that \nall too often dictate how we deal with the highway trust fund. It is, \nquite simply, a great example of what we can do when we work together.\n  I would like to briefly note that these types of victories for good \ngovernment have been piling up all year under the current Senate \nmajority.\n  We do need to start thinking now about more permanent solutions on \nhighways, but once we pass this bill, we will be in a better position \nthan at any time in nearly two decades to do so. That, as they say, is \nnothing to sneeze at.\n  Before I conclude, I wish to pay tribute to Chairman Inhofe, Chairman \nShuster, and Barbara Boxer and her Democratic counterpart in the House, \nwho led a conference committee that was able to sift through various \nissues and put together a very complex piece of legislation in a matter \nof just a few weeks. These two chairmen deserve a lot of credit for \ntheir efforts, as do all the Members who took part in the conference.\n  Today Congress is making headway to implementing the longest highway \nreauthorization bill in more than 15 years. We have heard time and \nagain that a long-term highway bill would only be possible if we \nincluded a big tax increase. Yet we have been able to defy the odds and \nprovide much needed funding for America's bridges, highways, and roads \nfor the next 5 years. This marks a watershed moment for our \ntransportation community, which will now have the security and \nstability they need to plan, implement, and complete critical \ninfrastructure projects.\n  Of course, while we have crossed a major hurdle today, our job is not \nyet over. There is still one more vote to go, and I am confident we \nwill get there.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to complete our work and ensure that a strong multiyear \nhighway bill is signed into law this year. I look forward to working \nwith all of my colleagues for whatever challenges lie ahead.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner).

Mr. President, when you are home and the television is \non, the phone starts to ring, your dog is at the back door barking, and \nthe kids need help doing their homework, occasionally you can forget \nthat dinner is on the stove, but if you forget about it too long, your \nhouse will catch on fire, and that is going to be a problem. You can \nget distracted by a lot of things and suddenly miss out on something \nthat is very important.\n  Our Nation is dealing with a lot of issues right now, such as \nterrorism, immigration, banking issues, our economy, education, \ntransportation, and I do have a concern that we have forgotten this \nyear we still have $450 billion in deficit and a total debt of $19 \ntrillion hanging over our heads.\n  If we were in any State in America and faced with that, the \nlegislative branch would work, make hard decisions, and then balance \ntheir budget. Every single State, at the end of the legislative \nsession, comes to a balanced budget, but we don't. We just overspend, \nand it has happened consecutively so many times now, our debt has built \nup to $19 trillion. I don't have an easy way to articulate $19 trillion \nof debt, but let me give you a picture of that. Earlier this year we \npassed a 10-year budget plan that would get rid of our $450 billion of \ndeficit and would slowly work down, within 10 years, back to a balance. \nGood.\n  Let's do a hypothetical. Let's say we finish out that path, and we \nhave to get back to a balance within 10 years, and then in year 11 we \ndo very well and we have a $50 billion surplus. It is a good surplus. \nHere is my question: How many years in a row would we have to have that \n$50 billion surplus before we paid off our debt? If you are doing the \nmath in your head, the correct answer is 460 years in a row. If we had \na $50 billion surplus for 460 years in a row, we could pay off our \ndebt. That is not going to happen, is it? We are in a bad spot, and my \nfear is that we are distracted and we are not focusing on something \nthat will come back and bite us.\n  What do we do about that? I ask if we can do the first thing: Can we \nat least agree that this is a problem and that we should actually work \nto balance our budget? At least have that as the common ground that we \ncan agree on in this body and say we need to get back to a balanced \nbudget, and then we need to begin to pay this down and start that \nprocess--to approach this issue in a way that I think can develop real \nsolutions. We need to find common-ground areas, but first we need to \nbegin with that one simple principle.\n  Our office has come up with a list which we affectionally call the \nFederal Fumbles List--100 ways the Federal Government has dropped the \nball. We are identifying areas of waste, duplication, and, quite \nfrankly, regulations that are well outside the purview of the Federal \nGovernment, many of which slow down the economy and drive up the costs \nto consumers.\n  These Federal fumbles are not an exhaustive list. This is not \neverything; This is just our list. We took some from multiple agencies \nand entities. As we pulled this list together, we encouraged this. This \nis our to-do list. We encourage other offices to start their to-do list \nso at least we can have a common-ground sense of, let's get back to a \nbalance and work together to identify something within our own office \nto find out ways we can deal with some simple things, such as, how are \nwe wasting taxpayer dollars? What programs are ripe with fraud? What \nduplication and inefficiency is out there? Where are we overregulating, \nwhich in turn raises the costs of goods and services for consumers? And \nhow does the government actually have processes in place that deceive \ntaxpayers and add debt to their families?\n  When we walked through this, we had a common agreement on our team: \nWe are not just going to identify problems; we are going to actually \nwork together to find a solution. Our issues and conversations have \nbeen simple. If I am back home in Oklahoma, I can sit in the \ncoffeehouse with other folks eating breakfast and talk about all the \nproblems, but when I get back in this room, we can't just complain \nabout the issues, we have to fix those issues. That is our job. We \nspend a tremendous amount of time just complaining about the issues as \nif fixing it comes from somewhere else.\n  So we take all 100 of these issues and say: Here is the problem, and \nhere is the solution we have proposed. If people have different ideas \nand different solutions, bring them, but let's at least agree that \nthese things should be resolved. Some of them are small, some of them \nare large, but we simply asked the question: How do we fix this?\n  I have several things to say on that issue. One is that we have to \nfix our budgeting process and the way we make decisions about it.\n\n[[Page S8229]]\n\n  We have these cute little terms in our budgeting process, such as \nCHIMPS, changes in mandatory programs. It is a cute term, but the \nproblem is that adds $11 billion to the debt every year and everyone \njust pretends that it is not there, that it is not real.\n  There is a fund called the Crime Victims Fund. This fund is supposed \nto go directly to what it says--to crime victims--but it is actually \nnot used for crime victims.\n  Eleven billion dollars each year--in fact, this is the same $11 \nbillion that is used each year as an offset for additional spending, \nbut the money never actually moves out of that account, it just stays \nthere. We pretend we are going to spend it and then actually spend it \nsomewhere else and then the next year do the same thing again. It is \ndeceptive. We have to stop that. That adds deficit and debt onto \nfamilies by a deceptive tactic.\n  We have a thing called the corporate payment shift. This one is fun \nas well. The corporate payment shift assumes that money is going to \ncome in or be spent, and we have a 10-year budgeting window and move it \nin the very last month to year 10 plus 1 month. We move it just \nslightly out of the budget window, but we say we are going to spend it \nand actually go ahead and spend it anyway. If we had a budget that was \n10 years and 1 month, it would be out of balance, but if we put that \nlittle corporate payment shift in there, it looks fine on paper, but in \nreality it doesn't work. So we identify that as one of the fumbles that \nwe have as a government. It is something that we obviously have to fix. \nBasic oversight will help that, but it is also this body making a \ndecision on how we are going to budget it.\n  We also walked through a lot of areas where we just identified things \nthat the Federal Government spends money on that we thought were rather \nunique to spend money on and we thought may need some oversight.\n  How about a $43 million natural gas filling station built in \nAfghanistan? It cost $43 million for one natural gas filling station. \nNow that that station is in place, it is not being used at all and it \nis a $43 million waste.\n  How about the Academy Awards. It is a pretty ritzy event. The Academy \nAwards are choosing to build a $250 million museum, and the Federal \ntaxpayers are kicking in $25,000 to that museum. Why in the world are \nwe kicking in $25,000? Did we believe at some point that they couldn't \nraise the last $25,000, and so we had to kick in a Federal connection \nto it? I would disagree.\n  One of my favorites is the fact that we just spent almost $50,000 to \nstudy the history of tobacco use in Russia. I am still looking for the \nnational security implications of why we just spent $50,000 to study \ncigarette use in Russia.\n  The National Park Service spent $65,000 doing a study on what happens \nto bugs when you turn on a light in dark areas. I can tell anyone in \nthis Chamber what bugs do if you turn on a light in a rural area. They \nfly at the light. But we spent $65,000 trying to investigate that.\n  The VA in Arkansas installed solar panels to show that they have \ngreen energy in this area. Many VA centers around the country are doing \nthis project. The particular one in Arkansas put them on in the wrong \nspot, relocated them, and spent $8 million in total just for the \ninstallation for their solar panels. Any guess on how long those solar \npanels will have to run continuously to before they pay off the cost of \ninstallation? They will have to run continuously for 40 years just to \npay for the cost of installation. That is not green energy, that is \njust waste.\n  How about a challenge like this. The Social Security Administration--\nthe definition for Social Security disability is that you cannot work \nin any job in the economy. You are only eligible for Social Security \ndisability if you cannot work in any job in the economy. But there are \nindividuals who receive both Social Security disability, which by \ndefinition means you cannot work, and unemployment insurance, which by \ndefinition means you are looking for a job. You should not be able to \nget unemployment insurance and Social Security disability insurance at \nthe same time. They violate the definitions between the two. Even the \nPresident of the United States agrees with that. Yet we have not been \nable to get that done. That is a fumble.\n  As American taxpayers, we spent $374,000 studying the dating habits \nof senior adults. Can someone help me understand what the national \nsecurity implications are for that and why we spent $374,000 studying \nthe dating habits of senior adults?\n  We also created what is called the Ambassador Slush Fund.\n  The Ambassador's Cultural Fund from the State Department, $5 \nmillion--almost $6 million--is designed to be able to help us give away \nmoney to do construction in other areas.\n  We have done projects like building a welcome grotto into a Buddhist \ntemple in China, which I find the ultimate irony. If any church in \nAmerica said we wanted to be able to add on a welcome center onto our \nchurch, we would forbid the use of taxpayer dollars for that, but in \nChina we literally borrowed money from them, gave it to our State \nDepartment so they could build a welcome grotto into a Buddhist temple \nback in China. I am not sure that is a great idea.\n  The State Department also has a Twitter account called \nThinkAgainTurnAway. It is to discourage people from joining the jihadi \nmovement. Any guess on how much Americans spend for a Twitter account? \nFor that one Twitter account with 23,000 followers, we spent $5 \nmillion--$5 million to maintain a Twitter account. I am very confident \nthere are multiple teenagers at home who could help us run that for a \nlot less than the price.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to extend my remarks for a \ncouple more moments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Let me mention just a couple more.\n  I have a real concern that our Social Security Administration is not \nsharing what is called the death master file. That may seem like a \nmacabre comment, but what happens is, if we don't share the death \nmaster file, then we literally don't know in other agencies when to be \nable to pull a Social Security number off the record. The Social \nSecurity Administration recognizes that someone has passed away, but \nthe IRS doesn't, so that is still a live Social Security number to \nthem, meaning someone could get that Social Security number, file, get \na work permit, even register and vote--all sorts of things can be \ndone--under that number.\n  We have 6.5 million people, according to our government, who are over \n112 years old--6.5 million people. That is quite a few. Actually, in \nthe world, there are less than 100, but according to our government we \nhave 6.5 million and those numbers are being abused.\n  I can't even get into multiple issues, but let me just mention one \nmore on this list of waste. We identified what many Americans already \nknow. Social Security numbers are being stolen and used to file \nfraudulent tax forms. Many Americans in the coming months will file \ntheir taxes only to get notification from the IRS that someone has \nalready filed under this number. It is infuriating to them, and it is \nbillions of dollars of loss to the Federal taxpayer. The IRS knows how \nto fix this. We list out the solutions. We have to actually implement \nthe fixes. We have to be able to protect the taxpayer and to protect \nindividuals from identify theft. That is a fumble, but it is fixable \nand we need to do it.\n  I haven't even gotten into some simple things such as school \nlunches--ask any teenager what they think of school lunches at this \npoint with the new regulations--or waters of the United States and how \neven the Corps of Engineers doesn't want to implement the new EPA rule. \nThe fiduciary standard is causing chaos among retirees and individuals \nwanting to get retirement advice or rural banks in how they want to be \nable to give out loans for mortgages but can't in many rural areas of \nAmerica.\n  There are solutions to these problems, and it is our responsibility \nto be able to work through the process to solve them. With $450 billion \nin deficit spending and an economy that continues to slow down, this \nbody needs to determine what our job is and do it. It would be my \nencouragement in the days ahead that we actually achieve that; that in \nthe days ahead we speak of what we have solved for the American people \nrather than pretending, as\n\n[[Page S8230]]\n\nwe are eating breakfast back home with some friends who are complaining \nabout the problems. It is time for us to fix the problems.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, policymakers from all over the world will \nbe meeting in Paris this week and next to address the issue of climate \nchange. With much fanfare, they will purport to reach an agreement that \nwill prevent the Earth's ``average global air temperature'' from rising \nmore than 2 degrees Celsius. This 2-degree limit will supposedly mean \nsuccess for the conference in Paris and success in the battle against \nglobal warming, thus preventing catastrophic events from occurring.\n  So I come to the floor to call attention to several news articles \npointing out problems with this approach, with this 2-degree Celsius \napproach. The first is a front-page story from yesterday's Wall Street \nJournal. I hold it in my hand. It is titled ``Climate Experts Question \nTemperature Benchmark.'' This is not an opinion piece, it is a news \narticle. The article points out that the 2-degree target is both \narbitrary and based on questionable research.\n  The article quotes Mark Maslin, professor of climatology at the \nUniversity College London, saying:\n\n       It emerged from a political agenda, not a scientific \n     analysis. It's not a sensible, rational target.\n\n  The article goes on to say that despite assumptions by policymakers, \nthe 2-degree target does not express ``a solid scientific view.'' \nIndeed, no report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \neven mentions the 2-degree limit.\n  Economics Professor William Nordhaus appears to have been the first \nto use the 2-degree figure. The article notes that his work ``argued \nthat a rise of two or more degrees would put the earth's climate \noutside the observable range of temperature over the last several \nhundred thousand years.'' I ask my colleagues how did they measure air \ntemperature 100,000 years ago, 200,000 years ago, as Professor Nordhaus \nappears to have been concerned about. I would also point out to my \ncolleagues that being outside the observable range is far different \nthan being catastrophic. It is not the same thing, but from that has \nevolved the 2-degree model.\n  This is not the first time the model has been criticized. In October \nof last year, David Victor and Charles Kennel wrote about it in the \njournal Nature. Victor is a professor of international relations at the \nUniversity of California San Diego and Kennel is a professor at the \nScripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, CA.\n  Yesterday I got this article from the journal Nature and read it \nmyself. In their piece, Professors Victor and Kennel wrote:\n\n       Politically and scientifically, the 2 degree Celsius goal \n     is wrong-headed. . . . It has allowed some governments to \n     pretend that they are taking serious action to mitigate \n     global warming, when in reality they have achieved almost \n     nothing.\n\n  This is one of the things I worry about. This is one of the things I \nfear from the Paris conference. The United States will agree to do a \nlot, costing job growth here, and other countries will do almost \nnothing, as the professors say.\n  Victor and Kennel say that the 2009 and 2010 U.S. conferences in \nCopenhagen and Cancun officially adopted this approach. They then \nconclude: ``There was little scientific basis for the 2 degrees Celsius \nfigure that was adopted.''\n  Additionally, in an op-ed last month for the Wall Street Journal, \nenvironmentalist Bjorn Lomborg cites his own peer-reviewed study to \nshow how the most high-flown promises in Paris will fail to make any \nsubstantial impact on climate change.\n  Even if every country fulfills every promise made in Paris over the \nnext decade and a half, according to Dr. Lomborg, the growth of global \ntemperatures would be reduced by less than .05 degrees Celsius, or \nfive-hundredths of a degree Celsius--by the end of the century, the \nyear 2100. So is it 2 degrees or is it less than five-hundredths of a \ndegree? And is 2 degrees sensible and rational? Not according to \nProfessors Maslin, Victor, Kennel, and certainly not according to Dr. \nLomborg.\n  One more quote from Professors Victor and Kennel. They point out one \nof the major problems in the 2-degree Celsius approach: ``Failure to \nset scientifically meaningful goals makes it hard for scientists and \npoliticians to explain how big investments in climate production will \ndeliver tangible results.''\n  Yes, what are the tangible results? What can we expect in tangible \nresults from the agreements that will certainly come out of Paris? We \nwill be $3 billion poorer, that is for certain, because the President \nhas pledged $3 billion from taxpayers for the Green Climate Fund. I \nwould point out that $3 billion could be used for Alzheimer's research \nor malaria or malnutrition or any number of the other problems the \npeople of the world see as more important than climate change.\n  Tangible results coming out of Paris: Electricity bills will be \nhigher. Lower income Americans will be colder in their own homes, our \neconomy will have suffered, and job growth will have been slowed, \nperhaps by as much as $154 billion a year. That figure comes from \nStanford University analysts who say that if we adopt the Obama \nadministration's proposal of cutting domestic carbon dioxide emissions \nby as much as 28 percent, GDP will be reduced by $154 billion per year.\n  If we spend all of this money, trim our GDP by $154 billion a year, \nand actually achieve this impractical 2 degrees Celsius, where will \nhumankind be then? How much will the sea level not rise? No one can \nsay. How much thicker will the icecap be in the Arctic or Antarctic? No \none knows. How many coral reefs will be preserved? No one will even \nventure a guess. All of this to be done, all of this money to be spent, \nand experts cannot say how much it will help, if at all.\n  Dr. Lomborg writes that the Paris agreements are ``likely to see \ncountries that have flourished with capitalism willingly compromising \ntheir future prosperity in the name of climate change.'' Negotiators in \nParis should weigh the real-world costs against the negligible \nenvironmental impact when discussing emissions reductions.\n  Finally, the Obama administration's international promises should \ncome back to the Senate for advice and consent of Congress. Under the \nConstitution, the approval by two-thirds in the Senate is needed to \nenter into a legally binding treaty. I join many of my colleagues in \nurging the President to submit to Congress any agreement in Paris with \nregard to U.S. emissions targets and timetables or pledges that \nappropriate taxpayer dollars.\n  Americans should have a say in the approval process. A recent FOX \nNews poll showed that only 3 percent of Americans believe that climate \nchange is the most important issue facing our country.\n  In conclusion, the President's promises in Paris are not based on \nscientific analysis, according to these professors, but would certainly \nslow the economy, cost jobs, cost billions of dollars, divert money \nfrom real and pressing needs, and be of limited value. With so much at \nstake, these policies should come back to Congress for debate, \nconsultation, and approval or disapproval.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor because we are \ndiscussing ObamaCare on the reconciliation bill. Webster's dictionary \ndefines the word ``success'' as the correct or desired result of an \nattempt. So I want to discuss the definition of the word ``success'' as \nwe consider repeal of ObamaCare.\n  On the day the bill was signed into law, President Obama said the \nfollowing:\n\n\n[[Page S8231]]\n\n\n  \n\n       Today we are affirming that essential truth, a truth every \n     generation is called to rediscover for itself, that we are \n     not a nation that scales back its aspirations.\n\n  Such grand words for where we are today with ObamaCare. Today the \nsuccess of the law that now bears his name, ObamaCare, is defined in \nmuch more meager terms. Think of all we have been through to this \npoint: the fight over the bill and the extreme legislative means used \nto pass it through the Congress; the Supreme Court decision that \neffectively repealed half of the law's coverage. Think of all the \nchanges made to the law through regulation to make sure ObamaCare \nactually got launched--the postponing of the employer mandate, the \npostponing of lifetime limits. Think of the impact this law has had on \nour economy--people losing jobs, people losing the health insurance \nthey currently have because if you like what you have, you may not be \nable to keep it.\n  Let's talk about that for a moment. ``If you like what you have, you \ncan keep it.'' This was the promise the President made to the American \npeople on at least 36 separate occasions. It is a great sound bite. It \nis easy to say. It rolls off the tongue. It is also not true. It was \nnever true. It obviously was not true when the law was written. It was \nobviously not true when the first proposed regulation came out.\n  This is what I said on the Senate floor in September of 2010:\n\n       Only in the District of Columbia could you get away with \n     telling the people ``if you like what you have, you can keep \n     it,'' and then pass regulations 6 months later that do just \n     the opposite, and figure that people are going to ignore it.\n\n  It is not that I have some magic crystal ball. We all knew it. The \nadministration certainly knew the day would come when millions of \npeople would receive cancellation notices. My constituents clearly know \nthat. I heard from many Iowans who found out the hard way that the \nPresident made a bunch of pie-in-the-sky promises that he knew he \ncouldn't keep; constituents such as this one from Perry, IA, who wrote \nto me saying:\n\n       My husband and I are farmers. For nine years now we have \n     bought our own policy. To keep the cost affordable our plan \n     is a major medical plan with a very high deductible. We \n     recently received a letter that our plan was going away. \n     Effective January 1, 2014, it will be updated to comply with \n     the mandates of ObamaCare.\n       To manage the risks of much higher premiums, our insurance \n     company is asking us to cancel our current policy and sign on \n     at a higher rate effective December 31, 2013 or we could go \n     to the government exchange.\n       We did not get to keep our current policy. We did not get \n     to keep our lower rates. I now have to pay for coverage that \n     I do not want or will never use. We are not low income that \n     might qualify for assistance.\n       We are the small business owner that is trying to live the \n     American dream. I do not believe in large government that \n     wants to run my life.\n\n  From a constituent living in Mason City:\n\n       My wife and I are both 60 years old, and have been covered \n     by an excellent Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield policy for \n     several years. It is not through my employer. We selected the \n     plan because it had the features we wanted and needed . . . \n     our choice. And because we are healthy, we have a preferred \n     premium rate.\n       Yesterday, we got a call from our agent explaining that \n     since our plan is not grandfathered, it will need to be \n     replaced by the end of 2014. The current plan has a $5,000 \n     deductible and the premium is $511 a month. The best option \n     going forward for us from Wellmark would cost $955 per month \n     (a modest 87 percent increase), and have a $10,000 \n     deductible. And because we have been diligent and responsible \n     in saving for our upcoming retirement, we do not qualify for \n     any taxpayer-funded subsidies.\n\n  These are just two of many letters, emails, and phone calls I have \nreceived from Iowans.\n  Now the issue has turned to cost. Millions of people face rising \npremiums. The impact is real and undeniable.\n  Here is another from a constituent from Des Moines:\n\n       In 2013, I encountered some medical problems which caused \n     me to retire early. My spouse works as an adjunct instructor \n     . . . thus not qualifying for coverage. In 2014, with 4 part-\n     time jobs between us, we made $44,289 in Adjusted Gross \n     Income.\n       Our Obamacare insurance cost $968 per month and after \n     credits, we paid $478 per month or approximately 13 percent \n     of our Adjusted Gross Income. In 2015, our Adjusted Gross \n     Income will be approximately the same, however our Obamacare \n     insurance jumped to a premium of $1,028.82 and our cost to \n     $590.12.\n       The insurance company touted that premiums went up less \n     than 10 percent, but as you can see, my costs went up 23 \n     percent. The impact to Adjusted Gross Income went to 16 \n     percent, a 23 percent increase. I just received my 2016 \n     premium estimate. Our Adjusted Gross Income is likely to be \n     the same. Our gross premium is scheduled to rise 36 percent \n     to nearly $1,400; our cost after the credit is jumping 63 \n     percent and the impact to our Adjusted Gross Income is that \n     25 percent of our income will be spent on health insurance (a \n     56 percent increase).\n\n  Thousands of Iowans have contacted me asking what can be done. Now \nthat we clearly see that what the President sold the American people \nwas a bag of Washington's best gift-wrapped hot air. All the grandiose \ntalk about the importance of this statute, and what we ultimately have \nis an optional Medicaid expansion with a glorified high-risk pool and a \ngovernment portal that makes DMV look efficient.\n  Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the co-op disaster. \nThe first co-op to fall was Iowa's CoOportunity. CoOportunity enrolled \nthe second most beneficiaries of any co-op in America. CoOportunity \nknew they were in trouble because they enrolled more than 100,000 \npeople when they were planning for less than 20,000. CoOportunity was \nin contact with CMS and so was the State of Iowa. CMS chose not to \nfurther fund CoOportunity and CoOportunity has since been liquidated. \nAmerican taxpayers have billions of dollars invested in these co-ops. \nThe taxpayer only gets their money back when co-ops succeed. CMS's \nstewardship of this program has proven that CoOportunity was not an \nexception but unfortunately the rule as more and more co-ops have \nfailed.\n  Americans deserve better. They voted for better. It is time to admit \nthat ObamaCare has not achieved the correct or desired result of an \nattempt. It has not been a success by any measure, unless, of course, \nyou lower your standard to the point that the mere act of keeping the \ndoors open is a success. How sad is that for all we have been through.\n  Maybe, just maybe, it is time to admit that the massive restructuring \nhas failed. Partisanship has failed. Perhaps it is time to sit down and \nconsider commonsense, bipartisan steps that we could take to lower the \ncost and improve quality. Perhaps we could enact alternative reforms \naimed at solving America's biggest health care problems, reforms like \nrevising the Tax Code to help individuals who buy their own health \ninsurance, allowing people to purchase health coverage across State \nlines and form risk pools in the individual market, expanding tax-free \nhealth savings accounts, making health care price and quality \ninformation more transparent, cracking down on frivolous medical \nmalpractice lawsuits, using high-risk pools to insure folks with \npreexisting conditions, giving States more freedom to improve Medicaid, \nand using provider competition and consumer choice to bring down costs \nin Medicare and throughout the health care delivery system.\n  The American people need to know that this failed program is not the \nonly answer and we are not scaling back our aspirations. With this vote \nthis week, we once again demonstrate to the American people our \nwillingness to not accept failure and to aim for better. That is what \nAmerica is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8231-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, with so many issues to wrap up before the \nend of this year and so many enormous challenges facing our country, my \nview is the Senate ought to be embracing bipartisanship at every turn. \nIn fact, earlier today the senior Senator from Iowa and I released an \n18-month bipartisan inquiry into Solvaldi, which is the blockbuster \ndrug to deal with hepatitis C, and the reason we did is because these \nspecialty drugs are the\n\n[[Page S8232]]\n\ndrugs of the future for cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and defeating \nhepatitis C if people can afford them. Using the company's own \ndocuments, there were real questions about whether access and \naffordability were just kind of an oversight because all they truly \ncared about was maximizing revenue. A Republican, a senior Member of \nthis body, a good friend of mine, and I as a Democrat came together \nbecause we thought this question of making sure the public can get \naccess to breakthrough cures and that they be affordable was something \nthat would require bipartisan effort. I am very proud that the senior \nSenator from Iowa and I joined in that effort earlier today.\n  We ought to be embracing bipartisanship. I come tonight to \nunfortunately talk about this reconciliation legislation because I \nthink it is the antithesis of what Chairman Grassley and I sought to do \nearlier today, which was to take a bipartisan approach. The \nreconciliation legislation in my view is a rejection of bipartisanship. \nIt is a rejection of bipartisanship because it would, for example, \nundermine women's health, it would mean millions more Americans go \nwithout insurance, and it puts at risk our ability to have affordable \nhealth insurance premiums. I think it is going to drive up these health \ninsurance premiums.\n  So I am going to just spend a few minutes tonight talking about why I \nobject to this legislation and again why it really is the antithesis of \nthe kind of bipartisanship that we need.\n  My first concern is that the Senate is looking once again at a plan \nthat would wreak havoc on women's health in our country by denying the \nfunding for Planned Parenthood. It is important to recognize the \nhorrific act of gun violence that happened at a Colorado Planned \nParenthood clinic last week. It was another in a long stream of \ntragedies that have taken place across the Nation, including one in my \nhome State in Roseburg, OR, in October. This time it marked an attack \non the public and women's health.\n  Millions of women have sought routine, medical care in Planned \nParenthood clinics just like the one in Colorado. More than 70,000 \nOregonians are served by the 11 Planned Parenthood centers in my home \nState.\n  The bottom line is that Planned Parenthood is a bedrock institution \nfor women's health care in America. In my view it is wrong to bring \nsuch a misguided, controversial proposal before this body in the wake \nof the horrible, tragic events in Colorado.\n  These are the services Planned Parenthood offers that would be at \nrisk of disappearing with this reconciliation proposal: pregnancy \ntests, birth control, prenatal services, HIV tests, cancer screenings, \nvaccinations, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted \ninfections, basic physical examinations, treatment for chronic \nconditions, pediatric care, adoption referrals, nutrition programs, and \nmore.\n  This seems to be the latest offering in what amounts to an ongoing, \ncoordinated campaign to regrettably undermine the fundamental rights of \nall women in our country to make their own reproductive choices and \nattain affordable, high-quality health care. When you wipe out Planned \nParenthood's funding, you dramatically and painfully reduce women's \naccess to services that have absolutely nothing to do with abortion. \nAnd I want to repeat that; I have done that on this floor before. What \nI have talked about are all those important services: cancer \nscreenings, gone; vaccinations, gone; basic physical exams, gone; \ntreatment for chronic conditions, gone; pediatric care, gone. The list \ngoes on and on and has absolutely nothing to do with abortion. So I \nhope that this campaign against women's health will come to an end.\n  The second objection I want to touch on tonight is the harm the bill \nthreatens to do to millions of vulnerable Americans by repealing as \nmuch of the Affordable Care Act, frankly, as Senate procedure would \nallow. Based on the reports of the bill's contents, this is what is at \nstake. According to the nonpartisan experts at the Congressional Budget \nOffice, this proposal would mean 14 million more Americans would go \nwithout health insurance. For people who shop for their own private \ninsurance coverage, premiums would increase by 20 percent. That is \npotentially hundreds or thousands of dollars taken out of families' \npockets. Emergency rooms would once again be the fallback for people \nwithout a doctor. Typical Americans with insurance would once again \nhave to pay the hidden tax of higher premiums to cover the costs of \nthose without coverage.\n  There have been more than 50 votes to repeal or undermine the \nAffordable Care Act, and there is still no viable plan to replace it. \nAs a Member of Congress, you can object to a law and want to make \nchanges, but America cannot and will not go back to the days when \nhealth care was reserved for the healthy and the wealthy. That is what \nthis plan does.\n  Before I came to Congress, I was codirector of the senior citizens \ngroup, the Gray Panthers, and I remember what health care was like in \nthose days. In effect, the system truly did work for people who were \nhealthy and wealthy. If you were healthy, you didn't have any \npreconditions. You didn't have any of these pre-existing conditions. If \nyou were wealthy, you could just pay the bill, but it was care that \nworked for the healthy and the wealthy.\n  Yet with the Affordable Care Act, that changed. Unfortunately, what \nthis destructive reconciliation bill would do would be to take us back \nto those days when health care was reserved for the healthy and the \nwealthy.\n  The fact is, despite raising costs for families, causing turmoil in \ninsurance markets, and raising the number of uninsured Americans by 14 \nmillion, this bill doesn't even manage to repeal the Affordable Care \nAct fully. That is because of the reconciliation process, because of \nthe way it works, which brings me to the final issue I wish to raise \ntoday.\n  Reconciliation is a sharp departure from the usual procedure for \nSenate debate. Usually bills being considered on the Senate floor are \nsubject to an unlimited debate and unlimited amendment. Further, it \ntypically takes 60 votes to pass a bill, assuring that there is at \nleast some measure of bipartisan support. These regular-order \nprocedures give the Senate its unique character. The reconciliation \nprocedure is an exception to this usual approach. Reconciliation \nimposes tight limits on debate and on amendments, and it allows a vote \nof a bare majority of Senators--51--to pass a bill. The reconciliation \nprocedure originally was created to facilitate the passage of budget-\nrelated bills which can be particularly important and particularly hard \nto pass. But reconciliation shouldn't be a free pass that allows the \nmajority to pass anything it wants on a fast track. That would \nundermine the fundamental character of the Senate.\n  I am concerned that the reconciliation process is being misused here. \nEverybody in the Chamber knows what is happening. This bill is not \ndesigned to address budget-related issues; it is all about repealing \nthe Affordable Care Act to the maximum extent possible. Repeatedly, the \nbill's advocates have proposed to repeal ObamaCare--to dismantle \nObamaCare.\n  A few weeks ago, the Parliamentarian advised that the reconciliation \nprocess could not be used to repeal the individual and employer \nmandates. The Parliamentarian said that would violate what is known as \nthe Byrd rule against extraneous amendments because the budgetary \neffects of the provision would be dwarfed by the health policy effects.\n  In response, the majority has proposed to formally retain the \nmandates but to completely repeal the penalties enforcing them. That is \nnot a straightforward way to legislate. It is a very cynical approach, \nand that is not this Senate at its best.\n  The complete elimination of all penalties is tantamount to repeal of \nthe mandates. A mandate without an enforcement system is not a legal \nrequirement; it is a mere recommendation. It is like having speed \nlimits but not fines for violating. By deleting the penalties, the \nproposal fundamentally alters the character and operation of the law.\n  Finally, I think this would set a very dangerous precedent for this \nbody. These penalties can be eliminated in a reconciliation bill. The \ndoor is going to be open to all kinds of proposals to strip away \npenalties in a future reconciliation bill. For example, you could keep \nan environmental law on the books, but you could just say: Let's\n\n[[Page S8233]]\n\nstrip away the penalties for violating. That would allow a majority to \nfundamentally undermine a nonbudgetary law in a reconciliation bill.\n  I have enormous respect for the Parliamentarian and her staff. They \nwork diligently to serve the Senate, and they have to make some tough \ncalls. I will say that this one leaves me disappointed and perplexed.\n  With so many issues--as I touched on earlier--I would hope that the \nSenate would spend more time doing what Chairman Grassley and I did \nsomewhere in the vicinity of 9 hours or 10 hours ago. We said there was \nan important issue. It happened to be a health care issue as well--\nprescription drugs. We spent 18 months with our very dedicated staffs, \nDemocrats and Republicans working together, to try to find some common \nground. It is a hugely important issue, important to the people of \nColorado, Oregon, and everywhere else. In effect, we said it was \nimportant because it was about the future. The drugs of the future are \ngoing to be specialty drugs, exciting drugs with the opportunity for \nreal cures. People are going to have to be able to afford them, and \nusing the companies' own documents, this morning Chairman Grassley and \nI pointed out how affordability and accessibility weren't actually the \nissue; the issue was maximizing revenue.\n  But most important--whether you agree with the two of us or not--it \nwas bipartisan. It was Democrats and Republicans coming together on a \nhugely important issue.\n  This reconciliation proposal we will deal with on the floor of this \nSenate is a rejection of the kind of bipartisanship that I was part of \nsomething like 8 hours or 10 hours ago. It is part of what I believe \nthe Senate is all about--what the Senate is at its best--as an \ninstitution that functions in a bipartisan way. That is why I felt \ncompelled to come to the floor tonight and lay out my concerns about a \nvery troubling precedent, and that is the one that is being set with \nthe reconciliation bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, respected public servant and renowned \nhistorian Tom Owen has announced that he will be retiring from the \nLouisville Metro Council after next year. Tom is a friend of mine, and \nI want to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for his many \nyears of public service. His deep knowledge of Louisville's past and \nhis great passion to shape our city's future will be greatly missed and \nimpossible to replace.\n  Tom is one of the original members of the metro council, having \nserved since that body's inception in 2002. In 2010 he served as metro \ncouncil president. Tom previously served on the old Louisville Board of \nAldermen from 1990 to 1998.\n  Tom represents district 8, which includes most of the Highlands \nneighborhood. I should mention here that Tom is not only my friend but \nalso my councilman. He is currently the chair of the committee on \nsustainability and a member of the committees on public works, bridges \nand transportation and planning, and zoning and land design.\n  Tom is also a full professor at the University of Louisville; and he \nhas served as a history instructor, an archivist, and a community \nrelations associate at the University of Louisville since 1968. His \nknowledge of the city of Louisville is vast, and he frequently speaks \non local television and radio about Louisville history. He also leads \nwalking tours of historic Louisville and famous city landmarks and \nmakes videos of these walking tours available to the public.\n  Tom earned his Ph.D. in American history from the University of \nKentucky, a master's in history from the University of Louisville, a \nbachelor of divinity from Methodist Theological School in Ohio, and a \nbachelor's degree from Kentucky Wesleyan. He is an elder at Highland \nPresbyterian Church, and of his many hobbies, I know he enjoys \nbicycling and commuting by bicycle, as he has championed bicycle \ncommuting as one his causes on the metro council.\n  Tom has been awarded the Distinguished Service Award from the \nLouisville Historical League, the Outstanding University of Louisville \nEmployee Award, an honorary membership in the Kentucky Chapter of the \nAmerica Institute of Architects, and a Patron Service Award at the \nUniversity of Louisville libraries. As all these awards make clear, Tom \nis widely respected as Louisville's unofficial historian, and his \nabsence from city government will be felt deeply.\n  Tom and I don't always see eye to eye on every issue, but I have \ngreat respect for Tom as a legislator, as an advocate for the citizens \nof the 8th district, and as someone who set out to make a difference \nfor all the citizens of Louisville. Our shared hometown is better off \nthanks to Tom's many years of service. I wish him well in retirement, \nand I am sure his wife, Phyllis, and his children and grandchildren \nwill be glad to spend more time with him. I wish my friend, Tom, all \nthe best in whatever exciting endeavors await him after his time in \noffice draws to a close.\n  The Louisville Courier-Journal published an article detailing Tom's \ncareer and decision to retire. I ask unanimous consent that the article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Nov. 25, 2015]\n\n                 Highlands Councilman Tom Owen Retiring\n\n                         (By Phillip M. Bailey)\n\n       Longtime Metro Councilman Tom Owen announced Wednesday he \n     will not seek re-election next year, opening up a possible \n     avalanche of candidates who will run for his seat \n     representing much of the Highlands neighborhood.\n       Owen, 76, who is an archivist at the University of \n     Louisville, has served on the council since 2003 and was a \n     member of the old Board of Aldermen before that. He told The \n     Courier-Journal last week he was still deliberating on \n     retirement, but said after careful and lengthy consideration \n     that now is the time to step away.\n       ``I had been mulling on this decision for a good two months \n     and that's why there had been rumors out there,'' Owen, D-8th \n     District, said. ``Once I got closer to pushing the send \n     button the more hesitant I became.''\n       Owen, a former council president, was first elected to the \n     old board in 1989 when he defeated incumbent Alderwoman Linda \n     Solley in the Democratic primary. In that campaign, Owen ran \n     on his credentials as a local historian, saying at the time \n     he was the ``only candidate who knows the city of Louisville \n     edge to edge and has a vision of the whole city's history and \n     needs.''\n       Among those needs in 1989, Owen said, was a trolley service \n     for the Bardstown Road corridor, safer pedestrian traffic and \n     a citywide paper recycling program. He was the only \n     challenger to beat an incumbent in the nine board primary \n     races that year.\n       ``I love being involved and I'm honored as a historian to \n     think I have shaped the destiny of Louisville even one \n     percent,'' Owen said Wednesday.\n       In a statement, Mayor Greg Fischer said, Owen ``has long \n     been the city's unofficial city historian, quite literally a \n     walking encyclopedia of Louisville history.''\n       Former Councilwoman Tina Ward-Pugh, who also served with \n     Owen on the Board of Aldermen for four years, said the two \n     were political soulmates on a number of issues such as the \n     environment, transportation and gay rights. She said Owen's \n     departure will create a ``vast cavern of institutional \n     knowledge'' for the council.\n       ``Tom and I were virtually joined at the hip on many \n     progressive and social justice issues over the years,'' Ward-\n     Pugh said. ``I probably pushed him a little more than he was \n     comfortable and he held my hand when I was headed out a \n     little too far, so we balanced each other.''\n       Owen ran for mayor in the 1998 Democratic primary where he \n     came just shy of beating Dave Armstrong, who went on to be \n     the last mayor of the old city.\n       The newspaper archives show Owen was one of the early \n     supporters of a Fairness law when the city was first debating \n     adopting an anti-discrimination legislation to protect gay, \n     lesbian, bisexual and transgendered individuals in housing \n     and other public accommodations. Today, Owen is most \n     associated with his push for better public transportation and \n     bicycle advocacy, and he has championed the city adding more \n     bike lanes to major thoroughfares.\n       As a UofL professor of libraries since 1975, colleagues say \n     Owen was always able to put the council's current actions in \n     a historical context.\n       ``Tom's a person I always go to for that information, so I \n     hope he keeps his same phone number,'' Councilman David \n     James, D-6th, said.\n       ``Tom has institutional knowledge, he has brains, he is \n     thoughtful and I have thoroughly enjoyed working with him,'' \n     said Councilman Kelly Downard, R-16th, who is also retiring \n     after this year. ``The council is going to miss him heavily, \n     and boy, there's going to be a hole.''\n       Only half of the Metro Council's 26 members are from the \n     original class who were elected when city and county \n     governments merged in 2002.\n       Owen said he doesn't want to look back on his career just \n     yet and has a lot more he'd like to accomplish in his last \n     year, but he said there are plenty of talented people who can \n     represent the district.\n       William Corey Nett, a member of the Tyler Park Neighborhood \n     Association, filed as a Democratic candidate this month. It \n     is expected that several more contenders will jump in the \n     race to represent the district, which encompasses most of the \n     Highlands neighborhood.\n       The deadline for candidates to run for Metro Council is \n     Jan. 26.\n\n[[Page S8235]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8235-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8235-S8236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING PAST CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY IN INDONESIA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the realignment toward Asia has focused our \nattention on partnerships with countries in the region. We share \npolitical, economic, security, and humanitarian interests, creating \ncomplex and multidimensional relationships. But our commitment to the \nprotection and promotion of human rights must continue to be a \nfoundation for our relations with these countries, as with others \naround the world. We must continue to advocate for open societies where \ndialogue and dissent are encouraged and where security forces are \nprofessional and accountable. At the same time, we cannot ignore \nhistory.\n  Fifty years ago, under the guise of a state-sanctioned Communist \npurge, hundreds of thousands of Indonesian men, women, and children \nwere murdered. Many more were rounded up and led to concentration camps \nwhere they were imprisoned, and many were tortured by the security \nforces of a dictatorial and brutal regime that had the backing of the \nUnited States. It has been widely recognized as one of the worst mass \natrocities of the 20th century, but efforts to establish a truth and \nreconciliation commission to come to terms with these crimes have \nstalled at every turn. The atrocities are still not recognized or \ndiscussed by the Indonesian Government, and the perpetrators were long \ncelebrated as heroes for their actions.\n  The United States should lead by example in acknowledging this tragic \nhistory and reaffirm that human rights are at the forefront of our \nstrategic relationships in Indonesia and beyond. As the most senior \nmember of the Appropriations Committee, I have supported conditions on \nforeign assistance, including requiring recipient countries to protect \nfreedoms of expression and association, respect the rule of law and due \nprocess, reform their judicial systems and security forces, and \nstrengthen other key elements of a democratic society.\n  Through the ``Leahy Law,'' I have sought to encourage reform of \nIndonesia's military and police forces, promote cooperation with \ncivilian authorities, and hold human rights violators accountable. I \nhave also supported efforts to demilitarize West Papua and stop the \nhuman rights violations associated with the militarization of that \nisland.\n  Unfortunately, while Indonesia has made important economic and \npolitical strides since the systemic repression of the Suharto years, \nimpunity for the horrific crimes of the 1960s and during the final \nyears of the independence struggle in East Timor remain glaring \nexamples of unfinished business that are inconsistent with a democratic \nsociety based on the principle that no one is above the law.\n  We need to recognize the role of our own government in this history, \ndeclassify relevant documents, and urge the Indonesian Government to \nacknowledge the massacres and establish a credible truth and justice \nmechanism.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a poignant opinion piece on this subject \nthat was published in the New Yorker on September 29, 2015, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New Yorker, Sept. 29, 2015]\n\n                  Suharto's Purge, Indonesia's Silence\n\n                        (By Joshua Oppenheimer)\n\n       This week marks the 50th anniversary of the beginning of a \n     mass slaughter in Indonesia. With American support, more than \n     500,000 people were murdered by the Indonesian Army and its \n     civilian death squads. At least 750,000 more were tortured \n     and sent to concentration camps, many for decades.\n       The victims were accused of being ``communists,'' an \n     umbrella that included not only members of the legally \n     registered Communist Party, but all likely opponents of \n     Suharto's new military regime--from union members and women's \n     rights activists to teachers and the ethnic Chinese. Unlike \n     in Germany, Rwanda or Cambodia, there have been no trials, no \n     truth-and-reconciliation commissions, no memorials to the \n     victims. Instead, many perpetrators still hold power \n     throughout the country.\n       Indonesia is the world's fourth most populous nation, and \n     if it is to become the democracy it claims to be, this \n     impunity must end. The anniversary is a moment for the United \n     States to support Indonesia's democratic transition by \n     acknowledging the 1965 genocide, and encouraging a process of \n     truth, reconciliation and justice.\n       On Oct. 1, 1965, six army generals in Jakarta were killed \n     by a group of disaffected junior officers. Maj. Gen. Suharto \n     assumed command of the armed forces, blamed the killings on \n     the leftists, and set in motion a killing machine. Millions \n     of people associated with left-leaning organizations were \n     targeted, and the nation dissolved into terror--people even \n     stopped eating fish for fear that fish were eating corpses. \n     Suharto usurped President Sukarno's authority and established \n     himself as de facto president by March 1966. From the very \n     beginning, he enjoyed the full support of the United States.\n       I've spent 12 years investigating the terrible legacy of \n     the genocide, creating two documentary films, ``The Act of \n     Killing'' in 2013 and ``The Look of Silence,'' released \n     earlier this year. I began in 2003, working with a family of \n     survivors. We wanted to show what it is like to live \n     surrounded by still-powerful perpetrators who had murdered \n     your loved ones.\n       The family gathered other survivors to tell their stories, \n     but the army warned them not to participate. Many survivors \n     urged me not to give up and suggested that I film \n     perpetrators in hopes that they would reveal details of the \n     massacres.\n       I did not know if it was safe to approach the killers, but \n     when I did, I found them open. They offered boastful accounts \n     of the killings, often with smiles on their faces and in \n     front of their grandchildren. I felt I had wandered into \n     Germany 40 years after the Holocaust, only to find the Nazis \n     still in power.\n       Today, former political prisoners from this era still face \n     discrimination and threats. Gatherings of elderly survivors \n     are regularly attacked by military-backed thugs. \n     Schoolchildren are still taught that the ``extermination of \n     the communists'' was heroic, and that victims' families \n     should be monitored for disloyalty. This official history, in \n     effect, legitimizes violence against a whole segment of \n     society.\n       The purpose of such intimidation is to create a climate of \n     fear in which corruption and plunder go unchallenged. \n     Inevitably in such an atmosphere, human rights violations \n     have continued since 1965, including the 1975-1999 occupation \n     of East Timor, where enforced starvation contributed to the \n     killing of nearly a third of the population, as well as \n     torture and extrajudicial killing that go on in West Papua \n     today.\n       Military rule in Indonesia formally ended in 1998, but the \n     army remains above the law. If a general orders an entire \n     village massacred, he cannot be tried in civilian courts. The \n     only way he could face justice is if the army itself convenes \n     a military tribunal, or if Parliament establishes a special \n     human rights court--something it has never done fairly and \n     effectively. With the military not subject to law, a shadow \n     state of paramilitaries and intelligence agencies has formed \n     around it. This shadow state continues to intimidate the \n     public into silence while, together with its business \n     partners, it loots the national wealth.\n       Indonesia can hold regular elections, but if the laws do \n     not apply to the most powerful elements in society, then \n     there is no rule of law, and no genuine democracy. The \n     country will never become a true democracy until it takes \n     serious steps to end impunity. An essential start is a \n     process of truth, reconciliation and justice.\n       This may still be possible. The Indonesian media, which \n     used to shy from discussing the genocide, now refers to the \n     killings as crimes against humanity, and grassroots activism \n     has taken hold. The current president, Joko Widodo, indicated \n     he would address the 1965 massacre, but he has not \n     established a truth commission, issued a national apology, or \n     taken any other steps to end the military's impunity.\n       We need truth and accountability from the United States as \n     well. U.S. involvement dates at least to an April 1962 \n     meeting between American and British officials resulting in \n     the decision to ``liquidate'' President Sukarno, the \n     populist--but not communist--founding father of Indonesia. As \n     a founder of the nonaligned movement, Sukarno favored \n     socialist policies; Washington wanted to replace him with \n     someone more deferential to Western strategic and commercial \n     interests.\n       The United States conducted covert operations to \n     destabilize Sukarno and strengthen the military. Then, when \n     genocide broke out, America provided equipment, weapons and \n     money. The United States compiled lists containing thousands \n     of names of public figures likely to oppose the new military \n     regime, and handed them over to the Indonesian military, \n     presumably with the expectation that they would be killed. \n     Western aid to Suharto's dictatorship, ultimately amounting \n     to tens of billions of dollars, began flowing while corpses \n     still clogged Indonesia's rivers. The American media \n     celebrated Suharto's rise and his campaign of death. Time \n     magazine said it was the ``best news for years in Asia.''\n       But the extent of America's role remains hidden behind a \n     wall of secrecy: C.I.A. documents and U.S. defense attach \n     papers remain classified. Numerous Freedom of Information Act \n     requests for these documents have been denied. Senator Tom \n     Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, will soon reintroduce a \n     resolution that, if passed, would acknowledge America's role \n     in the atrocities, call for declassification of all relevant \n     documents, and urge the Indonesian government to acknowledge \n     the massacres and establish a truth commission. If the U.S. \n     government recognizes the genocide publicly, acknowledges its\n\n[[Page S8236]]\n\n     role in the crimes, and releases all documents pertaining to \n     the issue, it will encourage the Indonesian government to do \n     the same.\n       This anniversary should be a reminder that although we want \n     to move on, although nothing will wake the dead or make whole \n     what has been broken, we must stop, honor the lives \n     destroyed, acknowledge our role in the destruction, and allow \n     the healing process to begin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8236-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CBO COST ESTIMATE--S. 720\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

The legislation would modify the terms and \n     conditions governing certain leasing activities and authorize \n     new direct spending of proceeds from federal oil and gas \n     leasing for certain programs and for payments to certain \n     coastal states. In addition, the bill would authorize \n     appropriations for grants to Indian tribes for capital \n     projects and other activities aimed at adapting to climate \n     change.\n       CBO estimates that enacting S. 2011 would reduce net direct \n     spending by about $0.2 billion over the 2016-2025 period. \n     Provisions in titles I-Ill would affect oil and gas leasing \n     on the OCS and CBO estimates those provisions would have a \n     net cost about $1.3 billion over the 10 year period. \n     Increased collections from eliminating restrictions on \n     exports of crude oil would total $1.4 billion over the same \n     period.\n       In addition, CBO estimates that implementing the bill would \n     increase spending subject to appropriation by about $700 \n     million over the 2016-2020 period mainly for programs to \n     assist Indian tribes. Because enacting the legislation would \n     affect direct spending, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. \n     Enacting the bill would not affect revenues.\n       CBO estimates that enacting the legislation would increase \n     both direct spending and net on-budget deficits by more than \n     $5 billion in at least one of the four consecutive 10-year \n     periods beginning in 2026.\n       The bill contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined \n     in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would impose \n     no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. To the \n     extent that the bill would increase royalties and other \n     revenue from offshore oil and gas development, the bill would \n     benefit certain coastal states through the sharing of leasing \n     receipts with the federal government. Some local and tribal \n     governments, as well as 2 institutions of higher education, \n     also would benefit from receipt sharing and grant programs \n     funded by leasing revenues.\n       The bill contains no private-sector mandates as defined in \n     UMRA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8236-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8236-S8237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CBO COST ESTIMATE--S. 2012\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

I respectfully ask \nunanimous consent that the summary of the opinion of the Congressional \nBudget Office be printed in the Congressional Record. The full estimate \nis available on CBO's Web site www.cbo.gov.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate\n\n\n            S. 2012--Energy Policy Modernization Act of 2015\n\n                           (October 15, 2015)\n\n       Summary: S. 2012 would amend current law and authorize \n     appropriations for a variety of activities and programs \n     administered primarily by the Department of Energy (DOE). The \n     legislation also would:\n       Expand and extend federal agencies' authority to use \n     certain types of long-term contracts to invest in energy \n     conservation measures and related services;\n       Specify various energy-related goals and requirements for \n     federal agencies;\n       Modify DOE's authority to guarantee loans under Title 17 of \n     the Energy Policy Act of 2005; and\n       Establish a pilot program to streamline the review and \n     approval of applications for permits to drill for oil and gas \n     on federal lands.\n       Assuming appropriation of amounts specifically authorized \n     and estimated to be necessary under S. 2012--roughly $40 \n     billion over the 2016-2020 period (and an additional $3 \n     billion in later years)--CBO estimates that implementing this \n     legislation would result in outlays totaling $32 billion over \n     the 2016-2020 period from those appropriations, with \n     additional spending of about $11 billion occurring after \n     2020.\n       CBO also estimates that the bill would result in additional \n     direct spending. The estimated amount of direct spending \n     depends on the budgetary treatment of federal commitments \n     through certain types of long-term energy-related contracts, \n     which CBO expects would increase under the bill. In CBO's \n     view, commitments under such contracts are a form of direct \n     spending because agencies enter into such contracts without \n     appropriations in advance to cover their full costs. On the \n     basis of that view, CBO estimates that enacting S. 2012 would \n     increase direct spending by $659 million over the 2016-2025 \n     period.\n       However, for purposes of determining budget-related points \n     of order for legislation considered by the Senate, section \n     3207 of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal \n     Year 2016 specifies a scoring rule for provisions related to \n     such contracts (referred to in this document as the scoring \n     rule for energy contracts). Specifically, that rule requires \n     CBO to calculate, on a net present value basis, the lifetime \n     net cost or savings attributable to projects financed by such \n     contracts and to record that amount as an upfront change in \n     spending subject to appropriation. Under that rule, CBO \n     estimates that S. 2012 would increase direct spending by $29 \n     million over the 2016-2025 period.\n       Enacting S. 2012 could affect revenues, but CBO estimates \n     any such effects would be insignificant in any year. Because \n     the bill would affect direct spending and revenues, pay-as-\n     you-go procedures apply.\n       CBO estimates that enacting S. 2012 would not increase net \n     direct spending or on-budget deficits by more than $5 billion \n     in any of the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in \n     2026.\n       S. 2012 would impose an intergovernmental and private-\n     sector mandate, as defined in the\n\n[[Page S8237]]\n\n     Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA), on public and private \n     entities regulated by FERC, such as electric utilities, by \n     requiring them to pay fees in some circumstances. The bill \n     would impose two additional mandates on public entities. One \n     would require state and tribal governments to certify to DOE \n     whether or not they have updated residential and commercial \n     building codes to meet the latest standards developed by \n     building efficiency organizations. The other would preempt \n     state and local environmental and liability laws if they \n     conflict with emergency orders issued by the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission (FERC). The bill also would impose \n     private-sector mandates on electric transmission \n     organizations and traders of oil contracts and on individuals \n     seeking compensation for damages caused by utilities \n     operating under certain emergency orders. Based on \n     information from DOE and analyses of similar requirements, \n     CBO estimates that the aggregate cost of complying with \n     mandates in the bill would fall below the annual thresholds \n     established in UMRA for intergovernmental and private-sector \n     mandates ($77 million and $154 million in 2015, respectively, \n     adjusted annually for inflation).\n       CBO has not reviewed some provisions of section 2001 and \n     section 4303 for intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates. Those provisions would provide the Secretary of \n     Energy with emergency authority to protect the electric \n     transmission grid from cybersecurity threats and would \n     protect entities subject to that authority from liability. \n     Section 4 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act excludes from \n     the application of that act any legislative provisions that \n     are necessary for national security. CBO has determined that \n     those provisions fall within that exclusion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8237-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016 OBJECTION\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this afternoon the House of Representatives \npassed a new version of the Intelligence authorization bill for fiscal \nyear 2016. I am concerned that section 305 of this bill would undermine \nindependent oversight of U.S. intelligence agencies, and if this \nlanguage remains in the bill, I will oppose any request to pass it by \nunanimous consent.\n  Section 305 would limit the authority of the watchdog body known as \nthe Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. In my judgment, \ncurtailing the authority of an independent oversight body like this \nboard would be a clearly unwise decision. Most Americans whom I talk to \nwant intelligence agencies to work to protect them from foreign \nthreats, and they also want those agencies to be subject to strong, \nindependent oversight, and this provision would undermine some of that \noversight.\n  Section 305 states that the Privacy and Civil Liberties Board shall \nnot have the authority to investigate any covert action program. This \nis problematic for two reasons. First, while this board's oversight \nactivities to date have not focused on covert action, it is reasonably \neasy to envision a covert action program that could have a significant \nimpact on Americans' privacy and civil liberties--for example, if it \nincluded a significant surveillance component.\n  An even bigger concern is that the CIA, in particular, could attempt \nto take advantage of this language and could refuse to cooperate with \ninvestigations of its surveillance activities by arguing that those \nactivities were somehow connected to a covert action program. I \nrecognize that this may not be the intent of this provision, but in my \n15 years on the Intelligence Committee, I have repeatedly seen senior \nCIA officials go to striking lengths to resist external oversight of \ntheir activities. In my judgment, Congress should be making it harder, \nnot easier, for intelligence officials to stymie independent oversight.\n  For these reasons, it is my intention to object to any unanimous \nconsent request to pass this bill in its current form. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues to modify or remove this provision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8237-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8237-S8238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nmy opening remarks during the conference with the House of \nRepresentatives on S. 1177, the Every Child Achieves Act, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                    NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND CONFERENCE\n\n       Representative Kline, Representative Scott, Senator Murray, \n     ladies and gentlemen.\n       We're here for one reason today, because I sat down with \n     Patty Murray in January and she gave me some good advice and \n     I took it.\n       And the advice was--why don't we see if we can develop a \n     bipartisan beginning to this bill, because we had failed in \n     the last two congresses.\n       And as a result we ended up with a bill that passed by the \n     Senate after many amendments, 81 to 17.\n       Newsweek magazine recently reminded us what we already knew \n     very well: No Child Left Behind is a law that everybody wants \n     fixed. Governors, teachers, superintendents, parents, \n     Republicans, Democrats, students they all want to see this \n     law fixed.\n       There is a consensus about that. And, fortunately, there is \n     a consensus about how to do it.\n       And that consensus is this--Continue the law's important \n     measurements of academic progress of students but restore to \n     states, school districts, classroom teachers and parents the \n     responsibility for deciding what to do about improving \n     student achievement.\n       That's why in the Senate the bill passed 81 to 17.\n       That's is why the bill had the support of the nation's \n     governors, the Chief State School Officers, the school \n     superintendents, the National Education Association and the \n     American Federation of Teachers.\n       There were some differences between the House bill and \n     Senate bill. Fundamentally, they were based upon that same \n     consensus.\n       Both end the waivers through which the U.S. Department of \n     Education has become, in effect, a national school board for \n     more than 80,000 Schools in 42 states.\n       Both end the federal Common Core mandate.\n       Both move decisions about whether schools and teachers are \n     succeeding or failing out of Washington, D.C., and back to \n     states and communities and teachers where those decisions \n     belong because the real way to higher standards, better \n     teachers and real accountability is through states, \n     communities, and classrooms--not through Washington, D.C.\n       That's why I believe this conference will be successful, \n     that both houses will approve our conference work product and \n     I believe the president will sign the legislation into law.\n       Even though this agreement, in my opinion, is the most \n     significant step toward local control of schools in 25 years, \n     some Republicans would like to go further.\n       I am one of them.\n       But my Scholarship for Kids proposal, which would have \n     given states the option to allow federal dollars to follow \n     children to the schools their parents choose, only received \n     45 votes in the Senate. We need 60.\n       So I have decided, like a president named Reagan once \n     advised, that I'll take 80 percent of what I want and I'll \n     fight for the other 20 percent on another day.\n       Besides, if I were to vote no, I would be voting to leave \n     in place the federal Common Core mandate, the national school \n     board, the waivers in 42 states. Let me repeat: Voting no is \n     voting to leave in place the Common Core mandate, the \n     national school board, and waivers in 42 states.\n       There are a lot of people counting on us: 50 million \n     children and 3.4 million teachers and 100,000 public schools.\n       The law expired seven years ago. If it were strictly \n     applied, every school in America a failing school.\n       Teachers and children and parents have been waiting all \n     that time. If this were homework, they would give us a \n     failing grade for being tardy.\n       So I hope we will remind ourselves, and this is my \n     conclusion, that it is a great privilege to serve in the \n     United States House of Representatives and the United States \n     Senate.\n       That there is no need for us to have that privilege if all \n     we do is announce our opinions. We could do that at home, or \n     on the radio, or the newspaper or the street corner.\n       As members of the Congress, after we have our say, our job \n     is to get a result.\n       We`re not the Iraqi parliament.\n       We are members of the United States Congress, and I hope \n     that we will demonstrate that we cherish that privilege and \n     that we cherish our children by building upon this \n     consensus--fixing the law that everybody wants fixed--and \n     showing that we are capable of governing by bringing badly \n     needed certainty to federal education policy in 100,000 \n     public schools.\n       Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nmy closing remarks during the conference with the House of \nRepresentatives on S. 1177, the Every Child Achieves Act, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                    NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND CONFERENCE\n\n       The real winners today are 100,000 public schools which are \n     attended by 50 million children, where three and a half \n     million teachers work and are eager for us to bring some \n     certainty to federal education policy.\n       This is a law that everybody knows needs fixing. But also \n     in fixing this law we know that there were alligators lurking \n     in every\n\n[[Page S8238]]\n\n     corner of the pond, and the fact that we were able to both in \n     the Senate and the House navigate that pond and deal with \n     respectfully with one another--and also recognize in some \n     cases our different points of view couldn't be included--I \n     think, is a great credit to the process.\n       Governors, teachers, superintendents, Republicans and \n     Democrats, wanted us to do this, and we've done it so far. \n     There's not only consensus on the need to fix it, but we have \n     now shown today that in the House and Senate of the United \n     States, there is consensus on how to fix it. And that means \n     we'll keep the important measures of student achievement, but \n     we will restore to states, communities and classroom teachers \n     the responsibility with what to do about the results of the \n     tests.\n       This would not have happened without your leadership and \n     Rep.

She founded TAPS after the death of her husband, \nAlaska Army National Guard BG Tom Carroll, in a military plane crash on \nNovember 12, 1992.\n  TAPS is an organization that provides support to military families \nwho have lost a loved one. TAPS welcomes anyone who is grieving the \ndeath of someone who died in the military. Its families have \nexperienced loss in a variety of ways--from combat, suicide, terrorism, \nhomicide, negligence, accidents, and illness. Our survivors include \nmothers and fathers, husbands and wives, sons and daughters, brothers \nand sisters, fiances, and other relatives of those who have died.\n  Since its launch in 1994, TAPS has cared for the more than 50,000 \nsurviving family members through a national network of peer-based \nemotional support services, a 24/7 helpline available to those grieving \na loss, connections to community-based care throughout the Nation, and \ncasework assistance for families navigating all of the resources and \nbenefits available to them.\n  One of TAPS' most respected programs is its ``Good Grief Camp,'' \nwhich is offered to young people who have lost a loved one. This \nprogram pairs young survivors with Active-Duty military mentors. \nMilitary mentors help the young survivors learn how our Nation honors \nthose who have served and sacrificed and companion these children \nduring their grief journey.\n  I suspect that many of our fellow Americans had never heard of Bonnie \nCarroll or TAPS before. Unlike some of the others honored at last \nweek's ceremony--people like Barbra Streisand, Steven Spielberg, and \nJames Taylor--Bonnie is not a celebrity. She does not seek attention \nfor herself. Her laser focus is on helping military families, and she \ndoes nothing to distract herself or her organization from that mission. \nBut that doesn't make her any less a rockstar. And now America knows \nwhy.\n  Incredible as it may seem, Bonnie Carroll's road to distinction did \nnot begin with her work at TAPS. Her resume includes service to America \nas a member of the Air National Guard, the U.S. Air Force Reserve, as a \nsenior staff member in the Reagan White House Cabinet Affairs Office, \nand the VA's White House liaison in the administration of President \nGeorge W. Bush. She relocated to Baghdad to serve with the Coalition \nProvisional Authority. She has served on countless boards and \ncommissions related to military health, suicide prevention, and grief \ntherapy.\n  Bonnie reflects the very best of the Alaskan spirit, a spirit of \ncommunity and service before self. I am honored to join with the \nPresident in recognizing the extraordinary contributions of Bonnie \nCarroll, my dear friend, fellow Alaskan, and great American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8238-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ALICE WATERS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating Alice Waters, groundbreaking chef, restaurant owner, \nauthor, and activist who was recently awarded the National Humanities \nMedal by President Obama for her pioneering role in the sustainable \nfood movement.\n  As a student at the University of California, Berkeley, in the 1960s, \nAlice developed a passion for social activism. While studying abroad in \nParis one semester, she began to realize the impact food can have on \nour daily lives. Exposed to lively discussions over fresh, locally \nsourced home-cooked meals, a simple yet revolutionary idea took root, \nand in 1971 she and a group of friends opened Chez Panisse in Berkeley.\n  It was a concept that took off almost immediately: fresh, local, and \norganic food that changed with the seasons. As the restaurant's success \ngrew, Alice and her staff created a network of local farmers and \nproducers whose dedication to sustainable agriculture supplied Chez \nPanisse's fresh ingredients, helped to pioneer farm-to-table-cuisine, \nand served as a model for future generations of restaurant owners.\n  Alice's influence spread far beyond the kitchen. In 1996, she created \nthe Edible Schoolyard Project to help schools develop community \ngardens, so students can better understand the origins of their food \nand how to create fresh, local, and healthy meals. Today there are more \nthan 5,000 Edible Schoolyard Project locations worldwide, and the \neffort helped inspire First Lady Michelle Obama to plant a vegetable \ngarden on the South Lawn of the White House.\n  Alice has said that ``good food is a right, not a privilege,'' and \nher work is helping to make that a reality. She has revolutionized the \nway our country cooks, eats, and thinks about food--and we are all \nbetter because of it.\n  I am proud to congratulate my friend, Alice Waters, on this \nincredible honor and wish her many more years of continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8238-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL WOMEN'S \n                              ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing the 100th anniversary of the American Medical Women's \nAssociation, AMWA, the first national organization of women physicians.\n  One hundred years ago, less than 6 percent of all physicians in the \nUnited States were women. Recognizing a crucial need to provide support \nfor these pioneering women and to bring diversity to the medical field, \nDr. Bertha Van Hoosen founded the AMWA on November 18, 1915, in \nChicago.\n  The AMWA quickly established a network and support system for women \nin the medical profession and documented their lack of opportunities in \npostgraduate training, internships, and academic appointments.\n  Over the years, the AMWA successfully advocated to increase \nleadership roles for women doctors, sponsored research and panel \ndiscussions on medical women in the workforce, and established \nscholarship and mentorship programs to encourage the next generation of \nwomen leaders. The AMWA has also worked to improve women's health by \naddressing issues from human trafficking and affordable contraceptive \ncare, to childhood obesity and osteoporosis risk across the globe.\n  For the past century, the American Medical Women's Association has \nserved as the vision and voice of women in medicine. As we celebrate \ntheir extraordinary milestone, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating the AMWA for their tireless efforts to open the door for \ngenerations of women physicians. Because of their work, countless men, \nwomen, and children have benefited from the dedicated service of AMWA \nmembers, and for that we are all grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8238-4", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8238-S8239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        OBSERVING WORLD AIDS DAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the 28th World \nAIDS Day. This day is a time to recognize the tremendous progress we \nhave\n\n[[Page S8239]]\n\nmade in combating the human immunodeficiency virus infection and \nacquired immune deficiency syndrome, HIV/AIDS, and to redouble our \ncommitment to preventing and treating this devastating disease.\n  For many years, we have viewed AIDS as a death sentence. Before 2000, \nrates of infection grew exponentially. People living with HIV/AIDS had \nfew options, and what options they did have were expensive and out of \nreach. Millions of children orphaned by HIV/AIDS were isolated within \ntheir own communities, and there was virtually no way to prevent HIV \ntransmissions from pregnant women to their unborn children, ending \ncountless lives before they could truly begin.\n  But thanks to sustained United States and global efforts--\nadministered through programs like the President's Emergency Plan for \nAIDS Relief, PEPFAR, the Global Fund, and UNAIDS--we are finally \nturning the tide, not only in terms of slowing the spread of HIV/AIDS, \nbut also by improving the lives of those affected by this disease.\n  Since 2000, new HIV infections have dropped by 35 percent. AIDS-\nrelated deaths are down 42 percent from their peak in 2004. To date, 15 \nmillion men, women, and children worldwide are on anti-retroviral \ntherapy, compared to only 1 million in 2001. We have also made \nsignificant progress in tackling mother-to-child transmissions, which \nare key to ending the AIDS epidemic. Today 73 percent of pregnant women \nliving with HIV have access to anti-retroviral therapy, greatly \nreducing the likelihood that they will transmit the disease to their \nbabies. As a result, since 2000, new infections among children have \nfallen by 58 percent. Because of our investments in HIV/AIDS treatment \nand prevention, health systems throughout Africa have been \nstrengthened, allowing millions to gain access to medications and more \nadvanced treatments. Life expectancy in nations like Rwanda and Kenya \nhave dramatically increased, and health facilities have been \nmodernized.\n  These steps are just some of the ways in which we have made \nremarkable progress to stop HIV/AIDS in its tracks. We are, without a \ndoubt, on our way to an AIDS-free generation. This is something that \ncan happen in our lifetimes.\n  In mid-September, more than 150 world leaders gathered at the United \nNations General Assembly to adopt the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \nDevelopment. Goal 3 includes a target to eradicate HIV/AIDS, \ntuberculosis, malaria, and other communicable diseases by 2030. This is \na bold commitment that requires strong leadership from the United \nStates. To achieve this goal, the United States must continue to invest \nin and provide strong funding for our global health programs, \nespecially PEPFAR.\n  As my colleagues know, PEPFAR is the largest commitment by any nation \nto combat a single disease internationally and represents the very best \nof America and our commitment to global humanitarian values. Thanks to \nPEPFAR, 7.7 million men, women, and children worldwide are receiving \nanti-retroviral treatments. In 2014, PEPFAR supported HIV testing and \ncounseling for more than 56.7 million people and provided training for \nmore than 140,000 new health care workers to help combat HIV on the \nground. Through PEPFAR, we have been able to reach 5 million children \nwho have been orphaned or made vulnerable due to HIV/AIDS. PEPFAR has \nalso dramatically improved outcomes for pregnant women and their \nbabies, reducing the transmission of HIV from mother to child. In 2014, \nPEPFAR supported HIV testing and counseling for more than 14.2 million \npregnant women worldwide. For the nearly 750,000 pregnant women who \ntested positive for HIV, PEPFAR's anti-retroviral medications allowed \n95 percent of their children to be born HIV-free.\n  We have made extraordinary progress; however, there is still much \nwork to be done. Currently, there are more than 22 million people \nliving with HIV who are not yet on treatment, and HIV is still the \nleading cause of death for women of reproductive age worldwide. We are \non our way to an AIDS-free generation, but we can't rest on our laurels \nnow. We need the commitment and leadership of partner countries--\nreinforced with support from donor nations, civil society, people \nliving with HIV, faith-based organizations, the private sector, and \nfoundations--to make an AIDS-free generation a reality. On this World \nAIDS Day, we recognize the progress we have made and recommit ourselves \nto continuing to combat HIV/AIDS both at home and abroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8239-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     HONORING MILTON PITTS CRENCHAW\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I wish to honor today Milton Pitts \nCrenchaw, an aviation pioneer from Little Rock, AR, who paved the way \nfor integration in the U.S. military and impacted generations of \naviators.\n  Crenchaw, known as the father of black aviation in Arkansas, \ndeveloped a love of flying while at the Tuskegee Institute. He exceled \nin the program, and after earning his pilot's license, he pursued his \ninstructor's certificate. Following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, \nCrenchaw joined the Army Air Corps Civilian Pilot Training Program as a \nflight instructor.\n  He had the distinction of being one of the original supervising \nsquadron commanders for the Tuskegee Airmen. He trained hundreds of \ncadets during the 1940s, an accomplishment he was rightfully proud of.\n  ``The first thing that he takes pride in is that he and the other \nBlack flight instructors paved the way for people of color to enter the \nfield of aviation. He is proud that he was chosen to implement that \nprogram,'' his daughter Dolores Crenchaw Singleton said in a recent \ninterview.\n  Crenchaw helped break the barriers that existed in the military. His \npassion for aviation continued after his tenure at Tuskegee, serving as \na flight instructor at several air bases, including Camp Rucker, AL, \nwhere he became the first Black flight instructor.\n  Crenchaw honorably served with the U.S. Army Air Corps and the U.S. \nAir Force for more than 40 years.\n  He also shared his love of aviation with Arkansas, and he was \ninstrumental in creating an aviation program at Philander Smith College \nin Little Rock. Crenchaw taught aviation at the school from 1947 to \n1953, holding classes at Adams Field in the Central Flying Service \nbuilding.\n  Along with the accolades of inductions in the Arkansas Aviation Hall \nof Fame and the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame, in 2007 he was awarded the \nCongressional Gold Medal, along with other members we have come to \nadmire as the Tuskegee Airmen.\n  Milton Pitts Crenchaw passed away on November 17, 2015. Today he will \nbe laid to rest at the Arkansas State Veterans Cemetery in North Little \nRock. He was a true American hero whose leadership helped secure \nvictory and peace for all freedom-loving people of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8239-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8239-S8240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING THE CHILDREN'S MUSEUM OF ATLANTA\n\n Mr. ISAKSON.

He graduated from \nTuscaloosa Central High School in 2004, and he attended Shelton State \nCommunity College. From there, he focused on forging a career in \nboxing.\n  Mr. Wilder began his boxing career in 2005, and he has achieved \noutstanding success as both an amateur and professional boxer. In 2007, \nWilder upset the favorites to win the National Golden Gloves and the \nU.S. championships. Wilder was awarded the bronze medal in boxing at \nthe 2008 Olympics. In 2012, he won the WBC Continental Americas \nheavyweight boxing title.\n  In January of this year, Wilder became the first American heavyweight \nchampion in 9 years after his win over Bermane Stiverne. Since then, \nWilder has successfully defended his WBC title twice, most recently in \nSeptember.\n  Deontay Wilder has made a proactive effort to give back to the State \nof Alabama by hosting his first two title defenses in Birmingham, AL. \nHe has also been a champion of charitable causes such as the fight \nagainst spina bifida.\n  Mr. Wilder is an incredible athlete and an inspiration to many.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor James Joseph \nMarshall, a third generation Montanan and a veteran of World War II.\n  On behalf of all Montanans and Americans, I stand to say thank you to \nJim's family for his service to our Nation.\n  It is my honor to share the story of Jim's life and service, a story \nthat most certainly will not be forgotten, and a story he perhaps \nwouldn't have told himself.\n  In fact, it wasn't until his oldest daughter, Vicki, was in eighth \ngrade that she even noticed her father's limp. She asked her mother, \n``Why does daddy limp?''\n  Ruth told her that he limped because of his war wound. He never \ntalked about his experience during the war, and it wasn't until he \nwrote about his injury for a presentation to middle schoolers that his \nfamily heard the full story.\n  Jim was shot in the leg while fighting in the Ruhr Pocket, in \nGermany, near the border of Czechoslovakia on April 25, 1945.\n  After sweeping the countryside searching for any remaining \nresistance, his platoon butted up against German troops on a \nmountainside. It wasn't long until the platoon was pinned down by the \nautomatic weapon fire.\n  The platoon made a dash for cover but to no avail. Every man was hit. \nJim described the shot to his leg like being hit by a sledgehammer.\n  German troops came to confirm they were all dead and to gather any \nrifles and ammo. Jim, with his orders shoved underneath him and the \nsole survivor, played dead. They passed on.\n  Not long after, German medics came through.\n  Surprisingly, a young German, whom Jim identified by the swastika on \nhis arm, put a compress on his leg and a jacket over top of him before \nmoving on.\n  Shortly after, an American Jeep rolled up and rescued him.\n  Jim always said he never would have made it out alive had that young \nGerman not stopped to show him some compassion.\n  Once home from the war in 1946, Jim enrolled at Montana State \nUniversity at Bozeman.\n  It was there that he met his future wife Ruth Officer, a nurse who \ntended to some residual issues with Jim's hip. They married on March \n15, 1947.\n  Jim was always a man who took care of his family, and that devotion \ntook them to Livingston, Ruth's hometown. There, he began work as a \ncarpenter's apprentice, eventually becoming a journeyman.\n  After returning to MSU to get his industrial art degree, he began \nteaching shop at Emerson Junior High in Bozeman. Eventually, he became \na purchasing agent for Missoula School District No. 1.\n  Jim and Ruth had three children: Vicki, Leann, and Jim. They remember \nhim as a humble man who cared deeply for his family and frequently \ndemonstrated that devotion.\n  The fondness with which Jim is remembered is reflective of the life \nhe lived. Folks will remember his willingness to help out a friend and \nhis love of photography, especially bald eagles. He was passionate \nabout making Montana better for future generations.\n  In September of 2012, Jim had the pleasure of participating in one of \nthe earliest Honor Flights to Washington, DC, to see the World War II \nMemorial there.\n  His daughter, Leann, helped him register himself as a World War II \nveteran at the memorial, and his name will remain in the kiosks there \nfor anyone to see.\n  In fact, I had the honor of greeting that particular Honor Flight \nback to Montana afterward and am happy to hear that Jim immensely \nenjoyed that experience.\n  Jim died on April 8, 2014, surrounded by family.\n  It was my honor to recognize James Joseph Marshall's bravery and \nservice to the United States by presenting his family with the Bronze \nStar Medal for meritorious achievement based on his prior award of the \ncombat infantryman badge and the Army of Occupation Medal with Germany \nClasp.\n  Our Nation is forever grateful for Jim's service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8240-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:09 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 611.

A bill to improve homeland security by enhancing the \nrequirements for participation in the Visa Waiver Program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Visa Waiver \nProgram Security Enhancement Act.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senator Flake, who is the lead \nRepublican cosponsor, as well as Senators Heitkamp, Coats, Heinrich, \nJohnson, Bennet, Ayotte, Warner, Baldwin, Tester, King, Klobuchar, \nBoxer, and Blumenthal.\n  This bill would improve the security of the Visa Waiver Program, \nwhich is used by about 20 million travelers a year.\n  The horrific attacks in Paris and the emergence of ISIL make it \nabsolutely clear that we must strengthen the Visa Waiver Program to \nprotect our country. This bill would do just that.\n  38 countries are now part of the Visa Waiver Program.\n  Nationals from these countries may come to the United States for up \nto 90 days without a visa.\n  Travelers through the program use an online application to gain \napproval to travel to the United States. Many of these travelers simply \napply for approval from their home computer.\n  Participating countries must also enter into valuable intelligence-\nsharing agreements with the United States.\n  By comparison, only about 36 million people secured visas for \nbusiness, tourism, and other temporary purposes to the United States \nfrom 2005 to 2010--an average of only 6 million per year.\n  As we all know, fewer than 2,000 refugees from the Syrian conflict--\nwhich go through a heavy vetting process--were admitted to the United \nStates over the last 4 years.\n  Put that in perspective: fewer than 2,000 Syrian refugees over 4 \nyears, versus 20 million travelers through the Visa Waiver program \nannually.\n\n[[Page S8243]]\n\n  The vetting for a refugee takes 18 to 24 months, whereas an \napplication to travel through the Visa Waiver Program can be approved \nwithin seconds.\n  That should tell us how much of a priority improving the security of \nthis program is.\n  Today, there are thousands of citizens from European visa waiver \ncountries that have gone to fight in Syria.\n  In fact, the Visa Waiver Program includes numerous countries that \nhave populations in which some people have become radicalized.\n  The program includes 38 countries, including the following: Belgium, \nFrance, Germany, Greece, Hungary, The Netherlands, and The United \nKingdom.\n  So, nationals of these countries who travel to Iraq or Syria to train \nand fight may then be able to cross back into Europe and then come to \nthis country on a visa waiver.\n  As is now clear, some who committed the recent attacks in Paris were \nFrench and Belgian nationals.\n  The attackers in the Charlie Hebdo attacks--the Kouachi brothers--\nwere born and raised in France. They were French nationals as well.\n  The European Union Justice Commissioner said in April of this year \nthat 5,000-6,000 Europeans could be fighting in Syria.\n  More than 1,500 are French nationals.\n  This is why the Visa Waiver Program, at the current time, poses a \nmajor risk--it is a quick and direct route for a terrorist to come to \nthe United States without a visa.\n  The group known as ISIL has publicly threatened to attack the United \nStates and we have every reason to believe they will exploit every \nopportunity to do so.\n  So we must take strong action.\n  A major concern is also the problem with lost and stolen passports, \nwhich could be used by dangerous individuals to gain entry to the \nUnited States on the Visa Waiver Program without raising red flags.\n  According to INTERPOL, nearly 45 million passports have been reported \nlost or stolen within the past 10 years.\n  Let me repeat that: 45 million lost or stolen passports circulating \nworldwide.\n  Passports typically are valid for five to 10 years, which means many \nof these lost or stolen passports have not yet expired.\n  If a blank passport is stolen, it may have no expiration date at all.\n  A foreign fighter could use one of the millions of unexpired lost and \nstolen passports to travel to the United States through the Visa Waiver \nProgram in order to do us harm.\n  Today, the first face-to-face interaction and biometric check that a \nfirst-time Visa Waiver Program traveler would have with any U.S. \nofficial is when the person reaches the port of entry, like a United \nStates airport.\n  That provides only a narrow window to detect that the individual is a \nperson who is intent on committing an attack.\n  This Visa Waiver Program Security Enhancement Act would strengthen \nthe Visa Waiver Program in a variety of ways, making our nation safer \nand protecting an important stream of international tourism and \ncommerce.\n  First, the bill says that a national of a Visa Waiver country who has \ntraveled to Iraq or Syria in the last five years would have to get a \nvisa instead of using the Visa Waiver Program.\n  The effect of this would be that the person would have to go through \nthe normal consular process--in which biometric information would be \ntaken, and the person interviewed--instead of traveling to the United \nStates on a visa waiver.\n  Second, the bill would require that biometric data, such as digital \nphotographs or fingerprints, be provided to the U.S. government prior \nto boarding a plane to travel to the U.S. on the Visa Waiver Program \nbut only for those individuals for whom we do not already have \nbiometrics.\n  Today, biometrics are not taken until a traveler from a Visa Waiver \ncountry first enters the United States at the port of entry.\n  That is too late, and it leaves the opportunity for a person seeking \nto commit an attack against the aircraft itself to do so.\n  We have recently seen that ISIL is willing to take down airliners. We \nknow what sort of tragedy can happen when terrorists take control of an \nairplane.\n  We must do everything we can to make sure an ISIL member does not \nboard an aircraft bound for the United States with the intent to take \nit down.\n  This bill would make the biometric requirement effective within one \nyear, prioritizing areas of danger, and would enable the Department of \nHomeland Security to extend the roll-out on a country-specific basis.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has already announced its intent \nto expand Customs and Border Protection preclearance to new foreign \nairports, including in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United \nKingdom--all Visa Waiver countries.\n  As the bill is currently written, those foreign nationals who travel \nthrough the preclearance process would satisfy the biometric \nrequirements of the bill.\n  The simple fact is that we need to develop a way to screen and verify \nindividuals biometrically before they get on a plane to the U.S., and \nthis bill would do that.\n  Third, the bill would eliminate the use of older-generation passports \nby any citizen of Visa Waiver Countries.\n  Within 90 days of enactment, all Visa Waiver travelers would be \nrequired to have a valid, unexpired, machine-readable passport that is \ntamper-resistant and incorporates biometric identifiers.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has announced that it will roll \nthis out administratively, but this provision would make it a clear \nstatutory requirement.\n  Fourth, the bill would strengthen the intelligence sharing that is \nthe bedrock of this program.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has been able to gather valuable \ndata from Visa Waiver countries under existing information sharing \nagreements.\n  There are three such agreements. One relates to information regarding \nknown or suspected terrorists. The second relates to sharing of \nfingerprint data pertaining to serious crimes. And the third requires \nprovision of lost or stolen passport information directly or via \nINTERPOL.\n  It is my understanding that--although countries have signed these \nagreements--not all have fully implemented them. This bill would \nrequire that those agreements be implemented, not just signed.\n  The bill would also establish several new information-sharing \nprovisions, which the Department of Homeland Security would be required \nto examine in assessing whether a country can join or stay in the Visa \nWaiver Program.\n  One such provision would require DHS to consider whether a country \ncontributes to and screens against INTERPOL's lost and stolen documents \ndatabase.\n  Let me explain why this is important. Simply put, INTERPOL's lost and \nstolen documents database is not as frequently used as it could be.\n  Increased use of INTERPOL's database could assist all nations, \nincluding those outside the Visa Waiver Program, to prevent travel \nusing lost or stolen passports and thus to inhibit the international \nmovement of foreign fighters.\n  This bill would also require DHS to consider whether a country \ncollects and shares biometric information of refugee and asylum \nseekers--an important provision to help the United States ensure bad \nactors are prevented from traveling to the United States.\n  It would also require DHS to consider whether a country shares \nintelligence about foreign fighters with the United States, as well as \nwith international organizations like INTERPOL.\n  Lastly, the bill would require that countries participating in the \nVisa Waiver Program have Federal Air Marshal agreements in place.\n  The Paris attacks demonstrate beyond any doubt that the Visa Waiver \nProgram creates a security risk for our country.\n  The Visa Waiver Program Security Enhancement Act will address \nvulnerabilities in the Visa Waiver Program, improve information \nsharing, and help keep our country safe.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n[[Page S8244]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8244-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 323--SUPPORTING THE DESIGNATION OF DECEMBER 1, 2015, \n AS ``#GIVINGTUESDAY'' AND SUPPORTING STRONG INCENTIVES FOR ALL PEOPLE \n                OF THE UNITED STATES TO GIVE GENEROUSLY\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Thune, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Roberts) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Finance:\n\n                              S. Res. 323\n\n       Whereas the Tuesday after Thanksgiving begins the holiday \n     giving season with a global day dedicated to charitable \n     giving, known as ``#GivingTuesday'';\n       Whereas December 1, 2015, is the fourth annual \n     #GivingTuesday;\n       Whereas since the inception of #GivingTuesday in 2012, \n     #GivingTuesday has become a worldwide movement that \n     celebrates the power of giving in all forms;\n       Whereas in 2012, #GivingTuesday brought together more than \n     2,500 organizations in all 50 States and continues to gain \n     momentum with more than 35,000 partners in the United States \n     and around the world;\n       Whereas online donations have increased 470 percent since \n     the Tuesday after Thanksgiving in 2011;\n       Whereas #GivingTuesday, along with other community giving \n     days, highlights the charitable community in the United \n     States, which comprises approximately 1,500,000 nonprofit \n     organizations, philanthropic organizations, and religious \n     congregations that are dedicated to improving lives and \n     strengthening communities;\n       Whereas nonprofit organizations are key partners with \n     Federal, State, and local governments in the delivery of key \n     programs and services, including--\n       (1) child learning and nutrition;\n       (2) emergency disaster response;\n       (3) services for victims; and\n       (4) job training and placement programs;\n       Whereas communities are lifted up by the exposure of all \n     community members to the cultural, educational, and civic \n     opportunities provided by nonprofit organizations;\n       Whereas the values of volunteerism and generosity toward \n     the common good has led to over 60 percent of people in the \n     United States, including 84 percent of millennials, making \n     financial contributions to support the work of nonprofit \n     organizations;\n       Whereas virtually every person in the United States \n     benefits from the work of the charitable community, which--\n       (1) employs over 13,700,000 workers, or 10 percent of the \n     workforce of the United States; and\n       (2) engages an additional 63,000,000 volunteers;\n       Whereas in 2014, individuals, foundations, and businesses \n     gave over $335,000,000,000 to support charitable causes and \n     it has been estimated that, with no deduction for charitable \n     gifts, annual individual giving would drop by 25 to 36 \n     percent;\n       Whereas other effective charitable giving incentives in the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 relating to individual \n     retirement account contributions, food donations, and \n     conservation easement donations expired on January 1, 2015, \n     the fifth time in recent years;\n       Whereas the United States is a great country with a strong \n     philanthropic tradition that should be continued and carried \n     on; and\n       Whereas all political parties can agree on charitable \n     giving, which transcends differences of ideology and unites \n     people across boundaries: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that the United States needs a strong and \n     vibrant charitable and philanthropic sector to enable \n     communities to meet local needs;\n       (2) supports the designation of December 1, 2015, as \n     ``#GivingTuesday''--\n       (A) to encourage charitable giving;\n       (B) to effect positive change; and\n       (C) to promote causes dedicated to progress, prosperity, \n     and a better world; and\n       (3) supports strong incentives for all people of the United \n     States to give generously to charitable organizations by--\n       (A) protecting the existing charitable donation tax \n     deduction; and\n       (B) continuing incentives that encourage philanthropy, \n     volunteering, and innovation.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I am pleased to support S. Res. 323, a \nresolution I submitted today along with Senator Schumer, Senator \nStabenow, and Senator Roberts, which expresses the sense of the Senate \nthat Congress should recognize the benefits of charitable giving and \nexpress support for the designation of today, December 1, 2015, as \n#GivingTuesday.\n  Celebrated annually since 2012 on the Tuesday after Black Friday and \nCyber Monday, #GivingTuesday kicks off the holiday giving season with a \nglobal day dedicated to charitable giving through a social movement \nthat encourages giving in all its forms by people and communities \nacross the country.\n  From the first year of #GivingTuesday, when more than 2,500 \norganizations from all 50 States came together to celebrate giving, to \ntoday, when more than 35,000 partners in the United States and around \nthe world will participate, this movement has provided an annual \nopportunity for the country to come together to honor the long American \nhistory of giving back and working together.\n  I would also like to recognize #GivingTuesday for its power to enact \npositive change and promote causes that further progress and prosperity \nfor a better world, while also enabling local communities to meet \nspecific needs.\n  In my State of South Dakota, for example, many local organizations \nhave already endorsed #GivingTuesday. Feeding South Dakota, located in \nPierre, Rapid City, and Sioux Falls, is participating through numerous \nfood programs and fundraisers with the ultimate goal of eliminating \nhunger entirely in my state. Likewise, the United Way & Volunteer \nServices of Greater Yankton is participating through a book drive that \nbenefits local children as part of the Big Red Bookshelf program, and \nthrough financial support that will be used for the Connecting Kids \nYouth Scholarship program.\n  The success of #GivingTuesday further highlights the work of the \nAmerican charitable community, which boasts 1.5 million nonprofits, \nphilanthropic organizations, and religious congregations dedicated to \nimproving lives and strengthening communities. These charitable \norganizations employ 13.7 million workers, or nearly 10 percent of the \nU.S. workforce, with an additional 63 million people engaged in \nvolunteer work.\n  In all, more than 60 percent of Americans, including 84 percent of \nmillennials, make financial contributions to support the work of \nnonprofit organizations.\n  As we just gave thanks last week surrounded by friends and family, it \nis abundantly clear that we have much to be thankful for. I hope that \nmy colleagues will join me to continue that spirit of giving and \nsharing, and support #GivingTuesday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/01/senate-section/article/S8244-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8244-S8245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 26--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS \n    REGARDING THE RIGHT OF STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO MAINTAIN \n                    ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN\n\n  Mr. KIRK (for himself, Mr. Manchin, and Mr. Rubio) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 26\n\n       Whereas Iran is a major threat to the national security of \n     the United States and its allies;\n       Whereas Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of \n     terrorism and continues to materially support Hezbollah, \n     Hamas, and the regime of Bashar al-Assad;\n       Whereas Iran is responsible for severe violations of the \n     human rights of the people of Iran, including imprisonment, \n     harassment, and torture against dissidents and those critical \n     of the Iranian regime such as human rights defenders, \n     lawyers, activists, and ethnic minorities;\n       Whereas the United States has led the international \n     community in imposing crippling economic sanctions against \n     Iran for sponsoring terrorism and its human rights \n     violations;\n       Whereas section 202 of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, \n     Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-\n     195;
