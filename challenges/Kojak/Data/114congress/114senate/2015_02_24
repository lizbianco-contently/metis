Mr. President, I want to take 60 seconds before the two \nleaders speak to welcome a North Carolinian, Randy Cash, who was \nappointed the national chaplain of the American Legion on August 28, \n2014, at their annual convention in Charlotte, which I attended, as \nwell as the President.\n  Randy is a native of North Carolina. He spent part of his life in \nMyrtle Beach, SC, but he attended a number of schools throughout the \nregion. He was commissioned as a Navy chaplain in 1980 and he entered \nActive Service in 1983. He was assigned to Destroyer Squadron Six out \nof Charleston, SC. His next tour was staff chaplain, Naval Education \nand Training Center in Newport, RI, and his life continued from spot to \nspot.\n  Randy has served as chaplain during Desert Shield, Desert Storm, \nwhile he was stationed at Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach. \nHe also had a turn at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, which we all talk about \ntoday, and was transferred to the 2nd Marine Division at Camp Lejeune, \nNC, where he served as regimental chaplain.\n  Let me say this is a decorated chaplain. Randy Cash retired from \nActive Duty in 2009. His military awards and decorations include the \nLegion of Merit, two awards, and the Bronze Star. He is a man of \nconviction, he is a tremendous North Carolinian, and over the next year \nhe will serve as the national chaplain of the American Legion in a most \neffective way.\n  Reverend Cash, we are delighted to have you here.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/24/senate-section/article/S1037-5", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.R. 240.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 5, H.R. 240, a bill \n     making appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security \n     for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n\n                             Keystone Bill\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Congress is sending the President \nof the United States another piece of bipartisan legislation today. \nAmericans of both parties are calling on him to sign it. There is no \ngood reason not to. The Keystone jobs bill is just common sense. \nConstruction of this important infrastructure project would support \nthousands of American jobs. It would pump billions into our economy and \nthe President's own State Department\n\n[[Page S1038]]\n\ntold us this could be achieved with minimal--minimal--environmental \nimpact. That is why this jobs and infrastructure bill passed both \nHouses of Congress with bipartisan support.\n  I know powerful special interests and political extremists are \npressuring the President to veto American jobs. I hope President Obama \nwill join with us in standing for the middle class instead. It is hard \nto even imagine what a serious justification for a veto might be. \nExcuses related to the review process obviously won't work, since this \nbipartisan bill is a solution for fixing a review the Obama \nadministration broke as it ignored deadlines and interfered for \npolitical reasons. Plus, the President has called on Congress to send \nhim infrastructure projects, and Keystone is an important \ninfrastructure project that is shovel ready.\n  Americans are urging President Obama to finally heed scientific \nconclusions his own State Department already reached. There is no \nreason for the President to ignore that science any longer. Republicans \nand Democrats, labor unions and businesses--we are all calling on him \nto finally allow American workers to build an infrastructure project \nthat just makes good sense.\n  Mr. President, last night I took action to allow the Senate to \nconsider commonsense legislation that every Democrat should want to \nsupport. This targeted measure would address the President's most \nrecent overreach from November.\n  The bill isn't tied to DHS funding. There is no excuse for our \nfriends on the other side to oppose it. That is especially true of the \nDemocrats who led their constituents to believe they would stand up for \ndemocratic principles in this debate. These colleagues have hidden \nbehind all manner of excuses to avoid upsetting the far left. Well, \nthis bill removes the excuses and it sets up a simple political \nequation: Either stand in defense of extreme overreach or stand with \nconstituents in support of shared democratic values.\n  As I have said already, my preference remains with the legislation \nthat has already passed the House. It is still the simplest way \nforward. But as long as Democrats continue to prevent us from even \ndebating that bill, I am ready to try another way. I hope our friends \nacross the aisle will demonstrate similar flexibility.\n  I am calling on Senators of good faith to work with us and move the \nbill forward as quickly as possible. So let's get to work.\n\n\n                   Recognition Of The Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I do appreciate--and that is an \nunderstatement--what the majority leader has to go through to try to \nplease the extreme voices on his side. The fact remains we are 4 very \nshort days away from a Homeland Security shutdown--a shutdown, Mr. \nPresident. We have a couple of bills on the floor that, unless there is \nunanimous consent, we can't get to in 4 days. Funding expires on \nFriday, yet last night the majority leader moved to bring a bill to the \nfloor that does absolutely nothing to fund Homeland Security--nothing.\n  If the majority leader wanted a vote on this bill, he shouldn't have \nwasted a month repeating the same failed procedural vote four times \nwith the same result. Albert Einstein said that is the definition of \ninsanity, when you keep doing the same thing over and over again, \ngetting the same result.\n  We have said all along that we are more than happy to have an \nimmigration debate once Homeland Security is funded. Nevada so badly \nneeds full funding of Homeland Security. State and local governments \ndemand full funding of Homeland Security. It is not only for Nevada, it \nis all across the country, because the homeland cannot be protected the \nway the law is now set up unless the Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security has the ability to grant. If there is full funding, \nit would be almost $2 billion worth of programs to allow the homeland \nto be protected by State and local governments.\n  So we are happy to have a debate on immigration, but we have to fully \nfund Homeland Security. We have said that all along. We have said it \nnot once, not twice, but we have said it many different times.\n  In fact, there was a proposal brought to the Senate floor 3 weeks \nago, sponsored by Senators Mikulski and Shaheen, only to have the \nRepublicans object to that.\n  We want a debate on immigration. We are happy to have a debate on \nimmigration. We are eager to debate immigration now or any other time, \nbut we can't do that until we fully fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. We have been saying that for 4 weeks and nothing has changed \nin the last 24 hours.\n  The majority leader should allow a vote on the Mikulski-Shaheen \nfunding, which is sitting on the floor right now. It is on the \ncalendar. That is the only way to resolve this mess which the \nRepublicans created. The only thing that can pass the Senate is a clean \nbill to fund Homeland Security. And then, once that is done, there is a \nconsent pending here on the Senate floor that says once that is done \nand the President signs that, we will be happy to debate immigration \nfor whatever time the Republicans deem necessary.\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n\n                       Reservation Of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, by calculation, we have today and 3 more \ndays before the Department of Homeland Security is shut down.\n  Think about what happened this last weekend all across America. It \nwas disclosed publicly that an extremist group, a terrorist group--Al-\nShabab--had some communication among their membership targeting malls \nin America for extremism and terrorism. God forbid that ever happens.\n  I know those who are managing these malls look at the terrible \nsituation that occurred in Africa and want to make certain it is never \nrepeated anywhere, let alone in the United States. They are making \nextraordinary efforts to protect people across America, not only as \nthey are shopping in malls but in other places, as they should.\n  What is the lead agency to protect America against terrorism? What is \nthe lead agency to make sure we never ever again in our history \nexperience 9/11? The Department of Homeland Security. That Department \nwas created after 9/11, because we felt the way we were protecting \nAmerica wasn't good enough. We took 22 different Federal agencies and \nput them under the roof of the Department of Homeland Security and said \nto that Department: Now focus; focus all your time and efforts to keep \nus safe. They have done a good job. I am sure they have made some \nmistakes along the way, but they have really dedicated themselves--all \nthe men and women who work there--to keeping America safe.\n  Now what has Congress done for the Department of Homeland Security? \nLast December, when we considered the appropriations--the budget--for \nthe Department of Homeland Security, the Republicans insisted we take \nthat Department out of the regular budget process and give it only \ntemporary funding, a continuing resolution--temporary funding--which \nlimits the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security to do his \nbest job to keep America safe. Why would the Republicans pick this \nappropriation, the single appropriation to keep America safe from \nterrorism and decide they don't want to properly fund it? They are only \ngiving it temporary funding and a continuing resolution because they \ndisagree with President Obama's position on immigration. That is it.\n\n  They want this issue of immigration, separate and apart from the \nbudget of the Homeland Security, to be debated, and they insist they \nwill not fund the Department of Homeland Security until it is debated. \nSo come February\n\n[[Page S1039]]\n\n27, in just a few days, this Department of Homeland Security is going \nto shut down. It is going to shut down.\n  Many of the employees are essential. They will be asked to come to \nwork even though there is only a promise of a paycheck, and they will \nshow up because they are loyal to this country and they want to do \ntheir job to keep it safe. Why won't the Senate and the House do its \njob?\n  Why can't we pass a clean appropriations bill for the Department of \nHomeland Security? Before we took a break last week for President's \nweek I made a unanimous consent request on the floor to do just that--\npass a clean appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. The majority leader, Senator McConnell of Kentucky, objected. \nHe objected to funding the Department of Homeland Security. I don't \nunderstand it. It doesn't make sense for us to put in jeopardy the \nsecurity of America over a political debate on immigration.\n  What is ironic is that now that the Republicans have the majority \ncontrol of the House and the Senate they can call any bill they wish. \nAfter funding the Department of Homeland Security, they can turn \nimmediately to a debate on immigration. It is their right. They pick \nthe topics, they dictate the calendar, and those of us in the minority \nhave to accede to their wishes. They are in the majority. They are \ncontrolling, but still Speaker Boehner and Senator McConnell, the \nRepublican majority leader, refuse to pass a clean appropriations bill \nto the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Luckily some Republicans are stepping up and saying this is wrong. I \ncommend the following Senators on the Republican side who have publicly \nstated that Congress should pass a clean Homeland Security bill and \nstop this tactic that came from the House of Representatives. Those \nSenators include: Senator Dean Heller of Nevada, Senator Mark Kirk of \nIllinois, Senators Jeff Flake and John McCain of Arizona, Senator \nLindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. \nWe need eight more Republican Senators to come forward and say we need \na clean appropriations bill and we need to pass it now. If eight \nRepublican Senators today will say that, then we can move forward and \npass this bill. We can fund this Department and stop this gamesmanship. \nThen, if the leaders want to move to a debate on immigration, so be it. \nBut let's have eight more Republicans step forward and join us to make \nthis a reality.\n  I don't understand, frankly, the thinking of many of the Republicans \nwho oppose the President's approach to immigration. Here is what it \ncomes down to. If the President used every penny given to him by \nCongress to deport those who are undocumented in the United States, he \ncould reach about 4 percent of those who are eligible for deportation--\n4 percent. What the President has said is: Let me focus then on \ndeporting those who are most dangerous to the United States.\n  President Obama has said there are people who have been here for \nyears. They are part of our communities. They have good jobs. They have \nraised families. They go to our churches. We see them every day. They \nare no threat to us. Let's focus on deporting those who are dangerous--\nthe felons, the criminals. The President has basically said we \nshouldn't set out to deport families, we ought to deport felons. We \nshouldn't set out to deport children, we ought to deport criminals. So \nhis priority is deportation of those most dangerous to the United \nStates, and the Republicans have opposed that. Why? Primarily because \nthe President supports it. It has reached that point in the debate. It \nis so divisive.\n  The President doesn't want to waste any resources in deporting those \nwho are not dangerous. He wants to get those who are dangerous out of \nthe United States first, and Republicans object to that.\n  There is something else they want to do too. The House of \nRepresentatives wants to challenge the President's right to Executive \norders when it comes to prioritizing those who can stay in the United \nStates.\n  Several years ago at the request of 20 or more Senators, the \nPresident initiated an Executive action known as DACA. This Executive \naction said that if someone qualified as a DREAMer, they would be \nallowed to stay without threat of deportation. We estimate that 2 \nmillion young people in America would qualify as DREAMers, and 600,000 \nhave this protection now. What the Republicans want to do in the House \nof Representatives is to eliminate this.\n  Who are these young people? They are young folks in America brought \nto this country as toddlers and infants, young boys and girls who grew \nup in this country, went to school in this country, have no problems in \ntheir criminal record and want to be part of America. That is it.\n  What the Republicans have said in the House is we want to deport \nthese people--deport them because they are here undocumented, despite \nthe fact that we have educated them and many of them are successes in \nlife and want to be part of our future. The Republicans have said \ndeport them.\n  The senior Senator from Maine has authored a bill to address this \nsubject, but as much as I respect her and count her as a friend, it \nfalls short of protecting the DREAMers who are in this country under \nDACA. I have to say that as one learns the stories of those who are \nprotected by the President's Executive order, we wonder what are the \nRepublicans thinking.\n  I have tried to tell these stories in light of individuals, not \nstatistics, and here is one I wish to tell everyone today. It is about \na young man who came to America when he was 9 years old from Thailand. \nHis name is Jirayut New. He was brought here at the age of 9 from \nThailand by his parents.\n  He grew up in San Francisco and he said:\n\n       I forced myself to read mystery novels, dictionary in hand, \n     in order to expand my vocabulary, one word at a time. I \n     mispronounced words, even in the face of ridicule, until I \n     mastered the English language.\n\n  It is amazing. These stories have happened many times in the past, \nbut it is incredible to think of a 9-year-old facing that ridicule but \nlearning the English language in San Francisco.\n  This young man became an excellent student and his dream was to be a \ndoctor. Throughout high school New worked 30 hours a week in his \nfamily's Thai restaurant. Here is what he said about that experience:\n\n       I spent most of my time in the restaurant working as a \n     waiter, cashier and chef, scrubbing toilets, washing dishes, \n     and mopping floors. It taught me to have faith, work hard, \n     and persevere.\n\n  His work paid off. He graduated salutatorian of his high school class \nwith a 4.3 grade point average. He was admitted to the University of \nCalifornia at Berkeley, one of the top schools in California and the \nNation. He won a scholarship that would have covered most of his \ntuition, but he couldn't accept it because he was undocumented.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Despite this setback, New persevered. In May of 2012 he \ngraduated with honors from Berkeley with a 3.7 grade point average and \na major in molecular and cellular biology. One month after he \ngraduated, President Obama issued his Executive order, DACA, and now \nNew was protected from deportation. As a result he was able to pursue \nhis dream to become a doctor.\n  Last fall New went to medical school at the University of California \nin San Francisco. Now what does he do in his spare time as a medical \nstudent? He volunteers at a homeless clinic run by students at the \nUniversity of California in San Francisco. He has cofounded Pre-Health \nDreamers, a national network of more than 400 DREAMers who are pursuing \ncareers in health care.\n  New and other similar DREAMers have so much to contribute to America. \nBut if the Republicans have their way, this man is going to be \ndeported. Instead of being able to stay in the United States as a \ndoctor, to realize his life's dream and make this a better and stronger \nnation, he will be deported. Will America be better or worse if this \nyoung man leaves? I think the answer is obvious.\n  So why do the Republicans persist? Why are they determined to take \nthis amazing young man and deport him? They have forgotten our legacy \nin\n\n[[Page S1040]]\n\nAmerica. We are a nation of immigrants, and our immigrants have come to \nthis country from all over the world because they appreciate the values \nand opportunity of America. I am lucky. My mother was an immigrant to \nthis country, and I stand on the Senate floor representing the great \nState of Illinois. It is my story, my family's story, and it is \nAmerica's story.\n  The time is clearly upon us to fund the appropriations of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security but not at the expense of this amazing \nyoung man. Let us fund this Department to keep America safe but also \nlet us dedicate ourselves to passing legislation which fixes our broken \nimmigration system and helps this young man and others like him to be a \npart of America's future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nfor 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before the Senator from Illinois leaves \nthe floor, I just want to thank him for his amazing leadership on this \nwhole issue of immigration.\n  The Senator and I share a similar background because my mother also \nwas an immigrant, and the thought of our moms being ripped out of our \nlives is just untenable. We are not going to let it happen.\n  I wish to thank him so much because he has been, I would say, the \ngrandfather of the whole DREAMer movement. So thank you, Senator.\n  We all know Republicans won in huge numbers in the 2014 election and \nthey took over the Senate and they run it. They run it--or at least \nthey are trying to run it.\n  Let's be clear. Less than 8 weeks after they took over the Senate we \nare facing a shutdown, a shutdown of the very agency that protects the \nhealth, the safety, the lives of the American people--the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  We are 4 days away, and even if they come up with a continuing \nresolution, a small little patch, they are shutting down the programs \nthat fund our firefighters and our first responders back home. So any \nway we look at it, this is a national disgrace.\n  Think about what our friends abroad and those who are not our friends \nare thinking about this. Republicans say we are in danger. We have to \ngo to war, put combat troops on the ground. But they are willing to \nshut down the Department that protects Americans in the homeland from a \nterrorist attack.\n  This is a self-inflicted crisis made up by the Republicans. It is \ndangerous. It is the height of irresponsibility and it is unnecessary.\n  Let me tell you, how does it make sense in the very same week that \nterrorists are threatening our shopping malls that we would shut down \nthe very agency charged with protecting those malls?\n  How does it make sense at a time when we are facing serious threats \nto our national security to furlough 30,000 Department of Homeland \nSecurity workers and to force more than 100,000 frontline Homeland \nSecurity personnel to work without pay? Why don't these Senators go \nwithout their pay? Give up your pay. Do you want to come to work every \nday and stand there and look for threats to our homeland and worry \nabout how you are going to pay the bills for your kids? Go without pay \nbefore you do this. You tell me how that makes sense not to pay people \nwho are in charge of our security. It is a disgrace.\n  Give up your pay--give up your pay, give up your health care, give up \nyour benefits, if this is so important to you.\n  Oh, no. They will collect their pay. Tell me, how does it make sense \nto shut off the grants that protect our cities, our ports from \nterrorist attacks, and how does it make sense to stop local communities \nfrom being able to hire police officers and firefighters?\n  The Department of Homeland Security is very large. When it was \ncreated I was troubled by that because it includes so many important \nthings in one department, including FEMA. So when we have a natural \ndisaster such as an earthquake, fire or flood, that is the Department \nthat deals with it. How does it make sense to disrupt disaster recovery \noperations such as the efforts in California to recover from our \ndevastating Napa Earthquake and the Rim Fire in Yosemite?\n  So not only are they disrupting Homeland Security and the protections \nof our perhaps most-targeted places in America, but they are disrupting \nrecovery from natural disasters, and God forbid if we have another \none. And the reason they are throwing a hissy fit is because the \nPresident stepped in and has a policy to take care of immigration. Why \ndid the President step in? Because Republicans refused to take up a \nbipartisan bill, pass it, and take care of the immigration problem the \nway they are supposed to. They are paralyzed on that point. They cannot \ndo it.\n\n  We had a bill that garnered 68 votes in the last Congress. All they \nhave to do is bring it up, pass it here, and then pass it in the House. \nIt will pass with overwhelming majorities. The President will sign it, \nand that would make his Executive order unnecessary. The only reason he \nissued an Executive order is that we are facing a crisis in this \ncountry. There are 11 million undocumented folks. Some of those \nundocumented folks are DREAMers. To me, that is the most important \ncategory. They are young people who were brought here when they were \nchildren. They know no other home. All they want to do is stay here and \ngive back to America. Republicans want to deport them and their \nparents. They want to deport the parents of American citizens. I thank \nGod these people were not in charge of Congress when I was growing up \nor else they might have deported my mother. It took her awhile to get \nthrough her naturalization. What if they passed something such as what \nthe Republicans are proposing?\n  I thought they were the party of family values. Show me where that is \ntrue--ripping families apart. I thought they were the party of economic \nprosperity. Show me how that is true when we know from study after \nstudy that one of the greatest things we can do for our economy and job \ncreation is to get people out of the shadows so they can go and buy a \nhome and hold a good job. They can't or won't pass an immigration bill. \nThey will not do their job.\n  So when the President steps in and does his job, they say: Oh, this \nis terrible. Let's shut down a totally unrelated department, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  Again I say, let's look at fiscal responsibility. According to the \nCenter for American Progress, it would cost more than $50 billion to \ndeport the entire population that the President is protecting. And here \nis the deal: I never heard a Republican--and I will stand corrected if \nany Republican corrects me--complain when President Eisenhower used his \nExecutive power to help immigrants or when President Nixon did the same \nthing to protect immigrants or when President Ronald Reagan, their \nhero, protected immigrants or when George Bush, Sr., protected \nimmigrants or when George W. Bush protected immigrants. They all used \ntheir authority. Show me one Republican who stood up and said: This is \noutrageous. Let's impeach the President. But they are annoyed because \nit is President Obama, and he won twice. Sorry. Wake up and smell the \nroses. He is the President, and he is doing the right thing for America \nbecause he loves America and he understands that these people, who the \nRepublicans want to deport, are going to help America move on to an era \nof greatness and keep us going.\n  Let's look at some of the young people Republicans want to deport. \nAlexis Bux is a 21-year-old student from central California. He is the \noldest of three siblings. His younger two siblings were born in the \nUnited States, but he was not. So these great family-value Republicans \nwant to rip away the oldest child from this family. His parents were \nfarm workers in the fields of San Joaquin Valley. Alexis received \nimmigration relief under DACA in 2012, and he will transfer to UC San \nDiego this fall where he will pursue his dream of a career in \nbiomedical engineering.\n  Tell me, Republicans, how our country is better off when you deport a \nyoung man such as him. He hopes to use his education to develop a \nsophisticated medical application and tools that will help cure deadly \ndiseases. All he wants to do is contribute to the Nation he loves.\n  If the Republicans had their way, they would deport people such as \nAna Albarran, who left Mexico at age 8. She came to this country with \nher younger\n\n[[Page S1041]]\n\nbrother and sister to join her parents. Her parents worked 11 hours a \nday as trimmers for a landscaping company in downtown Los Angeles.\n  After Ana received immigration relief, she felt confident enough to \nbegin applying for jobs, and now she is finishing her final year at UC \nMerced so she can begin her career as a bilingual first grade teacher.\n  Tell me, Republicans, how does it make sense to deport people such as \nAna and split her up from her parents when all they want to do is \ncontribute to the country they love? How does it make sense just \nbecause you are too incompetent to hold a vote on your immigration \nplan? If you want to kick people out of the country, put it to a vote. \nLet's go. If you want to deport 11 million people, then put it to a \nvote. Don't hide behind the Homeland Security bill and hold the \nPresident's work hostage. You never did it to the other Presidents. \nDon't do it to this President. How does it make sense to deport these \nmoms, these dads, and these young kids?\n  I mentioned before that I am the daughter of an immigrant mother. I \ntried to think of what my life would have been like without my mother. \nShe gave me my conscience. She gave me my values. She gave me all the \nlove and support I needed to pursue my dreams. I am the daughter of an \nimmigrant mother who never graduated from high school. I am a Senator \nin the U.S. Senate. But they would have deported my mother. I would not \nbe here today if it were not for my mom. So tell me how it makes sense \nto deport moms and dads and rip apart the lives of children.\n  Our national security is at stake, our family values are at stake, \nand our economy is at stake here. So get over the fact that you don't \nlike the President. We get it. You couldn't beat him. It is too bad for \nyou. You are in charge here in the Senate. Do your job. Bring an \nimmigration bill to the floor. Let's let this Homeland Security bill \ngo. It is a bipartisan bill. It is funding for the most important issue \nwe are dealing with today. Let's get to it. Don't hold it hostage \nbecause of your hatred of this President--and I use that word because \nthat is what I think. That is what I think.\n  In California alone, the President's Executive actions could boost \nCalifornia's economy by as much as $27.5 billion. The President's \naction will aid our economy. It will raise the Nation's gross domestic \nproduct by up to $90 billion over the next 10 years by expanding the \nlabor force and allowing immigrant workers the flexibility to seek new \njobs.\n  Why is that the case? Why does every independent study show us this \nis the case? The reason is simple. When workers come out of the \nshadows, their wages rise, they open bank accounts, buy homes, start \nbusinesses, and spend money in their communities.\n  So I say this to my Republican friends. There is a Presidential race \ncoming up. Forget the last one. Get over it. Let's work together.\n  Listen, I served with five Presidents. I am a strong Democrat. \nEveryone will tell you that. But I have respect for the office of the \nPresidency. If I didn't agree with Ronald Reagan, I came down here and \nsaid it. We had respect back and forth. If we lost, we lost, and we \nmoved on. That went both ways.\n  I know how it feels not to like the policies of a President. I get \nit. But don't overdo it and make it so personal. Get on with it. Grow \nup. Do your job. Have respect for the Office of the President. Don't \nsuddenly say Executive orders are bad when the President you don't like \ndoes it, but you don't say one word when a Republican President does \nthe same thing. It doesn't pass the smell test.\n  Three things could not be more important in this battle. We need to \nfund our Department of Homeland Security--especially when we are facing \nserious threats to our security. We need to uphold our family values \nand not split up loving families, and we need to protect and grow our \neconomy.\n  We can do this in the simplest way. First, I say to House Speaker \nBoehner--because under the Constitution all funding bills start in the \nHouse: Send us a clean bill. Send us the bill that everybody supported \nbefore you took it hostage on this immigration issue. Send it over \nclean. Let's fund everything in that bill to protect our shopping \nmalls, to give grants to our first responders, and to give grants to \nour local fire departments. Send it over. We will pass it, and \nimmediately following that, we will bring up an immigration bill.\n  We have it all ready for you. It passed with 68 votes. There is not \nmuch work to do. If you do that, the President's Executive order will \nnot be necessary because we will have taken the steps ourselves to fix \nour broken immigration system.\n  Let's stop the lawsuits. We have one judge who said there was \noverreach, but the next judge may say there is no overreach. Let's keep \nthis out of the courts. Let's do our job. Let's stop the self-inflicted \ncrisis. Let's stop the shadow that is hanging over the Nation. Let's do \nthe right thing here.\n  We can protect the American people from threats to our national \nsecurity. We can protect and grow our economy, and we can treat hard-\nworking immigrants and their families with the dignity and respect they \ndeserve. It all lies in the hands of Speaker Boehner and Leader \nMcConnell.\n  When you took over the Senate, you said: no more threats of \nshutdowns. Eight weeks later--not even 8 weeks--we are facing a \nshutdown of one of the most important departments. This is a disgrace, \nand it is self-inflicted. All you have to do is talk to Speaker \nBoehner. Send over a clean bill so we can vote on it. Then we will take \nup immigration, and you can show us all your great ideas on \nimmigration.\n  Let's hear it. Do you want to deport the DREAMers? Come on with it, \nand we will have a vote. You want to deport the parents? Come on with \nit, and we will have a vote. You want to kick 11 million people out of \nthis country? Come on with it, and we will have a vote and debate on \nit. But don't hold the Department of Homeland Security hostage because \nof this issue.\n  If there is one thing the American people hate more than anything \nelse, it is attaching unrelated matters to spending bills. I don't care \nif they are conservative Republicans or liberal Democrats or \nIndependent voters. They think it is the dumbest idea. They really do. \nThey don't understand it.\n  Pass your funding bills. Then battle your ideological issues \nseparately and apart from that. Don't hold these departments hostage to \nyour decision that President Obama did the wrong thing. If you don't \nlike what he did, put forward your own bill. You have not even done \nthat.\n  I have been here a long time. I will tell you something. I have never \nseen anything like this. It is a self-inflicted wound. Who gets hurt? \nNot the Republicans--they will keep getting their pay. They are fine. \nThe people who will be hurt are those whom we trust and count on and \nthe families that thought they could stay together. They are on the \nverge of that. That is what this party--the Grand Old Party, the GOP--\nhave brought to us, but they can get out of it in 5 minutes.\n  Speaker Boehner can pass a funding bill that will pass in a \nheartbeat. Send it over here, and we will pass it, turn to immigration, \nand then we can have it out on that subject. I think it is worthy of a \ndebate. But don't hold an important funding bill hostage to that \ndebate. It is ridiculous, unnecessary, destructive, and cruel.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/24/senate-section/article/S1041-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1041-S1043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  HARRIET TUBMAN AND THE HARRIET TUBMAN UNDERGROUND RAILROAD NATIONAL \n                            HISTORICAL PARK\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to celebrate the life of Harriet \nTubman and the establishment of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad \nNational Historical Park. Harriet Tubman was an American hero who \nchampioned freedom and was most famously known as a leader of the \nUnderground Railroad whose roots were on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.\n  Harriet Tubman was an iconic figure in our Nation's history for whom \nliberty and freedom were not just ideas\n\n[[Page S1042]]\n\nbut were God-given rights she fought tirelessly and at great personal \nperil to spread to others in bondage. The woman who is known to us as \nHarriet Tubman was born in approximately 1822 in Dorchester County, MD, \nand given the name Araminta ``Minty'' Ross. Born into slavery, she \nspent nearly 30 years of her life toiling for various families on \nMaryland's Eastern Shore.\n  Even as a young, enslaved girl, she demonstrated impressive mental \nand physical strength. One of her jobs was to set and check muskrat \ntraps in the swamps of the Blackwater River during blazing hot summers \nand freezing cold winters. Even though Harriet was slight in physical \nstature, she frequently worked with the men in the forest cutting \ntimber and carrying logs.\n  It was in this work setting, where both free and enslaved people \nworked together harvesting timber, that she first heard stories about \nwhat life was like for free Blacks in Northern States.\n  As a teenaged slave, one of her first acts of defiance was sticking \nup for an enslaved boy who was being harassed by a shopkeeper. In \nhelping the boy out of this situation, she took a serious blow to the \nhead when the shopkeeper threw a lead weight that struck her in the \nhead. Tubman recalled later in life that the mark of the weight on her \nskull never fully healed and after this incident she would see visions \nthat later inspired her to escape slavery.\n  As an adult she took the first name Harriet, and when she was 24 \nyears old she married John Tubman. In her late twenties, Harriet Tubman \nescaped from slavery in 1849. She fled in the dead of night, navigating \nthe maze of tidal streams and wetlands that to this day comprise the \nEastern Shore's landscape. She did so alone, demonstrating courage, \nstrength, and fortitude that became her hallmark.\n  Not satisfied with attaining her own freedom, she returned repeatedly \nfor more than 10 years to places of her enslavement in Dorchester and \nCaroline Counties where, under the most adverse conditions, she led \naway many family members and other slaves to freedom in the \nNortheastern United States and Canada.\n  She helped develop a complex network of safe houses and recruited \nabolitionist sympathizers residing along secret routes connecting the \nSouthern slave States and Northern free States.\n  No one knows exactly how many people she led to freedom or the number \nof trips between the North and the South she led, but the legend of her \nwork was an inspiration to the multitude of slaves seeking freedom and \nto abolitionists fighting to end slavery. Tubman became known as the \nMoses of her people by African Americans and White abolitionists alike.\n  Tubman once proudly told Frederick Douglass that in all her journeys \nshe ``never lost a single passenger.'' She was so effective that in \n1856 there was a $40,000 reward offered for her capture in the South. \nShe is the most famous and the most important conductor of the network \nof resistance known as the Underground Railroad.\n  But Tubman was more than a conductor on the Underground Railroad. She \nwas a scout and a spy for the Union Army, she was active in the women's \nsuffrage movement after the Civil War, and ultimately she served aging \nAfrican Americans by running a home for the aged in Auburn, NY.\n  In 1903 she bequeathed the Tubman home to the African Methodist \nEpiscopal Zion Church in Auburn, where it stands to this day. Just this \nmonth I was able to attend the midwinter meeting of the Board of \nBishops/International Ministers and Lay Association of the AME Zion \nChurch, where we honored Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglass, and \nHarriet Tubman.\n  The AME Zion Church, or the ``Freedom Church,'' as many refer to it, \nwas an important part of Harriet Tubman's life and was involved in the \nforefront of both the abolition and civil rights movements. She was a \ndedicated member of the church and actively supported the construction \nof the Thompson AME Church in Auburn, NY, where she lay in state after \nher death. Harriet Tubman died in Auburn in 1913, and she is buried in \nthe Fort Hill Cemetery.\n  Fortunately, many of the structures and landmarks in New York remain \nintact, in relatively good condition. For the past 7 years, I have \nchampioned legislation to establish the creation of the Harriet Tubman \nHistorical Parks in Maryland and New York. The creation of these parks \nhas been years in the making and long overdue, and I am very grateful \nfor the support my colleagues gave this bill in the last Congress.\n  Recently I was able to celebrate this park's formal designation \nduring a ceremonial event at the Harriet Tubman Museum and Educational \nCenter in Cambridge, MD, just a few miles from where she grew up. I was \nable to meet some of Harriet Tubman's descendants, which was incredibly \nmeaningful to me.\n  I am so pleased Harriet Tubman's legacy will live on in these parks. \nMy cosponsors and I all share a deep appreciation for how establishing \nthis park is preserving the legacy of this remarkable historic figure \nin American history and will also show how important this park will be \nto communities where they are located.\n  Every February our Nation's children learn lessons about the many \ncontributions African Americans have made to our democracy and to the \ngrowth and prosperity of our Nation. Preserving places significant to \nHarriet Tubman's life story for future generations creates a learning \nopportunity that our kids and grandkids can't get in the classroom or \nlearn from a textbook.\n  The park will educate the public about the historical significance of \nthe Underground Railroad and Harriet Tubman's early life and also is \nexpected to increase tourism, create jobs, and strengthen local \neconomies.\n  The final passage of this bill to create the park was the result of \nan unyielding bipartisan effort, including Representative Andy Harris, \nSenator Mikulski, and me, along with our partners from New York, \nSenators Schumer, Gillibrand, and former Secretary Clinton when she \nrepresented New York in this body, along with Congressmen Dan Maffei \nand Richard Hanna.\n  This was a bipartisan effort and involved Members from both New York \nand Maryland. The effort on this legislative work was started by my \npredecessor, Senator Sarbanes, when he passed legislation commissioning \nthe national service to conduct a special resource study on Harriet \nTubman.\n  The establishment of the national historical park commemorating the \nlife of Harriet Tubman and protecting the serene and almost untouched \nlandscape is an ideal way to celebrate and honor the outstanding life \nand incredible work of Harriet Tubman, while establishing an important \ndestination for tourists to come visit, learn, and experience \nMaryland's Eastern Shore.\n  The vision for the Tubman National Historical Parks is to preserve \nthe places significant to the life of Harriet Tubman and tell her story \nthrough interpretive activities, while continuing to discover aspects \nof her life and the experiences of passage along the Underground \nRailroad through archaeological research and discovery.\n  The buildings and structures in Maryland have mainly disappeared. \nSlaves were forced to live in primitive buildings even though many \nslaves were skilled tradesmen who constructed the substantial homes of \ntheir owners.\n  Not surprising, few of the structures associated with the early years \nof Tubman's life remain standing today. The landscape of the Eastern \nShore of Maryland, however, is still evocative of the time when Harriet \nTubman lived there. Farm fields and loblolly pine forests dot the \nlowland landscape, which is also notable for its extensive network of \ntidal rivers and wetlands that Tubman and the people she guided to \nfreedom used under cover of night. In particular, a number of places \nsignificant to Tubman's life--including the homestead of Ben Ross, her \nfather; Stewart's Canal, where he worked; the Brodess Farm, where she \nworked as a slave; and others--are within the master plan boundaries of \nthe Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. Similarly, Poplar Neck, the \nplantation from which she escaped, is still largely intact in Caroline \nCounty. The properties in Talbot County, immediately across the \nChoptank River from the plantation, are currently protected by various \nconservation easements. Were she alive today, Tubman would recognize \nmuch of the landscape that she knew intimately as she secretly led \nfreedom\n\n[[Page S1043]]\n\nseekers of all ages to the North. This park helps connect people today \nto America's history.\n  Only recently has the Park Service begun establishing units dedicated \nto the lives of African Americans. Places such as Booker T. Washington \nNational Monument on the campus of Tuskegee University in Alabama, the \nGeorge Washington Carver National Monument in Missouri, the National \nHistoric Trail commemorating the march for voting rights from Selma to \nMontgomery, and most recently the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial on \nthe Mall are all important monuments and places of historical \nsignificance that help tell the story of the African-American \nexperience.\n  As the National Park Service continues its important work to \ncommemorate and preserve African-American history by providing greater \npublic access and information about the places and people who have \nshaped the African-American experience, there are very few units \ndedicated to the lives of African-American women. This historic park is \nthe first national park in honor of a woman--obviously the first \nhistorical park for an African-American woman.\n  As we celebrate Black history this month and women's history next \nmonth, I cannot think of a more fitting hero than Harriet Tubman to be \nthe first African-American woman to be memorialized with national \nhistorical parks. These parks tell both her personal story and her \nlifelong fight for justice and freedom, from her fight against the \ncruel institution of slavery and the establishment of the Underground \nRailroad that she led, to her work in the women's suffrage movement.\n  I encourage my colleagues to seek inspiration from the heroes of \ntheir own States and work to preserve the physical remnants of their \nlegacy so that future generations of Americans might better know who \nhelped form this great Nation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz).

Mr. President, at a press conference the day after the \nelections in November, President Obama said: ``I am eager to work with \nthe new Congress to make the next 2 years as productive as possible.''\n  Well, Republicans couldn't have been happier to hear that. After \nyears of dysfunction in the Democrat-led Senate, Republicans were eager \nto get Washington working again for Americans and working with the \nPresident to get things done for the American people. We are still \neager to work with the President, but, unfortunately, despite his \nwords, the President hasn't shown much of an inclination to work with \nCongress.\n  Between January 7 and February 10 of this year, President Obama \nissued a total of 13 veto threats. That is more than two veto threats \nper week during that period. He has announced his intention to veto \neverything from a bipartisan jobs bill to national security legislation \nto bills to protect the unborn. And, of course, he has threatened to \nveto the Keystone XL Pipeline bill--a threat he is likely to make good \non this week.\n  One would think that if President Obama were at all serious about \nwanting to work with Congress, Keystone would be the first bill he \nwould sign. The American people support Keystone by a wide margin. \nUnions support Keystone because they are eager for the jobs that it \nwould create. Substantial numbers of Democrats support Keystone.\n  Here is what one Democrat had to say about the pipeline: ``We have \neverything to gain by building this pipeline, especially since it would \nhelp create thousands of jobs right here at home and limit our \ndependence on foreign oil.'' That is from a Democrat here in the \nSenate.\n  Approving Keystone is a no-brainer. It would support 42,000 jobs \nduring construction, would contribute billions to our economy, and \nwould bring in substantial revenue to State and local governments which \nwould mean more money for local priorities such as schools and \nteachers, roads and bridges. It would do all of this without spending a \ndime--not a single dime of taxpayer money.\n  The President's refusal to approve this legislation is a signal of \njust how unserious he is about wanting to work with Congress to get \nthings done. Unfortunately, after a promising start Democrats in the \nSenate are starting to imitate President Obama's obstruction. Yesterday \nDemocrats again voted to filibuster the Department of Homeland Security \nappropriations bill for the fourth time this month. What is their \nreason? They are desperate to protect the President's Executive action \non immigration.\n  Before President Obama decided to implement his Executive amnesty, he \nsaid 22 times he did not have the authority to take this action. In \nfact, in March of 2011 he told an audience:\n\n       With respect to the notion that I can just suspend \n     deportation through executive order, that is just not the \n     case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has \n     passed. . . . we've got three branches of government. \n     Congress passes the law. The executive branch's job is to \n     enforce and implement those laws.\n\n  That is from the President of the United States in March of 2011. At \nleast eight Democrats have expressed similar concerns. This is from a \nDemocrat here in the Senate: ``I have to be honest, how this is coming \nabout makes me uncomfortable.''\n  An independent Senator from Maine stated: ``I also frankly am \nconcerned about the constitutional separation of powers.''\n  This is an example of the reservations that have been expressed by \nDemocrats right here in the Senate about the President's Executive \namnesty.\n  Last week a Federal judge agreed with the legal concerns the \nPresident had raised and ordered the administration to halt amnesty \nproceedings. Despite this, Democrats continue to try to protect funding \nfor the President's unconstitutional action by preventing consideration \nof the Homeland Security appropriations bill.\n  If Democrats object to parts of the bill, they need to vote to get on \nthe bill so they can offer proposals to amend it. That is the way this \nplace works. Republicans have made it very clear that we are ready and \nwilling to vote on Democratic amendments. The leader on our side has \nsaid that when we get on the bill we will alternate amendments. It will \nbe a free-flowing process, just as we committed to when we took the \nmajority in the Senate.\n  The Democrats object to the bill's lack of funding for the \nPresident's amnesty. Then they should offer amendments to restore the \nfunding. That is simply how it works in the Senate. All we have to do \nis get on the bill. That just takes six Democrats to get us onto that \nlegislation to give us an opportunity to actually debate this.\n  When the Republicans took over the Senate in January, we made it our \ngoal to get Washington working again. That is exactly what we have \ndone. Our Democrat-controlled Senate was run on a strictly partisan \nline basis. The minority party was shut out of the debate and the \namendment process, and the Senate spent much of its time on narrow, \npartisan legislation.\n  Under Republican control the Senate floor has become once again an \nopen forum for debate and amendments by Members of both parties. \nRepublicans have allowed almost three times as many amendments in \nJanuary alone as Democrats allowed in the entire calendar year of 2014.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline bill was passed with bipartisan support with \namendments from Members of both parties. Republicans are eager to \ncontinue this bipartisan process going forward. That is why the \nobstruction of\n\n[[Page S1044]]\n\nthe President and the Democrats in this particular circumstance is so \ndisappointing.\n  Nobody around here expects Democrats and Republicans to always agree. \nThey certainly don't expect the President to never issue a veto threat. \nBut the President's apparent determination to obstruct everything is \npretty discouraging.\n  If the President continues to make veto threats at the same rate he \nhas so far, we will be looking at almost 90 veto threats by the end of \n2015. The American people deserve and expect better. Americans sent a \nclear message in the last election. They were tired of business as \nusual in Washington. They want Members of Congress and the President to \nwork together to address the challenges facing our Nation. Clearly, the \nPresident still hasn't managed to process that message.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/24/senate-section/article/S1044-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE PRESIDENT'S FOREIGN POLICY\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, before I close, I would like to take a \nminute to talk about the President's foreign policy. The Congress has \nreceived the President's request for authorization for the use of \nmilitary force in Iraq and Syria, and we will take a hard look at this \nrequest. But we still haven't seen a comprehensive strategy from the \nPresident for confronting and defeating ISIS. ISIS represents a barely \ncomprehensible level of evil. Wherever its members go they leave a \ntrail of blood. Their reign of terror in the Middle East has included \nthe systematic persecution and murder of Christians and other \nminorities, rape, torture, burnings, beheadings, as well as reports of \nthe crucifixion and burying alive of children.\n  Just 2 weeks ago ISIS beheaded 21 Coptic Christians in Libya. The \nmen's only crime was professing their faith. This morning's news \nincluded reports of another 90 Assyrian Christians being abducted by \nISIS from a village in northern Syria.\n  My heart sinks each time I hear any report of abductions of this \nnature because we know the fate that is likely in store for these \npeople. Evil like this cannot be ignored. It must be confronted. The \nUnited States should be a leader in the effort to defeat this hellish \norganization and its reign of brutality.\n  The President should have articulated a plan for responding to ISIS \nmonths ago, but, unfortunately, his lack of decision is par for the \ncourse when it comes to this administration's foreign policy. Time and \nagain, the President has been confronted with a foreign policy crisis \nand has simply failed to respond. That needs to end now. With crises \nmultiplying around the world, it is time for the President to step up \nand start leading. We cannot afford for him to sit on the sidelines any \nlonger.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/24/senate-section/article/S1044-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, this week marks the final week of Black \nHistory Month, an annual tradition that celebrates Black history and \nculture but also is a call to action to continue our Nation's march, as \nhalting as it sometimes is, toward equality.\n  This week we take an important step toward awarding a Congressional \nGold Medal to the foot soldiers who participated in Bloody Sunday, \nTurnaround Tuesday, or the Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights March. \nSenator Scott and I and Senators Shelby and Sessions and the banking \ncommittee moved forward on that earlier today. I am proud to be one of \nthe 65 cosponsors. I am also introducing a resolution this week \ninstructing the Postal Service to issue a commemorative stamp honoring \nthe 50th anniversary of the Selma marches.\n  It is far past time for us to honor the brave men and women who \nrisked life and limb to demand full participation in our democracy. We \ncan do this on the Senate floor. We can do it by traveling to Selma. \nNext week Senator Scott and I will lead a delegation to Selma for the \nanniversary of the march. I understand my colleague from Ohio may be \njoining us. I took my daughters Emily and Elizabeth there a number of \nyears ago. I look forward to the journey to Selma with my wife in a \ncouple of weeks, marking the 50th anniversary.\n  Fifty years ago, Dr. King led thousands in that 54-mile march--the \nsecond Selma bridge crossing, if you will. They arrived in Montgomery 4 \ndays later to a crowd of 25,000 Black and White supporters. In his \nspeech that day, Dr. King told a story of one of the marchers: Sister \nPollard, a 70-year-old African-American women who lived in Montgomery \nduring the bus boycott a little less than a decade earlier.\n  She was asked if she wanted a ride during the march instead of \nwalking. She said: ``No.''\n  The person said: ``Aren't you tired?''\n  She said: ``My feet are tired, but my soul is rested.''\n  Progress is never easy, and as we celebrate Black History Month, we \nare reminded of the long journey we have traveled and how far we still \nhave to go.\n  This month we celebrate the contributions African Americans have made \nto the fabric of our Nation.\n  When Carter G. Woodson started what became Black History Month in \n1926, my State of Ohio--the Presiding Officer's State--had already \nproduced 19th-century poet Paul Laurence Dunbar; Columbus native \nGranville T. Woods had already invented the telegraph device that sent \nmessages between moving trains and train stations; Mary Jane Patterson \nhad already become the first Black woman to graduate from Oberlin \nCollege, in my part of Ohio; Garrett Morgan, a Clevelander, had already \ninvented the traffic signal; Ohio State Representative John P. Green \nhad introduced a bill to establish Labor Day in Ohio, which later \nbecame Labor Day, which we all celebrate; and COL Charles Young, who \nfound freedom in Ripley, OH, in the Presiding Officer's old \ncongressional district, became the highest ranking African-American \ncommanding officer in the U.S. Army in 1894--120 years ago--and the \nfirst African-American superintendent of a national park.\n  This month we celebrate these and other pioneering Ohioans: two \nPulitzer Prize winners--Nobel Prize-winning writer Toni Morrison from \nLorain and former Poet Laureate of the United States Rita Dove from \nAkron.\n  Olympic Gold Medalist Jesse Owens grew up in Cleveland. Jesse Owens \nspoke at my brother's high school graduation in Mansfield.\n  Howard Arthur Tibbs from Salem served with the Tuskegee Airmen, and I \nwas honored to meet his family in 2007 when this body posthumously \nawarded him the Congressional Gold Medal.\n\n[[Page S1045]]\n\n  Congressman Louis Stokes, who so many in this body know, rose from \none of the first Federal housing projects in the Nation, in Cleveland, \nto prominence as a lawyer and legislator. Yesterday Louis Stokes \ncelebrated his 90th birthday. He argued before the Supreme Court in his \nlegal practice, and during his two decades in Congress he was a \nforceful advocate for the city he loves.\n  This month we honor them and many others. These achievements have \ncome in the face of centuries of oppression, making these achievements \nall the more remarkable. They have not come to be recognized simply \nthrough chance. It took a century of concerted effort--longer than \nthat, really--led by Black Americans such as Dr. King, to give voice to \nthe struggles and the stories, the triumphs and the traditions of the \nAfrican Americans who have shaped who we are as a country and as a \npeople. These stories are the ones we celebrate this month and the ones \nwe must do more to honor and tell.\n  This month I am introducing legislation to begin the process of \ndesignating the Parker House in Ripley, OH, as a national monument. \nJohn Parker was a slave who purchased his freedom, became a successful \nbusinessman, and helped many others to freedom on the Underground \nRailroad through crossing the Ohio River and heading north, some to \nOberlin and ultimately many to Canada.\n  Stories such as these are too often untold and overlooked. They show \nus how African Americans have shaped their own destiny in this country.\n  I hope today my colleagues will join me in honoring the African \nAmericans who have made us who we are as a nation. I would add that I \nhope this 50th anniversary, this trip that a number of colleagues and I \nwill take to Selma, will mark progress in voting rights.\n  We took huge strides in voting rights in the last 50 years. In fact, \nin 1964 it was a conservative Republican Congressman from north of \nDayton by the name of William McCullough, who was the senior Republican \non the House Judiciary Committee--Jacqueline Kennedy and others \ncredited Congressman McCullough, perhaps more than any other single \nMember--even more than Hubert Humphrey or Everett Dirksen--for the \nCivil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act passing the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate and being signed by the President.\n  Unfortunately, in the last few years we have seen State legislators \nand far too many Members of this body try to scale back and roll back \nsome of those gains in voting rights--all in the name of stopping \nfraud, when in fact voting fraud is much exaggerated by them. It barely \nexists. But the efforts to roll back voting rights has resulted from \nthat. It is wrong, and it is shameful, especially as we celebrate the \n50th anniversary.\n  I am hopeful we can move forward in spite of what this very \nconservative Supreme Court has done, move forward in voting rights as \nwe honor Black History Month, as we honor 50 years of Selma, and as we \nhonor the work African Americans and Whites have done to make this \ncountry a better place to live.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, for weeks now \nSenate Democrats have repeatedly blocked the Senate from even \nconsidering a $40 billion funding bill for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity that would extend through the end of the fiscal year, the end \nof September. They have done it not once, not twice, not three times, \nbut four times. Four times they have filibustered this Department of \nHomeland Security funding bill that would pay the salaries of the men \nand women who protect our ports, our airports, and our border.\n  Meanwhile, our friends across the aisle are telling the American \npeople: No, it is not us blocking this funding, it is the Republicans. \nWell, I beg to differ. The House of Representatives has actually passed \na Homeland Security appropriations bill--the bill we tried to get on \nfour different times and the Democrats don't seem satisfied with the \nability to offer amendments to change it or modify it in any way that \nthey can command 60 votes to do. Their attitude is: We are not even \ngoing to consider it unless we get everything we want right upfront.\n  I guess I can kind of understand why they are of that frame of mind \nbecause over the last few years, the Senate has become completely \ndysfunctional. Under the previous majority leader, there wasn't any \nopportunity to offer amendments and get votes on those amendments on \nlegislation. It was a ``my way or the highway'' proposition.\n  In other words, what I am saying is the Senate was broken, and after \nyears of running the Senate as an incumbent protection program and \nvoting on only poll-tested messages and blocking amendments, last \nNovember the American people said, enough is enough; no more \ndysfunction. Let's have a Senate and a Congress that represents our \ninterests, not the interests of protecting incumbents against taking \ntough votes.\n  I believe our colleagues who have blocked consideration of this \nfunding amendment should be, frankly, ashamed of themselves. It doesn't \nseem as though they have gotten the message.\n  The senior Senator from New York, Senator Schumer, who is a member of \nthe leadership and my friend, told the Huffington Post recently that \n``it is really fun to be in the minority.'' By that, I guess he means \nit is fun to block Homeland Security appropriations bills not once, not \ntwice, not three times, but four separate times. But filibustering this \ncritical funding for the men and women who protect us every day is not \nmy idea of fun, nor is it, I suspect, for the thousands of men and \nwomen who work in the Department of Homeland Security, from the Coast \nGuard to the Border Patrol to all of the people who work day in and day \nout to try and help keep us safe in the homeland.\n  When given the opportunity four times over the last few weeks to \nfully fund the Department of Homeland Security while rolling back the \nPresident's unconstitutional Executive action, four times Senate \nDemocrats have taken the low road and continued to obstruct.\n  Over the last several weeks, we pointed out the tough talk that came \nfrom some Senate Democrats last fall when the President issued his \nExecutive action on immigration back when the President made his intent \nclear to follow through with a series of unilateral actions that he had \npreviously said, on 22 different occasions, he didn't have the \nauthority to do. Twenty-two times the President said publicly he didn't \nhave the authority to do it, and last November, after being encouraged \nto wait until after the election so it didn't have a negative blowback \non people running for the Senate, he went ahead and did it anyway.\n  As I noted before, some of our colleagues on the other side expressed \ntheir concerns at the time. Some said it made them feel uncomfortable, \nand some said: I wish he wouldn't do it. Well, no kidding.\n  When the President usurps the authority given under the Constitution \nto the legislative branch of government and seeks to arrogate to \nhimself the power to unilaterally change the law, they should feel \nuncomfortable. One by one these same folks who were so concerned and so \nuncomfortable with what the President did last November have come down \nto the floor and voted in lockstep. They voted, in effect, to reaffirm \nthe President's actions.\n  In justifying these votes, we heard the common refrain, we don't \nnecessarily agree with the President's Executive actions, but an \nappropriations bill is not the proper vehicle to address them. That is \nwhat they said time and time again. So now we have a pretty simple and \nstraightforward message to our Democratic friends who were so concerned \nand so uncomfortable and who wished the President had not gone around \nCongress on immigration. We are here to say: Here is your chance.\n  This week the Senate will take up a bill that will address the \nPresident's Executive actions that were announced last November. \nSenator McConnell, the majority leader, made it clear last night that \nthis targeted bill is not tied to the Department of Homeland Security \nfunding.\n  Under the regular rules of the Senate, the process he set in order \nlast night will come to fruition on Friday, and that will be the time \nfor all of our colleagues on this side of the aisle and\n\n[[Page S1046]]\n\nthe ones on the other side of the aisle who expressed disapproval of \nthe President's Executive action to vote for a bill that expresses that \ndisapproval--the so-called Collins bill.\n  My strong preference would be to pass the House bill--that has been \nfilibustered four separate times by our Democratic friends--because it \nfully funds the Department while reining in the President's overreach. \nBut since the Democrats have refused on four different occasions to \neven allow the bill to come to the floor with the excuse that it is \ntied to the Department of Homeland Security funding, we are going to \ngive them an opportunity to put their money where their mouth is. In \nother words, we are going to see if they can take yes for an answer.\n  If all of the occasions where my colleagues said they were \nuncomfortable with the President's actions are not enough--if the 22 \ntimes the President himself said he didn't have the authority to issue \nthis Executive action--well, we now know that during the recess last \nweek a Federal judge in Texas has given us one more reason.\n  A week ago U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen in Brownsville, TX, ruled \nin a lawsuit brought by 26 different States, including Texas, that what \nthe President did was illegal. He issued a temporary injunction \nblocking implementation of the President's Executive action.\n  If that were the end of it, any amount of money that was appropriated \nby the Congress to fund the Department of Homeland Security could not \nlegally be used to fund the President's Executive action because there \nis an injunction in place issued by a Federal court that says you can't \ndo it, and, indeed, the administration has acknowledged that. They \nstood down, but now they have come back to the judge and asked for a \nstay of the judge's temporary injunction. They said if they don't get \nthat, they will go to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans \nand ask the appellate court to stay the judge's temporary injunction.\n  Judge Hanen's ruling enforces what I and many others have been saying \nfor a long time, that the President acted outside of the law when he \nwent around Congress to unilaterally change our Nation's immigration \nlaws.\n  But the judge's ruling gets to a broader issue, and there is one part \nof it that I found particularly important. In writing his opinion \nexplaining his ruling, Judge Hanen looked at the Obama administration's \ncase and imagined how you could take their argument and apply it across \nthe board.\n  It is easy to overlook and overreach what the President has said if \nyou perhaps agree with what he actually accomplished, which is, in \neffect, to give legal status to roughly 5 million people. If you think \nthat is a good idea, you are likely to turn a blind eye to the way the \nPresident did it. But if the courts establish the precedent that this \nPresident--or any future President, Republican or Democrat--can pick \nand choose which laws to enforce, what could end up happening? Well, it \ndoesn't take a lot of imagination. Judge Hanen writes: ``then a lack of \nresources''--which is the argument that was made by the \nadministration--``would be an acceptable reason to cease enforcing \nenvironmental laws, or the Voting Rights Act, or even the various laws \nthat protect civil rights and equal opportunity.''\n  That is what Judge Hanen said in his opinion in repudiating the \nargument made by the administration that the President had this \nauthority and talked about what kind of dangerous precedent it would \nset if it were accepted by the court as legal.\n  I am sure I am not the only one who would hate to see our country \nhead down that sort of lawless path where the laws don't make any \ndifference, it is just the preference of whoever is President which \ndetermines the direction the country should take. That is a dangerous \npath. It is completely inconsistent with who we are as a country that \nbelieves in the rule of law.\n  So now that the President's actions have been settled in the court of \npublic opinion, where they are deeply unpopular, and ruled upon by a \ncourt of law, my friends from the other side of the aisle need to take \nnote because they have a very clear choice. They can continue to give \nexcuses for why they are filibustering this $40 billion Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill or, as I said, they can put their money \nwhere their mouth is and vote to stop the President's 2014 Executive \naction separate and apart from any issue of funding of the Department \nof Homeland Security.\n  At the end of the day, the Senate will make sure the people who \nprotect our borders and our ports and our skies get paid because that \nis the responsible thing to do. Senate Democrats, who were so concerned \nand so uncomfortable with what the President did last fall, are out of \nexcuses, and they are going to have a chance to vote on the Collins \namendment on Friday or at some other time mutually agreed upon by the \nmajority and the minority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the remarks of my \nfriend and my colleague from Texas.\n  If my friend has a moment as he walks out this door, he should take a \nsharp left and stop at the staircase and look up. At the top of the \nstaircase the Senator from Texas will see this amazing portrait that \nhas been copied and referred to over and over again. It is an \nincredible painting that shows President Abraham Lincoln signing the \nEmancipation Proclamation in the midst of the Civil War while \nsurrounded by his Cabinet. This Emancipation Proclamation freed 3 \nmillion slaves in America from involuntary servitude.\n  Was the President signing a bill that had been passed by Congress? \nNo. He was signing an Executive order--the same type of Executive order \nused by President Obama to address the issue of immigration.\n  All right, Senator Durbin, you found one moment in history. According \nto arguments you heard on the floor, there could not be very many more. \nLet's fast forward to the late 1940s with President Harry Truman. \nPresident Harry Truman, after World War II, decided to finally end \nracial discrimination in the ranks of our military. How did he do it? \nDid he do it by signing a law passed by Congress? No. He signed an \nExecutive order ending the discrimination and segregation taking place \nin our military.\n  I don't argue that Presidents can exceed their constitutional powers. \nIt has happened. But to argue that Executive orders that have been used \nby President after President are inherently unconstitutional defies any \naccurate, honest reading of history.\n  Here are some realities. The immigration system in the United States \nof America today is broken--broken terribly--to the point where we may \nhave 12 to 13 million undocumented people in this country, where our \nborders are stronger now than they have ever been, but still have to be \nfortified to make sure we don't have the unnecessary migration of \npeople into the United States in an illegal status. There are so many \nthings we need to do to fix this broken immigration system, and we \naddressed them.\n  Two years ago eight Senators came together--four Democrats and four \nRepublicans. I was honored to be part of it. We sat down for months and \nwrote a comprehensive immigration reform bill. We brought it to the \nfloor of the Senate after considering 100 amendments in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, and it passed on the floor with 68 positive votes. \nFourteen Republicans joined the Democrats for the bipartisan bill which \nwas supported by the Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO, and \nconservatives and liberals across America.\n  Pretty good work for a Congress that is blamed many times for just \nbeing obstructionists. We passed it with 68 votes, sent it to the House \nof Representatives, where it languished for almost 2 years, never being \ncalled for a vote--never.\n  At that point the President stepped forward and said: I have to do \nsomething to deal with the problems of illegal immigration in America. \nHere is what he proposed--two things, basically. He said: If you are \nhere in America and are the parent of a child who is a U.S. citizen or \nthe parent of a child who is a legal resident alien, you can come \nforward, pay about $500 as a fee, subject yourself to a criminal \nbackground check. If you clear it or you committed no serious crimes \nand are no threat to America, then we will give you a temporary work \npermit to be in\n\n[[Page S1047]]\n\nthe United States and work. We want to know who you are, where you \nlive, the members of your family, and where you work. That is what the \nPresident proposed, and that is what they want to stop.\n  We would continue the current situation with millions of undocumented \npeople working without background checks, working without any \nregistration to this government, so we know their whereabouts and what \nthey do. That is what they want to end. They think the President went \nway too far in setting up this process. I think they are wrong.\n  The Republicans had a chance to pass a comprehensive immigration bill \nand they refused. In refusing, they left the President no alternative. \nHe is trying to make sense out of a broken immigration system. It would \nbe better if the Republicans joined us in the House and the Senate in a \nbipartisan effort to achieve that.\n  The last point I want to make is this: I think one of the most \nheartless things I have seen in my time in the House and Senate is the \neffort by the Republicans to end DACA. DACA was the protection the \nPresident gave to DREAMers. DREAMers are children brought to America--\nchildren, infants, toddlers, and young kids--by their parents, who grew \nup in America and went to school, have no serious criminal issues in \ntheir background, and who simply want the chance to be part of \nAmerica's future. That is all they are asking for.\n  The President's Executive order gives them that chance to prove \nthemselves, and the Republicans want to eliminate that order. I don't \nunderstand it. If they take the time to meet some of these young \npeople, they would realize what a waste it would be of such great skill \nand talent and love of America.\n  I will close--and I see my friend and colleague Senator Murray--and \nsay this: We are a nation of immigrants. Our diversity is our strength. \nThe people who are willing to risk everything in their lives to come to \nthis country, to be part of this great American experiment, to have an \nopportunity for their next generation to have a chance for a better \nlife, that is what defines us. That is who we are.\n  I stand here--and I have said it so many times and proudly so--the \nson of an immigrant mother who was brought here at the age of 2. She \nwas the first DREAMer in my house, and she raised a son to serve in the \nU.S. Senate. That is my story. That is my family's story. That is \nAmerica's story.\n  It is time for us to fund the Department of Homeland Security and \nprotect America and then have an honest debate about an immigration \npolicy consistent with American values.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for his \npassionate remarks. That rings so true to all of us. I thank him for \nall his work on the DREAM Act and making sure young people who are \nraised in this country have the opportunities that all of us do.\n  As we count down the final days before funding for the Department of \nHomeland Security potentially runs out, I want to take a few minutes to \ntalk about how we got to this point. As this deadline gets closer and \ncloser, I have been continually reminded we have been down this road \nmany times before. This is a manufactured crisis, and it is no \ndifferent than so many others we have faced in Congress over the last \nfew years. What is happening in Congress right now is not a debate over \ngovernment spending policies or priorities. That much is certain. This \nis not a debate over how the Department of Homeland Security should \nfunction. It is certainly not a debate about our national security. \nThis is, pure and simple, a political fight Republicans are having with \nthemselves across the two Chambers of the Capitol and across the \ndifferent factions of the Republican Party. That is not the case for \nevery Republican in the Senate. Several Members have said clearly we \nshould fund the Department of Homeland Security without any strings \nattached.\n  The fact remains some Republicans are making it clear they are \nwilling to hold hostage the basic operation of our government over \nrightwing politics and nothing else. While this process might seem \ncomplicated, it is actually very simple.\n  Democrats--along with national security experts, law enforcement \nexperts, State and local officials, and three former Secretaries of \nHomeland Security, including two Republicans--want to do nothing more \nthan fund the Department of Homeland Security cleanly, no strings or \nunrelated political amendments attached. But because they are so angry \nabout the President's actions months ago to improve our country's \nimmigration laws, some Republicans are demanding to pass a bill that \nwill tear apart families who are working hard to make it in America, \nput our security at risk, and seriously threaten all of the work we \nhave done recently--including the budget agreement I reached with \nCongressman Paul Ryan--to keep our government functioning. That is not \nonly bad policy. It doesn't make any sense.\n  The bill passed by Speaker Boehner and House Republicans would be \ndevastating to families across the country, and it would make day-to-\nday operations for the Department of Homeland Security needlessly \ndifficult. For example, TSA agents who work to keep our airports safe \nand secure would be forced to work without pay. These men and women \nshould be worrying about doing their jobs, not knowing whether they are \ngoing to be able to pay their bills and put food on their table. That \nis not what we want them worrying about. But because of political \npressure from the extreme anti-immigration, rightwing party, that is \nwhat Republican leaders in the House are demanding.\n  This looming shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security has \nbecome to them nothing more than collateral damage. The national \nimpacts of not funding the Department of Homeland Security have been \ndiscussed for weeks now. This would also cause problems all the way \ndown to individual fire departments in our local communities.\n  Right now the Whatcom County Fire District 18 located in my State--\nclose to the northern Canadian border and it is about an hour north of \nSeattle--is applying for an assistance to firefighters grant which is \nfunded through the Department of Homeland Security. This is a very \nrural fire district. They only have one paid employee--it happens to be \nthe fire chief--along with a volunteer firefighting force of 16 and a \nvolunteer EMT force of 6.\n  They have applied for a very small $24,000 Federal grant to replace \ntheir heavily used and outdated equipment--everything from boots and \nhelmets to gloves and fire hoods--that are now over 11 years old. I \nhave been working with them to help them get that needed equipment \nwhich protects those volunteers who put their lives on the line to save \nothers, but if Congress does not fund this department those grants are \nat risk. That is unacceptable. It is proof this political mess the \nRepublicans have made is not a hypothetical problem. It is something \nthat will have real impacts on every one of our communities across the \ncountry.\n  My colleagues are not going to give in and let the Republicans play \npolitics with the Department of Homeland Security. For years now we \nhave seen that strategy doesn't work. It holds us back. I am encouraged \nthe majority leader has said they are willing to bring up a clean \nDepartment of Homeland Security appropriations bill to the floor. We \nneed the same commitment from the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives. Time is running out. The country is waiting. We need \nto fund Homeland Security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, a number of things have been happening \ntoday with regard to the funding for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. There has been a lot of spin that somehow the Republicans are \nblocking the funding of the Department of Homeland Security. This gives \nnew meaning to the word obfuscation, I suppose, or disingenuousness.\n  The truth is the House of Representatives has fully funded the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. It has provided the level of funding \nthe President asked for. It has kept all accounts in Homeland Security \nas approved through the congressional process. It simply says: Mr. \nPresident, we considered your bill--this amnesty bill--that would \nprovide work permits, photo IDs, Social Security numbers, Medicare \nbenefits, and Social Security benefits, and you can't do that. We \nconsider that and reject it. So we are not going to fund that.\n  Now, the President has already told us and the staff they have across \nthe river in Crystal City where they are leasing a new building, and \nthis building is going to house 1,000 workers paid for by the taxpayers \nof the United States as part of Homeland Security. Are those 1,000 \nworkers going to be utilized to enforce the laws of the United States? \nAre they going to process applications for citizenship or visas? No, \nthose 1,000 people--costing several hundred million dollars, in truth--\nare going to be processing and providing these benefits to people \nunlawfully in America.\n  So Congress said: Wait a minute. We didn't authorize money for that. \nYou can't spend money to fund exactly the opposite of what we have \nenacted. So we are just going to put some language in the bill--the \nnormal bill that funds Homeland Security--and say you can't spend the \nmoney to violate the law. You can only spend the money to enforce the \nlaw, as it was created to do.\n  The bill then comes to the Senate; and what spectacle do we have? We \nhave Democratic Members in lockstep unity blocking even proceeding to \nthis bill, contending we are not funding Homeland Security. Can you \nimagine that?\n  Now, my colleague, the senior Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, the \nDemocratic whip, came down a couple of weeks ago and said: I am trying \nto figure out what is blocking this bill. So I took the floor and I \nsaid: Senator Durbin, you and your filibusterers are filibustering the \nbill. That is why it is not being passed.\n  Does anybody want to dispute that? The Republican Senate has \nrepeatedly brought up this bill and filed cloture to move to the bill \nso we can fund Homeland Security, and the Democrats are relentlessly \nand unanimously filibustering it, blocking even moving to the bill. \nAlthough Senator McConnell said if we did move to the bill, he would \nallow them to have amendments. So this is the situation we are in.\n  Colleagues, this goes to the core of our constitutional principles \nabout who controls the money in America. Congress is a coequal branch. \nIt is not subordinate to the President. If anything, the legislative \nbranch, through the Constitution, provides maybe even more power to \nCongress than it does to the Executive and more than it provides the \ncourts. And the most powerful power of Congress is the power of the \npurse.\n  Congress is not obligated to pay for anything it believes is unwise, \nand it has an absolute duty not to fund anything that is \nunconstitutional or illegal, which is what we are dealing with here. So \nCongress--the House of Representatives--acted wisely and properly in \nfunding Homeland Security and not allowing activities to be carried out \nthat are unlawful and that Congress has rejected.\n  This is so fundamental, so basic. How my colleagues have the gall to \ncome to the floor and have a press conference this afternoon and blame \nRepublicans for shutting down Homeland Security is beyond me. I don't \nbelieve the American people are buying it.\n  Now, there are some, even on the Republican side, who say: Oh gosh, \nthe President will blame us even if it is not our fault. So we might as \nwell cave in and give him what he wants. But what he wants is something \nhe can't be given. What he wants is for Congress to capitulate and \nerode its powers and responsibility. He wants Congress to violate its \nduty to fund something that is illegal and contrary to Congress's \nwishes. He can't demand that. He has no right to demand that.\n  Congress cannot fund--cannot and must not fund--an illegal action in \nhopes that another branch of government will intervene. Now, I say that \nbecause some have said: Well, a court in Texas has ruled that a part of \nthis action by the President is unlawful. The court was narrow in its \ndecision. It fundamentally said something similar to: It looks like a \nregulation to me, and if you are going to pass a regulation, you need \nto go through a process. And the President didn't go through a process. \nIt is not lawful. It is not legal. You can't enforce it. The judge \nissued an injunction barring the President from carrying out these \nplans, he announced, which is plain law, it seems to me. They didn't \neven go into some of the other ideas of the constitutionality and \nseparation of powers. He just blocked it on that basis.\n\n  So we are hearing it said that we can fully fund Homeland Security \nwithout any restrictions, allowing the President to do this, because \nthe courts stopped it. I think that is unwise for a number of reasons. \nThe first one is we don't know what the courts are going to do. This \nCongress has a duty to fund only things it believes are appropriate and \nlawful. So Congress shouldn't fund it on that basis, period. We should \nstand up for Congresses in years to come--for our children and \ngrandchildren and great-grandchildren--and defend the power of the \npurse and defend the integrity of this Congress.\n  We know how this country was founded. It was founded on an \nunderstanding of the British Parliament, and the British Parliament \nwrested from the king the power of taxes and money. That was a huge \nhistorical development, and it has been part of our tradition since, \nthat Congress has the power of the purse. The Executive can't do it. So \nwe replaced the king with the President, and we adhered in our \nConstitution to that great tradition of restraint on the Executive by \nthe legislative branch--by the Congress, by the Senate.\n  In the Texas court's injunction, let me go further and note the \nreasons why I think it is unwise for Congress to say that we, the \nSenate, have no duty to speak on this issue. The House has already \nspoken and said we are not going to fund this. But the Senate needs to \nask what its position will be.\n  I would point out that the Texas court's injunction addresses only a \npart of Obama's lawless actions and could be lifted at any time. So the \ninjunction could be lifted at any time. It only covers a part of his \nactions. If Congress relinquishes the power of the purse, then nothing \nwill be able to prevent the lawlessness or amnesty from going forward.\n  As the Texas court noted in issuing its injunction, ``This genie \nwould be impossible to put back in the bottle.''\n  That is absolutely true. He is evaluating whether to issue an \ninjunction.\n\n[[Page S1049]]\n\nSometimes you don't have to issue an injunction because there is not \nanything much happening right then. But he says, correctly, that: If \nthis goes forward and millions of people are given amnesty, you can't \nput that genie back in the bottle in any practical sense. It would be a \nnightmare to try to do that.\n  Let me point this out:\n  One, the Texas court's injunction only addresses a small part of the \nPresident's recent Executive actions in November.\n  The Texas lawsuit challenges only the President's November 20 \nunconstitutional Executive action. And of that, the injunction prevents \nthe administration from implementing only deferred action for parents \nof Americans and lawful permanent residents.\n  The Texas court injunction does not address the problematic \nenforcement priorities encompassed in the President's Executive \nactions.\n  He set all kinds of priorities that Congress disapproves of and that \nare bad--unless you don't want the laws enforced, in which case it is \ngood. And we have some who believe in open borders in this country. \nThey deny it when challenged, but they vote that way every time.\n  On November 20, 2014, the memo revised the administration's \nenforcement priorities which do not encompass certain criminal aliens \nnor do they encompass all aliens deemed to be subject to mandatory \ncustody under the Immigration and Nationality Act. In fact, these new \npriorities effectively gut the enforcement of our immigration laws for \nall but a few select criminal aliens.\n  Congress passed the law that requires the deportation of persons \ninvolved in criminal activities and convicted of those activities. The \nPresident eviscerated large portions of that in this order, and he \nshould not be allowed to do so. The judge did not address it.\n  Indeed, in response to the ruling, Secretary Johnson stated that the \nTexas court's order does not ``affect this Department's ability to set \nand implement enforcement priorities.''\n  Well, that is a big deal. They set priorities that violate statutory \nlaw, and they should not be allowed to do that. We can't effectively \neviscerate law by prosecutorial guidelines.\n  According to a February 18, 2015 email from Customs and Border \nProtection Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske regarding the injunction, he \nsaid:\n\n       Officers and agents should continue to process individuals \n     consistent with the enforcement priorities announced by the \n     Secretary in his memorandum of November 20, 2014, titled \n     Policies for the Apprehension, Detention and Removal of \n     Undocumented Immigrants.\n\n  It deals in large part with criminal activities, people convicted of \ncrimes who are supposed to be deported.\n  The funding bill the House passed would do much more to stop \nPresident Obama's unlawful Executive actions on immigration, so the \nadministration does not intend to change its course as it is still \nactively preparing for its rollout of Executive amnesty.\n  On February 17, just a few days ago, the President told reporters \nthat the administration is still ``doing the preparatory work because \nthis is a big piece of business.'' He said:\n\n       The Department of Homeland Security will continue in the \n     planning because we want to make sure as soon as these legal \n     issues get resolved, which I anticipate they will in our \n     favor, that we are ready to go.\n\n  So he is telling the Department of Homeland Security to spend money \nnow to be ready to move forward and immediately process his Executive \namnesty--providing Social Security numbers, photo IDs, Medicare and \nSocial Security benefits for people here unlawfully. He says go ahead \nand do it.\n  The Texas court injunction is only temporary and could be set aside \nat any time. The administration has already filed for a stay of the \ninjunction in the district court and has announced its intention to \nappeal.\n  Indeed, as I just read, the President said he expects to win. I don't \nthink he will, but it is a technical part of the ruling. The judge \nstill has many more that he could deal with that could overrule the \nPresident's action. He just chose one of them, and that one is rather \ntechnical. So who knows for sure what a court might rule.\n  In addition, the ruling does not address the substance of the case. \nIt will take many months to resolve this litigation, and during that \ntime there is a reasonable chance that some court will lift the stay \nand allow the President to begin implementing the amnesty pending a \nfinal ruling on the merits of the case. But Congress can stop it and \nhas a duty to stop it in its appropriations bill.\n  In addition, Democrats refused to fund the lawful functions of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. And this is important: The House-\npassed Department of Homeland Security funding bill funds all of the \nlawful, statutorily authorized functions of the Department, including \nthe immigration law enforcement component of the agencies that, under \nthe Obama administration, has been prevented from enforcing the laws.\n  Colleagues, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers--now, I \nguess, 2 years ago--filed a lawsuit against their own supervisors \ndeclaring that they were being forced to violate their oath to enforce \nthe laws of the United States.\n  I have never seen that. It is so bad that the ICE officers have filed \na lawsuit to stop the administration from ordering them to violate \nplain law.\n  Let me note that the President has already shut down the Department \nby ordering immigration officers and agents to violate the laws and \nsabotaging enforcement in a number of ways. These are direct orders of \nthis administration, dismantling systemic enforcement of our laws.\n  So I think the Senate Democrats and the President must answer why \nthey believe funding Executive amnesty and unlawful immigration \npolicies would make this country safer.\n  They say: Well, you won't pass a Homeland Security bill like we want \nit. You are not making America safe.\n  I say their policies eviscerating law enforcement are making America \nless safe, as the Immigration and Customs agents do, the ones who \nprocess the applicants.\n  Ken Palinkas, the President of the National Citizenship and \nImmigration Services Council, has written that: This amnesty executed \nby the President will make us less safe.\n  His amnesty makes us less safe. Passing a bill that stops his amnesty \nwill make us more safe. As a matter of fact, he said that more than one \ntime--a number of times. He is very concerned, as his officers are, \nthat if they carry out these policies, the American people are going to \nbe less safe. In fact, they have said explicitly there is no way they \ncan carry out in any effective manner the unlawful orders of the \nPresident of the United States.\n  Is anybody listening to the people who do the work every day? Does \nanybody care what they think? Apparently not.\n  So they are going to come to the floor and accuse Republicans in the \nHouse and on this side of the aisle of not making America safe when \ntheir own officers say the President's policies are making America less \nsafe.\n  They say there is no way they can effectively process the individuals \nthey are asked to process. They can't process the numbers today, much \nless what will happen under this bill when they have to process another \n5 million. It is just a very unwise thing.\n  So what did the courts say? I think this is an important quote from \nthe Texas court. A Federal court found that the President had \noverstepped his bounds. That is what the court fundamentally declared, \nstating:\n\n       It is Congress, and Congress alone, who has the power under \n     the Constitution to legislate in the field of immigration.\n\n  That is absolutely true. It is in the Constitution. As he said:\n\n       It is Congress, and Congress alone, who has the power under \n     the Constitution to legislate in the field of immigration.\n\n  So after the President issued his order and his Department issued \norders of amnesty on November 20, 2014, the President, amazingly, said \nthis: ``I just took an action to change the law.'' Don't we know from \nelementary school that Congress passes the law? The President doesn't \npass the law. He said 22 times that he didn't have the power to do \nthis, but now he has moved forward and admitted he is changing the law.\n\n  Well, some of our colleagues think: Oh, if we resist this, the \nPresident is going to accuse us of not funding Homeland Security, not \nprotecting the Republic.\n\n[[Page S1050]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. But I don't think that is so.\n  They say: Well, the press is unfair.\n  Well, not always. I think sometimes we Republicans are right to \ncomplain but not always.\n  This is what the headlines are today. The headlines aren't saying \nRepublicans are blocking the bill.\n  Politico: ``Democrats filibuster Department of Homeland Security \nbill.''\n  The Hill: ``Shutdown looms as Dems block DHS bill.''\n  McClatchy: ``Filibuster continues as Senate Dems block DHS funding \nbill.''\n  CNN: ``Senate Dems block Homeland Security funding bill again.''\n  Washington Post: ``Senate Democrats block DHS spending bill targeting \nObama's immigration actions.''\n  Associated Press: ``Dems Block Action on DHS-Immigration Bill.''\n  New York Times: ``Senate Democrats Block Vote on Homeland Security \nBill.''\n  Politico: ``Dems filibuster DHS bill.''\n  Well, that is absolutely true. We are bringing the bill to the floor. \nWe are not blocking it. We want to fully fund Homeland Security. We \nwant the laws enforced. We don't want to spend money from Homeland \nSecurity to eviscerate the law of the United States and undermine \nimmigration law in America, and we don't want to fund an unlawful \naction by the President.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Keystone Pipeline\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the President's \nveto of legislation that would have rubberstamped the construction of \nthe Keystone Pipeline. This legislation allowed a circumvention of \nFederal review processes and allowed corporations not to adhere to \nvarious environmental safety standards that are important for the \nAmerican people. So I am glad the President is vetoing this \nlegislation.\n  The rules for siting cross-border pipelines are well established, and \ntime and time again TransCanada has shown that it doesn't want to play \nby the rules. So with this veto by the President of the United States, \nhe is clearly saying TransCanada must play by the rules.\n  The President's veto recognizes three important implications for \nCongress in the intervening and trying to pass this Keystone Pipeline \nprocess.\n  First, this bill was premature because it authorized the construction \nof the pipeline while legal and administrative processes were still \nongoing in Nebraska and North and South Dakota and where landowners and \ntribes are seeking review in the courts and before regulatory bodies.\n  The legislation also eliminates the need for a national interest \ndetermination, which is associated with the process of the pipeline, \nwhich was a key authority for the U.S. Government to insist on safety \nand environmental regulations. It is a process that should have allowed \nthe State Department and the President to insist on pipeline safety \nconditions.\n  Finally, this legislation did not address the loophole for tar sands \noil companies to avoid paying for oilspill cleanups.\n  By vetoing this bill, the President refused to throw hundreds of \nconditions out the window. These are things from 59 different pipeline \nsafety conditions that would have been legally binding--but not if the \nlegislation had passed.\n  My colleagues also remember that we talked about work--that we now \nhave concerns on the existing Keystone Pipeline. So I am glad the \nPresident of the United States vetoed this legislation.\n  I hope we will get on to working on other important energy \nopportunities. I hope my colleagues will not try to override this veto \nbut instead focus on renewing the energy tax credits that help employ \nhundreds of thousands of people in various industries--anything from \nsolar, to wind, to hybrid electric vehicles--and get on to the other \nissues that are so important for us in talking about a 21st-century \nenergy strategy.\n  Again, I am glad the President of the United States has vetoed this \nlegislation that would have been a rubberstamp by Congress for a \nspecial interest. Instead, let's make sure all environmental and safety \nconditions are met.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the role.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, one of the measures that took place in \nthis Executive amnesty that has been too little commented upon since \nthe President signed these orders in November is another program which \nhas not been authorized by law which would add several hundred thousand \nnew workers to our country.\n  This is the headline from an article today: ``DHS Extends Eligibility \nfor Employment Authorization to Certain H-4 Dependent Spouses of H-1B \nNonimmigrants Seeking Employment-Based Lawful Permanent Residence.''\n  The H-1B program was set up for certain individuals to come and work \nfor 3 years and then extend maybe another 3 years only, to take a job \nin those industries and fields where there is a shortage of workers, \nand it does allow the spouses to come. But since its beginning it has \nbarred spouses from working; otherwise we would be doubling the number \nof workers. So this bill now just up and approves spouses of H-1B \nworkers to work.\n  The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, USCIS, estimates that \n``the number of individuals eligible to apply for employment \nauthorization under this rule could be as high as 179,600 in the first \nyear and 55,000 annually in subsequent years.'' This is a very large \naddition to the workforce.\n  One might say: Well, it is good that spouses can work.\n  Well, what if your child wants a job? What if you want a job? What if \nyour spouse wants a job and is looking for a job? Now we will have \nanother 250,000 job applicants, contrary to law.\n  There are many other aspects of the President's Executive order that \nhave not been given attention. I think this one is worth commenting \nabout.\n  There has been no sense at all by President Obama, the Department of \nHomeland Security, Jeh Johnson, the Democratic Members of this \nCongress--no concern about the employment prospects of lawful \nimmigrants, green card holders, and native-born Americans. We have high \nunemployment and the lowest percentage of Americans in the working age \ngroup actually holding jobs in America that we have had since 1970. \nWages are down. Professor Borjas at Harvard documents that excessive \nimmigration pulls down wages. Since 2007 wages of median-income \nfamilies are down $4,000.\n  I would say to colleagues that the first thing we should do is focus \non getting jobs for Americans who are unemployed. Are we going to keep \nAmericans on welfare and benefits while we bring in more and more \nforeigners to take jobs when we have Americans ready and willing to \ntake those jobs?\n  They like to suggest these guest workers are doing farm work. They \nare not. The overwhelming majority of guest workers admitted to the \nU.S. are not farm workers, but are taking jobs throughout the economy. \nA farm worker program, with temporary labor, if properly managed, is a \ngood program. I do not oppose that. People come and work for a period \nof time, and if they return home and come back the next season and make \nenough money to take care of their families maybe for the whole year, \nthat can work if properly managed. But look at this. The H-1Bs are \npeople with high-tech degrees, high-tech skills. They are competing \nagainst college graduates who have computer skills and other skills.\n  This is what we get. This is how it is working in this country. A \nbunch of companies got together and they signed a letter to Speaker \nBoehner and Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House, asking \nfor immigration reform back in September 2013. They said they needed \nmore H-1B workers, and they pushed for that.\n\n[[Page S1051]]\n\n  I would just note this: Byron York from the Washington Examiner has \nwritten about this, and this is what the facts are. They are not hiring \npeople. They don't have a shortage of workers. They are laying off \nworkers in very large numbers. Hewlett-Packard had 29,000 job cuts in \n2012--29,000. They signed the letter. Cisco Systems eliminated 4,000 \njobs in August 2013 in addition to 8,000 cut in the last 2 years. They \nsigned the letter asking for more H-1B workers. United Technologies cut \n3,000 jobs in 2013; American Express, 5,400 jobs in 2013; Procter & \nGamble, 5,700 jobs in 2012; and T-Mobile, 2,250 layoffs in 2012. These \nare companies that are asking for more foreign workers.\n  This is another report that was in the Los Angeles Times just a few \ndays ago: ``A loophole in immigration law is costing thousands of \nAmerican jobs.''\n\n       Since last summer, [Southern California] Edison--\n\n  The biggest utility company in California--\n\n     which serves nearly 14 million customers, has been firing its \n     domestic IT workers and replacing them with outsourced \n     employees from India. . . . The pay for Edison's domestic IT \n     specialists is about $80,000 to $160,000 not including \n     benefits.\n\n  Good pay.\n\n       The two Indian outsourcing firms providing workers to \n     Edison, Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys, pay their \n     recruits an average of about $65,000 to $71,000, according to \n     federal filings.\n\n  They are laying off hundreds and requiring the California Edison \nemployees to train the H-1B workers who shouldn't be coming into \nAmerica unless there is a job need that is unfilled. How can you say we \ndon't have qualified people? They are doing the job, and they are \nexpected to train them. This is the kind of thing that is out of \ncontrol. Somebody needs to defend the legitimate interests of middle \nAmerica.\n\n  We need to ask ourselves: Does this make sense? Should the President \nbe doubling up on it with his Executive amnesty that would add 179,600 \nnew workers in the first year of his order and 55,000 more annually on \ntop of the H-1B flow? We have legislation that has moved in this Senate \nthat would more than double the number of H-1B workers coming into the \ncountry when the evidence indicates they are not needed. It might make \nbusinesses happy; they can pay half the salary of what they would \notherwise be paying. But it would not be good for Americans who \ninvested in education, trained themselves, worked themselves into a \ngood job, and have it pulled out from under them.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish I could rise today to talk about \nthe underlying legislation we are supposed to be talking about, which \nis a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security, and also address \nthe President's Executive order on immigration, which went around the \nCongress but also went around the American people.\n  A judge in Texas agrees with those of us on this side of the aisle \nwho look at this as an illegal act. Instead, the President ought to \nwork with us. The President should work with the House and the Senate \nand the elected representatives of the American people to actually pass \na law to help fix what is broken in our immigration system.\n  We are not able to get on that legislation, and it is not because we \nhave differences about the bill that we could talk about. We could have \nvotes on amendments and debate this issue, but there are those on the \nother side of the aisle who have decided they don't even want us to \nhave the opportunity to hash out those differences so we can vote. I \nthink the constituents I represent in Ohio expect us to have that \ndebate, and they want us to have that debate. I hope those on the other \nside of the aisle will let us have that debate, and we could have a \ngood, honest discussion about this and address both of these problems--\nthe need to fund the Department and also the need to address this \nExecutive order. I think it is another example where Washington has let \ndown the people I represent.\n  In the meantime, this is no time for political games. It is a \ndangerous world. We have a real problem, not just here at home in \nprotecting the homeland, but also with fires burning all around the \nworld. It is time we showed some leadership both here in this Chamber \nand down the street at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It is time for \nPresidential leadership.\n  If you turn on the TV tonight, what you will see is those fires \nburning. You will see a world more dangerous than the one we had after \n9/11. You will see threats to the United States and our allies that \nseem to grow with every passing day. But even as these threats grow, it \nseems as though our President is increasingly hesitant to lead.\n  Iran, despite the platitudes of the Obama administration, which seems \nreally eager to find an agreement and make a deal, continues its march \ntoward developing nuclear weapons.\n  ISIS, the group the President once described as the JV team when they \nwere in Iraq flying the black flag of Islam extremism over cities such \nas Fallujah and Mosul, cities where American marines gave their lives \nto liberate--the President called them the JV team.\n  Russian soldiers now move freely through eastern Ukraine, and the \nseparatists there are using Russian equipment, they are trained by the \nRussian military, led by Russian special forces, and they continue to \nwage war on an American ally, Ukraine. While we all hoped the recent \ncease-fire would hold, all indications are that Russia and its proxies \nare taking advantage of that cease-fire in Ukraine to continue their \naggression.\n  Across Europe--in France, Denmark, and Belgian--innocent people have \nbeen murdered. Some were murdered for opposing terrorists aims, and \nsome for the simple fact they are Jewish. These attacks are not random, \nas has been suggested by the administration. Unfortunately, they are \ndesigned to incite fear and weaken our resolve to oppose Islamic \nterrorism wherever we find it.\n  We must not allow them to succeed any more than we must stand silent \nin the face of Iranian threats and Russian aggression. What we must do \nis take a long, hard look at how we got here and what we must do going \nforward to change the situation.\n  In my view, a lot of the chaos we are seeing across the globe stems \nfrom a lack of leadership. Into that void, chaos ensues. The defining \nthemes in the Obama administration's approach to foreign policy have \nbeen a preference for disengagement and an unwillingness to shoulder \nthe responsibility of global leadership the way previous Presidents--\nDemocrat and Republican alike--have done. As the administration itself \nhas said, they prefer to lead from behind.\n  The President has said that ``the trajectory of this planet overall \nis one toward less violence, more tolerance.'' I don't know about that. \nI don't think history moves inexorably toward more justice and more \npeace. These trajectories don't just happen, people make them happen. \nLeadership is the key.\n  When America is strong, when we stand unequivocally for freedom and \njustice and the right of all people to choose their own destiny, when \nwe do not back down in the face of threats and intimidation, that is \nwhen we see a world that is more stable, less dangerous, and more free.\n  More wars, more conflicts, more threats to our security--these don't \ntypically arise from American strength. They arise from American \nweakness. When we look around the world--whether it is in Gaza or \nEastern Europe or Iraq or Iran or Syria, the increase in violence and \ninstability has coincided with the growing perception that the United \nStates of America is either unwilling or unable to take a stand against \nthreats to international security and stability. Addressing these \ncomplex challenges--and many of them are very complex--requires a \nsustained and proactive American leadership role and American \nengagement. It requires strategies that seek to shape outcomes, not be \nshaped by them.\n  There is a lot at stake. Events in Ukraine, the Middle East, and \nelsewhere are a direct challenge to the United States-led international \norder, which has led to unprecedented global prosperity and stability \nfor both the United States and for the world. Confidence in America's \nwillingness to use our unmatched economic, political, and military \ncapabilities to uphold our system deters potential challengers and \nincentivizes other countries to\n\n[[Page S1052]]\n\nplay by the rules, which reduces the chances of war. If the credibility \nof this commitment is in doubt, then the stability and openness upon \nwhich U.S. economic prosperity and national security depend is \njeopardized and the chance for violence, instability, and economic \ncollapse increases. The world is watching. They are watching to see \nwhether this American-led order can withstand these challenges or if we \nreally are entering into a period of the post-American world.\n  In Ukraine, the administration's response has been incomplete, \nreactionary, and ineffective. There are many political and economic \ndimensions of this conflict, and Ukraine needs Western support to \nimplement crucial reforms in these areas. But there is also a military \ndimension to this crisis that we cannot continue to ignore. Sanctions \nalone have not worked. The so-called cease-fire agreements have not \nworked. As President Obama, Angela Merkel, and Francois Hollande debate \nand discuss cease-fires and timelines, Russia is deciding the outcome \non the ground in eastern Ukraine this afternoon as we talk. Unless we \nhelp provide Ukraine with the tools they need to prevent that from \nhappening, any future agreements will only solidify this reality. Let's \nallow them to defend themselves. Russia continues to believe that \nmilitary force is a viable option to achieve its goals, and unless the \nUnited States and its European allies and NATO help the Ukrainians \nprove otherwise, this behavior is unlikely to change.\n  It is well known by now that the President has refused to adopt \npolicies that actually provide Ukraine with the capabilities it needs. \nA bipartisan coalition, on the other hand, has emerged here in Congress \non the need to do more, and we will continue to advocate for a change \nin course and pursuit of a proactive, comprehensive strategy that \nactually works.\n  In the Middle East, proactive American leadership requires upholding \nour commitment to stand unequivocally with Israel. No other nation in \nthe world would be expected to put up with tunnels into their cities \nwith rockets raining down on people's homes. The press got it wrong \nlast year, and with all due respect, I believe the President got it \nwrong too. There is no moral equivalence in Gaza.\n  I have made a few trips to Israel. I met with their people. I have \nwalked the streets of Sderot and have seen the remains of missiles that \nwere targeted against innocents with hatred and an intent to kill and \nmaim. I have been out to the bomb shelters and the indoor fortified \nplaygrounds built so children can have a chance to play without fear. I \nhave spent time with an Iron Dome battery crew outside Ashkelon. I can \ntell you this: From what I have learned, the people of Israel want \npeace.\n  Unfortunately, we know the biggest winner from this administration's \nwavering support of Israel is Iran. Iran continues to stall on \nnegotiations meant to end their nuclear weapons program. They continue \nto ask for more time, and the administration continues to grant it. \nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is coming to the United \nStates next week to speak of the threat that Iran poses not only to \nIsrael but to the world, and the President seems to be too busy to meet \nwith him. Truly, the world has turned upside down.\n  A key test of U.S. leadership is ensuring that Iran does not retain \nnuclear capability in their continued march toward weaponization. If it \nwere in my power, I would put the Kirk-Menendez Iran sanctions bill--of \nwhich I am an original cosponsor--here on the floor on the Senate \ntoday, and, by the way, it would pass. I believe it would pass with \nover 60 votes because Republicans and Democrats alike recognize that \nIran will not negotiate in good faith unless the United States is \nunequivocal in our commitment to ending the nuclear threat Iran poses.\n  You will recall that this legislation does not impose new sanctions \nthat would be imposed now. These sanctions would be imposed if the \nIranians do not agree to halt their nuclear weapons program as \nrequired, by the way, by the United Nations. These are leveraged for \nthe White House, and the White House should use that leverage.\n  American leadership is needed for a more stable and peaceful world. I \nbelieve the future does not belong to bigotry and hate, but to freedom-\nloving people of the world, and the United States of America must lead \nthe way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the funding \nfor the Department of Homeland Security and the continuing need for \nimmigration reform.\n  We need to fund the Department of Homeland Security and we should \npass a clean DHS funding bill. That is the only bill that can pass the \nSenate, and that is the only bill that should pass the Senate. Once \nthat bill has passed the Senate and the House and becomes law, then we \ncan and should move on to consider immigration legislation.\n  Republican leadership in the Senate has wasted a lot of time over the \npast month politicizing immigration and mixing it up with the issue of \nfunding this Federal agency that helps to protect the United States \nfrom terrorists and other threats, and those threats are real. Just \nthis past weekend, the terrorist organization al-Shabaab issued a \nthreatening video suggesting that the Mall of America in my State of \nMinnesota could be a target for a terrorist attack.\n  Look, this issue is not something we should be politicizing. We \nshould enact into law a clean funding bill for DHS, and we should fund \nthe Department for the whole year and not make the Department run for a \nshort time on a continuing resolution and just revisit the issue in the \nnear future. That is not what we want. And then we should and can \ndebate immigration.\n  I have always believed the best way to accomplish meaningful and \nsustainable immigration reform is through congressional action. In the \nlast Congress, the Senate took such action. As a member of the \nJudiciary Committee, I was very proud to play an active role in the \ncomprehensive immigration bill the Senate passed with broad bipartisan \nsupport. For me, this was a model of how the Senate was supposed to \nwork. Four Senators from each side of the aisle, known as the Gang of \n8, came together and crafted a bill which we then marked up in the \nJudiciary Committee, and I was very pleased that a number of my \namendments were included in the bill, which then went to the Senate \nfloor and passed with 68 votes. That bill would have provided a real \nand comprehensive overhaul of our broken immigration system.\n  It would have significantly strengthened our border security, and it \nwould have helped a lot of people--from small businesses to families in \nour legal immigration system to the many undocumented immigrants who \nwould have an opportunity, through a tough but fair path, to get right \nwith the law. There are millions of people in our country who want the \nsame things that all of us want--a steady job, excellent education for \nour children, and a brighter future for their families. But they are \nliving in limbo and often in fear. Our bill would help them come out of \nthe shadows and get right with the law.\n  The Senate passed our bill in June of 2013. I was very hopeful the \nHouse would take up and pass the Senate bill. If the House had allowed \na vote on the Senate bill, it would have passed the House and been \nenacted into law. That would have meant real and lasting reform to our \nbroken immigration system. Unfortunately, over the course of the next \nyear and a half the Republican leadership in the House failed to act on \nthe bipartisan immigration reform bill passed in the Senate--again, \nwith 68 votes. The President took a step forward that will help a lot \nof people and will help to address fixing our broken immigration \nsystem.\n  While I still believe Congress needs to act, I think we need to keep \nthe Executive actions in place until we do. I will not support any \nlegislative effort to undo President Obama's Executive actions. We are \npresented with a choice. Once we pass a bill into law to fund the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, we can take a step forward and help a \nlot more people by passing comprehensive immigration reform or we can \ntake a step backward and harm a lot of people without getting any \ncloser to the comprehensive immigration reform we need.\n\n[[Page S1053]]\n\n  I will vote to move forward, not backward. We need a fully funded \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and we need a comprehensively \noverhauled immigration system.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Childhood Poverty\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is a privilege to be here with my \ncolleague from Colorado.\n  I rise to talk about our schools and really to talk about our values \nand our morality--what we stand for as a country--and to ask whether we \nare able to look forward and create a better future for our children.\n  To set the record straight, let me be clear. When it comes to our \nchildren, I have fallen short, you have fallen short, and this body has \nfallen short. Let me explain why.\n  We have learned in the last couple of weeks that over half of the \npublic school children in this country are now poor enough that they \nqualify for free or reduced lunches at school--children who, through no \nfault of their own, are reaping the whirlwind of 15 years of stagnant \nmiddle-class family income and the effects of the worst recession since \nthe Great Depression.\n  By many measures, as the Presiding Officer knows, Colorado's economy \nleads the Nation. But even in our home State, we see more children \nliving in poverty. In fact, the number of children in poverty is \ngrowing faster in Colorado than in most of the other 50 States.\n  As a country and as a State, we are making a lot of progress in a \nnumber of dimensions, but we are headed in the wrong direction when it \ncomes to our kids. That is a bad sign for any country but particularly \nfor a democracy that aspires to be the land of opportunity.\n  A girl in poverty in the United States is five times more likely to \nbe a young single mother than a child from a middle-class family, and a \nboy in poverty is twice as likely to be incarcerated as his middle-\nclass peers. Children from low-income families in this country are \nabout three times less likely to graduate from high school. Someone \nfrom a family in poverty stands only a 9-in-100 chance of earning a \ncollege degree. Think about that. There are 100 seats in this Chamber. \nThere are 100 desks in this Chamber. If they represented children \nliving in poverty in the United States, that desk, that desk, that \ndesk, those three desks, and three of those desks would represent \ncollege graduates. The entire rest of this Chamber would be people that \nwould never earn a college degree or its equivalent and who would be \nconstrained to the margins of our economy and our democracy as a result \nafter that.\n\n  Interestingly enough, the equivalent number for children in the top \nquarter of income earners is almost 80 out of 100. So 80 of these desks \nfrom a more affluent family--80 of these desks would represent a person \nwho graduated with a college degree or its equivalent, and 20 would \nrepresent people that had fallen short, but nine poor children would \nhave a college degree. In other words, in a way that is profoundly at \nwar with our founding ideals, poverty breeds deeper poverty, lack of \neducational achievement reaps deeper academic failure, and broken \nfamilies are the surest predictor of more broken families in the next \ngeneration and the generations beyond that. This is a sentence of \nunequal opportunity for all poor Americans, no matter the color of \ntheir skin. It is a generational sentence for 7 out of 10 children who \nwill remain at the bottom of the income scale their entire lives.\n  Are there people who defy these odds? Of course there are. As \nsuperintendent of the Denver public schools and in this job, I have met \nscores of children who have overcome the odds--sometimes alone--but \noften also with the help of a parent who wouldn't quit, a teacher who \nwouldn't take ``no'' for an answer, a former gang member whose sworn \nduty is to keep young people out of gangs, a philanthropist who \ninsisted that Denver's kids would go to college. In these exceptional \nchildren I have seen the indomitable nature of the human spirit \npersevere against all odds and have recognized how little I and most of \nus have achieved by comparison.\n  I have met kids who take three buses both ways to school leaving as \nearly as 5:30 in the morning just to have the benefit of a better \nschool all the way on the other side of town, kids who can't get up in \nthe morning because they have to work until 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock at \nnight in a fast food restaurant to help pay the rent, kids who pour \ntheir heart and soul out into their studies and communities only to \nlearn that college is not for them because of an immigration status \nthey did not even know that they had.\n  I met kids who were the primary caregivers of younger brothers and \nsisters who are taking care of ailing parents and grandparents, who \nhave made it to college for the first time in their family's history \nwho are that 9 in 100, who represent the best of our human spirit. They \nare our heroes.\n  As one of our Denver public school students, Chaunsea Dyson from \nSouth High School, recently told a radio reporter, ``When you are \ngrowing up in poverty, when you are 15 or 16 that means you are \ngrown.''\n  That means you are grown.\n  As the father of three girls who are 15, 14, and 10, I would say that \nis an awful lot to expect of a 16-year-old, especially one coming from \ncircumstances few in this Chamber could overcome. My point is that \nwhile there are many heroic people in our schools--kids, teachers, \nprincipals--succeeding in our school system today, heroism is not a \nstandard we tend to count on for the success of human enterprise. We \nsimply can't scale heroism. I wish we could--but we can't--to address \nthe scope of our achievement gap. It is too much to ask, and it is not \nfair to our kids who have no control over the circumstances of their \nbirth.\n  I don't think there is one Member in this Chamber who could come and \nsay that is not true, that a child could control somehow the \ncircumstances of his or her birth, because one of the enduring truths \nof being a human being is that we don't get to choose our parents. We \ndon't choose to be born into a home of wealth or poverty, a home that \nvalues books or learning or a home which for whatever reason does not. \nThat is a matter of good and bad luck. Yet those circumstances beyond \nour children's control--absolutely beyond their control--today almost \nalways determine educational outcomes in the United States of America.\n  So the question is, What is our obligation? What is our obligation as \na nation to remedy the burden of bad luck for millions of American \nchildren?\n  I believe at a minimum it means we have a moral duty to assure that \nour less lucky children have educational opportunities that let them \nmake the most of their God-given potential. That is certainly what I \nwould want for my own daughters. If we are honest, then by any \nreckoning we are failing to meet this moral duty and I would say \nfailing very badly. If we ask ourselves why we are failing to do our \nduty--how can this be--in my mind it comes down to a sad and simple \nreality: We are treating America's children as if they were someone \nelse's children rather than our own.\n  To demonstrate this let's consider what conditions we have allowed to \nexist for a child born, through no fault of her own, into poverty in \nthe United States of America in the year 2015. We know that by the age \nof 4 she will have heard 30 million fewer words than her more affluent \npeers--30 million. Ask any elementary schoolteacher in the country \nwhether that will make a difference in how prepared she is for \nkindergarten. Fewer than half of poor children start school with the \nskills they need to be ready to succeed in kindergarten. Every \nelementary schoolteacher in America knows that. What are the odds her \nneighborhood school will meet her needs? How about a school 1 mile \naway? How about a school 5 miles away? It is not likely in many \nAmerican cities and rural communities.\n  When she reaches the fourth grade her odds are no better. She is 9 \nyears old and there are 30 children in her classroom. On average, 24 of \nher classmates cannot read at grade level--24 out of 30. Her chances of \nbeing a proficient reader--20 percent--one in five.\n\n[[Page S1054]]\n\nOne in five poor children cannot read at grade level in the fourth \ngrade in the United States of America this week, today, this year. \nWould any of us accept those odds or outcomes for our own children? \nWould any one person in this Chamber accept that? Would any of us still \nbe in Washington engaged in the Potemkin debates we are having if our \nchild couldn't read by the fourth grade? Of course not--of course we \nwouldn't. But we act as if it is not our children who are the \ncasualties, and so we smile and we stroke our chins on the cable TV and \npretend this is all somehow out of our hands, too hard to solve, \nsomeone else's problem.\n  Here is where it ends. In this knowledge-based global economy, this \nunforgiving global economy, only 9 out of 100 kids, as I said in \npoverty, will graduate with a college degree or its equivalent and 91 \nwill not. These are the results we have produced for our children in \nthis unforgiving global economy.\n  But for once let's put aside the finger-pointing and the blame--\nalthough we should take our fair share of responsibility--and let's ask \nthe questions our children might reasonably ask to judge their Nation's \nleaders.\n  For example, they might ask: Why do we trail behind 35 other \ndeveloped countries in our math scores? Why does the United States rank \n20th in increasing educational attainment from one generation to the \nnext--20th; the least likely country to produce more educated people \ncoming after us than there were before us.\n  Why are American children much more likely to be stuck in the \neconomic class into which they are born than children in at least 12 \nother countries, including Canada, Japan, Germany, Australia, and \nDenmark?\n  These seem like reasonable questions. You wouldn't know they were on \nanybody's mind around here with what concerns us on this floor, but I \ncan tell you it is of concern to people at home.\n  Why are we consigning, they might ask, our children and ourselves to \na social economic framework that is increasing, not decreasing, \ninequality in this country, when other countries in the world are \nheaded in the opposite direction?\n  Why are we putting up with a set of circumstances in which income and \nequality in America has grown significantly much faster than other \nindustrialized countries in the world? If I were a child living in \npoverty in this country, those are the questions I would want to know, \nin addition to the fact that I can't find a school, not just down the \nstreet, not just in my neighborhood but in my city or even in the \nregion of my State to go to. To put it another way, I can't find a \nschool in my community that any Member of the Senate would be proud to \nsend their child to.\n  Why can't I find that school?\n  I didn't pick my parents. That was a question of good luck or bad \nluck. In my case it was bad luck.\n  I know there are profound disagreements about whether the Federal, \nState or local government should serve our kids and how. I am even \nsympathetic, believe me, as a former school superintendent, to many \narguments about how poorly Washington is often situated to help. But \nsurely as a nation, one way or another, we have a moral obligation. \nThat is our legacy as Americans ``in Order to form a more perfect \nUnion, establish Justice, ensure domestic Tranquility, provide for the \ncommon defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings \nof Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity. . . . ''\n  Imagine how less powerful the Preamble to the Constitution would have \nbeen if it stopped with ourselves, period--but it didn't. It resolves \nthe question in favor of our posterity--our posterity, not someone \nelse's--our children, not someone else's. What would this debate sound \nlike if we were serious about this moral obligation?\n  Without deciding today who would deliver and pay for these important \nsocial goods, something we should debate and understand, consult with \nour States and our school districts, our parents and our communities; \nbut, without making those decisions today, if we just were treating the \ncountry's children as our own children, what would this debate sound \nlike? What would we do?\n  We surely would provide every parent and her child with the choice to \naccess early childhood education from birth to age 5 in order to attack \nthat 30 million word deficit. Surely we would do that.\n  I am not saying we should do it. I don't think we should do that from \nhere, but as a nation we should do that. Surely we would ensure that \nevery child, without exception and regardless of where they live, has \nthe choice to attend a high-performing school from kindergarten to 12th \ngrade. Surely we would do that.\n  We would enable every young person, consistent with most of our \npostwar history, the chance to attain a college degree or other \nadvanced technical training without bankrupting their family. I saw \nsome data this weekend about this that showed that in 1975--and \nadmittedly it was the high-water mark--the Pell grants covered roughly \n76 percent of what it cost to go to college, the average cost of \ncollege. Do you know what that number is now? It is 22 percent, mostly \nbecause the cost of college has increased so much.\n  Bankruptcy is a real issue. These goals--early childhood education, a \ngreat K-12 school, affordable college--might seem obvious and even \nunimaginative to many of us in this Chamber, but that might be because \nwe take them for granted for our own children. Of course we want high-\nquality early childhood education, of course we want a high-quality K-\n12 school, of course we want our young people to have access to college \nwithout bankrupting our family, and that is the experience of a lot of \npeople in this Chamber. The terrible reality for most poor children in \nAmerica in 2015 is that these simple goals are as out of reach as \nflying to the Moon, all over this country.\n\n  Some say we can't afford to change, and I say we can't afford not to \nchange. The costs of failure, as we know, are simply too high. Since \nthe Industrial Revolution, we have had the greatest economy the world \nhas ever known, and if we are to remain so in the 21st century, we must \neducate our people. We have no other choice. They are our greatest \nasset. We can do it.\n  I am not proposing today a new Federal program of any kind. However, \nI will say if it were left up to me, we would have a standing committee \nin the Senate focused exclusively on our children and their future. \nSuch a committee would, for example, examine every funding stream in \nthe Federal budget related to kids and ask what is working and what is \nnot working. What redundancies exist? How are we going to align every \nsingle taxpayer dollar or tax credit to help support the health, \neducation, and well-being of our children?\n  I suspect that in addition to increasing efficiency, we would decide \nto spend more of our resources in and around schools. That is where our \nkids are, after all, and that is where the people who have served them \nin our communities need to be instead of tied up in the redtape of \ncompliance and outdated and unimaginative Federal rules and \nregulations.\n  In addition to that, we need to explore more efficient ways to \nfinance social welfare programs, promote more creative ways to weave \nour social safety net in this country, and reform our criminal justice \nsystem. A good start would be to graduate children from high school, \nsince around 80 percent of our prison inmates are high-school dropouts. \nThat would help a lot. We need to better engage with the private and \nnonprofit sectors when the government isn't working well enough. This \nis all part of a broader but essential conversation, one this body \ncontinues to avoid while it wanders from one phony conflict to the \nnext, and one that becomes more difficult and more expensive the longer \nwe wait.\n  Our kids are waiting for us to have this conversation. We are wasting \ntheir time. It is one thing for us to waste our own time--although the \ncapacity for doing that around here is beyond belief--but we ought to \nstop wasting our kids' time. As I said, it is only going to become more \ndifficult and more expensive the longer we wait.\n  In the meantime, we have before us the potential to rewrite the \nElementary and Secondary School Act. Fixing so-called No Child Left \nBehind is only one piece of the puzzle. Given where we are, this is all \npretty modest stuff. There are some very encouraging signs, although \nthe law has plenty of flaws. In fact, I said many times that if we had \na rally out in front of the Capitol to keep No Child Left Behind the\n\n[[Page S1055]]\n\nsame--if that is what the rally was for--not a single person in America \nwould show up for that rally.\n  Incidentally, while we have this reauthorization in front of us, it \nis a reauthorization that should have happened 7 years ago. It expired \n7 years ago. We are running education policy in this country by waivers \nfrom the Department of Education because this Congress cannot do its \njob. Almost 40 of 50 States have waivers from the law as it exists \ntoday. Let's change the law. Let's write it properly. Let's do our work \naround here instead of spending our time on things the American people \ndon't want us to spend our time on.\n  Although everybody loves to hate No Child Left Behind, and I put \nmyself in that category, it has some good things. It required us to \nface the facts about how our kids in poverty are doing in our schools. \nIt shed light for the first time on the achievement gap--the brutal \nachievement gap--we have in this country, and some school districts \nstepped up. Denver Public Schools is one such district.\n  Over the last decade, Denver Public Schools has implemented a number \nof changes and has seen real results. My schoolboard and my principals \nand my teachers and our kids and I would be the first to say we have \nnot yet gotten to a place where you can say the ZIP Code you were born \ninto doesn't determine the education you are going to get, but we are a \nlot closer in Denver. We are a lot closer there than we are in a lot of \nother cities in this country. We have seen some real results.\n  Almost 30 percent more students graduated and went to college last \nyear than in 2005. That is not enough. We are not satisfied with that. \nBut if you could say that about every single city in this country, that \nwe were graduating and sending 30 percent more students to college than \nwe were in 2005, that might give us some hope for the future. That \nmight suggest that some outcomes other than the ones we have been \nseeing with the result of 9 out of 100 poor kids getting a college \ndegree is not where we have to end up, is not where we have to land.\n  I am here to tell you, not as a U.S. Senator, but as someone who was \na superintendent of the Denver Public Schools, this is possible. It is \npossible to change these outcomes in urban districts and in rural \ndistricts for children who are unlucky enough to be born into poverty \nin the greatest Nation on the planet--unlucky enough to be born poor \nand not born rich.\n  Denver has recognized the importance of providing access to high-\nquality, early childhood education, and now an estimated 70 percent of \nDenver's 4-year-olds are enrolled in preschool. That was not true in \n2005.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, we live in a State that doesn't \nrequire or pay for 5-year-olds to go to kindergarten. That is a shame. \nBut because of the changes we made in Denver, our 5-year-olds go to \nkindergarten--a full day if they want it, which most of them do--and 70 \npercent of the fourth graders in Denver have early childhood education, \nand it is not only delivered by the Denver Public Schools, but by other \nproviders as well and the Denver public schools.\n\n  This seems to be having an effect as kids who attend the Denver \npreschool program track higher in school readiness. They know more \nabout the alphabet, words, and books. They have a higher vocabulary and \nare able to comprehend basic math. And in kindergarten, first, and \nsecond grade, they showed better literacy and math skills than their \npeers.\n  The dropout rate in Denver has decreased since 2005 by 60 percent. \nIncidentally, the teen pregnancy rate has also fallen by 60 percent. \nDenver Public Schools has gone from being the district with the lowest \nrate of academic growth among major districts in the State to the \nhighest for 3 straight years. I am not taking responsibility for that. \nI am here, not there.\n  Last year DPS students from low-income families had stronger growth \nin math and writing than nonfree- and reduced-lunch students Statewide. \nAnd Denver's nonfree- and reduced-lunch students showed more growth \nthan their State counterparts in math by nine points.\n  This was once labeled the failing school district in our State, but \nbecause of the data that we have as a result of No Child Left Behind, \nwe can actually see what is happening--which kids are growing and which \nkids are not, which schools are driving growth among kids and which \nschools are not.\n  You can look at a map of our city and find a school that looks just \nlike your low-performing school with the same percentage of free- and \nreduced-lunch kids where kids are succeeding beyond their wildest \ndreams. Then what parents can do is say: I want that school, not this \nschool, for my kid. Because we have a robust system of choice in \nDenver, parents are able to take advantage of that data, and we simply \nwould not have had the proliferation of high-performing charter schools \nif it had not been for No Child Left Behind. In addition, Denver has \ngone beyond that.\n  We have 33 innovation schools where teachers and administrators have \nthe flexibility to modernize their teaching practices and have more \nautonomy to make decisions at the school level to better meet the needs \nof individual students. And it is not just Denver. We have seen \nprogress all across the country--not remotely enough, but we have seen \nprogress, and we cannot go backward.\n  In the 3 decades prior to No Child Left Behind being passed--30 \nyears--the average 9-year-old's reading score on the National \nAssessment of Educational Progress increased only 4 points--4 points in \n30 years. Is that acceptable? Contrast that to the gains from 1990 to \n2012, which is roughly the life of No Child Left Behind. During that \nspan, 9-year-olds gained 9 points in reading, about 7 times as much \nannual progress. We have seen similar progress in math--9-year-olds \nonly increased 2 points from 1990 to 1999, but from 1999 to 2012, they \ngained 12 points. In that same span, African-American students improved \nby 15 points and Latino students improved by 21 points.\n  The achievement gap shrunk as well. In reading, the gap between White \nand African-American 9-year-old students dropped from 35 to 23 points. \nIt is still too big, but it is moving in the right direction. This \nrepresents progress, but as I have said, in the face of stiff \ncompetition worldwide, it is nowhere near enough.\n  Since the year 2000, we have dropped from second to twelfth in the \nworld in the production of college graduates. We need to write a bill \nthat builds on our successes and turns us away from the failed \npractices of the past, and we cannot do it if we are constrained by the \ntypical politics--the small politics of Washington. We cannot afford to \nhave the same tired fights. We won't always agree on everything, but I \nknow we can find a way to pass a bill that helps our schools and school \ndistricts to make the decisions they think are best for the kids they \nare educating.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  We are under a 10-minute time limitation.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 7 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. I appreciate the indulgence of my colleague from \nLouisiana.\n  In a significant demonstration of leadership around here, Chairman \nAlexander and Senator Murray have told us they intend to write a \nbipartisan bill. Their process has the potential to be a rare exception \nto the gridlock that has gripped this Senate, along with our bipartisan \nwork on the farm bill and immigration.\n  Senators Alexander and Murray have both expressed a willingness to \nwork together because they appreciate the importance of this task. They \nunderstand the consequences of failure. They know enough about this \nissue, and they care enough about it.\n  In January of 1941, during one of the Nation's most difficult times--\nthe height of the Great Depression and on the eve of our entry into the \nSecond World War, Franklin Roosevelt declared that there were four \nuniversal freedoms that all persons possessed--freedom of speech, \nfreedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear.\n  Today, in the 21st century, some of these freedoms may be obtainable, \nbut an honest assessment tells us it would be impossible to achieve all \nof them without something additional, and that is freedom from \nignorance. In the end, freedom from ignorance is the surest relief from \nthe shackles of poverty.\n\n[[Page S1056]]\n\n  Where does this leave us as we begin this important but long overdue \nnational conversation on the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary School Act?\n  First, for all the reasons I have mentioned, America's children would \nbenefit if we treated our work less as legislators than as parents and \ngrandparents with a real stake in the outcome of what we decide.\n  Second, we must be clear-eyed about the Federal Government's proper \nrole in American education and what is not. As a superintendent, I \nlearned there are many things the Federal Government cannot and should \nnot do when it comes to educating our children. And above all else, \nWashington cannot and should not micromanage our schools or our school \ndistricts or cultivate systems driven by compliance rather than \ncreativity.\n  I believe the evidence of our failures and our successes over the \nlast 15 years suggest three primary Federal responsibilities: equity, \naccountability, and innovation. After all, the deep and intractable \ninequities that persisted along lines of race and class and geography \nin America of the 1960s drove Lyndon Johnson to pass the first \nElementary and Secondary Schools Act. They drove the creation of title \nI, specific funds targeted to the kids who needed the greatest support.\n  Sadly, for all the reasons I said, half a century later the data \nreveals these profound inequities persist and our students need our \nhelp now more than ever. But there is also reason for hope in this \ndata, and maybe that is the most important message I can bring. We now \nhave evidence that sustains support to make the difference in closing \nthe pernicious gaps that remain for low-income kids around the country. \nOur deep commitment to equity, therefore, is as important today as it \nwas in 1963.\n  This means not just committing title I resources, but continuing to \nexpand efforts to open the best schools and attract the best teachers \nand principals to our communities in the greatest need. In particular, \nwe must help teachers who are saying they want better preparation, they \nwant an excellent principal in their school, they want a better \ncompensation system and opportunities for leadership that allow them to \ncontinue working with students.\n  At DPS we have made some strides. We created the Denver Teacher \nResidency Program and introduced differentiated pay. We used Federal \ninnovation dollars to help us improve and expand early on. We are \ncreating leadership roles for teachers who demonstrate results with \ntheir students. We survey our teachers every year, and their \nsatisfaction rates are higher than the national average. But there is \nstill much more for us to do.\n  Second, those of us working in the field know we must have a clear, \nshared system of accountability, a system that allows us to monitor, \nunderstand, and improve outcomes for students. This requires annual \nassessments that monitor progress and growth across all our cities and \nStates. It requires breaking down data to show how and if we are \nclosing the gaps for all students in our school districts. It means \nrequiring States to take courageous action to turn around those schools \nthat consistently fail our children.\n  That is not just about paying attention to how we are serving our \nlow-income students in Detroit or Denver. It means examining how well \nwe serve our historically disadvantaged students even when they live in \nsome of the most advantaged neighborhoods. As we do this, we need to \nwork to reduce the amount of testing in our schools. As the father of \nthree daughters in the Denver public schools, I am concerned about how \nmuch they are tested. But as their father, I also want to know every \nyear how they are doing against a set of rigorous standards and \ncompared to kids in Denver, across Colorado, and around the world. Will \nthey be ready for college? Do they have the skills they need to succeed \nin this global economy?\n  Third, we have learned over the last decade there is a vital Federal \nrole when it comes to innovation in our schools. We can help provide \nthe preconditions for success by providing incentives for educators on \nthe ground to apply their own creative thinking to address our most \npersistent education problems.\n  I say to my colleague from Louisiana, through the Chair, I am coming \nto the end. I owe him 10 minutes whenever he would like it. I thank him \nfor his indulgence.\n  We will never solve the challenges our teachers and students face in \nWashington, period. We will not do it from here. We can help local \nleaders break free from a status quo that will never succeed for enough \nof America's children.\n  We should help identify the challenges, provide resources to local \neducators to overcome them in the context that works best for their \ncommunities and their students, and we should continue to be the \nclearinghouse that gathers these stories of successful innovation and \nprovide the resources to invest in scaling what works and sharing these \npractices across communities and States.\n  Equity, accountability, innovation--that is our charge and the \ncommitment we must keep if we are to build an America where we treat \nevery child as if she were our own.\n  As a parent myself, I am well aware the first responsibility any \nparent has is the education of her child. I am also aware that many \npeople believe a bad education is just one more outcome produced by \ncorrosive poverty in this country. Fix poverty, and you will fix \neducation. Maybe so, but that is cold comfort for millions of children \nin our schools today.\n  In the end, we have a duty as a nation to ensure that education \nliberates our children, rather than reinforces the circumstances into \nwhich they were born. In that sense, America's children are our \nchildren, our responsibility, not someone else's. Can you really accept \nan America in which your little girl has just a 1-in-5 chance of being \nable to read well or a 9-in-100 chance to graduate from college? Can \nyou really demand heroism as a precondition for success? If this were \nyour child, would you still be in the Senate, or would you go home and \nsolve the problem?\n  It has been said the future has no lobby in Washington, DC. Are we \nreally content to have that depressing observation be the ultimate \nverdict on our leadership? I doubt we are. I would raise this as a \nbipartisan challenge as I close.\n  I know the Senator from Louisiana knows a lot about what I came to \ntalk about today, and I look forward to working with him on the health \ncommittee.\n  Here is my bipartisan challenge. Let's forge a lobby for the future. \nLet's agree that the obligation we owe the Founders is to create more \nopportunity, not less, for the children coming after us. Let's pledge \nthat every child in America is our child, and our future rests with \nher, as it most assuredly does.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the House-\npassed Homeland Security appropriations bill. This bill is not just \nabout whether we should fund the Department of Homeland Security to \ncarry out the very important work of protecting our Nation, but also \nwhether we will provide amnesty to those here illegally.\n  First, let's establish that the Constitution says Congress has \nauthority over our immigration and naturalization laws. The President \ndoes not have the authority to waive legal requirements. The Supreme \nCourt has upheld this on numerous occasions. The President has admitted \nmore than 20 times he does not have this authority. That said, now his \nadministration is attempting to block the ruling the judge recently \nmade to protect his amnesty plan. As has been reported in the papers, \nJudge Hanen in Texas has put an injunction against proceeding with the \nPresident's amnesty bill. It is reported the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, at the President's direction, is moving forward with plans to \nseal large contracts with companies to process deferred-action \napplications for millions of illegal immigrants as soon as possible.\n  American families have seen President Obama rewrite the laws many \ntimes, and the outcomes of the recent elections show they do not \nsupport President Obama's Executive overreach. The President intends to \ngrant amnesty to 5 million people. This will\n\n[[Page S1057]]\n\nnot be done on a case-by-case basis as the law suggests it should be. \nIt is going to be a rubberstamp, a rubberstamp at the expense of those \nwho are legally attempting to come to our country. It will take longer \nfor those who are attempting to come legally to gain admittance under \nthe law. I support the efforts of those coming to the United States to \nmake a better life for themselves and their family. We all believe in \nimmigration. We just think immigration should be legal.\n  The President has rewritten the law to allow illegal immigrants the \nability to receive work permits and drivers licenses which also \nincludes receiving a Social Security number. After a certain period of \ntime they will be eligible for Social Security. This goes far beyond \nhis legal authority. By the way, many of my Democratic colleagues have \nexpressed concerns about the President's action and whether he had the \nconstitutional authority to take the action he has taken. Clearly he \ndoes not. While the President says this legal status is temporary, the \nreality is once work permits have been issued and Social Security cards \nare given, folks will be allowed to stay. They would not be deemed a \npriority for removal. On top of that, the temporary status may be \nrenewed.\n  In 2011, the President took Executive action for the Department of \nHomeland Security to start prioritizing illegal immigrants for removal. \nIn April 2014, several months before he took his most recent action, \nthe Los Angeles Times quoted former ICE Director John Sandweg in an \narticle where he said, If you are a run-of-the-mill immigrant here \nillegally, your odds of getting deported are close to zero.\n  The Associated Press reported in September 2014 the Department of \nHomeland Security admitted to a group of immigrant advocates during a \nconfidential meeting that about 70 percent of illegal immigrants \ntraveling as families failed to report back to ICE as ordered after \nthey were released at the border.\n  A few weeks ago Louisiana school administrators and I met, and they \nexpressed concern about how the President's immigration policies have \nstressed our school systems. Classroom sizes have grown. Their \nassociated costs to hire more teachers, buy textbooks, and the required \nresources to educate these students all have grown. President Obama is \ngiving Executive amnesty to suit his agenda but is stretching limited \nlocal and State resources. By stretching them, it is making it tougher \non Americans who are born here.\n  The administration says only 5 million people will be impacted by the \nPresident's Executive order. The reality is with numerous options for \nillegal immigrants to remain in this country, people are going to hear \nabout it. They will attempt to come. This will be a magnet for others \nto come here illegally. Illegal behavior is being rewarded.\n  If the President's supporters feel compelled to continue blocking the \nfunding bill, it must be clear they feel that Executive amnesty is \nlegal regardless of how the courts have ruled. It is clear they believe \nthat protecting the President's illegal action is more important than \nproviding our men and women with the resources to protect our border.\n  We must fund the Department of Homeland Security. As I have said, \nmany of my colleagues who expressed serious concerns with the \nPresident's Executive actions in November are now voting to protect \nthese actions. It is unfortunate they voted four times to prevent this \nbill--the Homeland Security funding bill--from coming up for debate. \nThey won't even allow debate. Folks say they want funding for the \nHomeland Security Department, but they won't allow debate. This is \nunconscionable.\n  I believe it is important we move forward to avoid a shutdown of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. I urge my colleagues to please stop \nblocking this important legislation we must pass to protect our country \nand give the men and women of Homeland Security the resources they need \nand, most importantly, to protect the Constitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the role.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, in 3\\1/2\\ days, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity may well shut down. I speak as the senior Democrat on the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs for the last 2 \nyears and, along with Dr. Tom Coburn, our former colleague from \nOklahoma, chaired that committee that he and I led.\n  But in 3\\1/2\\ days, if Congress fails to act responsibly--78 hours, I \nthink, from right now--the Department of Homeland Security may shut \ndown. I have spoken on the floor a number of times in recent weeks \nabout the complex, consistent, and very real threats that our country \nfaces. We are familiar with a lot of them--maybe not all.\n  But over the past several months we have seen horrific images of \nbeheadings, of mass murders, brutal executions at the hands of the \nIslamic State. Some of our Nation's largest companies and Federal \nagencies have been victims of massive cyber attacks. They continue to \nthis day.\n  This weekend another terrorist group, the Al Qaeda-linked terrorist \ngroup in Somalia called al-Shabaab, vowed they would seek revenge \nagainst the United States. They cited the Mall of America in Minnesota \nas a potential target. It is not just these groups or the lone wolf \nterrorists they inspire that we need to worry about.\n  Last fall, Ebola ravaged several nations in western Africa and even \ncame to our shores as well. Threats from Mother Nature persist too. \nCommunities and cities in some parts of our country are trying to get \nthrough a winter that has already broken snowfall records, and more \nrecords are likely to fall. Yet today, here in the Congress, there are \nsome who are questioning whether even to fund the very agencies charged \nwith keeping us safe from these and other evolving threats. That goes \nbeyond being irresponsible. Department of Homeland Security Secretary \nJeh Johnson nailed it recently when he said what it was. Here is what \nhe said: ``It is bizarre and absurd that we are even having this \ndiscussion.'' I could not agree more. Is this really the message we \nwant to be sending to all those folks across the world who wish us \nharm? God, I hope not.\n  Here we are, days before this key agency could be forced to shut down \npreparing for the worst. Some of our colleagues have said that it is \nnot a big deal if the Department shuts down. I could not disagree more \nstrongly, and here is why. If we continue this behavior and fail to \npass a clean Department of Homeland Security funding bill by midnight \non Friday, this is what will happen at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity: Much of the Department's workforce, up to 200,000 people, \nwill be expected to show up for work but work without pay.\n  That includes Border Patrol agents who protect our borders. That \nincludes Coast Guard crews who patrol our waters. That includes the TSA \nemployees who keep our skies safe and make it safe to fly on airplanes \nand get in and out of our airports. Many of these courageous men and \nwomen put their lives in harm's way every day. We expect them to \ncontinue doing that. We just are not going to pay them.\n  That is right. We want you to keep doing your job of protecting our \nNation. Eventually, those in Congress will get around to doing our job. \nWhen we do, you will get paid. Let me ask: How would we like to be \ntreated that way? How would we like to be treated that way? Well, we \nwould not. I think it is shameful that we would even contemplate \ntreating some of our bravest fellow employees like that.\n  It is shameful. Even worse, treating our people like this does not \nmake America any safer. In fact, it makes us less safe in the end. Even \nif we did avoid a shutdown, we would keep the Department running on a \nstopgap continuing resolution. We would prevent the men and women who \nwork there from doing their jobs as efficiently and as effectively as \nthey could be, should be, and would like to be.\n  Secretary Johnson described that putting the Department on another \ncontinuing resolution--these are his words--``is a little like trying \nto drive\n\n[[Page S1058]]\n\ncross-country with no more than five gallons of gas [in the tank] at a \ntime and you don't know when the next gas station is. You can't plan \nexcept days and weeks at a time.''\n  For example, if we pass another stopgap continuing resolution, the \nDepartment will not be able to replace obsolete surveillance technology \nalong high-risk areas of our border. We need to replace that. In \naddition, our Nation will have significantly fewer resources to respond \nto any future surges of unaccompanied minors along our southwest \nborder. Moreover, we will put construction of a badly needed national \nsecurity cutter for the Coast Guard on hold. Why does that matter? It \nmatters because our Coast Guard fleet is aging and needs to be \nmodernized. These ships are essential to stopping illegal trafficking \noff our coasts, such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, and \nillegal immigration--some of it in vessels that travel at speeds of \ngreater than 50 knots.\n  If that is not enough, try this: It is widely known that employee \nmorale at the Department of Homeland Security is the lowest of all \nmajor Federal agencies. Passing yet another continuing resolution I \npromise you will not make it any better--quite the opposite. Morale \nwill only get worse, and in doing so threaten to degrade the \nperformance of the people we rely on, perhaps more than any other, to \nkeep Americans safe.\n  So let me say it again. This is not the way we should be treating the \npublic servants who in many cases risk their lives to keep our Nation \nand all Americans safe. This is no way to run a key national agency. \nFurthermore, as we have learned over the years, this kind of crisis \nbudgeting costs taxpayers millions of dollars in lost productivity, in \nhiring freezes, in contracts that will have to be renegotiated--not at \na lower cost to taxpayers--at higher costs.\n  Now, I understand why some of our colleagues are concerned about the \npolicies and procedures set forth in the President's Executive action \non immigration. I get it. They have every right to express those \nconcerns. But the budget of the Department of Homeland Security is not \nthe place to have that debate. A Federal district court in South Texas \nrecently examined what the President put forward and blocked its \nimplementation. Why cannot we just let the judicial process play out \nand meanwhile do our job by funding the Department of Homeland Security \nfor the balance of this fiscal year?\n  Some of our Republican colleagues agree with this approach. One of \nour colleagues, Lindsey Graham, said earlier this week: ``I hope \nRepublicans will come together and back the court case, file a friend \nof the court brief with the court and fund DHS.''\n  He added:\n\n       I am willing and ready to pass a DHS funding bill and let \n     this play out in court. The worst possible outcome for this \n     nation is to defund the Department of Homeland Security given \n     the multiple threats we face to our homeland.\n\n  Our friend, Lindsey's friend, John McCain, also said recently--these \nare his words, not mine:\n\n       It's not a good idea to shut down the Department of \n     Homeland Security. . . . Now we have the perfect reason to \n     not shut it down because the courts have decided, at least \n     initially, in our favor.\n\n  ``Our favor'' is that of the Republican Governors who filed the \nlawsuit in the South Texas district court. I want to urge my Republican \ncolleagues to go ahead and pursue this potential judicial remedy to \naddress the concerns they have. But while they are doing that, for \nGod's sake, let's bring a clean, fiscal year 2015 appropriations bill \nfor the Department of Homeland Security--the same bill that both \nDemocrats and Republicans agreed to last December--let's bring it to \nthe floor so we can give the Department the funding and the certainty \nthat it desperately needs.\n  Regardless of what happens in the courts, at the end of the day \ncomprehensive immigration reform is the only way we can fix our broken \nimmigration system for the long term. It is the only way we can address \nthe issues the President was trying to resolve in his Executive action \nin a straightforward way, as we did in the last Congress when we passed \nby a big bipartisan vote right on this floor--by a 2-to-1 margin--\ncomprehensive immigration reform.\n  We owe the American people an honest and thorough debate on \nimmigration reform. But let's do it the right way. We have shown that \nwe can do that. We did it a year and a half ago. Let's do it \nagain. Let's do it this year after approving a clean, full-year funding \nbill for the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n  I might just add this. The comprehensive immigration reform that we \npassed here by a 2-to-1 margin a year and a half ago was priced out by \nthe Congressional Budget Office, which is not Democratic or Republican. \nThey looked at it and did all the numbers and everything. They \nconcluded that rather than increasing the budget deficit, that \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill reduced the budget deficit for \nthe next 10 years by $200 billion. Further, for the second 10 years, it \nreduced our budget deficit by $700 billion.\n  A different study further suggested that the impact on our Nation's \neconomy and on our gross domestic product by the implementation of that \nsame comprehensive immigration reform was that it would not diminish \nthe growth to our economy. It would actually increase it by 5 percent--\n5-percent GDP growth over a two-decade period of time.\n  Those of us who are privileged to serve in the Senate were sent here \nby our constituents with a critical responsibility: to work together \nand pass laws that help our Nation and help our economy to grow and to \nthrive.\n  This debate--or any debate, for that matter--should not be about one \npolitical party winning or losing, because the only people who are \nlosing are the constituents we are supposed to serve. As long as we \ncontinue to spend our time debating these manufactured funding crises, \nour constituents--American taxpayers from coast to coast--are going to \ncontinue to lose. We as a Congress, I think, lose as well.\n  I believe American voters made it clear in last fall's election. They \nare tired of all of this kind of behavior. I do not blame them either. \nBut it is simple. They want us to do our job. They want us to work \ntogether across these aisles. They want us to get things done that need \nto get done. They want us to find ways to strengthen the----\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. In closing, let me just note that I am encouraged to hear \nthat Senate Majority Leader McConnell now seems to be moving toward \nallowing a vote on a clean bill. I hope this change of course is the \nbeginning of the end of this crisis for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and for our country. Whatever we do, it is critical that we \nconsider and pass a clean Department of Homeland Security funding bill \nfirst. At this point, every hour that goes by without one creates more \nuncertainty and more waste.\n  After we do that, let's roll up our sleeves and let's get back to \nwork on a thoughtful, 21st century immigration reform policy for our \ncountry, a policy that is fair, a policy that will significantly reduce \nour Nation's budget deficit, and a policy that will strengthen the \neconomic recovery now underway.\n  I want to thank my friend from Iowa for the kindness in allowing me \nto proceed for an extra few minutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/24/senate-section/article/S1058-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1058-S1059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO CHRISTY PRIETSCH\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this week, the Senate will bid a fond \nfarewell to the director of its Employee Assistance Program, Christy \nPrietsch.\n  Christy is retiring after more than a decade of dedicated service in \nthe Senate. She has made quite an impression since coming here in 2004. \nSenate employees know Christy as a warm and inviting person they can go \nto whenever they need someone to talk to. She is experienced in helping \nothers overcome obstacles both personal and professional, and it is \nclear that her care and concern for the Senate community is as genuine \nas it is deep.\n  But for Christy, we also know that such a fulsome commitment to \nserving the Senate has meant spending less time with her husband and \nher son than she would like. So we hope this decision to retire will \ngive Christy the\n\n[[Page S1059]]\n\nopportunity to see more of her family. We also hope that, after helping \nso many others for so many years--not only in the Senate, but before \nthat in agencies such as the Secret Service and Department of Justice--\nChristy will have a little more time to pursue her own passions too.\n  So the Senate sends its thanks to this dedicated professional who has \ntouched the lives of many, Christy Prietsch, and we wish her well in \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/24/senate-section/article/S1059-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1059-S1060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Any Member of the \n     Senate appointed for such purposes shall be of the same party \n     as the Member who is ineligible or disqualifies himself or \n     herself.\n       Sec. 2. (a) It shall be the duty of the Select Committee \n     to--\n       (1) receive complaints and investigate allegations of \n     improper conduct which may reflect upon the Senate, \n     violations of law, violations of the Senate Code of Official \n     Conduct and violations of rules and regulations of the \n     Senate, relating to the conduct of individuals in the \n     performance of their duties as Members of the Senate, or as \n     officers or employees of the Senate, and to make appropriate \n     findings of fact and conclusions with respect thereto;\n       (2)(A) recommend to the Senate by report or resolution by a \n     majority vote of the full committee disciplinary action to be \n     taken with respect to such violations which the Select \n     Committee shall determine, after according to the individual \n     concerned due notice and opportunity for a hearing, to have \n     occurred;\n       (B) pursuant to subparagraph (A) recommend discipline, \n     including--\n       (i) in the case of a Member, a recommendation to the Senate \n     for expulsion, censure, payment of restitution, \n     recommendation to a Member's party conference regarding the \n     Member's seniority or positions of responsibility, or a \n     combination of these; and\n       (ii) in the case of an officer or employee, dismissal, \n     suspension, payment of restitution, or a combination of \n     these;\n       (3) subject to the provisions of subsection (e), by a \n     unanimous vote of 6 members, order that a Member, officer, or \n     employee be reprimanded or pay restitution, or both, if the \n     Select Committee determines, after according to the Member, \n     officer, or employee due notice and opportunity for a \n     hearing, that misconduct occurred warranting discipline less \n     serious than discipline by the full Senate;\n       (4) in the circumstances described in subsection (d)(3), \n     issue a public or private letter of admonition to a Member, \n     officer, or employee, which shall not be subject to appeal to \n     the Senate;\n       (5) recommend to the Senate, by report or resolution, such \n     additional rules or regulations as the Select Committee shall \n     determine to be necessary or desirable to insure proper \n     standards of conduct by Members of the Senate, and by \n     officers or employees of the Senate, in the performance of \n     their duties and the discharge of their responsibilities;\n       (6) by a majority vote of the full committee, report \n     violations of any law, including the provision of false \n     information to the Select Committee, to the proper Federal \n     and State authorities; and\n       (7) develop and implement programs and materials designed \n     to educate Members, officers, and employees about the laws, \n     rules, regulations, and standards of conduct applicable to \n     such individuals in the performance of their duties.\n       (b) For the purposes of this resolution--\n       (1) the term ``sworn complaint'' means a written statement \n     of facts, submitted under penalty of perjury, within the \n     personal knowledge of the complainant alleging a violation of \n     law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or any other rule \n     or regulation of the Senate relating to the conduct of \n     individuals in the performance of their duties as Members, \n     officers, or employees of the Senate;\n       (2) the term ``preliminary inquiry'' means a proceeding \n     undertaken by the Select Committee following the receipt of a \n     complaint or allegation of, or information about, misconduct \n     by a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate to determine \n     whether there is substantial credible evidence which provides \n     substantial cause for the Select Committee to conclude that a \n     violation within the jurisdiction of the Select Committee has \n     occurred; and\n       (3) the term ``adjudicatory review'' means a proceeding \n     undertaken by the Select Committee after a finding, on the \n     basis of a preliminary inquiry, that there is substantial \n     credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the \n     Select Committee to conclude that a violation within the \n     jurisdiction of the Select Committee has occurred.\n       (c) (1) No--\n       (A) adjudicatory review of conduct of a Member or officer \n     of the Senate may be conducted;\n\n[[Page S1061]]\n\n       (B) report, resolution, or recommendation relating to such \n     an adjudicatory review of conduct may be made; and\n       (C) letter of admonition pursuant to subsection (d)(3) may \n     be issued, unless approved by the affirmative recorded vote \n     of no fewer than 4 members of the Select Committee.\n       (2) No other resolution, report, recommendation, \n     interpretative ruling, or advisory opinion may be made \n     without an affirmative vote of a majority of the Members of \n     the Select Committee voting.\n       (d) (1) When the Select Committee receives a sworn \n     complaint or other allegation or information about a Member, \n     officer, or employee of the Senate, it shall promptly conduct \n     a preliminary inquiry into matters raised by that complaint, \n     allegation, or information. The preliminary inquiry shall be \n     of duration and scope necessary to determine whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Select Committee to conclude that a violation \n     within the jurisdiction of the Select Committee has occurred. \n     The Select Committee may delegate to the chairman and vice \n     chairman the discretion to determine the appropriate \n     duration, scope, and conduct of a preliminary inquiry.\n       (2) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under \n     paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines by a recorded \n     vote that there is not such substantial credible evidence, \n     the Select Committee shall dismiss the matter. The Select \n     Committee may delegate to the chairman and vice chairman the \n     authority, on behalf of the Select Committee, to dismiss any \n     matter that they determine, after a preliminary inquiry, \n     lacks substantial merit.

No provisions of the Senate Code \n     of Official Conduct shall apply to or require disclosure of \n     any act, relationship, or transaction which occurred prior to \n     the effective date of the applicable provision of the Code. \n     The Select Committee may initiate an adjudicatory review of \n     any alleged violation of a rule or law which was in effect \n     prior to the enactment of the Senate Code of Official Conduct \n     if the alleged violation occurred while such rule or law was \n     in effect and the violation was not a matter resolved on the \n     merits by the predecessor Select Committee.\n       (h) The Select Committee shall adopt written rules setting \n     forth procedures to be used in conducting preliminary \n     inquiries and adjudicatory reviews.\n       (i) The Select Committee from time to time shall transmit \n     to the Senate its recommendation as to any legislative \n     measures which it may consider to be necessary for the \n     effective discharge of its duties.\n       Sec. 3.

Each member of the Committee shall be \n     given a reasonable opportunity to have separate views \n     included as part of any Committee report. (See Rule 8 on \n     Procedures for Handling Committee Sensitive and Classified \n     Materials.)\n       (k) INELIGIBILITY OR DISQUALIFICATION OF MEMBERS AND STAFF:\n       (1) A member of the Committee shall be ineligible to \n     participate in any Committee proceeding that relates \n     specifically to any of the following:\n       (A) a preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review relating \n     to (i) the conduct of (I) such member; (II) any officer or \n     employee the member supervises; or (ii) any complaint filed \n     by the member; and\n       (B) the determinations and recommendations of the Committee \n     with respect to any preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory \n     review described in subparagraph (A).\n       For purposes of this paragraph, a member of the committee \n     and an officer of the Senate shall be deemed to supervise any \n     officer or employee consistent with the provision of \n     paragraph 12 of Rule XXXVII of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.\n       (2) If any Committee proceeding appears to relate to a \n     member of the Committee in a manner described in subparagraph \n     (1) of this paragraph, the staff shall prepare a report to \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman. If either the Chairman or the \n     Vice Chairman concludes from the report that it appears that \n     the member may be ineligible, the member shall be notified in \n     writing of the nature of the particular proceeding and the \n     reason that it appears that the member may be ineligible to \n     participate in it. If the member agrees that he or she is \n     ineligible, the member shall so notify the Chairman or Vice \n     Chairman. If the member believes that he or she is not \n     ineligible, he or she may explain the reasons to the Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, and if they both agree that the member is \n     not ineligible, the member shall continue to serve. But if \n     either the Chairman or Vice Chairman continues to believe \n     that the member is ineligible, while the member believes that \n     he or she is not ineligible, the matter shall be promptly \n     referred to the Committee. The member shall present his or \n     her arguments to the Committee in executive session. Any \n     contested questions concerning a member's eligibility shall \n     be decided by a majority vote of the Committee, meeting in \n     executive session, with the member in question not \n     participating.\n       (3) A member of the Committee may, at the discretion of the \n     member, disqualify himself or herself from participating in \n     any preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review pending before \n     the Committee and the determinations and recommendations of \n     the Committee with respect to any such preliminary inquiry or \n     adjudicatory review.\n       (4) Whenever any member of the Committee is ineligible \n     under paragraph (1) to participate in any preliminary inquiry \n     or adjudicatory review, or disqualifies himself or herself \n     under paragraph (3) from participating in any preliminary \n     inquiry or adjudicatory review, another Senator shall be \n     appointed by the Senate to serve as a member of the Committee \n     solely for purposes of such preliminary inquiry or \n     adjudicatory review and the determinations and \n     recommendations of the Committee with respect to such \n     preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review. Any member of the \n     Senate appointed for such purposes shall be of the same party \n     as the member who is ineligible or disqualifies himself or \n     herself.\n       (5) The President of the Senate shall be given written \n     notice of the ineligibility or disqualification of any member \n     from any preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review, or other \n     proceeding requiring the appointment of another member in \n     accordance with subparagraph (k)(4).\n       (6) A member of the Committee staff shall be ineligible to \n     participate in any Committee proceeding that the staff \n     director or outside counsel determines relates specifically \n     to any of the following:\n       (A) the staff member's own conduct;\n       (B) the conduct of any employee that the staff member \n     supervises;\n       (C) the conduct of any member, officer or employee for whom \n     the staff member has worked for any substantial period; or\n       (D) a complaint, sworn or unsworn, that was filed by the \n     staff member.

In any such \n     case an absent member's vote may be announced solely for the \n     purpose of recording the member's position and such announced \n     votes shall not be counted for or against the motion.\n       (2) On matters other than matters listed in paragraph \n     (m)(1) above, the Committee may order that the record be held \n     open for the vote of absentees or recorded proxy votes if the \n     absent Committee member has been informed of the matter on \n     which the vote occurs and has affirmatively requested of the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman in writing that he be so recorded.\n       (3) All proxies shall be in writing, and shall be delivered \n     to the Chairman or Vice Chairman to be recorded.\n       (4) Proxies shall not be considered for the purpose of \n     establishing a quorum.\n       (n) APPROVAL OF BLIND TRUSTS AND FOREIGN TRAVEL REQUESTS \n     BETWEEN SESSIONS AND DURING EXTENDED RECESSES: During any \n     period in which the Senate stands in adjournment between \n     sessions of the Congress or stands in a recess scheduled to \n     extend beyond fourteen days, the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     or their designees, acting jointly, are authorized to approve \n     or disapprove blind trusts under the provision of Rule XXXIV.\n       (o) COMMITTEE USE OF SERVICES OR EMPLOYEES OF OTHER \n     AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS: With the prior consent of the \n     department or agency involved, the Committee may (1) utilize \n     the services, information, or facilities of any such \n     department or agency of the Government, and (2) employ on a \n     reimbursable basis or otherwise the services of such \n     personnel of any such department or agency as it deems \n     advisable. With the consent of any other committee of the \n     Senate, or any subcommittee, the Committee may utilize the \n     facilities and the services of the staff of such other \n     committee or subcommittee whenever the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman of the Committee, acting jointly, determine that \n     such action is necessary and appropriate.\n\n\n     RULE 2: PROCEDURES FOR COMPLAINTS, ALLEGATIONS, OR INFORMATION\n\n       (a) COMPLAINT, ALLEGATION, OR INFORMATION: Any member or \n     staff member of the Committee shall report to the Committee, \n     and any other person may report to the Committee, a sworn \n     complaint or other allegation or information, alleging that \n     any Senator, or officer, or employee of the Senate has \n     violated a law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or any \n     rule or regulation of the Senate relating to the conduct of \n     any individual in the performance of his or her duty as a \n     Member, officer, or employee of the Senate, or has engaged in \n     improper conduct which may reflect upon the Senate. Such \n     complaints or allegations or information may be reported to \n     the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, a Committee member, or a \n     Committee staff member.\n       (b) SOURCE OF COMPLAINT, ALLEGATION, OR INFORMATION: \n     Complaints, allegations, and information to be reported to \n     the Committee may be obtained from a variety of sources, \n     including but not limited to the following:\n       (1) sworn complaints, defined as a written statement of \n     facts, submitted under penalty of perjury, within the \n     personal knowledge of the complainant alleging a violation of \n     law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or any other rule \n     or regulation of the Senate relating to the conduct of \n     individuals in the performance of their duties as members, \n     officers, or employees of the Senate;\n       (2) anonymous or informal complaints;\n       (3) information developed during a study or inquiry by the \n     Committee or other committees or subcommittees of the Senate, \n     including information obtained in connection with legislative \n     or general oversight hearings;\n       (4) information reported by the news media; or\n       (5) information obtained from any individual, agency or \n     department of the executive branch of the Federal Government.\n       (c) FORM AND CONTENT OF COMPLAINTS: A complaint need not be \n     sworn nor must it be in any particular form to receive \n     Committee consideration, but the preferred complaint will:\n       (1) state, whenever possible, the name, address, and \n     telephone number of the party filing the complaint;\n       (2) provide the name of each member, officer or employee of \n     the Senate who is specifically alleged to have engaged in \n     improper conduct or committed a violation;\n       (3) state the nature of the alleged improper conduct or \n     violation;\n       (4) supply all documents in the possession of the party \n     filing the complaint relevant to or in support of his or her \n     allegations as an attachment to the complaint.\n\n\n        RULE 3: PROCEDURES FOR CONDUCTING A PRELIMINARY INQUIRY\n\n       (a) DEFINITION OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY: A ``preliminary \n     inquiry'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee \n     following the receipt of a complaint or allegation of, or \n     information about, misconduct by a Member, officer, or \n     employee of the Senate to determine whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred.\n       (b) BASIS FOR PRELIMINARY INQUIRY: The Committee shall \n     promptly commence a preliminary inquiry whenever it has \n     received a sworn complaint, or other allegation of, or \n     information about, alleged misconduct or violations pursuant \n     to Rule 2.\n       (c) SCOPE OF PRELIMINARY INQUIRY:\n       (1) The preliminary inquiry shall be of such duration and \n     scope as is necessary to determine whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, on behalf of the Committee \n     may supervise and determine the appropriate duration, scope, \n     and conduct of a preliminary inquiry. Whether a preliminary \n     inquiry is conducted jointly by the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman or by the Committee as a whole, the day to day \n     supervision of a preliminary inquiry rests with the Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (2) A preliminary inquiry may include any inquiries, \n     interviews, sworn statements, depositions, or subpoenas \n     deemed appropriate to obtain information upon which to make \n     any determination provided for by this Rule.\n       (d) OPPORTUNITY FOR RESPONSE: A preliminary inquiry may \n     include an opportunity for any known respondent or his or her \n     designated representative to present either a written or oral \n     statement, or to respond orally to questions from the \n     Committee. Such an oral statement or answers shall be \n     transcribed and signed by the person providing the statement \n     or answers.\n       (e) STATUS REPORTS: The Committee staff or outside counsel \n     shall periodically report to the Committee in the form and \n     according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee. The \n     reports shall be confidential.\n       (f) FINAL REPORT: When the preliminary inquiry is \n     completed, the staff or outside counsel shall make a \n     confidential report, oral or written, to the Committee on \n     findings and recommendations, as appropriate.\n       (g) COMMITTEE ACTION: As soon as practicable following \n     submission of the report on the preliminary inquiry, the \n     Committee shall determine by a recorded vote whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Committee \n     may make any of the following determinations:\n       (1) The Committee may determine that there is not such \n     substantial credible evidence and, in such case, the \n     Committee shall dismiss the matter. The Committee, or \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman acting jointly on behalf of the \n     Committee, may dismiss any matter which, after a preliminary \n     inquiry, is determined to lack substantial merit. The \n     Committee shall inform the complainant of the dismissal.\n       (2) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence, but that the alleged violation \n     is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis \n     nature. In such case, the Committee may dispose of the matter \n     by issuing a public or private letter of admonition, which \n     shall not be considered discipline and which shall not be \n     subject to appeal to the Senate. The issuance of a letter of \n     admonition must be approved by the affirmative recorded vote \n     of no fewer than four members of the Committee voting.\n       (3) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence and that the matter cannot be \n     appropriately disposed of under paragraph (2). In such case, \n     the Committee shall promptly initiate an adjudicatory review \n     in accordance with Rule 4. No adjudicatory review of conduct \n     of a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate may be \n     initiated except by the affirmative recorded vote of not less \n     than four members of the Committee.\n\n\n        RULE 4: PROCEDURES FOR CONDUCTING AN ADJUDICATORY REVIEW\n\n       (a) DEFINITION OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW: An ``adjudicatory \n     review'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee after a \n     finding, on the basis of a preliminary inquiry, that there is \n     substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a \n     violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has \n     occurred.\n       (b) SCOPE OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW: When the Committee \n     decides to conduct an adjudicatory review, it shall be of \n     such duration and scope as is necessary for the Committee to \n     determine whether a violation within its jurisdiction has \n     occurred. An adjudicatory review shall be conducted by \n     outside counsel as authorized by section 3(b)(1) of Senate \n     Resolution 338 unless the Committee determines not to use \n     outside counsel. In the course of the adjudicatory review, \n     designated outside counsel, or if the Committee determines \n     not to use outside counsel, the Committee or its staff, may \n     conduct any inquiries or interviews, take sworn statements, \n     use compulsory process as described in Rule 6, or take any \n     other actions that the Committee deems appropriate to secure \n     the evidence necessary to make a determination.\n       (c) NOTICE TO RESPONDENT: The Committee shall give written \n     notice to any known respondent who is the subject of an \n     adjudicatory review. The notice shall be sent to the \n     respondent no later than five working\n\n[[Page S1066]]\n\n     days after the Committee has voted to conduct an adjudicatory \n     review. The notice shall include a statement of the nature of \n     the possible violation, and description of the evidence \n     indicating that a possible violation occurred. The Committee \n     may offer the respondent an opportunity to present a \n     statement, orally or in writing, or to respond to questions \n     from members of the Committee, the Committee staff, or \n     outside counsel.\n       (d) RIGHT TO A HEARING: The Committee shall accord a \n     respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends \n     disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or \n     before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand (not \n     requiring discipline by the full Senate).\n       (e) PROGRESS REPORTS TO COMMITTEE: The Committee staff or \n     outside counsel shall periodically report to the Committee \n     concerning the progress of the adjudicatory review. Such \n     reports shall be delivered to the Committee in the form and \n     according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee, and \n     shall be confidential.\n       (f) FINAL REPORT OF ADJUDICATORY REVIEW TO COMMITTEE: Upon \n     completion of an adjudicatory review, including any hearings \n     held pursuant to Rule 5, the outside counsel or the staff \n     shall submit a confidential written report to the Committee, \n     which shall detail the factual findings of the adjudicatory \n     review and which may recommend disciplinary action, if \n     appropriate. Findings of fact of the adjudicatory review \n     shall be detailed in this report whether or not disciplinary \n     action is recommended.\n       (g) COMMITTEE ACTION:\n       (1) As soon as practicable following submission of the \n     report of the staff or outside counsel on the adjudicatory \n     review, the Committee shall prepare and submit a report to \n     the Senate, including a recommendation or proposed resolution \n     to the Senate concerning disciplinary action, if appropriate. \n     A report shall be issued, stating in detail the Committee's \n     findings of fact, whether or not disciplinary action is \n     recommended. The report shall also explain fully the reasons \n     underlying the Committee's recommendation concerning \n     disciplinary action, if any. No adjudicatory review of \n     conduct of a Member, officer or employee of the Senate may be \n     conducted, or report or resolution or recommendation relating \n     to such an adjudicatory review of conduct may be made, except \n     by the affirmative recorded vote of not less than four \n     members of the Committee.\n       (2) Pursuant to S. Res. 338, as amended, section 2(a), \n     subsections (2), (3), and (4), after receipt of the report \n     prescribed by paragraph (f) of this rule, the Committee may \n     make any of the following recommendations for disciplinary \n     action or issue an order for reprimand or restitution, as \n     follows:\n       (i) In the case of a Member, a recommendation to the Senate \n     for expulsion, censure, payment of restitution, \n     recommendation to a Member's party conference regarding the \n     Member's seniority or positions of responsibility, or a \n     combination of these;\n       (ii) In the case of an officer or employee, a \n     recommendation to the Senate of dismissal, suspension, \n     payment of restitution, or a combination of these;\n       (iii) In the case where the Committee determines, after \n     according to the Member, officer, or employee due notice and \n     opportunity for a hearing, that misconduct occurred \n     warranting discipline less serious than discipline by the \n     full Senate, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (h) \n     of this rule relating to appeal, by a unanimous vote of six \n     members order that a Member, officer or employee be \n     reprimanded or pay restitution or both;\n       (iv) In the case where the Committee determines that \n     misconduct is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de \n     minimis nature, issue a public or private letter of \n     admonition to a Member, officer or employee, which shall not \n     be subject to appeal to the Senate.\n       (3) In the case where the Committee determines, upon \n     consideration of all the evidence, that the facts do not \n     warrant a finding that there is substantial credible evidence \n     which provides substantial cause for the Committee to \n     conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the \n     Committee has occurred, the Committee may dismiss the matter.\n       (4) Promptly, after the conclusion of the adjudicatory \n     review, the Committee's report and recommendation, if any, \n     shall be forwarded to the Secretary of the Senate, and a copy \n     shall be provided to the complainant and the respondent. The \n     full report and recommendation, if any, shall be printed and \n     made public, unless the Committee determines by the recorded \n     vote of not less than four members of the Committee that it \n     should remain confidential.\n       (h) RIGHT OF APPEAL:\n       (1) Any individual who is the subject of a reprimand or \n     order of restitution, or both, pursuant to subsection \n     (g)(2)(iii), may, within 30 days of the Committee's report to \n     the Senate of its action imposing a reprimand or order of \n     restitution, or both, appeal to the Senate by providing \n     written notice of the appeal to the Committee and the \n     presiding officer of the Senate. The presiding officer shall \n     cause the notice of the appeal to be printed in the \n     Congressional Record and the Senate Journal.\n       (2) S. Res. 338 provides that a motion to proceed to \n     consideration of an appeal pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be \n     highly privileged and not debatable. If the motion to proceed \n     to consideration of the appeal is agreed to, the appeal shall \n     be decided on the basis of the Committee's report to the \n     Senate. Debate on the appeal shall be limited to 10 hours, \n     which shall be divided equally between, and controlled by, \n     those favoring and those opposing the appeal.\n\n\n                    RULE 5: PROCEDURES FOR HEARINGS\n\n       (a) RIGHT TO HEARING: The Committee may hold a public or \n     executive hearing in any preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory \n     review, or other proceeding. The Committee shall accord a \n     respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends \n     disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or \n     before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand. (See \n     Rule 4(d).)\n       (b) NON-PUBLIC HEARINGS: The Committee may at any time \n     during a hearing determine in accordance with paragraph 5(b) \n     of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate whether to \n     receive the testimony of specific witnesses in executive \n     session. If a witness desires to express a preference for \n     testifying in public or in executive session, he or she shall \n     so notify the Committee at least five days before he or she \n     is scheduled to testify.\n       (c) ADJUDICATORY HEARINGS: The Committee may, by the \n     recorded vote of not less than four members of the Committee, \n     designate any public or executive hearing as an adjudicatory \n     hearing; and any hearing which is concerned with possible \n     disciplinary action against a respondent or respondents \n     designated by the Committee shall be an adjudicatory hearing. \n     In any adjudicatory hearing, the procedures described in \n     paragraph (j) shall apply.\n       (d) SUBPOENA POWER: The Committee may require, by subpoena \n     or otherwise, the attendance and testimony of such witnesses \n     and the production of such correspondence, books, papers, \n     documents or other articles as it deems advisable. (See Rule \n     6.)\n       (e) NOTICE OF HEARINGS: The Committee shall make public an \n     announcement of the date, place, and subject matter of any \n     hearing to be conducted by it, in accordance with Rule 1(f).\n       (f) PRESIDING OFFICER: The Chairman shall preside over the \n     hearings, or in his absence the Vice Chairman. If the Vice \n     Chairman is also absent, a Committee member designated by the \n     Chairman shall preside. If an oath or affirmation is \n     required, it shall be administered to a witness by the \n     Presiding Officer, or in his absence, by any Committee \n     member.\n       (g) WITNESSES:\n       (1) A subpoena or other request to testify shall be served \n     on a witness sufficiently in advance of his or her scheduled \n     appearance to allow the witness a reasonable period of time, \n     as determined by the Committee, to prepare for the hearing \n     and to employ counsel if desired.\n       (2) The Committee may, by recorded vote of not less than \n     four members of the Committee, rule that no member of the \n     Committee or staff or outside counsel shall make public the \n     name of any witness subpoenaed by the Committee before the \n     date of that witness's scheduled appearance, except as \n     specifically authorized by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly.\n       (3) Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written \n     statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy \n     of such statement with the Committee at least two working \n     days in advance of the hearing at which the statement is to \n     be presented. The Chairman and Vice Chairman shall determine \n     whether such statements may be read or placed in the record \n     of the hearing.\n       (4) Insofar as practicable, each witness shall be permitted \n     to present a brief oral opening statement, if he or she \n     desires to do so.\n       (h) RIGHT TO TESTIFY: Any person whose name is mentioned or \n     who is specifically identified or otherwise referred to in \n     testimony or in statements made by a Committee member, staff \n     member or outside counsel, or any witness, and who reasonably \n     believes that the statement tends to adversely affect his or \n     her reputation may--\n       (1) Request to appear personally before the Committee to \n     testify in his or her own behalf; or\n       (2) File a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     testimony or other evidence or statement of which he or she \n     complained. Such request and such statement shall be \n     submitted to the Committee for its consideration and action.\n       (i) CONDUCT OF WITNESSES AND OTHER ATTENDEES: The Presiding \n     Officer may punish any breaches of order and decorum by \n     censure and exclusion from the hearings. The Committee, by \n     majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that the offender \n     be cited for contempt of Congress.\n       (j) ADJUDICATORY HEARING PROCEDURES:\n       (1) NOTICE OF HEARINGS: A copy of the public announcement \n     of an adjudicatory hearing, required by paragraph (e), shall \n     be furnished together with a copy of these Rules to all \n     witnesses at the time that they are subpoenaed or otherwise \n     summoned to testify.\n       (2) PREPARATION FOR ADJUDICATORY HEARINGS:\n       (A) At least five working days prior to the commencement of \n     an adjudicatory hearing, the Committee shall provide the \n     following information and documents to the respondent, if \n     any:\n       (i) a list of proposed witnesses to be called at the \n     hearing;\n       (ii) copies of all documents expected to be introduced as \n     exhibits at the hearing; and\n\n[[Page S1067]]\n\n       (iii) a brief statement as to the nature of the testimony \n     expected to be given by each witness to be called at the \n     hearing.\n       (B) At least two working days prior to the commencement of \n     an adjudicatory hearing, the respondent, if any, shall \n     provide the information and documents described in divisions \n     (i), (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A) to the Committee.\n       (C) At the discretion of the Committee, the information and \n     documents to be exchanged under this paragraph shall be \n     subject to an appropriate agreement limiting access and \n     disclosure.\n       (D) If a respondent refuses to provide the information and \n     documents to the Committee (see (A) and (B) of this \n     subparagraph), or if a respondent or other individual \n     violates an agreement limiting access and disclosure, the \n     Committee, by majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that \n     the offender be cited for contempt of Congress.\n       (3) SWEARING OF WITNESSES: All witnesses who testify at \n     adjudicatory hearings shall be sworn unless the Presiding \n     Officer, for good cause, decides that a witness does not have \n     to be sworn.\n       (4) RIGHT TO COUNSEL: Any witness at an adjudicatory \n     hearing may be accompanied by counsel of his or her own \n     choosing, who shall be permitted to advise the witness of his \n     or her legal rights during the testimony.\n       (5) RIGHT TO CROSS-EXAMINE AND CALL WITNESSES:\n       (A) In adjudicatory hearings, any respondent and any other \n     person who obtains the permission of the Committee, may \n     personally or through counsel cross-examine witnesses called \n     by the Committee and may call witnesses in his or her own \n     behalf.\n       (B) A respondent may apply to the Committee for the \n     issuance of subpoenas for the appearance of witnesses or the \n     production of documents on his or her behalf. An application \n     shall be approved upon a concise showing by the respondent \n     that the proposed testimony or evidence is relevant and \n     appropriate, as determined by the Chairman and Vice Chairman.\n       (C) With respect to witnesses called by a respondent, or \n     other individual given permission by the Committee, each such \n     witness shall first be examined by the party who called the \n     witness or by that party's counsel.\n       (D) At least one working day before a witness's scheduled \n     appearance, a witness or a witness's counsel may submit to \n     the Committee written questions proposed to be asked of that \n     witness. If the Committee determines that it is necessary, \n     such questions may be asked by any member of the Committee, \n     or by any Committee staff member if directed by a Committee \n     member. The witness or witness's counsel may also submit \n     additional sworn testimony for the record within twenty-four \n     hours after the last day that the witness has testified. The \n     insertion of such testimony in that day's record is subject \n     to the approval of the Chairman and Vice Chairman acting \n     jointly within five days after the testimony is received.\n       (6) ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE:\n       (A) The object of the hearing shall be to ascertain the \n     truth. Any evidence that may be relevant and probative shall \n     be admissible unless privileged under the Federal Rules of \n     Evidence. Rules of evidence shall not be applied strictly, \n     but the Presiding Officer shall exclude irrelevant or unduly \n     repetitious testimony. Objections going only to the weight \n     that should be given evidence will not justify its exclusion.\n       (B) The Presiding Officer shall rule upon any question of \n     the admissibility of testimony or other evidence presented to \n     the Committee. Such rulings shall be final unless reversed or \n     modified by a recorded vote of not less than four members of \n     the Committee before the recess of that day's hearings.\n       (C) Notwithstanding paragraphs (A) and (B), in any matter \n     before the Committee involving allegations of sexual \n     discrimination, including sexual harassment, or sexual \n     misconduct, b a Member, officer, or employee within the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee, the Committee shall be guided \n     by the standards and procedures of Rule 412 of the Federal \n     Rules of Evidence, except that the Committee may admit \n     evidence subject to the provisions of this paragraph only \n     upon a determination of not less than four members of the \n     full Committee that the interests of justice require that \n     such evidence be admitted.\n       (7) SUPPLEMENTARY HEARING PROCEDURES: The Committee may \n     adopt any additional special hearing procedures that it deems \n     necessary or appropriate to a particular adjudicatory \n     hearing. Copies of such supplementary procedures shall be \n     furnished to witnesses and respondents, and shall be made \n     available upon request to any member of the public.\n       (k) TRANSCRIPTS:\n       (1) An accurate stenographic or recorded transcript shall \n     be made of all public and executive hearings. Any member of \n     the Committee, Committee staff member, outside counsel \n     retained by the Committee, or witness may examine a copy of \n     the transcript retained by the Committee of his or her own \n     remarks and may suggest to the official reporter any \n     typographical or transcription errors. If the reporter \n     declines to make the requested corrections, the member, staff \n     member, outside counsel or witness may request a ruling by \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. Any member or \n     witness shall return the transcript with suggested \n     corrections to the Committee offices within five working days \n     after receipt of the transcript, or as soon thereafter as is \n     practicable. If the testimony was given in executive session, \n     the member or witness may only inspect the transcript at a \n     location determined by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly. Any questions arising with respect to the processing \n     and correction of transcripts shall be decided by the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (2) Except for the record of a hearing which is closed to \n     the public, each transcript shall be printed as soon as is \n     practicable after receipt of the corrected version. The \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may order the \n     transcript of a hearing to be printed without the corrections \n     of a member or witness if they determine that such member or \n     witness has been afforded a reasonable time to correct such \n     transcript and such transcript has not been returned within \n     such time.\n       (3) The Committee shall furnish each witness, at no cost, \n     one transcript copy of that witness's testimony given at a \n     public hearing. If the testimony was given in executive \n     session, then a transcript copy shall be provided upon \n     request, subject to appropriate conditions and restrictions \n     prescribed by the Chairman and Vice Chairman. If any \n     individual violates such conditions and restrictions, the \n     Committee may recommend by majority vote that he or she be \n     cited for contempt of Congress.\n\n\n                   RULE 6: Subpoenas and Depositions\n\n       (a) SUBPOENAS:\n       (1) AUTHORIZATION FOR ISSUANCE: Subpoenas for the \n     attendance and testimony of witnesses at depositions or \n     hearings, and subpoenas for the production of documents and \n     tangible things at depositions, hearings, or other times and \n     places designated therein, may be authorized for issuance by \n     either (A) a majority vote of the Committee, or (B) the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, at any time \n     during a preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review, or other \n     proceeding.\n       (2) SIGNATURE AND SERVICE: All subpoenas shall be signed by \n     the Chairman or the Vice Chairman and may be served by any \n     person eighteen years of age or older, who is designated by \n     the Chairman or Vice Chairman. Each subpoena shall be served \n     with a copy of the Rules of the Committee and a brief \n     statement of the purpose of the Committee's proceeding.\n       (3) WITHDRAWAL OF SUBPOENA: The Committee, by recorded vote \n     of not less than four members of the Committee, may withdraw \n     any subpoena authorized for issuance by it or authorized for \n     issuance by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. \n     The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may withdraw \n     any subpoena authorized for issuance by them.\n       (b) DEPOSITIONS:\n       (1) PERSONS AUTHORIZED TO TAKE DEPOSITIONS: Depositions may \n     be taken by any member of the Committee designated by the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, or by any other \n     person designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, including outside counsel, Committee staff, other \n     employees of the Senate, or government employees detailed to \n     the Committee.\n       (2) DEPOSITION NOTICES: Notices for the taking of \n     depositions shall be authorized by the Committee, or the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, and issued by the \n     Chairman, Vice Chairman, or a Committee staff member or \n     outside counsel designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly. Depositions may be taken at any time during a \n     preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review or other proceeding. \n     Deposition notices shall specify a time and place for \n     examination. Unless otherwise specified, the deposition shall \n     be in private, and the testimony taken and documents produced \n     shall be deemed for the purpose of these rules to have been \n     received in a closed or executive session of the Committee. \n     The Committee shall not initiate procedures leading to \n     criminal or civil enforcement proceedings for a witness's \n     failure to appear, or to testify, or to produce documents, \n     unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a subpoena \n     authorized for issuance by the Committee, or the Chairman and \n     Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (3) COUNSEL AT DEPOSITIONS: Witnesses may be accompanied at \n     a deposition by counsel to advise them of their rights.\n       (4) DEPOSITION PROCEDURE: Witnesses at depositions shall be \n     examined upon oath administered by an individual authorized \n     by law to administer oaths, or administered by any member of \n     the Committee if one is present. Questions may be propounded \n     by any person or persons who are authorized to take \n     depositions for the Committee. If a witness objects to a \n     question and refuses to testify, or refuses to produce a \n     document, any member of the Committee who is present may rule \n     on the objection and, if the objection is overruled, direct \n     the witness to answer the question or produce the document. \n     If no member of the Committee is present, the individual who \n     has been designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, to take the deposition may proceed with the \n     deposition, or may, at that time or at a subsequent time, \n     seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from \n     the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Committee, who may refer \n     the matter to the Committee or rule on the objection. If the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman, or the Committee upon referral, \n     overrules the objection, the Chairman, Vice Chairman, or the \n     Committee as the case may be, may direct\n\n[[Page S1068]]\n\n     the witness to answer the question or produce the document. \n     The Committee shall not initiate procedures leading to civil \n     or criminal enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify \n     or produce documents after having been directed to do so.\n       (5) FILING OF DEPOSITIONS: Deposition testimony shall be \n     transcribed or electronically recorded. If the deposition is \n     transcribed, the individual administering the oath shall \n     certify on the transcript that the witness was duly sworn in \n     his or her presence and the transcriber shall certify that \n     the transcript is a true record of the testimony. The \n     transcript with these certifications shall be filed with the \n     chief clerk of the Committee, and the witness shall be \n     furnished with access to a copy at the Committee's offices \n     for review. Upon inspecting the transcript, within a time \n     limit set by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, \n     a witness may request in writing changes in the transcript to \n     correct errors in transcription. The witness may also bring \n     to the attention of the Committee errors of fact in the \n     witness's testimony by submitting a sworn statement about \n     those facts with a request that it be attached to the \n     transcript. The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, \n     may rule on the witness's request, and the changes or \n     attachments allowed shall be certified by the Committee's \n     chief clerk.

Mr. President, this month marks another important \nanniversary for many Bahrainis. Four years ago, more than a 100,000 \npeople took to the streets of Manama, camping out at Pearl Roundabout \nand peacefully protesting their lack of access to Bahrain's political \nsystem and their government's abuse of basic human rights. Bahrain's \nrulers responded to these calls for reform as authoritarian regimes so \noften do: with force. In the years since, an estimated 3,000 Bahrainis \nhave been arrested, more than 150 protestors have been killed and more \nthan 100 people have had their citizenship revoked. Indeed, the \nBahraini regime continues to go to great lengths to stifle peaceful \nprotest and quell any dissent by closing down media outlets and filling \nup already overcrowded prisons with political prisoners and human \nrights defenders. While many Bahrainis feel their struggle has been \nforgotten by the world, I want them to know that it will not go \nunremembered or unmarked here in the U.S. Senate.\n  The regime continues to go to great lengths to convince the world \nthat it is making progress but I am sad to report that I cannot share \nthat conclusion. Not while the regime refuses to permit a visit by Juan \nMendez, the U.N.'s top torture investigator. Not while opposition \nleaders sit in Bahraini jails. And not while the State Department's \nlast Human Rights Report lists abuses that include ``restrictions on \ncivil liberties,'' ``arbitrary deprivation of life,'' and ``arrest and \ndetention of protesters on vague charges, in some cases leading to \ntheir torture in detention.''\n  Four years after the peaceful protests began, Bahrain's rulers \ncontinue to commit human rights violations while taking only \nsuperficial steps toward a meaningful political solution. As a result, \nseveral attempts to conclude a national dialogue among Bahrain's \ninterests and parties have only resulted in stalemate. Unsurprisingly, \nthe regime cracked down on the largest political opposition bloc in the \nlead-up to the November 2014 elections, resulting in a large-scale \nboycott of the election by voters. The regime arrested a senior \nopposition leader 1 month later, an action that the State Department \nwarned ``will only inflame tensions'' and further dampen potential for \na renewed political dialogue. The regime responded not by releasing \nthat leader, but by doubling down and moving to criminalize the \npolitical party he leads.\n  On this somber anniversary, I want to take the occasion to urge the \nBahraini regime to implement true and meaningful reforms, to cease the \nuse of violence and repression against peaceful protesters, and to \nengage in credible dialogue about the future of Bahrain. To be clear, \nmy aim is not to dictate to Bahrain's rulers what their government \nought to look like; indeed, those decisions can only be made by the \npeople of Bahrain. But Bahrain has long been an ally of the United \nStates, and I believe this country has an obligation to hold friends to \na higher standard.\n  To those who will say that human rights abuses are bad but that \nstability and cooperation in the region must come before such concerns, \nI say that you are offering a false choice. I worry there will come a \nday when peaceful protesters, seeing no hope for redress, ask \nthemselves if they, too, should not resort to violence. Indeed, the \nprospect of further violence and instability--or full-blown civil war--\ncould have a profound impact on regional security and on the thousands \nof United States military personnel stationed in Bahrain. That is why I \nwill continue coming down to this floor on this sad anniversary and \nkeep using my voice in this body to raise awareness of this important \nissue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/24/senate-section/article/S1071-3", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1071-S1072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ALYCIA FARRELL\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is sometimes said that the work of the \nstaff is little noticed until something goes wrong. Today, I wish to \nmake comments about a member of the staff of the Appropriations \nCommittee for a different reason: the outstanding record of service to \nthe Senate and the Nation by Alycia Farrell.\n\n[[Page S1072]]\n\n  Alycia came to Washington, DC, to study at the Elliott School of \nInternational Affairs at the George Washington University. She joined \nthe Senate Committee on Appropriations under the late chairman, Ted \nStevens, in 2001. A year later, she was promoted to a professional \nstaff member for the Subcommittee on Military Construction and in 2003 \nmoved to the Subcommittee on Defense.\n  Alycia's responsibilities on the Subcommittee on Defense for the last \n12 years have been varied and complex. Her areas of expertise have \nincluded oversight of military health programs, where she has been \ninstrumental in pushing for reforms to better serve the men and women \nin uniform and their families. She has tackled the most important \nissues in military health care over the last decade, including \nincreasing funding for traumatic brain injury, suicide prevention, and \nimplementing electronic health record systems for our veterans.\n  She has also excelled in oversight of missile defense programs, where \nAlycia has been a key voice in promoting the defense of our country \nwhile also calling for accountability in these technologically complex \nand expensive programs. She is a notable expert in the cooperative \nprograms between the United States and Israel, where Alycia has played \na key part in obtaining funding for programs such as Iron Dome, which \nhave helped protect a key American ally from harm.\n  But no description of Alycia's contributions to the Senate are \ncomplete without mentioning what she has brought to the people who have \nworked with her for the last decade and a half. She is a bundle of \ncheerful energy who takes great enthusiasm in everything she does. This \nis especially true in her love of the outdoors and commitment to \nhockey.\n  Alycia Farrell is soon to depart the Senate for new challenges. \nRaised in Alaska, she has heard the call of the northern climate from \nher youth and will soon move to Alberta, Canada, where she will \nestablish a new life with her fiance.\n  I send Alycia Farrell my heartfelt gratitude for outstanding service \nto the Senate, and I wish her all the very best on her future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/24/senate-section/article/S1072-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRATULATING JANET MURNAGHAN\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Today I wish to honor Delaware County's Janet Murnaghan, \nwho will be receiving the Women of Achievement Award from the Delaware \nCounty Women's Commission on March 11. Mrs. Murnaghan was chosen as an \nawardee for representing women of Delaware County in an extraordinary \nway, specifically by displaying incredible thoughtfulness, persistence \nand passion in caring for her daughter, Sarah.\n  It was my privilege to nominate Janet for this accolade in \ncelebration of Women's History Month. Janet, her husband, Fran, and I \nfirst met 2 years ago at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Their \ndaughter was battling cystic fibrosis and was in dire need of new lungs \nto save her young life. Though their daughter, Sarah, would have likely \nranked near the top of the donor list for a new lung because of her \nmedical need, a Federal policy prevented children under the age of 12 \nfrom being considered for mature lungs until all adult candidates in \nthe region were ruled out. Sarah faced long odds at receiving a \nlifesaving transplant due to the short supply of pediatric donors. This \nobstacle would not stop Janet and the Murnaghan family. Sarah's mother \ntook the fight to social media, to national TV and eventually directly \nto then Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. Janet \nargued that children under age 12 should be considered for adult lung \ntransplants using the same criteria as adults as long as doctors \ndemonstrated the operation's viability.\n  The Murnaghan family was eventually forced to pursue legal action to \nprevent Secretary Sebelius from enforcing the under-12 rule. Even in \nthe most difficult moments, Mrs. Murnaghan remained levelheaded and \nresilient. Her determination was rewarded as a Federal judge issued a \ntemporary restraining order, allowing young Sarah to receive the \nlifesaving transplant. While the first set of lungs failed due to their \npoor quality, the second set was perfect. Sarah is now breathing on her \nown, bike riding with her siblings, and has already returned to school.\n  Janet and Sarah could not declare victory just yet. Though there was \nsuccess in Sarah's specific case, the rule preventing children from \nreceiving adult lungs was still in place. Last summer, thanks to Janet \nMurnaghan and other advocates, the transplant network permanently \nrevised the under-12 policy. Without Janet taking a leadership role on \nbehalf of her daughter and children across the Nation, this policy \nmight not have been changed. She has certainly set herself apart as a \nwoman of achievement.\n  On behalf of the Senate, I wish to extend my compliments to my \nfriend, Janet Murnaghan, as she receives this much-deserved, \nprestigious award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/24/senate-section/article/S1072-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DISCHARGE PETITION--S.J.

He has also served as a member of the California \nState Board of Education, California Postsecondary Education \nCommission, Los Angeles Commission for Children, Youth and Their \nFamilies, and the Los Angeles Information Technology Agency.\n  A man of many talents, Alan is also a skilled communications and \npublic relations expert and has served as a strategist for academic \ninstitutions, nonprofits, governments, corporations, and political \ncampaigns.\n  In announcing Alan's appointment, USC Rossier Dean Karen Symms \nGallagher said, ``With his broad and unique experience in education, \ncommunications, public policy and the arts, he is someone who can make \nimportant projects, programs and initiatives a reality at Rossier and \nUSC.''\n  I have known Alan for many years and have had the opportunity to see \nhis immense talents and his passion for education.

Mr. President, I wish to extend my most sincere \ncondolences on the passing of Domingo Enrique Morel Senior. Domingo was \na pillar of the community during his time in my hometown of Union City, \nNJ, and he will be deeply missed.\n\n[[Page S1073]]\n\n  As the saying goes, all politics is local. The foundations of our \ndemocratic system do not lie in the Halls of the Capitol but in the \nneighborhoods and cities spread across our great country. The critical \nprogress we must make as a nation only occurs when groups of dedicated \ncitizens selflessly contribute their time and efforts toward improving \nthe lives of their families and communities. Domingo was one of these \ncommitted citizens.\n  As a resident of Union City, Domingo chose to give back to his \nneighbors through the political process. He spent many hours organizing \nneighborhoods and people in support of issues he believed would make \nhis city and State a better place for people to live and work. Domingo \ndid the hard, behind-the-scenes job of organizing communities at the \ngrassroots level. I am eternally grateful for the effort Domingo gave \non my behalf; it is because of his loyal public service that I am able \nto do my work on behalf of the citizens of New Jersey today.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with Domingo's family at this difficult \ntime.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrepeal the Medicare outpatient rehabilitation therapy caps; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Medicare Access \nto Rehabilitation Services Act, which I am introducing today with my \ncolleague Senator Collins. This important bill repeals the monetary \ncaps that limit Medicare beneficiaries' access to medically necessary \noutpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language \npathology services.\n  Limits on outpatient rehabilitation therapy services under Medicare \nwere first imposed in 1997 as part of the Balanced Budget Act. The \ndecision to impose limits on these services was not based on data, \nquality-of-care concerns, or clinical judgment--its sole purpose was to \nlimit spending in order to balance the federal budget. Since 1997, \nCongress has acted over 12 times to prevent the implementation of the \ntherapy caps through moratoriums and an exceptions process. While these \nshort-term actions have provided necessary relief to our seniors, a \nlong-term solution is essential to bring permanent relief and much-\nneeded stability for both patients and providers.\n  We need a full repeal of the existing caps on physical therapy, \noccupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services. These \nannual financial caps limit services often needed after a stroke, \ntraumatic brain injury, or spinal cord injury, or to effectively manage \nconditions such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and \narthritis. Arbitrary caps on these vital Medicare outpatient therapy \nservices are simply unacceptable. They also discriminate against the \noldest and sickest Medicare beneficiaries, who typically require the \nmost intensive therapy, and disadvantage Medicare beneficiaries who \nlive in regions with higher health care costs.\n  In a 2009 report issued by the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee, \nMEDPAC, it was estimated that the\n\n[[Page S1077]]\n\ntherapy cap, if enforced without an exceptions process, could \nnegatively impact 931,000 Medicare beneficiaries. Arbitrarily capping \noutpatient rehabilitation therapy services would likely cause some \nbeneficiaries to delay necessary care, force others to assume higher \nout-of pocket costs, and disrupt the continuum of care for many seniors \nand individuals with disabilities.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Collins in supporting the \nMedicare Access to Rehabilitation Services Act to ensure that our \nseniors have access to the outpatient rehabilitation therapy services \nthat they need.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 539\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Access to \n     Rehabilitation Services Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. OUTPATIENT THERAPY CAP REPEAL.\n\n       Section 1833 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395(l)) \n     is amended by striking subsection (g).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Heitkamp):\n  S. 540. A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nAct to require the Secretary of Agriculture to make loan guarantees and \ngrants to finance certain improvements to school lunch facilities, to \ntrain school food service personnel, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my friend and \ncolleague from North Dakota, Senator Heitkamp, in introducing the \nSchool Food Modernization Act to assist schools in providing healthier \nmeals to students throughout the country.\n  School meals play a vital role in the lives of our young people. More \nthan 30 million children participate in the National School Lunch \nProgram every school day. In Maine, 40 percent of children qualify for \nfree or reduced-price meals based on household income.\n  The food served at schools to these children affects their health and \nwell-being. Many children consume up to half their daily caloric intake \nat school. In fact, children often get their most nutritious meal of \nthe day at school instead of at home. At the same time, too many of our \nchildren are at risk of serious disease. One-third of the children in \nthis country are overweight or obese, which increases their risk for \nheart disease, high blood pressure, Type 2 Diabetes and other chronic \ndiseases. These conditions may have a lifelong effect on their health \nas they grow to adulthood.\n  In response to concerns about the health of our children, our schools \nhave stepped up to the plate. Nationwide, schools are working \ndiligently to meet the new U.S. Department of Agriculture standards and \nserve healthier meals. For example, in the New Sweden Consolidated \nSchool in Aroostook County, ME, food service manager Melanie Lagasse \nprepares meals from scratch instead of opening cans or pushing a \ndefrost button. The school's 64 students, ranging from preschool to \neighth grade, have grown to relish the chicken stew, baked fish, and \nmeatloaf that she makes fresh.\n  Many schools, however, lack the right tools for preparing meals rich \nin fresh ingredients and must rely on workarounds that are expensive, \ninefficient, and unsustainable. Schools built decades ago lack the \ntools and the infrastructure necessary beyond reheating and holding \nfood for meal service.\n  To serve healthier meals to their students, 99 percent of Maine \nschool districts need at least one piece of equipment and almost half, \n48 percent, of districts need kitchen infrastructure upgrades. The \nmedian equipment need per school is $45,000.\n  Even more costly would be making the required changes to \ninfrastructure. Forty-eight percent of Maine schools need some kind of \ninfrastructure change to serve healthy meals. For example, 41 percent \nof schools need more physical space, 22 percent need more electrical \ncapacity, 21 percent need more plumbing capacity, and 19 percent need \nmore ventilation.\n  Add the equipment costs together with the infrastructure costs and it \nis estimated that overall, $58.8 million would be needed just in Maine \nto serve healthy meals to all of our students. That far exceeds the \n$111,000 in grants that the USDA awarded Maine during the last two \nfiscal years for new equipment.\n  Our bill authorizes loan guarantee assistance and grants for school \nequipment and infrastructure improvements, thereby helping food service \npersonnel meet nutrition standards. First, it would establish a loan \nguarantee assistance program within USDA to help schools acquire new \nequipment to prepare and serve healthier, more nutritious meals to \nstudents. School administrators and other eligible borrowers could \nobtain Federal guarantees for 80 percent of the loan value needed to \nconstruct, remodel, or expand their kitchens, dining, or food storage \ninfrastructure.\n  Second, the bill would provide targeted grant assistance to give \nschool administrators and food service directors the seed funding \nneeded to upgrade kitchen infrastructure or to purchase high-quality, \ndurable kitchen equipment such as commercial ovens, steamers, and \nstoves.\n  Finally, to aid school food service personnel in meeting the \nnutrition guidelines, the legislation would strengthen training and \nprovide technical assistance by authorizing USDA to provide support on \na competitive basis to highly qualified third-party trainers to develop \nand administer training and technical assistance, including online \nprograms.\n  We need to start our school children off on the right food every day. \nIf they are going to be able to learn and compete, they need to be \nhealthy and their minds and bodies fully nourished. This bill will help \nus achieve that goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Blumenthal, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Reed, Mr. Menendez, \n        Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Murphy, Ms. Warren, and Mr. Markey):\n  S. 551. A bill to increase public safety by permitting the Attorney \nGeneral to deny the transfer of firearms or the issuance of firearms \nand explosives licenses to known or suspected dangerous terrorists; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to address what I believe \nis a national security and public safety weakness.\n  The United States currently has a system in place to keep known or \nsuspected terrorists off of airplanes. But even though they can't fly, \nthese very same terrorists can walk into any gun store anywhere in the \ncountry and purchase a firearm.\n  If a terrorist is too dangerous to board an airplane, that same \nindividual is too dangerous to possess a gun.\n  That's why we are introducing the Denying Firearms and Explosives to \nDangerous Terrorists Act, a bill to fix this glaring loophole in our \nbackground check system.\n  This is not a hypothetical issue.\n  Individuals with links to terrorism regularly purchase guns in the \nUnited States.\n  According to data just received from the Government Accountability \nOffice, between February 2004 and December 2014, there were at least \n2,233 cases in which a known or suspected terrorist--individuals who at \nthe time were on federal terrorist watch lists--tried to buy a firearm \nor obtain a firearm or explosives license or permit.\n  In 91 percent of these cases, a total of 2,043 separate occasions, \nthose known or suspected terrorists successfully passed a background \ncheck.\n  The Kouachi brothers, the terrorists who killed 12 people at Charlie \nHebdo in Paris, are reportedly on the U.S. no fly list.\n  However, if they had made it to the United States, the fact that they \nwere on terrorist watch lists would have done nothing to prevent them \nfrom legally buying firearms or explosives.\n  One of the alleged Boston Marathon bombers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was \nreportedly placed on two terrorist watch lists in 2011.\n  He later killed three and injured 170 with homemade explosives and \nkilled a police officer with a handgun.\n\n[[Page S1078]]\n\n  In 2009, Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad opened fire at a military \nrecruiting station in Little Rock, Arkansas. He killed one and \ncritically injured another.\n  According to press reports, Muhammad had been under investigation by \nthe FBI for suspected links to terrorism after traveling to Yemen, \nwhere he was arrested for using a Somali passport. Those actions \ncertainly would have placed him on terrorist watch lists, but would not \nhave kept him from buying firearms.\n  The bill that we are introducing today is very simple.\n  It would close this dangerous loophole by giving the Attorney General \ndiscretion to prevent someone from buying explosives or a gun if that \nindividual is a known or suspected terrorist and may use the firearm in \nconnection with terrorism.\n  It would also give the Attorney General discretion to prevent someone \nfrom obtaining a license to sell guns or explosives if that individual \nis a known or suspected terrorist and may use the firearm in connection \nwith terrorism.\n  The Attorney General could use a range of tools to make this \ndecision, most notable terrorist watch lists and the no fly list.\n  In addition to making the decision at the discretion of the Attorney \nGeneral, the bill includes other safeguards to make sure innocent \nindividuals are not denied the ability to buy firearms or explosives.\n  The first safeguard is that very high standards already exist for an \nindividual to be designated as a known or suspected terrorist.\n  The FBI or the National Counterterrorism Center must nominate the \nindividual to be included in the Terrorist Screening Database.\n  There must be sufficient identifying data about the person to ensure \nthey can be accurately matched with the terrorist on the watch list.\n  The circumstances must meet the ``reasonable suspicion'' standard. \nThis means the facts of the case must be strong enough to reasonably \ndetermine the person is known or suspected to be engaged in terrorism.\n  The second safeguard is that every provision in current law allowing \nindividuals to appeal the denial of a firearm or explosive purchase \nwill also apply to this bill.\n  The office within the FBI that handles the background check system, \nknown as the NICS Section, or the National Instant Criminal Background \nCheck System Section, must provide the reason for denial upon request.\n  Individuals then have the right to correct any inaccurate records in \nthe background check system. If a purchase is still denied, individuals \ncan take the Justice Department to court to overturn the decision.\n  Gun safety safety bills are often labeled as Democratic bills. That \nis not the case here.\n  This bill was first proposed by the Justice Department under \nPresident George W. Bush, who recognized that keeping guns away from \nterrorists is good policy.\n  Attorney General Holder has also testified that the Justice \nDepartment under President Obama continues to support this proposal.\n  The bill has also been endorsed by Everytown for Gun Safety. This \ngroup represents more than 1,000 current and former mayors, both \nRepublican and Democrat.\n  The legislation has also been endorsed by the Brady Campaign to \nPrevent Gun Violence, the Violence Policy Center, Americans for \nResponsible Solutions, and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.\n  I would also like to thank the bill's cosponsors: Senators \nWhitehouse, Schumer, Durbin, Blumenthal, Boxer, Reed, Menendez, \nGillibrand, Murphy, Warren, and Markey. All of you are champions for \nstronger gun safety laws.\n  The terrorist attack in Paris should be a wake-up call for everyone.\n  This sort of terrorist attack is very possible here in the United \nStates, and the ability for known and suspected terrorists to buy guns \nand explosives makes it even more likely.\n  Congress should close this loophole in our background check system \nand ensure that known and suspected terrorists can't easily gain access \nto these weapons.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. RISCH (for himself, Mr. Cardin, Ms. Ayotte, and Mrs. \n        Shaheen):\n  S. 552. A bill to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to \nprovide for increased limitations on leverage for multiple licenses \nunder common control; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am pleased join my colleague, Senator \nRisch, in introducing the Small Business Investment Company Capital, \nSBIC, Act of 2015. And I am pleased that Congressman Chabot, Chairman \nof the House Small Business Committee, is introducing the same bill on \nthe House side today.\n  This bipartisan legislation makes a common-sense change to the Small \nBusiness Investment Company, SBIC, program run by the Small Business \nAdministration, SBA. This change will provide increased support to some \nof the program's most successful participants, SBICs that run multiple \nfunds at a time. At no additional cost to the taxpayer, the SBIC Act \nwill raise the limit that a ``family of funds'' can borrow with an SBA \nguarantee from $225 million to $350 million\n  The SBIC program guarantees loans to qualified investment funds, or \nSBICs. In turn, these SBICs invest in promising small businesses by \ncombining the SBA loan with privately raised capital, often at a 2:1 \nratio. It is important to note that while these SBICs are licensed and \nregulated by the SBA, they are privately owned and operated.\n  Since its inception, the SBIC Debenture program has been incredibly \nsuccessful. SBICs have invested more than $70 billion in nearly 170,000 \nsmall businesses. Recently, the program has experienced rapid growth. \nIn 2013, SBA guaranteed loans to SBICs equaling $3.5 billion, a 70 \npercent increase in financing dollars from three years ago and the \nhighest amount of financings in the past decade.\n  This success is largely attributed to Congressional action that \nraised the ceiling for maximum investments for the SBIC program each \nyear from $3 billion to $4 billion. Senator Landrieu, Senator Risch, \nand I worked with a bipartisan coalition to increase this ceiling and \nensure SBIC funds have access to sufficient capital to invest in \npromising small businesses.\n  Nowhere is the success of this increase seen more than in Maryland. \nSince the start of fiscal year 2015, SBICs have already invested nearly \n$65 million in Maryland small businesses. Yet, this success could be \nenhanced even more if Congress increased the amount SBICs with a family \nof funds can borrow from the SBA.\n  SBICs that run multiple funds at a time are known as ``families of \nfunds.'' While many of our Nation's most successful and reliable SBICs \nhave a family of funds, their success is being restricted by the \ncurrent lending limit. Simply raising the limit from $225 million to \n$350 million would provide these proven fund managers the additional \ncapital needed to invest in small businesses and stimulate local \neconomies.\n  Put simply, by increasing the ``family of funds'' lending limit to \n$350 million, proven investors can invest in more promising small \nbusinesses. The SBIC Act enhances the SBA's ability to support these \nsuccessful investors as they finance small businesses that will \ncontinue to create jobs in this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/24/senate-section/article/S1078-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1078-S1079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 4--SUPPORTING THE LOCAL RADIO FREEDOM ACT\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO (for himself and Ms. Heitkamp) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                             S.

is clear that a military approach alone will not \n     eliminate the threat of Boko Haram, and gross human rights \n     abuses and atrocities by security forces causes insecurity \n     and mistrust among the civilian population;\n       Whereas it is imperative that the Government of Nigeria \n     implement a comprehensive, civilian security focused plan \n     that prioritizes protecting

    in successive elections, including in 2011, when nearly 800 \n     people died in clashes following the presidential election;\n       Whereas President Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, General \n     Muhammadu Buhari, and other presidential candidates pledged \n     to reverse this trend by signing the ``Abuja Accord'' on \n     January 14, 2015, in which they committed themselves and \n     their campaigns to refraining from public statements that \n     incite violence, to running issue-based campaigns that do not \n     seek to divide citizens along religious or ethnic lines, and \n     to supporting the impartial conduct of the electoral \n     commission and the security services;\n       Whereas Secretary of State John Kerry visited Nigeria on \n     January 25, 2015, to emphasize the importance of ensuring the \n     upcoming elections are peaceful, nonviolent, and credible;\n       Whereas, despite the Nigerian Independent National \n     Electoral Commission's (INEC) views that preparations were \n     ``sufficient to conduct free, fair and credible elections as \n     scheduled,'' at the repeated urging of security officials, \n     INEC announced on February 7, 2015, the postponement of the \n     elections by six weeks, and elections will now take place on \n     March 28 and April 11, 2015;\n       Whereas tensions in the country remain high,

Nigeria is the most populous nation in Africa, with \n     the largest economy;\n       Whereas the Governments of the United States and Nigeria \n     have had a strong bilateral relationship, and Nigeria has \n     been a valued partner of the United States since its \n     transition to civilian rule;\n       Whereas the Government of Nigeria is currently confronted \n     with threats to internal security by terrorists, insurgents, \n     and communal violence that have caused considerable \n     population displacement, and at the same time must administer \n     transparent and

challenges in a responsible way, including by \n     ensuring full enfranchisement, with particular emphasis on \n     developing a means for enfranchisement for the hundreds of \n     thousands displaced by violence;\n       Whereas the members of Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati \n     wal-Jihad, commonly known as Boko Haram, have terrorized the \n     people of Nigeria with increasing violence since 2009, \n     targeting military, government, and civilian sites in \n     Nigeria, including schools, mosques, churches, markets, \n     villages, and agricultural centers, and killing thousands and \n     abducting hundreds of civilians in Nigeria and the \n     surrounding countries;\n       Whereas the Department of State named several individuals \n     linked to Boko Haram, including its leader, Abubakar Shekau, \n     as Specially Designated Global Terrorists in 2012, and \n     designated Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organization \n     (FTO) in November 2013;\n

a presidential statement condemning the recent escalation of \n     attacks in northeastern Nigeria and surrounding countries and \n     expressing concern that the situation was undermining peace \n     and security in West and Central Africa;\n       Whereas the over 200 school girls abducted by Boko Haram on \n     April 14, 2014, from the Government Girls Secondary School in \n     the northeastern state of Borno, whose kidnapping sparked \n     domestic and international outrage spawning the Twitter \n     campaign #BringBackOurGirls, are still missing;\n       Whereas the militant group is an increasing menace to the \n     countries along Nigeria's northeastern border, prompting the \n     African Union, the Lake Chad Basin Commission, the European \n     Union, and the United Nations Security Council to recognize \n     that there must be a regional response;\n\n[[Page S1082]]\n\n       Whereas the United States Government has stepped forward to \n     offer assistance through intelligence sharing, bilateral and \n     international sanctioning of Boko Haram leaders, \n     counterterrorism assistance through the Global Security \n     Contingency Fund program for countries in the region to \n     counter the militant group, and humanitarian services to \n     populations affected by and vulnerable to Boko Haram \n     violence;\n       Whereas Boko Haram emerged partially as a response to \n     underdevelopment in northeastern Nigeria, and inequality, \n     elite impunity, and alleged human rights abuses by security \n     forces may be fueling anti-government sentiment;\n       Whereas it is clear that a military approach alone will not \n     eliminate the threat of Boko Haram, and gross human rights \n     abuses and atrocities by security forces causes insecurity \n     and mistrust among the civilian population;\n       Whereas it is imperative that the Government of Nigeria \n     implement a comprehensive, civilian security focused plan \n     that prioritizes protecting civilians and also addresses \n     legitimate political and economic grievances of citizens in \n     northern Nigeria;\n       Whereas Nigeria is

Mr. President, many of my colleagues know I have been \nfighting for years to end the abuse of the H-1B visa program and help \ndisadvantaged U.S. workers who are harmed by that program. Today I wish \nto draw the attention of my colleagues to a recent incident that \nhighlights how some employers are potentially using legal avenues to \nimport foreign workers, lay off qualified Americans, and then export \njobs overseas. I was shocked by the heartless manner in which U.S. \nworkers were injured in the case I am about to describe.\n  First, I wish to remind my colleagues about how the H-1B program is \nsupposed to work. Under the terms of the H-1B program, U.S. employers \nmay import into the United States each year up to 65,000 so-called \nspecialty occupation workers. The jobs being filled must be a job for \nwhich a bachelor's degree is necessary. Even though the annual cap is \n65,000, the actual number of foreign workers being imported is much \nmore because of numerous exemptions. In fiscal year 2012, for example, \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services approved a total of 262,569 \nH-1B petitions--way above the legal limit of 65,000 or I should say the \nsupposed limit of 65,000.\n  About 60 percent of H-1B workers come to fill computer-related \noccupations. Every year the list of the top 10 H-1B employers is \ndominated by foreign-based companies offering information technology or \nIT consulting services to the clients.\n  Under the law, H-1B employers are also required to: No. 1, pay the \nworkers the greater of the prevailing wage for that job in that area or \nthe wage the employer pays to similarly qualified U.S. workers doing \nthe same job and at the same time--or the No. 2 condition--provide \nworking conditions that will not adversely affect other similarly \nemployed U.S. workers.\n  Additionally, H-1B employers may not displace a U.S. worker within \nthe period beginning 90 days before and ending 90 days after the date \nof filing any H-1B petition by that employer.\n  Now I will describe what the program lacks. Most people believe \nemployers try to recruit Americans before they petition for H-1B \nworkers. Yet under the law, not all employers are required to prove to \nthe Department of Labor that they tried to find an American to fill the \njob first. That is right. American workers do not get the first chance \nat these jobs in the United States, and if there is an equally or even \nbetter qualified U.S. worker, the company does not have to offer him or \nher that job.\n  I have pushed for changes in the legislation in that law. In fact, I \noffered several pro-U.S. worker amendments during consideration of the \nimmigration bill in 2013. Every amendment I offered was defeated. The \nmajority at that time--meaning the Democratic majority, and it was a \nbipartisan majority that helped defeat it--defeated these pro-American \nworker amendments. They pushed through S. 744, the 2013 immigration \nbill, without this significant, much needed change.\n  Let me describe to my colleagues the appalling instance referenced \nabove.\n  I have described what the H-1B law was and how, during the \nimmigration debate of 2013, I tried to amend it and improve it, and I \nwasn't successful. I started my remarks tonight by talking about the \nabuse of H-1B, the law not being followed, overseas companies bringing \nworkers in here for an American company to employ, and then in turn \nthese jobs are going to be shipped overseas. So now I wish to describe \nthis appalling incident I referenced earlier.\n  Last August, Southern California Edison started laying off 400 \nAmerican workers from its IT department. The company replaced them with \nforeign H-1B workers. According to the company, 100 additional American \nworkers who will also be replaced by H-1B workers will leave supposedly \nvoluntarily. According to Computerworld, the final major batch of \nlayoffs is scheduled for March 6 or March 7.\n\n  The foreign workers who are replacing the American workers at Edison \nare employees of two overseas-based IT consulting companies that are \nalso two of the largest users of H-1B visas. In 2013 one of the two \ncompanies paid the largest immigration fine in U.S. history. That \ncompany paid $34 million in a civil settlement after allegations of \nsystemic visa fraud and abuse.\n  The jobs being filled by H-1B workers are manifestly not jobs for \nwhich Americans are unavailable. I say that because the jobs are \ncurrently filled by skilled American workers. It is disturbing that not \nonly have these American workers been laid off, but also some of them \nhave reportedly had to train their very own replacements.\n  A columnist for the Los Angeles Times writes that by laying off \nhundreds of its American IT staff and replacing them with relatively \nlow-wage foreign contract workers, Edison stands to save as much as 40 \npercent in wage costs per laid-off worker. One\n\n[[Page S1084]]\n\nlaid-off Edison worker told the columnist that company supervisors told \na group of workers last year: ``We can get four Indian guys far cheaper \nthan the price of you.''\n  Worse yet, most of the 500 jobs that had been held by Americans will \neventually just move overseas. According to the Los Angeles Times, \nEdison admits that eventually about 70 percent of the work will shift \noverseas permanently.\n  Edison describes the 400 layoffs as a ``transition'' to the foreign \nIT consulting companies that ``will lead to enhancements that deliver \nfaster and more efficient tools and applications for services that \ncustomers rely on.''\n  Then it adds further: ``[T]hrough outsourcing, [Edison's] information \ntechnology organization will adopt a proven business strategy commonly \nand successfully used by top U.S. companies that [Edison] benchmarks \nagainst.''\n  With respect to replacing American workers with H-1B workers, Edison \nsays the company ``is not hiring H-1B workers to replace displaced \nemployees.'' Edison's cynical defense is built upon a very shameless \nexploitation of a loophole in the H-1B laws. That loophole says that \ntechnically Edison isn't the H-1B workers' employer; the two foreign \nconsulting companies are. The H-1B workers are just contracted out for \nextended, potentially multiyear periods from the foreign consulting \ncompanies to the American company, Edison. Thus, Edison argues that it \nis not subject to the requirements under the immigration laws that I \nspoke of earlier. They argue that because they are not the employer who \npetitioned directly for the H-1B workers, they--Edison--don't have to \nabide by the working condition requirements or the 90-day rule.\n  The condemnation of this attack on American workers has been very \nquick and, quite frankly, bipartisan. On February 10 over 300 members \nof the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers rallied in \nIrvine, CA, in support of their fellow Edison employees. Several \nMembers of Congress have expressed concern about the situation. On \nFebruary 17 the Economic Policy Institute sent a letter to the \nSecretary of Labor asking him to investigate the Edison layoffs. \nSpecifically, the institute asked the Secretary of Labor to determine \nwhether Edison, the foreign consulting companies, or any of the parties \ninvolved in these layoffs violated the requirements that the hiring of \nH-1B workers not ``adversely affect the wages and working conditions of \nU.S. workers comparably employed.''\n  I echo the request of the Economic Policy Institute. The prohibition \non adversely affecting U.S. workers can reasonably be applied to \nsituations, such as in the Edison case, where the H-1B workers are \ncontractors at a worksite rather than employees.\n  I also draw your attention to a powerful February 16 Los Angeles \nTimes editorial entitled ``End H-1B visa program's abuse.'' The Los \nAngeles Times calls Edison's action ``part of a years-long trend among \ncompanies of misusing H-1B visas to undercut wages and offshore high-\npaying American jobs.'' The Los Angeles Times concludes that the H-1B \nprogram, although perhaps well-intentioned, is ``broken'' and that \n``Congress needs to fix it.'' And, of course, I could not agree more, \nas evidenced by all the amendments I offered in 2013 on the immigration \nbill.\n  This situation with Southern California Edison is not new. It is \nhappening time and time again. American workers are losing out because \nthe law is not strong enough to protect them, so it needs to be fixed.\n  Any proposal to reform the H-1B program must include substantially \nincreased protections for U.S. workers such as I have proposed many \ntimes in the past. These protections must at a minimum include the \nrequirement that companies first recruit here at home before they \nimport more foreign workers. We also need to reform the H-1B wage \nrequirements so that U.S. workers' wages would no longer be undercut by \nH-1B workers' wages. There also needs to be more oversight of the \nprogram, including random audits of those who use the program.\n  Tightening the law to ensure that U.S. workers have the first \nopportunity at high-paying, high-skilled jobs in this country is a no-\nbrainer. Yet there is so much opposition to this philosophy. I just \ncannot believe the opposition. As I stated earlier, the majority in the \nlast Congress--and that happened to be a bipartisan majority--pushed \nfor changes to the H-1B program but voted against every single \namendment I offered to ensure that U.S. workers were given priority.\n  Now there is a lot of fanfare and a lot of talk about a high-skilled \nbill that has been reintroduced in the Senate that would increase the \nannual number of H-1B visas. The sponsors of the bill claim it will \n``boost our competitiveness in the global economy.'' This bill only \nmakes the problems worse. It doesn't plug the loopholes. It doesn't \nmake sure American workers are put before foreign workers. It doesn't \nensure that employers don't use the program to pay cheaper wages, which \nthen in turn disadvantages U.S. workers.\n  The H-1B program could be a very worthwhile program. According to the \noriginal intent, I obviously would support it because we want workers \nto do the jobs that need to be done in America, but it should first be \npeople who are already here.\n  Our employment-based immigration programs could have served and could \nagain serve a valuable purpose if used properly. However, they are \nbeing misused and abused. They are failing the American worker. Reforms \nare needed to put integrity back into the programs and to ensure that \nAmerican workers and students are given every chance to fill vacant \njobs in this country. So I am putting my colleagues on notice that I am \ncommitted to this effort. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I \ndon't intend on allowing legislation to move through this body without \nreforms to the H-1B program that protect American workers.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/24/senate-section/article/S1084-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
