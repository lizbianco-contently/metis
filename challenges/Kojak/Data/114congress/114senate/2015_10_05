Madam President, we live in an incredibly dangerous \nworld. The number of threats facing our Nation is simply staggering. \nThat is one reason both parties actually came together to pass the \nnational defense authorization bill through both Chambers by very large \nbipartisan margins. In the Senate, it was 71 to 25; in the House, 269 \nto 151. A bipartisan committee then worked to merge both Chambers' \nbills into one.\n  Republicans on the committee supported that unified Defense bill. \nDemocrats on the committee also supported that unified Defense bill. \nThe House already passed the unified legislation, and we will vote on \nit here tomorrow.\n  Americans have every reason to expect that Democrats will vote again \nto support--not block--America's national defense authorization bill. \nAnd yet, at a time when the United States faces numerous conventional, \ncyber, and terror threats, the Obama administration is goading \nDemocrats into opposing the very legislation that sets out defense \npolicy and authorizes funds for our military.\n  Democrats just voted to pass America's national defense bill this \nsummer. Now they might filibuster it? This is part of a pattern that \nshould be worrying to all of us. Just consider what we have seen \nalready. The Senate passed a bipartisan veterans funding bill out of \nthe Committee on Appropriations. Democrats voted for and praised the \nbill at that time; then they filibustered it. The Senate passed a \nbipartisan defense funding bill out of the Committee on Appropriations. \nDemocrats voted for and praised the bill at that time; then they \nfilibustered it twice.\n  This really hasn't stopped, Madam President. These are serious times. \nIt is time for Democrats to prove they can be serious as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/05/senate-section/article/S7109-6", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, at about a quarter to eleven this morning, \none of my friends passed away. Her name was Janice Shelton. She was a \nfixture in the Senate. She worked in the Senate for more than three \ndecades, but the reason I feel so bad this afternoon is that Janice \nworked for me. Janice Shelton worked for me for 25 years. She was such \na good person. She ran my office, and that is an understatement.\n  Janice was born in Virginia, in Warrenton. She graduated from Mt. \nVernon High School in Alexandria and attended Northern Virginia \nCommunity College. She was married to Robert Shelton for 61 years. They \nhave two daughters, Robin LeCroy and Laurie Nelson. They have eight \ngrandchildren in total, two of whom I know well. Shelton Nelson worked \nfor me. Well, I shouldn't say he worked for me. I got to know him very \nwell. I read the papers every Sunday to find out how his football team \nhad done. He was a huge offensive lineman. He weighed more than 300 \npounds, all solid muscle. His brother Chris, who is 6 foot 4, was a \nstunningly good baseball pitcher, also at the college level. Rebecca \nand Holly worked in the Senate as Senate pages. And they have four \ngreat-grandchildren.\n  Janice started her career working with the Department of the Army. \nShe worked in the Carter White House in the Office of Domestic Policy. \nShe worked in the Reagan White House. She then moved to the Senate in \n1981, working as an executive assistant. She worked for Paula Hawkins \nof Florida for 6 years and worked for Senator Mikulski for 1 year and \nthen worked for me for 25 years. She left maybe less than 3 years ago \nand moved to North Carolina to be near her two daughters, one of whom \nnow lives in Atlanta.\n  Janice spent her professional career creating order where chaos could \neasily have been. In my office everyone knew\n\n[[Page S7110]]\n\nJanice Shelton. She ran that place so well and was so polite, yet so \nfirm, in what she would allow to happen and not happen. There was no \nbad language. She had a little cup, and if people used bad language, \nthey had to put money in it. She was so gracious and so kind, and she \nhad unbelievable energy. It didn't matter what the job was, big or \nsmall, Janice could handle that job. She was a stenographer, but she \nwas a person who could handle the most difficult administrative \nsituation, and she was a woman of tremendous faith.\n  Janice had a love affair with her husband Bobby for a long time. I \nremember Bobby, with that southern accent of his. When Bobby was still \nin business around here, he would bother his morning breakfast crowd by \nwearing T-shirts of mine. He ran with a kind of conservative crowd, and \nmy T-shirt didn't fit in very well all the time. But she and Bobby were \nso loyal to me.\n  Janice was good to my family. She knew every one of my children and \nknew my grandchildren. She suffered with the bad times that we had. I \nremember I was heavily involved in the final stages of the Obama health \ncare bill when she walked into my office and said: I have to talk to \nyou. She told me my wife had been in a very bad automobile accident. \nShe, of course, was available anytime she was needed to help Landra or \nme with things--those personal things you can't have just anyone help \nyou with; it had to be somebody like Janice.\n  Janice's desk was right outside my office door. She was a fixture \nthere. She was there all the time that I was. Whatever my hours were in \nthe Senate, those were her hours. And I mean that without anything \nother than the truth. If I was there until 10 o'clock, she was there \nuntil 10 o'clock. Often, after I would go home at night, I would call \nback and say: Janice, why are you still there? And she would say: Well, \nI still have a few things to do.\n  I have missed Janice now for almost 3 years. I talked to her as often \nas I could. I am going to truly miss her now. She will leave a \ntremendous void in my heart. I am going to call my kids later today--I \nhaven't done it yet because I haven't had time for anything--and tell \nthem about Janice's passing.\n  I wish words could convey to everyone within the sound of my voice \nwhat a wonderful human being Janice Shelton was. I will miss her. The \nimpact she has made in my life and my wife's life will be there \nforever.\n  Two of my staff came into my office separately and broke down in \ntears about Janice no longer being with us. She created such loyalty, \nsuch admiration for her hard work and professionalism. I love Janice \nShelton and always will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/05/senate-section/article/S7110-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7110-S7111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MASS SHOOTING AT UMPQUA COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND GUN VIOLENCE IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, just a few days ago--last Thursday--our \ngreat Nation witnessed another tragedy. While preparing these remarks, \nwe were trying to come up with what we should say, and ``tragedy'' \ndoesn't quite convey how horrible that mass killing was in Oregon.\n  Once again, a young man was able to obtain an arsenal of guns and end \nthe lives of innocent people. Nine men and women woke up Thursday \nmorning, all to attend a community college, but they were assaulted and \nkilled in a demented, sadistic killing ritual. Lucero Alcaraz, age 19; \nTreven Taylor Anspach, age 20; Rebecka Ann Carnes, age 18; Quinn Glen \nCooper, age 18; Kim Saltmarsh Dietz, 59 years old; Lucas Eibel, 18 \nyears old; Jason Dale Johnson, 34; Lawrence Levine, 67; Sarena Dawn \nMoore, 44--all victims of a deranged gunman's murderous attack.\n  Madam President, our hearts are broken for the families and loved \nones of the victims and for this whole community of Roseburg, but a \nbroken heart isn't enough, is it. This senseless act of gun violence is \nnot an isolated tragedy. Communities all around our Nation are \nshattered daily by these cruel and undeserved acts of gun violence.\n  The reality of gun violence in the United States is not only \nshocking; it is pathetic. Every day, gun violence claims the lives of \n30 Americans. Tomorrow at this time, 4:15--24 hours from now--about 30 \nmore Americans will be killed by guns. And 11,000 Americans are \nmurdered with guns each year. This year alone, we have had 200 mass \nshootings--200. Anywhere else in the world these alarming facts would \nprompt action. Sadly, here in the United States we have become so \ndesensitized to the lives taken every day by guns that our response is \nto do nothing--to do nothing.\n  Each time gun violence claims a life in America, the Nation follows \nthe same routine. Here is what it is. The same thing happens. We have \nshock and sorrow. Then we start asking questions. Who did that? Who was \nthe killer? We usually have to wait a few hours to find out who it was. \nWhy did they do this? Why did they carry out this horrible act? Then we \nwonder aloud, when the time allows it: What could we as a nation have \ndone to prevent this terrible thing from happening? But we don't do \nanything. We don't act.\n  It is within our power to reduce gun violence in this Nation and \nprevent mass shootings--not all of them but some of them, a few of \nthem. We know these tragic events almost always occur in instances \nwhere somebody is unstable or they are terribly violent, and they are \nable to get a gun easily and use it to carry out these terrible \nattacks. We know this, yet we fail to pass improved Federal laws \nplacing distance between mentally ill, violent people and guns. Instead \nof taking action, lawmakers all around this country pander to the \nextreme rightwing gun lobby and leave Americans vulnerable to these \nattacks. This year alone there have been more than 200 mass shootings--\nthis year. The United States is the global leader in mass shootings--\nthis great Nation. Can't we raise standards in this country for gun \npurchases? The answer of course is yes. We can do it while not \ninfringing on the rights to restrict access to firearms but to keep \nAmericans safe. Let's not mince words about who would stop us from \npassing background checks: Republicans who wage a rightwing ideological \ncrusade fashioned by the National Rifle Association and Gun Owners of \nAmerica. These two organizations are in a scramble of who can raise the \nmost money. That is what it is all about. If one of them does \nsomething, the other will do better than that. Each request comes with \n``Can you send some money?'' This rightwing ideological crusade, \nfashioned by the NRA and Gun Owners of America, is to prevent \nbackground checks to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists, \ncriminals, and the mentally ill.\n  The National Rifle Association is a far cry from the sportsmen's \norganization it once was. The NRA once called mandatory background \nchecks ``reasonable.'' That is what they said. Now it uses its energies \nand its members' dues to fight against even the most sensible reforms. \nIn opposition to this deadly agenda, Democrats have long sought to \nstrengthen background checks. But instead of joining Democrats in \nfinding ways to protect American lives, Republicans have pledged their \nloyalty to what was once a moderate sportsmen's organization.\n  Times have changed. Now the NRA and its leadership are committed to a \nradical agenda that allows criminals and mentally ill Americans to \naccess guns and commit these terrible acts. Is this what the American \npeople elected us to do? I think not. Is this the protection they want \nor deserve? I think not. Americans are smarter than that. They deserve \nbetter than that.\n  The majority of people who belong to the NRA believe there should be \nbackground checks to stop people who are mentally unstable and are \ncriminals from buying guns, and 90 percent of gun owners believe there \nshould be background checks, including 86 percent of Republicans. But \neven in the face of overwhelming public support, Republicans still \nrefuse to join Democrats in taking steps to implement background checks \nthat could save the lives of countless Americans.\n  We have witnessed the consequence of inaction too often. Why do I say \nthat? This is over a period of many, many years--now decades: Fort \nHood, 13 Americans killed; Tucson, 6 Americans killed; Carson City, 4 \nAmericans killed; Newtown, 27 Americans killed, including 22 babies, \nlittle tiny children; Aurora, 12 Americans killed; the Navy Yard, here \nin DC, 12 Americans killed; Charleston, 9 Americans killed while \nworshipping; Moneta, VA, 2 journalists shot to death on live \ntelevision; and now there is the massacre at Umpqua Community College, \n9 dead.\n\n[[Page S7111]]\n\n  These tragic events have shattered the lives of too many families. \nThe shooter was armed with 6 firearms and loads of ammunition, and when \nthey came to his home they found at least 14 guns--and another gun. I \nthought it was only 14, but, no, they found another one. So add them \nup--15 plus 6, or 21 guns--21 guns.\n  We do not yet know why this young man murdered these innocent people \nin cold blood. But what does it say about our country that it is \nwilling to stand by, idle, while these tragedies happen, happen, \nhappen?\n  Smarter gun laws in this country are long overdue. The lives of these \nmen, women, babies, and children are at stake. How many more innocent \nlives must be taken before we are willing to act? How many more \ncommunities and families' lives will be shattered? How many more sacred \nplaces of worship will be violently attacked? How many more colleges or \nschools will be terrorized and forever traumatized by gun violence? How \nmany more Americans will we mourn? How many more solemn statements, \nspeeches of condemnation, and frank discussions must take place? What \nwill it take before we stand up as a nation and say: Enough, not \nanother innocent American will fall victim to this ideological crusade \nof having more guns and more guns and more guns.\n  If we don't take action, we are equally responsible for innocent \ndeaths as are the sick individuals who plot and carry out these \nhorrific massacres. I have started reaching out to Senators and talking \nabout what can be done to advance the cause of background checks while \nRepublicans are in charge for the next year or so. But one thing is \nclear. To pass background checks, we need Republicans to stop acting as \npuppets for the NRA.\n  Madam President, would the Presiding Officer announce what the \nschedule is for the rest of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/05/senate-section/article/S7111-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, our Founders designed a constitutional \ngovernment powerful enough to defend against all threats, foreign and \ndomestic, yet safe enough itself not to threaten our liberty. The \nseparation of powers is a primary feature of our Constitution. Our \nFounders knew that encroachment by the executive onto the legislature, \nor vice versa, isn't only a political dispute but ultimately a threat \nto the freedom of all Americans. Thus they provided both branches with \nchecks and balances to prevent such encroachment.\n  Late last week, we learned shocking news. Armed agents of the \nexecutive violated the law to intimidate a Congressman from doing his \njob. This is exactly the kind of encroachment against which our \nFounders warned. The executive hasn't yet acted with anything like the \ngravity this matter deserves. Until it does, I intend to use the powers \nof my office to demand action and to protect our constitutional order.\n\n  Let me say more about the shocking news. In an inspector general \nreport issued last week, we learned that dozens of Secret Service \nemployees illegally accessed the personnel file of Representative Jason \nChaffetz. More than a decade ago, Congressman Chaffetz applied to the \nSecret Service; he was not hired. Now he is the chairman of the House \nOversight and Government Reform Committee.\n  In late March of this year, the committee held an important oversight \nhearing into a serious misconduct by Secret Service agents. Mere \nminutes into the hearing, an agent at the Secret Service's Washington \noffice illegally searched the Service's database, which contains all \nmanner of criminal, security, investigative, personnel, and other data. \nThe agent discovered Congressman Chaffetz's old job application. This \nsearch was a blatant violation of the Privacy Act, about which the \ncomputer-based system explicitly warns on a prompt screen. The agent \nadmitted conducting the search simply out of curiosity, presumably \nbecause Congressman Chaffetz was conducting an oversight hearing.\n  Far from an isolated incident, word quickly spread throughout the \nSecret Service, and 45 employees accessed Congressman Chaffetz's \nrecords over the next week on 60 different occasions. These employees \nwere located around the world, from London to Sacramento, in multiple \nheadquarter offices, even on Bill Clinton's protective detail. The \ninspector general could identify only four instances of potentially \nlegitimate access. Moreover, the inspector general concludes that the \ninformation was shared with hundreds of people--each a violation of the \nPrivacy Act.\n  Some employees realized their mistake and self-reported to their \nsupervisor, according to the inspector general. While these employees \nindeed made a serious mistake, at least they owned up to it. Others \nremained defiant, saying they didn't read the warning banner or even \nclaiming a right to satisfy personal curiosity because the personnel \nfiles are ``our database.''\n  Let me state for the record my admiration for the vast majority of \nSecret Service agents, officers, and other professionals. We saw their \nprofessionalism on display again last month during Pope Francis's visit \nand at the U.N. General Assembly. They are dedicated professionals who \nrisk their lives to defend our Constitution and laws. Indeed, Secret \nService whistleblowers aware of this situation helped to initiate the \ninspector general investigation. Like the soldiers with whom I served \nin the Army, the upstanding men and women of the Secret Service want to \nget rid of their bad apples more than anyone.\n  Unfortunately, the senior leaders at the Secret Service once again \nfailed their people. The inspector general identified 18 supervisors \nwho knew or should have known of the illegal searches and disclosures. \nWith but one exception, the inspector general found no evidence that \nthese senior managers reported the matter up the chain of command or \ntook steps to stop or remedy it.\n  These leadership failures went all the way to the top. One example is \nDeputy Director Craig Magaw. When briefed by a subordinate, Mr. Magaw \nreportedly ``made a shooing hand motion and stated `Yeah, yeah we \nknow.' '' Despite the gravity of the allegations, Mr. Magaw apparently \ntook no steps to learn more or stop the illegal activity, and he claims \nnot to recall this exchange.\n  Another example is Chief of Staff Michael Biermann, whom the \ninspector general characterizes as the de facto gatekeeper for Director \nJoe Clancy and Deputy Director Magaw. Mr. Biermann admits to hearing \nrampant rumors about the Chaffetz matter within 24 hours of the \nhearing. Yet he also apparently didn't inquire any further to learn the \ntruth or take action to stop illegal activity.\n  The most egregious example of leadership failure in the inspector \ngeneral report is Assistant Director Ed Lowery, the head of training \nfor the Secret Service. Mr. Lowery wrote in this email about \nCongressman Chaffetz, ``Some information that he might find \nembarrassing needs to get out. Just to be fair.''\n  Lo and behold, 2 days later, a news Web site ran an article--\nunsourced--about Congressman Chaffetz's decade-old job application to \nthe Secret Service. I wonder who the source could have been. For that \nmatter, I wonder if this kind of attitude from the head of training \nexplains some of the Secret Service's recent struggles.\n  There is even more egregious behavior not in the inspector general \nreport. Thanks to a Friday afternoon news dump, we now know that \nDirector Joe Clancy himself both knew of the Chaffetz matter at the \ntime and misrepresented the facts to the inspector\n\n[[Page S7112]]\n\ngeneral. In the report, Director Clancy states he didn't learn about \nthe matter until a week after the congressional hearing, on the eve of \na Washington Post story about the matter. As we have seen, this would \nhave made him a notable exception among the Secret Service's top \nleaders. But Director Clancy, confronted with this report, is now \nsinging a different tune. He now admits that he heard of a \n``speculative rumor'' the day after the hearing and a week before the \nWashington Post story. Yet Director Clancy says he considered the rumor \n``not credible'' and ``not indicative'' of wrongful conduct. That \nadmission alone is a damning and ironic confession of a gross \nleadership failure.\n  Let's put this in context. Director Clancy was specifically hired \njust months earlier to clean up the Secret Service's leadership culture \nafter a string of embarrassing incidents. At the very congressional \nhearing that started all of this, Director Clancy testified that he was \n``infuriated'' that he hadn't been made aware of the latest security \nlapse. He further testified that he was ``working furiously to try to \nbreak down these barriers where people feel they can't talk up the \nchain.''\n  Despite all that, despite all the problems he was specifically hired \nto fix, despite hearing rumors that obviously should have triggered \nimmediate investigation, he did nothing for a full week to look into \nthe matter and put a stop to it, which he only did once the story hit \nthe Washington Post.\n  How could this happen? How could someone hired to change the culture \nof his agency be so indifferent to potential illegal activity and to \nsuch a constitutional affront to the legislature that he did nothing--\nabsolutely nothing--until the press broke the story? To make matters \nworse, Director Clancy misrepresented all of it to the inspector \ngeneral until the report was released last Wednesday. If anything \nremotely like this happened in the Army, commanders would have been \nrelieved of command months ago. The Army holds its leaders responsible \nfor everything their unit does and fails to do, and we should expect no \nless from the Secret Service leadership.\n  Jason Chaffetz and I served together in the House. He is a tough, \nsmart guy, more than capable of standing up for himself, although I \nshould say this is not a partisan matter. I would feel the same way and \ngive the same speech if Secret Service employees violated the law to \nintimidate Representative Elijah Cummings, chairman Chaffetz's \nDemocratic counterpart. Of course, for that matter, how do we know they \ndidn't? But since I am neither in the House any longer nor on the \ncommittees that oversee the Secret Service or Homeland Security, why am \nI so outraged by the Secret Service or Homeland Security? Why am I so \noutraged by the Secret Service's misconduct in this matter?\n  First, if Secret Service personnel will violate the law to intimidate \nand retaliate against the chairman of their oversight committee, what \nmight they do to a normal Arkansan, to the little guy who doesn't have \nChairman Chaffetz's megaphone and position of influence? What might \nrenegade bureaucrats in other agencies do?\n  Second, these abuses are far more than yet another example of \ngovernment misconduct; they strike at the heart of our constitutional \norder. Although troubled by Secret Service lapses like the Colombian \nprostitute scandal, I haven't spoken out on these matters, believing my \npeers on the oversight committee could handle them, as they did. This \ncase, though, goes far beyond simple misbehavior, even beyond \nviolations of law. To reiterate, armed agents of a paramilitary law \nenforcement agency violated the law to intimidate the Congressman \ncharged with oversight of that agency.\n  The gravity of this scandal hasn't thus far been met with appropriate \naction from the highest levels of the executive branch. Secretary of \nHomeland Security Jeh Johnson stated last week that he is ``confident \nU.S. Secret Service Director Joe Clancy will take appropriate action to \nhold accountable those who violated any laws or policies of this \nDepartment.'' This response is woefully inadequate on multiple counts.\n  First, when an abuse of power strikes at the heart of our \nconstitutional order, it warrants at a minimum the attention of a \nSenate-confirmed department Secretary.\n  Second, Secretary Johnson implies there may be some doubt about \nwhether laws were broken. In fact, the inspector general identified no \nfewer than 56 instances of blatant illegal activity.\n  Third, Director Clancy cannot be trusted to handle this matter given \nwhat we know now, although, to give Secretary Johnson the benefit of \nthe doubt on this count, he issued this statement before Director \nClancy's Friday afternoon admission of misrepresenting the facts to the \ninspector general.\n  Responsibility for a constitutional confrontation such as this calls \nfor a Presidential response. Yet President Obama has been silent. His \nspokesman last week acted as if an apology was enough and implied that \nit was really just a matter of procedures not being followed--as if \nthere are appropriate procedures for the executive to violate the law \nto intimidate a Member of the legislature. He even suggested that the \nresponse thus far ``is a strong indication that there is effective \nleadership in place at the Secret Service.'' Effective at what, one \nmust ask?\n  This indifferent response is far short of what this situation \ndemands. First, Secretary Johnson must take appropriate disciplinary \naction against all Secret Service personnel involved, including \nDirector Joe Clancy, Deputy Director Craig Magaw, Chief of Staff \nMichael Biermann, and Assistant Director Ed Lowery. I invite Secretary \nJohnson to brief not only me but the entire Congress. Once he makes his \ndecision about appropriate action--for instance, firings, revocation of \nsecurity clearances, removal from supervisory positions or suspension--\nhe can explain his own reasoning. Congress can then decide whether this \ndiscipline is adequate. Most immediately, if it turns out that Director \nClancy knowingly misled the inspector general, he should resign or be \nfired. He was hired to clean up wrongdoing at the Secret Service, not \nperpetrate it and cover it up.\n  Second, and independent of workplace discipline, the Attorney General \nmust start a criminal investigation of the Secret Service personnel who \nunlawfully accessed Congressman Chaffetz's personnel file and who \ndisseminated its contents. Criminal violations of the Privacy Act and \nother statutes must be punished.\n  The inspector general lacks criminal authority, and it is unclear \nfrom his report if he was able to take certain key steps, such as \nobtaining personal emails and phone records. Further, Secret Service \nofficials sat in many of the interviews the inspector general \nconducted, raising genuine questions about improper influence in the \nprocess. What is needed is a vigorous and disinterested criminal \ninvestigation by a single Federal prosecutor at the Justice Department.\n  Senators often make requests for action from the executive branch, \nwhich are almost as often ignored. Let me say for the record that these \naren't requests; these are demands. They are quite modest demands, \ngiven these most serious constitutional stakes. Take and explain \nappropriate disciplinary action and start a criminal investigation.\n  Until then, I will be compelled to act by exercising our \nconstitutional authority over executive branch nominations. Every \nofficer of the United States, from the President to the newest clerk, \nmust understand that Congress will fend off this kind of executive \nencroachment and there will be severe consequences for attempting to \nintimidate the people's elected representatives or obstructing us from \ndoing our jobs.\n  I am not yet at the point of calling for a total blockade on all \nexecutive branch nominations, although I may reach that point. Right \nbefore this speech, though, I did register an objection to three \nprominent political nominations and there will be more to follow if the \nexecutive branch doesn't act swiftly. None of these are nominees to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, partly because the Department has no \npending nominees but mostly because this is a constitutional question, \nnot a parochial matter about a single department.\n  I take this step reluctantly and with no particular quarrel with \nthese three nominations or future ones to which I might be compelled to \nobject. I do not\n\n[[Page S7113]]\n\nwish to prolong this dispute, only to defend our constitutional order. \nWhen President Obama and Secretary Johnson take appropriate action, I \nwill likewise take action and release these and future objections. I \nhope our two branches can resolve this confrontation quickly and in \nkeeping with our constitutional traditions. The American people deserve \nno less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am here on the floor this afternoon to \ntalk about a young man named Billy Smolinski and a law that Senator \nHoeven and I are introducing on behalf of him, his family, and, quite \nliterally, the millions of other families throughout the United States \nwho have had to deal with the trauma, angst, and grief of a loved one \ngone missing.\n  I will begin by telling everyone a little bit about Billy Smolinski. \nBilly's parents don't think that he is alive any longer, but they \naren't sure because on August 24, 2004, at the age of 31 Billy went \nmissing.\n  Billy was a vibrant young man who lived in Waterbury, CT, along with \nhis treasured dog. When he didn't respond to calls and communications \nfrom his family over the course of a number of days, his parents--and I \nwill speak about his mother in particular, Jan Smolinski, who has been \nthe driving force behind Billy's Law--contacted the Waterbury Police \nDepartment. The Waterbury Police Department is a great police \ndepartment, and I have a lot of friends there, but even they will admit \nthey really screwed up this case from the beginning. They told his \nparents that he probably didn't go missing, that he was just running \naway from his personal problems. One officer stated that Billy was \nprobably ``drinking a beer somewhere in Europe.''\n  The Smolinskis pressed their case over and over, day after day, and \nafter 2 weeks of asking for help from the police department, the \nSmolinskis were finally able get an investigation started, but it went \nslowly. DNA samples were submitted and lost. It took 4 years before the \npolice department ever actually searched his car to see if there was \nany information about what happened to Billy.\n  Billy's case made a lot of news in Connecticut and Waterbury, and \nover the course of the last few years, it has taken twists and turns, \nbut he has never been found. His parents suspect he has been killed, \nbut law enforcement hasn't made progress on that potential case either.\n  Over the course of the last 11 years, Billy's parents encountered \nobstacle after obstacle when they tried to be helpful and participate \nin the investigation and search for Billy Smolinski. They came to me at \nthat time, as their Member of Congress representing Waterbury, CT, to \ndiscuss ways in which we here in Washington could take down some of the \nbarriers they faced. What they reluctantly found, as they became a part \nof this big national network of families who have had loved ones go \nmissing, was that their story was not unique.\n  Their story of finding obstacles at the local police department and \nnationally was not unique and unfortunately all too common, as they \ntried to figure out what happened to Billy. What they were connected \ninto was a national network of tens of thousands of individuals who \nwere searching for a missing loved one--a missing father, mother, \nbrother or sister.\n  Nationwide there are as many as 90,000 active missing persons cases \nat any given time, and there are some really simple things we can do to \nhelp families who are trying to find their missing loved one. Much of \nthe attention, rightly, goes to missing children.\n  Missing children have an entire set of laws built up around them, and \nfor good reason, our priority lies in finding them. Law enforcement, \nwithin a matter of hours, has to post information about missing \nchildren onto national databases. There are specific campaigns waged on \nbillboards and media outlets to immediately find missing children. But \nour focus on finding missing children shouldn't absolve us from the \nresponsibility to help families such as the Smolinskis to find missing \nadults as well.\n  Senator Hoeven and I have gotten together on a fairly simple piece of \nlegislation, and I wish to talk about it today. A companion piece of \nlegislation is being introduced in the House by my colleague in \nConnecticut, Representative Elizabeth Esty, and Congressman Ted Poe of \nTexas.\n\n  I will explain what this piece of legislation does. At its \nfoundation, it strengthens the database system that families access to \ntry to find their missing loved one. Currently, there are two \ndatabases. One is a law enforcement database, which is called NCIC, and \nthe other one is a public-facing database called NamUs. These two \ndatabases very often aren't talking to each other, and therein lies the \nprimary problem this bill tries to solve.\n  Law enforcement uploads all sorts of information onto NCIC, but the \nnet data often doesn't get transferred over to the database that the \nfamilies can access, which is called the NamUs database.\n  Why is that important?\n  It is important because families are the supersleuths in cases of \nmissing persons. Families are the ones who know all of the detailed and \nintricate information about the circumstances of a disappearance and \nthe identification of their loved one.\n  I don't mean to get too gruesome, but think about this statistic. \nThere are 40,000 sets of unidentified remains in the country today. \nThink about that. There are 40,000 sets of unidentified remains in the \ncountry, but because not all of that information--the detailed \ndescriptions of those remains--is uploaded onto a database that the \npublic can see, Billy's body may be out there somewhere, but his \nparents can't find him because they don't have access to the \ninformation. Unfortunately, that is the reality and the problem that we \nare trying to solve. If you get more information that law enforcement \nhas onto a public database, the supersleuths--the parents, brothers, \nand sisters--will have more access to it. What about information that \nlaw enforcement has about an individual who has gone missing--a report \nof someone who has gone missing in California and whose information is \nnot uploaded onto a database that a family who is looking for that \ninformation in New York may want?\n  This legislation authorizes NamUs permanently in law and then \nrequires that the two databases be connected. Law enforcement, rightly, \nhas a concern that any information that is sensitive to an open case \nshould remain private, and this legislation allows for the FBI to \ndetermine what information has to remain private as part of NCIC and \nwhat information goes onto the public database. But connecting those \ndatabases will give more information to families such as the Smolinskis \nto try and crack these 90,000 cases that are out there today.\n  The legislation also opens up a relatively modest but important \ntraining program for police, coroners, and medical examiners to make \nsure they are using these databases and putting this information \nonline. The databases don't work if the information is not getting \nuploaded. If the data from the coroner's office isn't up on the \ndatabase, there is no way a family from across the country can access \nit to try to find the final resting place of their loved ones. So this \nlegislation authorizes a small new program that would provide training \nto those medical examiners, coroners, and police departments to try to \nmake sure that information is getting up on the law enforcement \ndatabase, the NCIC. Remember, they put up all the information about \nmissing kids right away, but as we heard in the case of Billy \nSmolinski, they often don't put that information up about missing \nadults.\n  Some of these police departments are tiny. They don't have the \nresources to train their personnel on how to do that, and this program \nwould allow them to get that. In the end, we can crack a lot of these \ncases--thousands of these cases--if we are able to simply give tools to \nthese families so they could participate in the search and tools to law \nenforcement so they can talk with each other.\n  The Smolinskis have not given up. Jan has come down to Congress to \ntestify on behalf of Billy's Law. She has changed the practices of the \nWaterbury Police Department and has even gotten laws passed in Hartford \nto make sure\n\n[[Page S7114]]\n\nthat other police departments don't make the same mistakes.\n  She wants to make sure those mistakes aren't repeated across the \ncountry. She thinks about what would have happened if that information \nabout Billy had been uploaded onto NCIC immediately, the day she \nreported it. Maybe Billy was taken to some other State. Maybe the lack \nof that information being transmitted that day meant that a break in \nthe case didn't happen in those early days. She always thinks about \nwhat would have happened if she had access to more information--if the \ndatabase that she looks at virtually every day, the NamUs database, had \nmore information about missing persons and unidentified remains. She \nthinks about her ability to solve this case and how it could have \nhelped the police solve this case if those databases were better or \nmore up to date.\n  We hope we are eventually going to solve the case of Billy \nSmolinski's disappearance in Connecticut, but we also hope that we can \npass legislation here in both Houses--bipartisan, noncontroversial, \nmeasured, commonsense--that will assure that there are less Jan \nSmolinskis in the world going forward.\n  We passed this in the House, when I was there, with a broad, big \nbipartisan vote. This is the first time we introduced it on a \nbipartisan basis here in the Senate, and I am hopeful--speaking on \nbehalf of not just the Smolinski family, but the 90,000 other families \nwho are grieving for a missing person--we can get this done and get it \ndone shortly so we can get families and law enforcement the tools they \nneed to crack more of these cases.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DROZD TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                     EASTERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Dale A. \nDrozd, of California, to be United States District Judge for the \nEastern District of California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes for debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, as the distinguished chair pointed out, \nwe are going to vote on the nomination of Judge Dale Drozd to be a \nFederal District Judge for the Eastern District of California. That is \nthe good news.\n  Unfortunately, the bad news is that so far this year, we have only \nconfirmed six judges since the Republicans took back the majority in \nJanuary. That is not even a judge per month. Some would claim this is \nreasonable, but I don't believe it is.\n  President Bush, in the last 2 years of his term, had a Republican \nmajority for up to that point, but during the last years of his term he \nhad a Democratic majority. I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee at \nthat time. I did not want to do what the Republicans had done to \nPresident Clinton in blocking 75 of his judges. I said we have to go \nwith the regular order, because if we didn't go with the regular order, \nwe were going to be politicizing the judiciary.\n  So we had a Democratic majority, a Republican President, and by this \ntime we had confirmed 33 judges hoping it would set a precedent and \nstop what was happening when the Republicans blocked 75 of President \nClinton's judges. I wanted to set a different pattern. I wanted to take \nat least judicial confirmations out of politics.\n  Well, it went back to the same old, same old, doing just exactly what \nthey did to President Clinton. They have allowed only six judges to be \nconfirmed so far this year under the Obama administration, as opposed \nto 33 whom we had confirmed during the Bush administration. In fact, at \nthis rate, by the end of the year, the Senate will have confirmed the \nfewest number of judges at any time any one of us have been in this \nbody--the fewest number of judges in more than half a century--even \nthough we have a much larger population, we have a lot more vacancies, \nand we have a number of judicial emergencies.\n  This has had a devastating effect on Americans across the country. I \nhear all the time from individuals and from small businesses about how \nthey go into our Federal courts seeking justice; they want the Federal \ncourts to hear these claims and these courts are saying: We can't. We \nhave so many vacancies in the judiciary, it will be years before we can \nhear your case.\n  Last week, I spoke about the Associated Press report on Latino \nmigrant farmworkers who have waited more than three years just to learn \nwhether they can proceed with their claim for stolen wages. The lengthy \nwait time is due to the fact that there are too many cases and not \nenough judges in that California Federal court. An empty judgeship in \nthat court has remained unfilled for almost three years. The long \noverdue vote today to confirm Judge Drozd will finally fill that \nvacancy.\n  The Wall Street Journal highlighted a case in the same California \nFederal court brought by a former Navy technician who alleged that he \nhad been discriminated against by his employer. That lawsuit has been \npending for eight years. The technician has not been able to find \nsteady work since filing his suit and does not know how he will manage \nfinancially as he waits for a day in court that seems never to come.\n  One of the Federal judges in that court, Judge Lawrence J. O'Neill, \ngave the Wall Street Journal this devastating assessment: ``Over the \nyears I've received several letters from people indicating, 'Even if I \nwin this case now, my business has failed because of the delay. How is \nthis justice?' And the simple answer, which I cannot give them, is \nthis: It is not justice. We know it.''\n  Today, Nancy Kaufman, the CEO of the National Council of Jewish \nWomen, authored an op-ed which said: ``what matters to the average \nperson or business with a case in the federal courts is whether the \nlower courts are, in fact, able to dispense justice in a timely manner \nwith so many empty seats on the bench. And that is where the majority \nin the Senate has strangled the process by running up the number of \njudicial vacancies.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that Ms. Kaufman's op-ed be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Huffington Post, Oct. 5, 2015]\n\n             The Disgraceful State of Judicial Nominations\n\n      (By Nancy K. Kaufman, CEO, National Council of Jewish Women)\n\n       The first Monday in October marks the beginning of a new \n     term for the U.S. Supreme Court and a good time to reflect on \n     the state of the nation's judicial branch of government. This \n     year the capacity of the federal court system to keep up with \n     its caseload is seriously in question. Judicial vacancies are \n     rising and the Senate is likely to confirm the smallest \n     number of nominees since 1953. The confirmation of federal \n     judges by the Senate has all but come to a halt. Furthermore, \n     the pattern of behavior by senators to slow the process \n     appears quite deliberate. Critics have charged that the \n     delays in the process are intended to deny President Obama \n     the ability to appoint judges in the last two years of his \n     term, unlike the pace of confirmations experienced by other \n     presidents at this point in their tenure.\n       How has this happened? Judicial nominations proceed through \n     the Senate in a sort of formal dance, in which individual \n     senators have an unusual role. By tradition the president \n     consults senators in whose states the judicial vacancies \n     occur prior to nominating anyone. Then the nominees go before \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee for hearings and a vote. But \n     individual senators can delay a Senate Judiciary Committee \n     hearing indefinitely without stating why. Some have done so \n     even when they agreed to the nomination in the first place. A \n     nomination can be held hostage due to another matter \n     altogether or another piece of legislation. After\n\n[[Page S7115]]\n\n     the hearing and the committee vote, the Senate majority \n     leader is then supposed to schedule a floor vote, and that \n     too can be delayed almost indefinitely.\n       In fact, during the current two-year session of Congress \n     which began in January, only five judges were confirmed by \n     the Senate in the first eight months--the slowest pace since \n     1953. A sixth judge was confirmed in September, the first \n     nominee in 2015 from a state with a Democratic senator--\n     Missouri's Claire McCaskill. These weren't controversial \n     nominees. All six were voted out of committee with bipartisan \n     support and ultimately confirmed unanimously on the Senate \n     floor, and yet were forced to wait an average of 80 days for \n     a floor vote.\n       Such a slow confirmation rate is without precedent. Most \n     recently, when Republican president George W. Bush had two \n     years left, the Democratic Senate confirmed 68 judges. During \n     the last two years of Democratic president Bill Clinton's \n     term in office, the Republican Senate confirmed 73 judges. In \n     both cases, the nominees confirmed in the last two years \n     accounted for about one-fifth of the total for each \n     president. At the current snail's pace, less than one in 20 \n     of Obama's confirmations will come during his final two \n     years.\n       What's at stake? A situation where ``justice delayed is \n     justice denied.'' While the Supreme Court is rightly regarded \n     as the pinnacle of the US legal system, it is nonetheless a \n     very small part of it. Its nine justices often set landmark \n     precedents with their decisions, or at least clarify existing \n     law, but typically the court now handles only 80 cases or \n     less per term. In contrast, a total of 376,536 civil and \n     criminal cases were filed in US district courts in 2014. Of \n     those, the majority--nearly 300,000--were civil cases. That \n     year, about 55,000 cases were appealed from the district \n     courts to the 11 US Courts of Appeals. During the last \n     Supreme Court term, 7,376 cases were appealed to the Supreme \n     Court. (It is important to remember that cases generally \n     don't reach the appeals stage in the same year they were \n     originally filed.) In other words, on average about one-tenth \n     of one percent of appeals cases make it all the way to the \n     top of the judicial branch--making the lower federal courts \n     critical decision-makers.\n       So what matters to the average person or business with a \n     case in the federal courts is whether the lower courts are, \n     in fact, able to dispense justice in a timely manner with so \n     many empty seats on the bench. And that is where the majority \n     in the Senate has strangled the process by running up the \n     number of judicial vacancies. Since January 1, that number \n     has increased by 56 percent, from 43 to 67.\n       When the courts lack enough judges, a judicial emergency is \n     declared by the Judicial Conference of the United States, the \n     national policy-making body for the federal courts created by \n     federal law. A judicial emergency is a situation defined by \n     strict criteria--it is not just an off-the-cuff opinion. \n     Since January 1, the number of such declared emergencies has \n     increased by 158 percent, from 12 to 31, affecting districts \n     with millions of people. Two judicial nominees pending for \n     over six months have not yet had a confirmation hearing--\n     although if confirmed, both would end a judicial emergency.\n       As a country that presents itself as a leader among nations \n     when it comes to rule of law, the corruption of the process \n     of selecting judges in a partisan manner ought to be an \n     international embarrassment. And the only way that \n     embarrassment will motivate change is if American voters \n     organize to call on their senators to end the charade of \n     pretense that surrounds confirming judges today--the pretense \n     that in effect says, ``Nothing to worry about, just move \n     along.'' What needs to move along is the Senate confirmation \n     process with a much greater degree of transparency, or the \n     damage to our system of justice and, more importantly, to \n     those individuals depending on it, will only intensify.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. This is not just occurring in one or two courts across the \ncountry. Judicial vacancies have dramatically risen in courts \nthroughout the country because of Senate Republicans' virtual shut down \nof the confirmation process. Mr. President, in fact, because of the \nunprecedented nature of Republican obstruction, vacancies have \nincreased by more than 50 percent, from 43 to 68. Additionally, the \nnumber of Federal court vacancies deemed to be ``judicial emergencies'' \nby the non-partisan Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has \nincreased by 158 percent since the beginning of the year. There are now \n31 judicial emergency vacancies that are affecting communities across \nthe country.\n  The women and men who have been nominated are all highly qualified, \noutstanding public servants. Many of them have the support of both \nRepublican and Democratic Senators in their States. In fact, those \npending on the floor were all voted out of the Judiciary Committee in \nvoice votes. Every single Republican and every single Democrat was \nsupported. Those home State Republican Senators who have issued press \nreleases and have publicly supported their judicial nominees should \ntake the next step and ask their leader to schedule up-or-down votes.\n  Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo was nominated last year to fill an \nemergency vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in \nPennsylvania. If confirmed, Judge Restrepo will be the first Hispanic \njudge from Pennsylvania to ever serve on the appellate court and only \nthe second Hispanic judge to serve on the Third Circuit. In fact, the \nSenate unanimously confirmed him 2 years ago to serve as a district \ncourt judge, but Judge Restrepo, who is highly qualified, is being \nblocked by the Republican majority from being confirmed.\n  He has bipartisan support from both Pennsylvania Senators. He was \nvoted out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote. He has the strong \nendorsement of the nonpartisan Hispanic Bar Association. In fact, at \nhis confirmation hearing Senator Toomey stated: ``There is no question \n[Judge Restrepo] is a very well qualified candidate to serve on the \nThird Circuit.'' Senator Toomey described Judge Restrepo's life story \nas ``an American Dream'' and recounted how Judge Restrepo came to the \nUnited States from Columbia and rose to the top of his profession by \n``virtue of his hard work, his intellect, his integrity.''\n  So given these remarkable credentials, his wealth of experience and \nstrong bipartisan support, the Senate should have confirmed him months \nago. Instead, for 10 months, since Judge Restrepo's nomination back in \nNovember, 2014, he has been denied a vote of confirmation. Every single \nSenate Democrat has said they will vote for him, but he is being denied \na confirmation vote by Senate Republican leadership. No one doubts he \nwill be confirmed once the majority leader decides to schedule this \nvote. If he would take the time to schedule the vote, he could be \nvoice-voted 5 minutes later.\n  I have heard Senator Toomey indicate his strong support and that he \nwould like to see Judge Restrepo receive a vote, but I have yet to see \nhim ask for a firm commitment on a vote. I have a feeling that people \nin Pennsylvania are wondering when this longstanding and emergency \nvacancy of the appeals court will be filled, when this body will stop \nturning its back on Pennsylvania, when the Republican leadership will \nallow Pennsylvania to have their voice on the circuit court.\n  Besides Judges Drozd and Restrepo, there are 14 other highly \nqualified judicial nominees with bipartisan support pending on the \nExecutive Calendar. We should be voting on all of them today. Instead, \nwe will only vote on Judge Drozd.\n  Judge Dale Drozd is nominated to a judicial emergency vacancy in the \nU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. Since 1997, \nhe has served as a Magistrate Judge in that same court, and has been \nserving as the Chief Magistrate since 2011. Over his 18-year career as \na Magistrate Judge, he has presided over 1,100 cases. Prior to that, \nJudge Drozd was in private practice at two different law firms for \napproximately 14 years. While in private practice, Judge Drozd earned \nan ``AV Preeminent'' rating from Martindale-Hubbell from 1990 to 1997, \nand was also listed in The Best Lawyers in America publication from \n1995 to 1997.\n  He was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote and has the \nsupport of his two home State Senators, Senator Feinstein and Senator \nBoxer. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously \nrated Judge Drozd ``well qualified'' to serve on the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District of California, its highest rating. I \nwill vote to confirm Judge Drozd.\n  After we confirm Judge Drozd today, I would urge the Senate \nRepublican leadership to schedule votes for the remaining 15 consensus \njudicial nominees on the Executive Calendar without further delay. But \nthe Republican leadership continues with this obstruction. If home \nState Senators cannot persuade the leader to schedule a vote for their \nnominee soon, it is unlikely that even the highly qualified nominees \nwho have Republican support are going to be confirmed by the end of the \nyear.\n  This would certainly be the case with Judge Restrepo of Pennsylvania, \nwho was first nominated back in November 2014, nearly a year ago. This \nwould also be the case with two Tennessee district court nominees, one \nof whom was also first nominated in November 2014, and\n\n[[Page S7116]]\n\nanother who was first nominated in February 2015. These are nominees \nfrom states with Republican home state Senators, and who would fill \nvacancies where they are very much needed.\n  Let's stop this obstruction. Let's follow what I did with President \nBush, stop the needless delays, schedule Judge Restrepo's confirmation \nvote this week and the other 14 pending nominees without further delay. \nIf you did that, you would be up to two-thirds of what we did for \nPresident Bush at this time in 2007.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are having a lot of trouble moving \njudges, but today we are moving a judge, Judge Dale Drozd for the \nEastern District Court of California.\n  It has taken a year since his nomination. It will be a year in \nNovember to get to this point. The Eastern District Court of California \nis in a state of judicial emergency, so I am so glad we are going to \nadd this good man to the court. Cases are piling up because we don't \nhave enough judges to review them, so Judge Drozd's leadership is \ndesperately needed.\n  This position on the Eastern bench, again, has been vacant since \nOctober of 2012, and Judge Drozd is an excellent candidate to fill it. \nHe received his bachelor's degree in 1977 from California State \nUniversity at San Diego and his law degree from the University of \nCalifornia at Los Angeles, where he was a member of the Order of the \nCoif.\n  He began his legal career as a law clerk for a district judge in the \nsame judicial district where he now serves. Following his clerkship, he \nworked in private practice in Sacramento and San Francisco for 15 \nyears.\n  In 1997, he was appointed to serve as a magistrate judge in the \nEastern District of California. Four years later he became the chief \nmagistrate judge.\n  Judge Drozd's 18 years on the bench serving the people of the Eastern \nDistrict and his previous years in private practice make him an \nexcellent candidate to fill this vacancy. He also received a unanimous \n``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association.\n  He is a noncontroversial nominee who has bipartisan support, \nincluding praise from two judges in the Eastern District who were both \nappointed by President George W. Bush. Judge Lawrence O'Neill wrote to \nme and said:\n\n       At this point of desperation in the Eastern District of \n     California, every day of delay makes an enormous difference. \n     . . . Needing help is a severe understatement.\n\n  This is what a judge who was appointed by George W. Bush said.\n\n       Any person in a position of authority relating to the \n     confirmation of this nominee should focus on his bipartisan \n     support.\n\n  I think that is important. This nominee has broad support from both \npolitical parties. Chief Judge Morrison C. England said Judge Drozd \n``has all the attributes needed to be an outstanding addition to the \ndistrict court bench in Fresno.'' He continues: ``I know he has \nbipartisan support and I certainly support and encourage his \nconfirmation at the earliest possible time.''\n  I am glad we are voting to confirm Judge Drozd today. The people of \nthe Eastern District of California need his leadership, and the \noverworked judges of the Eastern District need his help. I hope maybe \nwe can start to move these nominees forward.\n\n\n              Mass Shooting In Oregon and Gun Legislation\n\n  Mr. President, if I might speak on another topic at this time.\n  I just wanted to send my condolences to those who were impacted by \nthe tragic mass shooting in Oregon. As many have said, as we pray for \nthose who are fighting to survive and for the families who are \ngrieving, we have to do more than pray. We have to stop this.\n  I know we can't stop every single tragedy from happening, but I have \nto say, if you look at my home State, we have passed some very \ncommonsense laws. We don't have a gun show loophole. That is important. \nIf it is important to get a background check from a federally licensed \ndealer, it is important to get a background check at a gun show. It is \nimportant to get a Federal background check online.\n  We have to make it harder for people who want to get guns for \nnefarious reasons--not to protect their families but sometimes to harm \ntheir families, harm their communities.\n  I want to say that after Senator Feinstein and I went through one of \nthese horrible experiences with some of our communities, we introduced \na bill which would give parents and families of mentally disturbed \nyoung people a chance to go to court and intervene so that individual \nwould not have this weaponry, because we knew in the last incident in \nCalifornia where a gunman came down and shot up people sitting in a \ncafe, that the mother was desperate to try and warn law enforcement \nthat this was going to happen and to intervene, but there was no \npathway for her to go.\n  This bill that we call the Gun Violence Intervention Act is very \nsimple. It says if a family member knows and believes someone in their \nfamily is mentally unstable, is buying a gun, and may well use it, give \nthat family member a pathway forward to intervene in the situation.\n  I don't know who could be against this because a judge will be \nobjective. If somebody is doing it or if a mom is doing it just out of \nwhole cloth and there is no reason, the judge will not allow it.\n  I am proud to say that California has passed a nearly identical bill \nand it will go into effect in 2016. Then, in California, if you see \nsomeone in your family who you know is acting strange, who you know is \nmaking threats, who you know is buying weapons, you have the ability to \nintervene and take your story to a judge and prevent these kinds of \ntragedies. That is just one example of some of the commonsense measures \nwe should be taking up.\n  My heart goes out to the families, but I have to say I agree with the \ncritics who say don't just come to the Senate floor and say your heart \ngoes out to the families. That is not enough. So I am calling on this \nSenate to do something.\n  Wednesday we are going to have a press conference that Senator \nBlumenthal has organized to talk about a very important but small \nloophole-closing he is recommending.\n  At this time I yield the floor, and the remaining time I would give \nto Senator Nelson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I am certainly going to help Senator \nBoxer. On the question about guns, I am an old country boy. I grew up \non a ranch and grew up with guns, but guns should be for hunting, not \nfor killing. One of the most commonsense measures is a measure that you \nought to have background checks, such as in gun shows, where guns are \nsold to get around the background check law.\n\n\n        Transpacific Trade Agreement and Tobacco Warning Labels\n\n  Mr. President, this Senator came to the floor on a happier note, to \ncongratulate our Ambassador, the U.S. Trade Representative, for \nsuccessfully completing the negotiations with 11 other nations in the \nPacific Rim on this transpacific agreement.\n  One of the items in there I had dug my heels in because we heard in \nAustralia they had a law that required tobacco companies selling \ncigarettes to put a warning label on the cigarette package, just like \nwe have to do in America--a warning about the hazardous effects of \nsmoking.\n  Lo and behold, it is now in a tribunal called the Investor-State \nDispute Settlement, which had basically governed trade agreements \nbetween countries, and they were throwing out Australia's law that said \nyou had to have a warning on a cigarette package.\n  So having been involved from the beginning in Florida with the return \nof money from the tobacco companies to the government of Florida for \nall of the medical expenses Florida had borne under Medicaid, having \nremoved tobacco stocks, as one of the three trustees of what governed \nthe Florida pension plan, and removed tobacco stocks from the Florida \npension fund, I am here to say hallelujah.\n  The fact is that our Pacific trade agreement is going to honor the \nlaws of\n\n[[Page S7117]]\n\ncountries that want to cut down on tobacco use. As they referred to it \nin the trade agreement, it will exempt from the investor-state dispute \nsettlement mechanism anything in a country with regard to tobacco \ncontrol. This is a win for the health care advocates who are trying to \nkeep our people informed about the hazards, what smoking tobacco will \ndo to their health.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield back all \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Dale A. Drozd, of California, to be United States District Judge for \nthe Eastern District of California?\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from North Carolina (Mr. Burr), the Senator from Texas (Mr. \nCruz), the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi), the Senator from Arizona \n(Mr. McCain), the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Rounds), the Senator \nfrom Florida (Mr. Rubio), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Scott), \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey), and the Senator from \nLouisiana (Mr. Vitter).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I just returned from South Carolina. I am \nsure many Members of the body have been watching this drama unfold on \ntelevision. I have never seen anything like it. I was in the Charleston \narea over the weekend. There was 18 inches in about 24 hours, and \nColumbia, SC, is really under siege. It is a thousand-year historic \nrain. I am not a meteorologist, but it seems as if everything bad that \ncould happen did happen to send the water and the rain to South \nCarolina. All 46 counties have received Federal emergency declaration. \nThere has been a verbal request for a major disaster declaration for 11 \ncounties; 1,300 National Guard deployed and 7,000 more on standby; the \nentire State trooper force is on the road; 1,250 South Carolina DOT \nmaintenance employees working; 550 road closures; 150 bridge closures; \n26,000 and climbing without power; 40,000 and climbing without water; \nthere have been 9 deaths.\n  The economic damage--we don't know yet. There will be an insurance \ncomponent, and there will be a disaster relief component. As we get \nthrough this and look at the damages--that comes later--we are not \ngoing to ask the Federal Government to do anything beyond the \nresponsibility of the government. We will not turn this into a pile-on \nparty.\n  The bottom line is I really appreciate my colleagues coming up and \noffering their assistance and their prayers to the people of South \nCarolina. Our Governor and the entire infrastructure of the emergency \nmanagement system in South Carolina have done a very good job.\n  More is coming. The rain is about to depart the area, but we will \nhave runoff from upstate of South Carolina that will flow down to the \ncoast and run right through the communities that have been hit the \nhardest. So there is a second wave of water coming.\n  My sister lives in the Columbia area, and I can say there are very \nfew families in South Carolina not affected by this. Manning, SC, is \nvirtually underwater. ``We are thinking about the people of South \nCarolina'' is what I have heard from all of my colleagues. Senator \nSchumer called. The Vice President called. I appreciate all of your \nconcern and prayers. We will hopefully get this behind us soon in terms \nof the rainfall and start building up some levees and dams that are \njust about to break. I worry about the bridges and the damage to our \nbridges. I don't think we really appreciate how extensive it is.\n  This is sort of the worst of nature coming our way, but I think we \nmet it with the best of human nature. From what I can tell, people have \nbeen working together trying to slug through this. And I will just echo \nwhat the Governor said: Stay in your homes. Get off the roads. It is so \ndangerous down there. Anybody who has to be rescued because they are \nout looking around and taking photos is draining resources from the \npeople who are under siege.\n  So on behalf of Tim Scott and myself, we are going to do whatever we \ncan, with our House delegation, to make sure our State is taken care of \nin an appropriate fashion. Hopefully by the end of this week we will \nbegin to survey the damage, but unfortunately there is more coming as \nthe runoff from upstate makes its way to the coast. This was literally \na perfect storm of things coming together to take water from the \nhurricane and create a river of rain. I have never seen anything like \nit, and I have lived in the State all my life.\n  To the people without power, whose houses are underwater, whose cars \nhave been devastated, those who have lost loved ones, we are definitely \nthinking about you. We are pulling together in our State.\n  Mr. President, 2015 has been a miserable year for the State of South \nCarolina. Some of the worst things have happened, and we are still \nhanging in there. Everybody is clinging to each other in a very \nheartwarming way. And I am sure there will be exceptions to that rule--\ncurfews are in place--but the vast majority of South Carolinians are \nrising to the occasion.\n  I was talking to the Governor last night. We can't wait to get this \nyear behind us. And I cannot tell you, from the Charleston shooting to \nthis, how tough it has been for our State. But when it is all said and \ndone, we are going to be together and come out stronger.\n  To the families who are thinking the world has come to an end, God \nwilling, it will get better. The water will pass, we will start \nsurveying the damage, and we will help those who need help.\n\n[[Page S7118]]\n\nWe are not going to ask for a penny more than we need. This is not \nabout fixing problems unrelated to this event; this is about \nappropriately dealing with this event and nothing more.\n  I thank the President and the Members of this body who have offered \ntheir prayers and wishes for the people of South Carolina.\n  To the people of my State, to the first responders, to all who have \nbeen involved trying to take care of your fellow citizens, God bless \nyou. To our Governor and her team, I know you are working so hard.\n  I would end this with a request for prayers. Any money that people \ncan send will be much appreciated because there are people who have \nlost everything they have worked for all their lives. It is days like \nthis that make you appreciate one another.\n  There is a role for the government to play here, but at the end of \nthe day, it is going to be people helping people, with the government \nproviding some resources, but we will have to help each other. There is \nno substitute for neighbor taking care of neighbor here.\n  I appreciate the floor time. I will keep the body informed as this \ndisaster unfolds.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator hold his suggestion?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/05/senate-section/article/S7118-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7118-S7119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AND DRUG PRICING\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we have seen this movie before. It was 4 \nyears ago that a drug company in St. Louis raised the price \ndramatically on a drug that was administered to pregnant women, a shot \nthey took once a week for 20 weeks that significantly reduced the \nincidents of low birth weight babies. Now we see a headline on the \nfront page of the New York Times today which reads ``A Drug Company's \nPrice Tactics Pinch Insurers and Consumers.'' Two weeks ago another New \nYork Times headline read ``Drug Goes From $13.50 a Tablet to $750, \nOvernight.'' In April the Wall Street Journal ran an article titled \n``Pharmaceutical Companies Buy Rivals' Drugs, Then Jack Up the \nPrices.'' The reporters who did the investigating in these articles all \nfound the same thing: Pharmaceutical companies buy up the rights of \nolder existing drugs where all the costs from research have been \nrecouped and raise prices dramatically overnight.\n  In its most recent article, the Times investigated Valeant \nPharmaceuticals, a company that recently raised the cost of the \nlifesaving drug Cuprimine more than fivefold. The Times interviewed Mr. \nBruce Mannes, a 68-year-old retired carpenter in Michigan who has \nrelied on Cuprimine for 55 years to treat his Wilson's disease. In May \nMr. Mannes was paying $366 a month for Cuprimine. Today he is forced to \npay $1,800 a month just to stay alive. It is the same drug and the same \ndosage. It was $366 a month not too long ago. Today it is $1,800 a \nmonth just to stay alive.\n  It is not just Mr. Mannes who is left on the hook to pay for his \nmedicine, which has more than quadrupled in cost. The taxpayer-funded \nMedicare Program will now be spending $35,000 a month to cover its \nportion of his pills because current law prohibits Medicare--because of \nthe power of the drug companies in this institution--from negotiating \nmore favorable drug prices.\n  Cuprimine is not a cure for Wilson's disease. Mr. Mannes must take \nthis drug for the rest of his life. It doesn't cure him, but it keeps \nhim alive.\n  Valeant did nothing to improve this drug. They don't claim that. It \nhas been around for decades. They have done nothing to invest in a \ncure. Instead, the company bought the rights to an existing medicine \nand raised its price.\n  Remember, I said that in May Mr. Mannes was paying $366 a month. \nToday he is paying $1,800 a month.\n  This story, unfortunately, is outrageous, and it is not an isolated \nstory. The Times reports that this year alone Valeant has raised the \nprice of its drugs by an average of 66 percent. When Valeant acquired \nSalix Pharmaceuticals earlier this year, it raised the price of its \ndiabetic drug Glumetza by 800 percent. These are drugs that have been \nout there. They don't need to recoup their costs of research and \ndevelopment. These are drugs that have been used for many years at a \nsignificantly lower price. They buy these companies--these drugs and \njack up the price. After Valeant acquired the drug Isuprel, which \ntreats slow or irregular heart rate, it raised the price by more than \n$30,000.\n  Valeant's investors and its billionaire CEO are, of course, getting \nrich but always on the backs of America's seniors and American \ntaxpayers, who pay the price. Seniors on Medicare face skyrocketing \nbills for lifesaving drugs they cannot afford. Insurance companies \nsometimes stop covering drugs altogether.\n  Janis, from Lower Salem in Washington County, OH, wrote to me about \nthe drug Glumetza. She wrote:\n\n       My husband has gotten the drug Glumetza for $10 each refill \n     of 180 pills. When he re-ordered this prescription this \n     morning the pharmacy called him to say that Glumetza now \n     costs $3,000 for a 15-day supply. His insurance has a limit \n     of $3,000.\n       The pharmaceutical companies are beginning to look like the \n     drug cartels of Mexico.\n       The insurance companies are being forced to cut benefits or \n     increase their cost to consumers who have worked hard all \n     their lives and earned their health care benefits. He and I \n     cannot continue to afford to pay these out of pocket expenses \n     on a fixed income.\n\n  We know that Janis in Washington County, OH, isn't alone. We also \nknow that all Americans face higher health care premiums when insurance \ncompanies and hospitals are forced to absorb the cost of this price-\ngouging.\n  Jeffrey Rosner of the Cleveland Clinic told the Times that the nine \ndrugs with the worst price increases cost that hospital alone an \nadditional $11 million a year and that Valeant's products made up 80 \npercent of that. Yet their billionaire CEO is doing very well.\n  Valeant is not the only company that profits from its business of \nbuying up old drugs and jacking up the price. We remember the coverage \nlast month about Turing Pharmaceuticals, which raised the price of a \ndrug called Daraprim, which is used to treat a life-threatening \nparasitic infection, from $13.50 to $750 a tablet overnight. The \ncompany Rodelis Therapeutics recently raised the price of a drug to \ntreat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis from $500 to over $10,000 for \nthe same number of pills.\n  These are not scenarios of pharmaceutical companies charging higher \nprices to finance the development cost of new drugs. Take Valeant for \nexample. Valeant spends 3 percent of its sales on research and \ndevelopment. Traditional drug companies tell us they spend 15 to 20 \npercent. Traditional drug companies will tell you they spend 15 to 20 \npercent of their revenues on research and development. That is why they \nneed to charge high prices at the beginning, at least during their \npatent protection period--to recoup, they will say, the $500 million, \n$600 million, whatever it costs, in research and development. Valeant \nis buying drugs where that research and development have already been \nrecouped. They spend only 3 percent of their sales on research and \ndevelopment.\n  So where does Valeant's money go? One might hope it would support \nAmerican pharmaceutical manufacturing jobs or pay back into our tax \nsystem to support lifesaving biopharmaceutical research at the National \nInstitutes of health. But, no, what actually is happening is \ninfuriating. Valeant, which shifted its profits overseas in 2010 to \navoid its U.S. tax obligation, buys up the rights to existing \npharmaceutical companies, lays off workers, hikes prices by eight- \nnine- tenfold, and then expects patients, hospitals, and taxpayers to \npick up the tab. It is not right.\n  As I said at the outset, we have seen this before. Valeant, Turing, \nand Rodelis are not the first companies to try this shady--and \n``shady'' is too kind a word--business model. They won't be the last. \nIn 2011, KV Pharmaceutical created an overnight monopoly on the \nlifesaving drug 17P, a preterm labor-prevention drug--a progesterone--\nfor pregnant women. KV Pharmaceutical didn't invent the drug. It spent \nno money on R It spent no money on clinical trials, which are also \nexpensive but not for them. The drug had been around for decades. It \nwas normally compounded at pharmacies and at hospitals to treat \npregnant\n\n[[Page S7119]]\n\nwomen. What did it do? It applied to the FDA for 7 years of exclusive \ncoverage under the Orphan Drug Act and changed the name from 17P to \nMakena. That is it. They proposed raising the price by almost 15 \npercent overnight. It was a $10 drug initially--$10, taken 20 times, so \nit cost about $200 for the regimen, and they raised the price to \n$30,000. Imagine that.\n  We have thousands of pregnant women who have had a history of preterm \nbirths, and their doctors say to these women: You should take this \ncompound, this progesterone, P17. The cost is only $200. You will get a \nshot every week for 20 weeks in a row.\n  Then all of a sudden the price of $200 is raised to $30,000. What \nhappens? Some places, Medicaid won't pay. Other places, private \ninsurance won't pay. In many cases, women simply wouldn't take this \nprogesterone, and the problems of low birth weight babies increases.\n  The potentially devastating impact on our country is already too high \nfor the preterm birth rate. Fewer women are able to afford the drug. \nWhen that happened 4 years ago, I wrote to the company's CEO asking \nthem to consider the price increase. The senior Senator from Minnesota, \nMs. Klobuchar, and I sent a letter to the FTC urging an investigation. \nTogether, we kept the pressure on the company. Frankly, we embarrassed \nthem, as they deserved. So far the drug has stayed more affordable. We \nneed to do the same thing today. Valeant and companies like it must not \nbe allowed to get away with fleecing consumers and taxpayers.\n  I am calling on my colleagues on the HELP Committee to hold hearings \non this price-gouging. We must work together--Congress, the media, the \npublic--to expose this kind of behavior, maybe a little shame. I don't \nnormally like to do that, but when a CEO makes this kind of money by \nfleecing so many people--especially when it comes to low birth weight \nbabies but also where people need these moderately priced drugs to stay \nalive--I think it is time to out them and put pressure on these \ncompanies.\n  One thing we can also do, if my colleagues would wean themselves off \nof drug company contributions, is give Medicare the authority to \nnegotiate drug prices. Many of these drugs with massive price increases \nare taken by large numbers of seniors who are on Medicare. We know the \nVeterans Administration uses the buying power of millions of American \nveterans to negotiate directly with drug companies to bring down \nsignificantly the cost of these drugs. For too long the pharmaceutical \ncompanies have profited off of their ability to charge more vulnerable \nMedicare beneficiaries higher prices for their drugs. Current law \nexpressly bans Medicare from negotiating with pharmaceutical \ncompanies--again showing the power of drug companies lobbying my \ncolleagues in this body--even though the government can negotiate \nbigger discounts with private insurance companies.\n  This summer I helped introduce the Medicare Prescription Drug Savings \nand Choice Act, which would allow seniors to enroll in a Medicare Part \nD plan administered directly by Medicare instead of a private insurance \ncompany. This legislation requires the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to negotiate directly with drug companies to get the best \nprices for our seniors. Seniors should be able to get drug coverage \ndirectly through Medicare and not be forced to buy from a middleman.\n  The purpose of lifesaving drugs is that--to save lives, not to line \nthe pockets of Big Pharma executives and investors. We owe it to the \npeople we serve--the people who elect us--to put a stop to the price-\ngouging that is bankrupting patients and overcharging Medicare, \nstraining hospitals, and fleecing taxpayers.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/05/senate-section/article/S7119-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7119-S7120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              WOMEN'S SMALL BUSINESS OWNERSHIP ACT OF 2015\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I have introduced, along with Senator \nVitter and Senator Shaheen, a bill that we believe will help break the \nglass ceiling women entrepreneurs face in this country.\n  This month is National Women's Small Business Month. Throughout the \nmonth, the important contributions women entrepreneurs make to keep the \neconomy growing will be highlighted. According the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration, SBA, women-owned businesses are growing three times \nfaster than their counterparts. Today, there are more than 10 million \nwomen-owned businesses across our country. They provide more than 23 \nmillion jobs and are expected to provide another five million \nadditional jobs by 2018. In addition, one-third of all women-owned \nbusinesses are now owned by minorities.\n  It is clear that we need to be investing more in our women-owned \nsmall businesses. That is why the legislation I am introducing today \nwould help ensure that the next generation of women small business \nowners can get the training and counseling they need to turn their \nideas into realities.\n  This legislation would reauthorize the SBA's Women's Business \nCenters, WBCs, program for the first time since 1999. I am very pleased \nwe were able to raise the authorized funding level for this critical \ncounseling program to $21.7 million annually. Although the number of \nwomen entrepreneurs has continued to grow, funding for WBCs has \nremained flat for many years.\n  Last year, when I was chair of the Senate Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee, we took a hard look at actions necessary to \npropel women's entrepreneurship forward and introduced legislation that \naddressed three components necessary to unlock their success--\nincreasing access to federal contracts, increasing access to capital, \nand improving the training and counseling programs that support them. \nIt became very clear that women all over the country agree that the \nCongress must take these additional steps.\n  As Chair, I also issued a report, ``21st Century Barriers to Women's \nEntrepreneurship,'' which demonstrated the need for the policy changes \nwe seek in this legislation.\n  I am pleased to say that on October 14, one of those goals will be \nachieved. The Small Business Administration has finalized sole-source \nauthority for the women's procurement program--bringing the program and \nthe women it serves in line with other Federal contracting programs. \nThis will result in increased access to Federal contracts for women.\n  The bill I introduced addresses another finding in the report which \ncalled for expanding training and counseling for women entrepreneurs. \nIt does this by reauthorizing the SBA's Women's Business Center, WBC, \nprogram, which provides critical counseling, training, and other \nassistance to women, particularly in socially and economically \ndisadvantaged communities. I cannot think of a better investment than \none that helps women who want to create jobs and contribute to the \neconomy. Women's Business Centers also provide important business \ncounseling and training to underserved minority entrepreneurs.\n  The need is greater than we knew last year. Since the Survey of \nBusiness Owners, published by the Census Bureau, was released this \nsummer, a greater number of women have started businesses. The latest \npreliminary data showed that there are nearly 10 million women-owned \nfirms in the United States. This is a 27 percent increase from the \nsurvey's last iteration in 2007 and a 50 percent increase in only a \ndecade. Women-owned businesses generate more than $1.6 trillion in \nrevenue.\n  The report we issued last year showed that women entrepreneurs \nbenefit from the customized business training and counseling Women's \nBusiness Centers provide to help level the playing field in starting \nand growing a small business. The majority of women-owned businesses \nare still under $24,999 in revenues. Women entrepreneurs receive only 4 \npercent of all commercial loan dollars, 17 percent of SBA loans, and \n4.2 percent of venture capital--so there is plenty of work to be done.\n  It is astonishing to me that more than 100 Women's Business Centers\n\n[[Page S7120]]\n\naround the country are expected to serve this growing group of \nentrepreneurs. Women-owned small businesses generate needed income. \nAccording to a study released by the Association for Enterprise \nOpportunity, AEO, ``microbusinesses can be vital for income and wealth \ncreation in underserved communities. In 2010, for instance, female-\nheaded family households in which at least one person owned a \nmicrobusiness generated $8,000 to $13,000 more in annual household \nincome than similar households without a business owner.'' For low-\nincome households, this additional income is a path toward prosperity. \nThe report goes on to say, ``the median net worth of business owners is \nalmost two and a half times greater than that of non-business owners.''\n  Liz Jamieson, Director of the Washington Center for Women in \nBusiness, a WBC in Lacey, WA, explains why we need to increase support \nfor Women's Business Centers. ``Since our inception in 2013, the \nWashington Center for Women in Business has coached and supported over \n400 women entrepreneurs, to help them start, grow or scale up their \ncompanies. We've also provided training and business skills development \nto over 1000 entrepreneurs in the same time frame. Our center would not \nexist without the partnership of the SBA. Even so, our center serves 34 \nof the 39 counties in Washington State, and two staff people can only \ndo so much, although they do an extraordinary job and we get rave \nreviews. This legislation will empower us to empower far more \nentrepreneurs from all over our state, and to help them grow their \nbusinesses and create more jobs.''\n  The legislation enjoys broad support by a number of key national \norganizations that support women business owners. The Association of \nWomen's Business Centers, AWBC, Women Impacting Public Policy, WIPP, \nand the Association for Enterprise Opportunity, AEO, believe the \nchanges we are proposing in this legislation are necessary to make this \nprogram open to more women.\n  In closing, I would like to thank my colleagues who have cosponsored \nthis legislation. I also want to commend Chairman Vitter and Ranking \nMember Shaheen of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee for \ntheir hard work and dedication to assisting women entrepreneurs \nsucceed. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/05/senate-section/article/S7120-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7120-S7121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               SRI LANKA\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to address the situation in Sri \nLanka, a country that has endured a brutal civil war and is working to \naddress the difficult issues of accountability and reconciliation.\n  Following the historic elections in January and August, Sri Lanka has \na remarkable opportunity to economically integrate with the West and \nbuild security ties. This relationship has great potential that we all \nhope can be realized. But before we move forward on greater economic \nand security cooperation, Sri Lanka must finally resolve longstanding \nissues of accountability that have plagued the country since the end of \nthe war and engage in a credible and legitimate effort to reconcile \namongst all communities in the country: Sinhalese and Tamil, Muslim, \nChristian, Hindu, and Buddhist.\n  Efforts by the last government to deal with war crimes allegations \nwere a sham, according to the U.N., according to the U.S. Government, \naccording to the victims and according to the current government in \nColombo. Justice has been mostly nonexistent for scores across the \ncountry. Many Tamils do not trust the central government to administer \na genuine and credible domestic mechanism to provide real \naccountability for crimes committed during the war. Many Sinhala \nmothers want to know what happened to their sons who served in the \nmilitary. Many combatants and civilians remain unaccounted for, \nnecessitating a comprehensive effort to identify all missing persons.\n  On October 1, the U.N. Human Rights Council passed Resolution 25/1, \nwhich is focused on accountability and reconciliation in Sri Lanka. \nThis resolution is not perfect, but if fully implemented, it provides \nthe most promising path forward since the end of the war. The \nresolution leaves open the possibility for international judges and \nprosecutors in Sri Lanka's judicial mechanism to promote \naccountability. The current government has made clear that the \ninternational role will be limited to providing technical assistance \nand advice. As the U.S. works with Sri Lanka to implement the \nresolution, I urge our diplomats to push for the most robust \ninternational role in the accountability process. I also urge the Sri \nLankan Government to continue to act in good faith to ensure that any \naccountability mechanism is seen as fair and just by all its citizens.\n  The U.S. led an effort to pass a 2014 U.N. Human Rights Council \nresolution which mandated a report on war crimes allegations in Sri \nLanka. Earlier this month, the Office of the High Commissioner for \nHuman Rights released its report which documented ``a horrific level of \nviolations and abuses'' committed between 2002 and 2011. Among the \nviolations committed by Sri Lankan government forces, the separatist \nTamil Tigers, LTTE, and pro-government paramilitaries included in the \n261-page report include enforced disappearances, extrajudicial \nkillings, torture, denial of humanitarian assistance, sexual violence, \nindiscriminate shelling, and the recruitment of child soldiers.\n  The report also recommended a series of measures that Sri Lanka \nshould take to address these issues. For example the report recommends \nthat the Government of Sri Lanka integrate international judges and \nprosecutors with an independent Sri Lankan investigative and \nprosecuting body to try those accused of war crimes, implement security \nsector reform, return land occupied by the military, strengthen witness \nprotection programs, and establish a national reparations policy in \nconsultation with victims and families.\n  Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera spoke a few weeks ago at the \n30th session of the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva. His own very \nwelcome recognition of the depth of the institutional challenges and of \npast failures is more than enough reason to insist on outside \ninvolvement, particularly in investigations and witness protection.\n  Foreign Minister Samaraweera appears genuinely committed to \nreconciliation. He recently announced the government's support for a \ncommission for truth, justice, reconciliation and nonrecurrence to help \nvictims understand what happened and help them attain justice. He \nemphasized the government's commitment to an office on missing persons \nbased on the principle of the families' right to know what happened to \ntheir loved ones. He announced the establishment of an office for \nreparations for victims. Most notably he acknowledged that any judicial \nmechanism for accountability will need to be designed through a wide \nprocess of consultations involving all stakeholders to include support \nfrom the international community.\n  Sri Lanka and its supporters in the international community expect \naction, not more promises, on each of these fronts.\n  The political will expressed by the government for a democratic \nfuture based on human rights and rule of law is something that should \nbe acknowledged and welcomed by the U.S., international community, and \nall Sri Lankans. We have an obligation to support and foster this \nvision. As a friend, we also have an obligation to identify \nshortcomings as they arise throughout the process.\n  Moving forward, the U.S. can take several concrete measures to \nsupport Sri Lanka's accountability process through the challenging days \nahead.\n  First, the U.S. should work to ensure that the commitments in the \ncurrent UNHRC resolution are fully implemented. Following the passage \nof the resolution, the U.S. should push for the most robust \ninternational role in the accountability process, to include \ninternational judges and prosecutors.\n  Second, the United States can support efforts to ensure witness \nprotection inside of Sri Lanka. This could include the establishment of \nspecial security force for witness protection, developed in close \ncoordination with leaders in the Tamil community.\n  Third, the U.S. military should urge its counterparts in the Sri \nLankan Armed Forces to play a constructive\n\n[[Page S7121]]\n\nrole in the accountability process. I understand that there are many in \nthe Sri Lankan military who seek to clear the military's name so that \nthe institution can move forward. They should deliver on that \ncommitment.\n  Fourth, the U.S. should continue and expand programs that strengthen \ncivil society voices in Sri Lanka. The country now has a parliament \nwhich is more disposed towards incorporating civil society into the \npolicymaking process. These advocates will be critical moving forward \non this as well as broader reconciliation efforts.\n  Finally, the U.S. should make clear that any accountability process \nmust include addressing violations committed by all sides in the \nconflict: LTTE, the Sri Lankan military, and pro-government \nparamilitary groups.\n  The goal of accountability is not revenge. The goal is to conduct a \nprocess where all sides are provided a measure of justice that leads to \ndurable reconciliation and a marked departure from armed conflict. The \nprevious government's policies were a dangerous cocktail that were \nslowly sliding Sri Lanka back into ethnic and religious strife. Today, \nSri Lanka's leaders have an important opportunity to move beyond this \ndivisive past. They say they want it and they have a plan on paper. Now \nis the time to act. And I am prepared to support the efforts of \nPresident Sirisena, Prime Minister Wickramasinghe, Opposition Leader \nSampanthan, and all Sri Lankans towards that end.\n  The High Commissioner for Human Rights Prince Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein \nsaid the credibility of the U.N. Human Rights Council is on the line in \nSri Lanka. I agree and would say that the same goes for the United \nStates. Our country has an important responsibility to finish the work \nof diplomats in recent years and promote the strongest accountability \nmechanism in Sri Lanka. Our credibility on human rights issues around \nthe world is at stake and will be watched closely by human rights \ndefenders and violators alike.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/05/senate-section/article/S7121-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     RECOGNIZING LITTLE ROCK AIR FORCE BASE ON ITS 60TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I wish to honor the men and women \nof Little Rock Air Force Base and the surrounding communities for their \nsteadfast support, spirit of service, and faithful dedication to the \ndefense of our Nation.\n  In 1951, community leaders in Jacksonville, AR, and the surrounding \nregion began petitioning Congress for the creation of a local air base. \nThe needed support was unattainable in the post-World War II \nenvironment, so supporters took it upon themselves to raise the money \nand purchase the land required for the base. In only 32 days, these air \nbase advocates raised more than $800,000, and with the combination of \npurchased and donated land, 6,359 acres were gifted to the U.S. \nGovernment for the establishment of Little Rock Air Force Base.\n  On October 9, 1955, the base officially opened. Since that day, it \nhas served as a strategic operating location for numerous mission sets. \nFrom reconnaissance and bomber alert missions to the ever-present \nreadiness of Titan II missile crews, Little Rock Air Force Base stood \nready. With their cargo aircraft and selfless airmen, the base has \nresponded to numerous natural disasters and humanitarian missions. Most \nrecently, with the C-130 Hercules, Little Rock airmen have had a \ncontinuous global presence. From training members of three U.S. \nservices and 20 foreign nations to supporting operations on five of the \nseven continents, they embody their motto as ``The Home of Combat \nAirlift.''\n  Over the past 60 years, the men and women of Little Rock Air Force \nBase have employed weapons systems covering every key tenant of air \npower. Currently, the base seamlessly blends Active Duty, Air National \nGuard, and Air Force Reserve command personnel into a singular fighting \nmachine, taking airmen from initial qualification through graduate-\nlevel training.\n  From its inception, Little Rock Air Force Base has been uniquely \nsuited to fulfill any mission it is presented. The support of the \ncommunity provides an unmatched strength that cannot be countered by \nany weapon system. The people of central Arkansas have opened their \nhearts and homes for six decades to welcome the men and women of the \nUnited States military.\n  I am proud to represent the men and women of Little Rock Air Force \nBase and the communities who support them. I am grateful for their \nservice and dedication and look forward to a future of continued \nsuccess and cooperation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/05/senate-section/article/S7121-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO COLONEL MARTIN L. SIMS\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to pay special tribute to \nCOL Martin L. Sims on the occasion of his retirement from a long and \ndistinguished career in the U.S. Army.\n  Colonel Sims began his military career through the Army Reserve \nOfficer Training Corps at Vanderbilt University where he was a \nDistinguished Military Graduate in 1987, was branched as an armor \nofficer, and was granted an educational delay to attend law school at \nthe University of Tennessee where he served as the managing editor of \nthe Tennessee Law Review and graduated with honors in 1990.\n  After being assessed into the Army Judge Advocate General's Corps, he \nentered into active duty as a first lieutenant, less than 2 months \nafter the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. For the next 25 years, Colonel Sims \nserved faithfully as a judge advocate during which time he was \nstationed overseas four times and deployed on numerous occasions to \nAfghanistan, Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav \nRepublic of Macedonia, Hungary, Kosovo, Kuwait, and Iraq in support of \nvarious contingency operations.\n  A dedicated and talented soldier-lawyer, Colonel Sims held numerous \npositions of significant responsibility, culminating in his selection \nas the special assistant for strategy, plans, and capabilities within \nthe Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative \nAffairs. Some of the many other key positions Colonel Sims held prior \nto his final assignment include service as the staff judge advocate for \nthe 25th Infantry Division in Iraq; the staff judge advocate for \nCombined Joint Interagency Task Force 435 in Afghanistan; legal advisor \nto the inspector general of the Army, and deputy chief of the \ninternational and operational law branch at the office of the Judge \nAdvocate General of the Army. A recognized master military justice \npractitioner, COL Sims also served the Army and the Department of \nDefense as a distinguished jurist, sitting as a senior judge on the \nUnited States Army Court of Criminal Appeals and as an associate judge \non the United States Court of Military Commission Review.\n  I ask that you join me, our colleagues, and Colonel Sims' many \nfriends in saluting this distinguished officer's many contributions and \nsacrifices in the defense of our great Nation.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize an historic \nmilestone in the city of Grand Forks, ND, the 100th anniversary of the \nEdgewood Corporate Plaza Building.\n  The Edgewood Corporate Plaza Building, located on the corner of \nFourth Street and DeMers Avenue in downtown Grand Forks, is a fixture \nin this city. Formerly known as the First National Bank Building, it is \nan impressive classical revival style structure of brick and stone on a \nsturdy polished granite base that covers two of its five stories.\n  When the building opened in 1915, it was home to the Scandinavian \nAmerican Bank. It changed the face of downtown Grand Forks and helped \nspur westward growth toward the University of North Dakota. The bank, \nlater known as First National Bank, and its building remained an anchor \nof the downtown area. It was officially listed on the National Register \nof Historic Places in 1982 and is unofficially loved as the only \nbuilding in the city with an escalator.\n\n[[Page S7122]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the devastating Red River flood in 1997 caused \nsignificant damage in Grand Forks. The bank building stood in 4 feet of \nfloodwater while sustaining significant fire damage to its upper \nstories. Extensive rehabilitation has restored its beauty and function. \nEdgewood Real Estate Investment Trust and Edgewood Management Group \npurchased the building in 2012, and it is now the corporate office for \nEdgewood, which owns and operates more than 50 senior living \ncommunities and multifamily housing units across seven States.\n  Downtown Grand Forks has redefined itself from its banking and retail \nheyday; its historic structures are now home to office and residential \nspaces, entertainment venues, and boutique retail. The Edgewood \nCorporate Plaza Building stands as a tribute to the city's history and \na cornerstone for the bright future ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/05/senate-section/article/S7122-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING WILLIAM H. SAMPSEL\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I wish to honor William H. Sampsel, \na veteran of World War II.\n  On behalf of all Montanans and all Americans, I stand to say thank \nyou to William for his service to our Nation. It is my honor to share \nthe story of William's life and service--a story that most certainly \nwon't be forgotten and a story he perhaps wouldn't have told himself.\n  William, an extremely humble man, never asked to be placed on a \npedestal; in fact it was his quiet service that is the landmark of his \nstory.\n  William was born in the midst of the Great Depression in January of \n1925. His parents William H. and Marguerite Brennan Sampsel lived in \nShenandoah, PA, at the time. His father, William H., was a meter reader \nwith the Pennsylvania Power and Light Company and would later become a \ndistrict manager. His mother, Marguerite, cared for five children.\n  From a young age, William developed a strong work ethic that would \nserve him well throughout his life. He started his first job at the age \nof 14, clearing forest land by hand, earning a modest wage of $1 a day. \nBy the time he was off to college, he quadrupled his wage to $4 a day.\n  William's high school football coach, Al ``Ali Baba'' Barbartsky, a \nteammate of Vince Lombardi, helped make it possible for William to \nattend the University of Illinois on a football scholarship. Although \nWilliam was a 180-pound guard for U of I's football team, his true love \nwas baseball.\n  In 1943, William enlisted in the Army and was assigned to Fort \nBenning, GA, for basic training. The following year, he was sent to an \ninfantry division at Camp McCain, MS. Shortly following, he was \ntransferred to the 319th Combat Engineer Battalion, where he deployed \nto France in August of 1944 as an Army engineer.\n  While in France on orders to contain a pocket of German soldiers in \nLorient and St. Nazaire, he was wounded in battle. Toward the end of \nthe war, he was promoted to second lieutenant and received a Purple \nHeart medal.\n  Now, William never told his family about receiving a Purple Heart for \nhis service. They found out after noticing his name on the Montana \nPurple Heart Memorial wall in Billings. But when asked about his \nprestigious award, he humbly described the incident as ``just a little \nshrapnel''.\n  But this only speaks true to the man he was.\n  After his service in the Army was up, William attended Penn State \nUniversity and graduated in 1949 with a degree in geology. He then was \nhired at Amerada Petroleum Co.--now known as Hess--in Tyler, TX.\n  There he met his wife Christine Wallis, and they were married in May \nof 1952. William and Christine moved to Regina, SK, Calgary, AB; and \nultimately settled in Billings, MT, in 1961. William and Christine had \ntwo children--daughter, Priscilla, who now lives in Laurel, and son, \nMichael William Sampsel, who lives in Tucson, Arizona.\n  Outside of his accomplishments as a geologist, William loved to fish \nand is remembered for his love of the outdoors.\n  William died on July 19, 2012.\n  William always gave all he had to give, whether it was his knowledge, \nmilitary service, or help to others in need. His life story is \nreflective of the dedicated, hard-working, and generous man folks knew.\n  It is my honor to recognize William H. Sampsel's bravery and service \nto the United States by presenting his family with his Purple Heart, in \naddition to a Good Conduct Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern \nCampaign Medal with four bronze service stars, World War II Victory \nMedal, Army of Occupation Medal with Germany Clasp, Honorable Service \nLapel Button WW II, and a sharpshooter badge and rifle bar.\n  Our Nation is grateful for William's service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/05/senate-section/article/S7122-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/05/senate-section/article/S7122-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations, a treaty, and a withdrawal which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/05/senate-section/article/S7122-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 2015, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on October 2, 2015, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Thornberry) has signed the \nfollowing enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 1624.
