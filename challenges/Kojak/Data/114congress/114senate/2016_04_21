Mr. President, I rise to welcome Bishop Swain to the U.S. \nSenate. On behalf of myself, my colleague from South Dakota who is \ncurrently presiding over the Senate, and thousands of grateful \nbelievers in South Dakota, I thank Bishop Swain for his service to our \nLord and to our communities of faith.\n  Bishop Swain was sworn in as the eighth bishop of the Catholic \nDiocese of Sioux Falls in late 2006, but his journey of faith and \nservice to his country began far before that. Paul Joseph Swain was \nborn in Newark, NY, and is one of eight children.\n  After graduating from Northern Ohio University with a degree in \nhistory and earning his master's at the University of Wisconsin, Bishop \nSwain joined the Air Force as an intelligence officer. He served our \nNation in the Vietnam war, where he earned a Bronze Star.\n  Bishop Swain should feel right at home on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate because after serving in Vietnam, he tried his hand in politics. \nHe completed his law degree and went on to work on the campaign and in \nthe administration of Gov. Lee Sherman Dreyfus, who served as the \nGovernor of Wisconsin until 1983.\n  After a short stint in politics, Bishop Swain answered a much higher \ncalling. He was received into the Catholic Church, graduated divinity \nschool in 1988, and entered the priesthood. Years of dedicated pastoral \nwork ensued in the Diocese of Madison, WI, and a decade ago we were \ntruly blessed when Pope Benedict named him bishop of Sioux Falls.\n  On the day of his ordination, Archbishop Flynn gave the homily at \nhigh mass. He noticed that as successors to the apostles, the service \nof bishops is to spread the word of God and promote the sanctity of \ntheir flock. Bishop Swain has never forgotten that counsel. He \nunderstands that the church has a role to play in the public square, \nparticularly on moral issues. He never shies away from the challenges \nfacing the poor and disenfranchised, and he never hesitates to stand \nfor values that protect life and family. He is a pillar of our \ncommunity and a spiritual leader to over 100,000 Catholics in East \nRiver, SD.\n  Bishop Swain's episcopal motto is to ``Give praise to the Lord.'' \nToday we are giving praise for Bishop Swain's unwavering devotion to \nthe word of the Lord and to the service of His people.\n  I thank the bishop for joining us today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/21/senate-section/article/S2351-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week we have seen what can be \naccomplished on behalf of the American people with a Senate that is \nback to work under the Republican majority.\n  We just passed two broad bipartisan bills aimed at protecting \nconsumers and modernizing our energy policies, respectively, and both \nbills take important steps to bolster national security as well.\n  The passage of the Energy Policy Modernization Act yesterday marks \nthe first broad energy legislation to move through the Senate since the \nBush administration. In the years since that time, our country ``has \ngone from fearing oil and gas shortages to becoming the leading \nproducer of both fuels'' as one paper put it.\n  It is clear this energy legislation is much needed when it comes to \nbringing our aging infrastructure and policies in line with current and \nfuture demands.\n  I thank the Energy Committee chair, Senator Murkowski, and the \nranking member, Senator Cantwell, for working to advance this \nlegislation. It is important for our country. It will help Americans \nsave more energy, produce more energy, and pay less for energy. To \nparaphrase Senator Murkowski, it is another example of how the Senate \nis back to work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/21/senate-section/article/S2352-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let us continue that work today. The \nRepublican-led Senate has made important strides to get the legislative \nprocess functioning again. We know the impact that can have on \nrestoring the appropriations process. We also know cooperation is going \nto be important as we move forward.\n  It was good to see our Democratic colleagues yesterday, recently \npledging cooperation in the appropriations process, writing that this \n``is a win-win opportunity, and we should seize it together.''\n  I have been pleased to see the headway that has already been made by \nthe Appropriations Committee. The committee has held dozens of hearings \nso far and, later this morning, members will mark up 2 more of the 12 \nfunding bills, adding to the two the committee has already reported out \nunanimously. We will continue floor consideration of one of those \nunanimously endorsed measures today: the energy security and water \ninfrastructure funding bill.\n  The legislation before us includes provisions that impact each of our \nStates. It will support our waterway infrastructure, boost energy \ninnovation, and promote American competitiveness. It will strengthen \nnational security and support our nuclear security program. It will \nalso reduce wasteful spending.\n  I appreciate the leadership of Senators Alexander and Feinstein on \nthis bill and recognize the hard work and research that have gone into \nit. I also appreciate the Appropriations chairman, Senator Cochran, for \nworking with Senator Mikulski to move these appropriations bills \nthrough committee and to the floor. This is a responsible bipartisan \nbill. It invests in the future of American energy and waterways. It \nwill keep our country safe. So let's continue working today to advance \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/21/senate-section/article/S2352-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on one final matter, I want to take a \nminute to say something about an amendment yesterday that would have \ndefunded regional commissions such as the Appalachian Regional \nCommission, or ARC.\n  While I did not support that effort, it did raise some important \nquestions about the direction of ARC. I have been a long supporter of \nthe Appalachian Regional Commission, the only government agency whose \nmain purpose is to help poor and disadvantaged communities in the \nAppalachian region. However, I am deeply concerned that after 50 years, \nARC's focus has become clouded.\n  For instance, ARC's internal guidelines cap at 30 percent the amount \nof area development funds that can be used in the most impoverished \nareas of Appalachia. It seems utterly illogical to me that at a \ngovernment agency, whose mission should be to alleviate poverty, 70 \npercent of the funds go to counties that are not among the poorest.\n  What does ARC stand for if not to help the poorest areas of \nAppalachia? Is ARC a specialized agency with a coherent mission or is \nit just another Federal bureaucracy that simply allocates funds among \n13 selected States regardless of the need?\n  I hope the vote last night will serve as a wake-up call for \nmanagement at the ARC--a wake-up call that it is time for the agency to \nreform itself and focus on the counties that most need assistance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/21/senate-section/article/S2352-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is difficult for me to be here to talk \nabout what I am going to talk about because I believe that the Senate \noperates only when there is trust among the Members of this body.\n  A man whom I served with whom I have such great respect for, and that \nis former Republican Majority Leader Bob Dole, said:\n\n       I knew that nothing else I did would matter very much if I \n     ever forfeited the trust of my colleagues. As we all learn \n     around here, if you don't keep your word, it doesn't make \n     much difference what agenda you try to advance.\n\n  The trust which Senator Dole spoke of has been broken. The Republican \nleader McConnell broke his word to me.\n  In December of 2014, the Republican leader and the Senator from South \nDakota, Mr. Thune, came to me on the floor, asking if I would agree to \nconfirming a Republican Commissioner to the Federal Communications \nCommission. That man's name is Michael O'Rielly, and he had worked for \nJon Kyl and John Cornyn. Of course, Cornyn is still here and Kyl left. \nI have great respect for Jon Kyl, being from my neighboring State of \nArizona.\n  So I said that this is kind of an unusual request, since everyone \nknows that two leaders, when we have a Commission we are going to staff \nwith our selections, he and I have a right to do that, and we always \npair them--a Democrat, a Republican, and a Democrat and a Republican. \nWe pair them together.\n  So I said to my friend from South Dakota and my friend from Kentucky \nthat doesn't sound like the right thing to do for me, but they talked a \nwhile longer, and my heart said do it, my head said don't. My heart \nwon, and I relented, after having made an arrangement, an agreement \nwith them that we would go ahead and do O'Rielly right then; that I \nwould agree to do that provided that when the new Congress convened in \nless than a month, we would take care of the Democrat. Her name is \nJessica Rosenworcel. That was our agreement. That is how we would pair \none Republican with a Democrat, as is our custom.\n  But--and I repeat--I said: I agree, we will go ahead and do him now. \nHe didn't have a job, so I was told, and so he could do that. They \npromised me they would confirm Rosenworcel the next Congress. I wasn't \nthere alone. I had my staff with me. So it is not me saying one thing. \nI don't think anyone denies the conversation. I didn't have to agree to \nthis. I did it because the Republican leader said he would do his part \nand get her confirmed.\n  I am sorry to report to the world, to the Senate, I was wrong. Over \nthe last 16 months, the Republican leader has refused to fulfill his \ncommitment. He hasn't kept his word. Republicans assumed control of the \nSenate in January 2015. I waited patiently for the Republican leader \nand Senator Thune to keep their word regarding Rosenworcel's \nnomination.\n  To his credit--John Thune and I have served here a long time. I know \nhim well. I worked against him once and was successful. I worked \nagainst him a second time and wasn't successful. He beat my dear friend \nTom Daschle, but he is a fine man. He and I used the gym together in \nthe House. To his credit,\n\n[[Page S2353]]\n\nSenator Thune did everything he could to fulfill the commitment. He was \nhaving pressure not to do anything, I am sure, but he called his \ncommittee together. He is the chairman of the Commerce Committee. He \nreported Rosenworcel out to the Senate floor. There his authority \nstops. He doesn't have any power to do any more. He did what he felt he \nwas obligated to do, and I felt he was obligated to do. It is now \nSenator McConnell's problem, I guess. But a year went by. She still \nwasn't sent to the floor. That is when I talked to Senator Thune--the \nfirst of many times. He did what he said he would do and reported her \nout.\n\n  A few months ago, in December of 2015, a year after we had made our \nagreement, I reminded Senator McConnell of his commitment to do what he \nsaid he would do to quickly advance the nomination. He told me that the \nSenate would confirm her when we returned in 2016. January 2016 passed \nwith no action. Before we left for the President's Day recess, I spoke \nagain with Senators McConnell and Thune about Rosenworcel's nomination. \nFebruary passed with no movement. March passed. Here we are, 21 days \ninto April, with no confirmation.\n  I have waited. I have waited patiently for my friend to do the right \nthing. I have held off for months coming to the floor. What else would \nI do? What else could I do? I held off, hoping the Republican leader \nwould deliver on the pledge that he gave to me.\n  I spoke again with him yesterday on the telephone, urging him to move \nher forward. He said to me: We'll do it next year. Next year she is out \nof a job. Her term expires at the end of this year. Her career will \nbasically be over because of my accepting my counterpart's word. I told \nthe Republican leader and I told Senator Thune that I would not remain \nsilent forever on this. I told both of them yesterday I was going to \ncome to the floor.\n  The Republican leader, I hope, was aware of the words of Bob Dole, \nwhich I talked about earlier in my remarks. Dole said:\n\n       I knew that nothing else I did would matter very much if I \n     ever forfeited the trust of my colleagues. As we all learn \n     around here, if you don't keep your word, it doesn't make \n     much difference what agenda you try to advance.\n\n  That was Robert Dole.\n  To say I am disappointed is an understatement. This is a commitment \nthat was made to me about a year and a half ago. We have to keep our \ntrust. This isn't an issue of my being offended. I have been offended. \nThe Presiding Officer has been offended. We have all been offended. \nThis isn't only personal with me, in taking the Republican leader's \npromise as a personal affront. It is not a personal affront to me. If \nit is, I will have to bear that. I think it is, but I can handle that. \nWhat I am concerned about is what it means for the Senate and what it \nmeans for a human being, a woman who works very hard every day, trying \nto do the right thing for a very important part of our country.\n  I understand the Republican leader has a tough job. I know that. I \nhad that job a lot longer than he has. Because of the dysfunction in \nhis caucus, it is difficult, I am told and as we see, for him to get \nthings done. But that is no excuse for someone not keeping their word. \nHe could go into executive session. We would agree to that. He could \nfile cloture. He could do this in many different ways.\n  I still expect him to live up to his commitment and get Commissioner \nRosenworcel confirmed. I don't want this to be a bad time for the \nSenate if it continues. It is a bad day for the Senate now because you \nhave to keep your word. That is all we have around here.\n  I see no one on the floor, and I will ask the Chair to announce what \nthe Senate is going to do the rest of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/21/senate-section/article/S2353-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the bill that is on \nthe floor. The very fact that we have this bill on the floor deserves \nsome attention. We have an appropriations bill on the energy and water \nresponsibilities of the Federal Government. I think this is the first \ntime this bill has been on the Senate floor in 7 years.\n  With the current majority, the Appropriations Committee is 1 month \nahead of any time in recent history that bills have been marked up and \nbrought to the floor. The majority leader set aside 12 weeks to do the \nwork that for decades--in fact, for a couple of centuries--was the core \nwork of what the Congress did. The Congress set the priorities of the \ncountry by having an open and free debate on how the Congress and the \ncountry would spend the money that was entrusted to the Congress--the \nlong-ranging discussion of the power of the purse. You know, you don't \nhave to be a great student of American history to say: Well, don't you \nmen and women in the Congress have the power of the purse? Well, we do \nhave it, according to the Constitution, but we have not had it in the \npractice of the last 6 or 7 years when the work of the Congress simply \nwas not done in a way that people could see what was going on or that \nMembers could freely weigh in.\n  One of the things about the debate we are having on this Energy and \nWater bill is that any Member of the Senate can come to the floor and \nthey can say: Don't spend this money at all. In this bill, spend the \nmoney here rather than there. They can say some combination of those \ntwo things, and then the Senate votes on that before we approve the \nfinal bill.\n  I am pleased that we are debating this bill. That may actually be \nmore important than the bill itself. But the bill itself is important \nas well.\n  This bill provides the critical resources to support the safety and \nlong-term viability of our waterway systems. One of the reasons we are \nso competitive internationally and so competitive in our own domestic \neconomy is that we have had the ability to use the waterways of the \ncountry--particularly the internal as well as the external waterways--\nin a way that makes us more competitive than we would be otherwise.\n  Our inland waterways in particular are critical to economic growth. \nWe are right on the edge of a time when world food demand doubles from \nthe Presiding Officer's State, from my State. Agriculture, which is the \nbiggest economic sector of the economy, is in a great position not only \nto meet those food needs in our country but to meet food needs \nworldwide. That position is dramatically enhanced if we have a \ntransportation system that doesn't just include highways and doesn't \njust include railroads but also includes the waterways of the country.\n  Another thing our two States have had in common--the Upper Missouri \nand the Lower Missouri--is the devastating challenges that flooding can \npresent. This bill makes it possible for us to deal with flood control \nand navigation. Once again, this emphasizes that the Corps of Engineers \ncan't just say these are the top two priorities of managing the \nMississippi River Valley system, particularly the Missouri and \nMississippi, but those really need to be apparent in their commitment \nto both flood control and navigation as things we want to do.\n  I am pleased this bill prioritizes things like the bank stabilization \nand navigation project on the Mississippi River, the tributaries \nproject that is central to our flood control efforts in our State. I am \nalso glad the bill increases funding for small ports and harbors to \nserve as vital places for us to compete.\n  You know, the inland ports are basically export ports. There is \nnothing wrong with buying things from other people, but it is better to \nsell things to other people. The inland ports serve a geographic area \nthat is roughly twice as big as the coastal ports. That doesn't mean \nthere is anything wrong with the coastal ports; it just means, let's \nget realistic about where we are\n\n[[Page S2354]]\n\nmaking investments that allow us to compete. If a coastal port \neffectively really supports an area, say, 300 miles inland from that \ncoastal port, an inland port supports an area 300 miles in all \ndirections. So this is an effective thing for us to do.\n  Also, we need to ensure that we are looking at our port systems as a \nsystem, not just as one individual port. The old days of the Congress \nbeing able to say ``This is what you want to do in this port or this \nharbor'' are now being replaced by being sure the Corps of Engineers \nunderstands its responsibility to do this.\n  Another agency that needs to understand its reasonable responsibility \nis the EPA. So once again I am on the floor for the third time in about \nas many months--and heaven knows how many times in the last several \nyears--talking about this incredible overreach EPA is making when they \nwant to decide they don't want to change the law that says navigable \nwaters of the United States are under the authority of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency--not a new concept in law at all.\n  Navigable waters have seemed to be a Federal responsibility since the \n1840s in law, in bills that have passed the Congress. So in the early \n1970s, the Clean Water Act was passed, and the EPA was formed. The \nClean Water Act said the EPA will have jurisdiction over navigable \nwaters. But with this outrageous waters of the United States rule, the \nEPA wants to now define ``navigable waters'' as basically all the water \nin the country.\n  They want to say it is any water that can run into any water that can \nrun into any water. I don't know how many iterations of that there \nwould be that can run into any water that eventually runs into \nnavigable water. There is a case before the Supreme Court right now \nwhere the EPA is challenging a company in Minnesota based on navigable \nwaters. The location they are challenging is 120 miles away, by no \nargument, from the nearest thing that anybody would truly consider a \nnavigable water.\n  The Farm Bureau in Missouri has a map that I have brought to the \nfloor now a number of times--the Farm Bureau map of where the \njurisdiction of the EPA would be under waters of the United States. \nThis is anything that deals with water: a building permit, runoff from \nyour driveway, resurfacing a parking lot, fertilizer on a farm field, \ndrilling a hole for a utility pole. Anything that involves water, \ntheoretically, under this rule, could come under the jurisdiction of \nthe EPA.\n  In my State, anything that would meet the EPA definition of what \ncould be the definition of their new sense of waters of the United \nStates covers 99.7 percent of the State.\n  The Presiding Officer is a little further from this map. He may not \nbe able to see the two dozen white dots on the map that would clearly \nstill under the jurisdiction of the State of Missouri or under the \njurisdiction of a county government or under the jurisdiction of a \ncity. That would be three-tenths of 1 percent.\n  Senator Hoeven, who has fought to not allow this rule to go forward, \nas I have since the day it was proposed, has once again proposed an \namendment to this bill. We all get to vote on it. A majority of the \nSenate has shown its concern about this particular regulation, this \noutlandish regulation--enough that the Senate and the House have put a \nbill on the President's desk in the last few months that the President \nvetoed, which said: Don't go forward with this regulation.\n  What this amendment says is: No money can be spent to go forward with \nthis regulation. I certainly encourage my colleagues to once again step \nup, as they are already on the record as having been willing to do, to \nstop this regulation. This amendment--the way to stop this regulation \nis to say that no money can be spent to move forward with this \nregulation, which a majority of the Congress, Democrats and \nRepublicans, organizations all over America, government at virtually \nevery level, county governments, city governments, and State \ngovernments, have said they don't want. The Attorney Generals of about \nhalf of the States have a case before the Supreme Court. But none of \nthat seems to get through to the all-knowing EPA on this issue.\n\n  Today I urge my colleagues to once again step up and say: We want \nthis stopped.\n  One way to stop it is not to have any money available to move forward \nwith this outlandish rule.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, April is actually Sexual Assault \nAwareness Month, and I rise to speak about two extraordinary women who \nwere accepted into their dream colleges and then after they arrived on \ncampus were sexually assaulted. They tried to seek help from their \nschool, and they were blamed for their assaults by their school's \nadministrators.\n  A couple of years ago, these two young women walked into my office. \nThey didn't have an appointment. They didn't have any connections on \nCapitol Hill. They certainly didn't have an expensive lobbyist to lead \nthem in. Annie and Andrea had heard about my work to fight sexual \nassaults in the military, and they simply wanted to help.\n  The same crisis was unfolding on college campuses across the country. \nWhen they tried to report their rapes, they were not believed. They \nwere actually retaliated against. For them, justice seemed impossible. \nBut instead of doing nothing, Annie and Andrea joined together and they \ncreated an organization called End Rape on Campus. They took their \nstories to college campus after college campus to be heard, to help \nother survivors like themselves, to make a difference, to achieve \njustice, and to hold these schools accountable.\n  Together, Annie and Andrea have helped many other sexual assault \nsurvivors file dozens of title IX complaints for how their schools \nmishandled their sexual assault claims. These young women are changing \nlives. They are helping their peers find justice. They took a risk to \nraise their voices, and now we are closer than ever to passing a \ncomprehensive, bipartisan piece of legislation to make sure campus \nsexual assault cases are handled with the professionalism and fairness \nall our students deserve. We are closer than ever to passing a bill \nthat would finally give our colleges and universities an incentive to \nsolve the problem of sexual assault rather than stay silent and pretend \nit doesn't exist because they are worried about application numbers or \npress releases.\n  I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to support this bipartisan \nbill, the Campus Accountability and Safety Act, because when surveys \nkeep confirming that one out of five of our women in college are \nsexually assaulted before they graduate, we know we have more work to \ndo. We need to follow the example of Annie and Andrea and speak out \nabout this crisis.\n  I am going to use this moment to tell one story--the story of Andrea, \nwhat actually happened to her. She wrote a book with Annie called ``We \nBelieve You.'' It is an incredible compilation of survivor stories. It \nis quite heartbreaking and very tough to read, but it is one of the \nmost inspiring books I have ever read. There are thousands of stories \njust like hers. I have others to tell on the Senate floor, but now I am \ngoing to tell you Andrea's in her own words:\n\n       After I publicly came forward as a survivor, I learned that \n     the biggest triggers aren't actually the nightmares of my \n     assault, but the nightmares of the betrayals that I've had to \n     survive.\n       When the media tells your story, it feels like open season \n     on your truth. It's exposed to commentary, and a part of you \n     loses control over it, and the vulnerabilities that you \n     intended to share.\n       When you tell your story to the media, you're at the mercy \n     of their portrayal, and the portrayal of others.\n       I've been betrayed by friends who struggled to understand \n     what happened to me, and to accept that the same person who \n     put forth strength and composure could fall apart.\n       I wish I could have said the right things to get them to \n     understand that I was broken, and that my confidence was a \n     lie to both of us.\n       I've been betrayed by the university that I love so dearly, \n     whose seal I wear around my neck, and whose quads and bricks \n     hold pieces of me--pieces of who I was before, and of who I \n     am today.\n\n  Andrea is one of many young men and women whose lives have been \nshattered by a violent sexual crime and then shattered again by a \nsecond betrayal when their schools chose not to\n\n[[Page S2355]]\n\nbelieve them or to offer justice. These survivors deserve better. They \nneed Congress to act. We have to do the right thing. We have to be \ntheir voice. We have to stand for them. The bipartisan Campus \nAccountability and Safety Act does exactly that. Please, let's all do \nour jobs and pass the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Nelson pertaining to the introduction of S. 2843 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. NELSON.

Mr. President, I rise to address an amendment that has \nbeen filed, and on which I hope we are going to have a vote. That is \namendment No. 3814. It is called End Crony Capitalist Advanced \nTechnology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program.\n  Let me describe what this is about. We are all watching this \nPresidential election campaign unfold, and a big theme on both sides of \nthe aisle is about how the Obama economy is not working for so many \nmillions of ordinary Americans--middle-income, middle-class, working-\nclass Americans who are working as hard as ever and falling behind. It \nis true. It has absolutely been a fact that this economy is not \nanywhere near where it should be. Part of that and part of the theme is \nhow Washington works for the well-connected--for the few who get to \nfigure out how to get special benefits from taxpayers. But that doesn't \napply if you are an ordinary man or woman who is just working hard to \nfeed their family and take care of their family and who doesn't have \nthe lobbyists and the connections to get special treatment. It is \ninfuriating for people, and they are right.\n  One of the most egregious examples is the Advanced Technology Vehicle \nManufacturing Loan Program. This is a program that forces taxpayers to \nlend money to especially preferred--very affluent, generally--and well-\nconnected businesses. It was created in 2007, and it requires the \nDepartment of Energy to lend this money--up to $25 billion of taxpayer \nmoney--to private corporations that ought to be funding their activity \nprivately.\n  Why should my constituents in Pennsylvania be made to take the risk \nfor some company that has an idea they want to float? Why in the world \nshould it be that my constituents and your constituents, Mr. President, \nhave to subsidize a particular business because some politicians decide \nthey like it? This is completely outrageous, and this program is \nparticularly egregious.\n  So far this program has made five loans worth $8.4 billion. Of the \nfive, two of them have already defaulted. Two have already gone under. \nWhy should our taxpayers have to make these loans to companies that \nthen fail, and the taxpayers end up holding the bag?\n  Fisker Automotive is one of them. They got a $529 million loan in \n2010. It took less than 1 year for them to default. The Department of \nEnergy--which is to say, our constituents, taxpayers--then took a $139 \nmillion loss, just on that one transaction.\n  The Vehicle Production Group got a $50 million loan in 2011. Two \nyears later, they defaulted. Taxpayers lost almost all of it--$42 \nmillion.\n  But it gets even more absurd. In 2011, the Department of Energy, \nunder this program, tried to make a $730 million loan to a company \nowned by a Russian oligarch so he could build a steel plant to compete \nwith American steel companies and steelworkers that are already making \nthis product. Why in the world should my constituents be forced to \nsubsidize a Russian oligarch? This is ridiculous. And by the way, the \nplant had already been built. It was retroactively funding facilities \nthat he already had the resources to build. This is just crazy. This is \nwhat drives people crazy.\n  The GAO has recommended three times that this program be terminated. \nThey have estimated that if the program continues, they are going to \nlose another $400 million. So here we have Washington picking a handful \nof preferred companies to get huge taxpayer subsidies. It has proven it \nis a losing program. Why are we doing this in the first place?\n  So we have an amendment that would end this program. Senator Coats, \nSenator Fischer and myself want to end this. We don't want taxpayers to \ncontinue to subsidize these companies. We don't think crony capitalism \nis the way our system should work. We think our economy should work for \neverybody who shows up and punches a clock and works hard, not the \nwell-connected who can get a big subsidy from Washington. So we have an \namendment that would end it.\n  Now, there is some controversy about whether we are even going to \nhave a vote on this, which is really disturbing. I hope we can resolve \nthis and have this vote. I will live with the consequences of this \nvote, as we all have to. But if there are people who like this program \nand think that our taxpayers should continue being forced to give away \nmoney and subsidize preferred special interests, OK, come on down to \nthe floor and make the case. Argue for why we should continue this \ncrony capitalism, and why it is that politicians ought to put their \nthumbs on the scale of our economy and divert taxpayer dollars to \npreferred interests. Come on down and make the case. At least have the \ncourage of your convictions, and let's have a vote. That is all I am \nasking for.\n  So I am hoping we will get this. I am hoping we will have a vote and, \nof course, I am hoping we will end a terrible program that undermines \nthe confidence the American people have in our government. We could \ntake a step in the right direction of restoring some confidence that \nthis town can figure out what to do and can take steps to help our \neconomy be fairer, more open, and more successful for all Americans.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/21/senate-section/article/S2355-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2355-S2357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I recently had the opportunity to convene \na roundtable at the University of Baltimore School of Law entitled: \n``Why Nine? A Discussion on the Importance of a Fully Functioning \nSupreme Court.'' I want to particularly thank the dean of the \nUniversity of Baltimore Law School, Ronald Weich, for moderating this \nroundtable and bringing his extensive experience to this discussion. \nRon Weich is well known here. He is the former chief counsel to Senate \nMinority Leader Reid and former Assistant Attorney General for \nLegislative Affairs at the U.S. Justice Department.\n  I want to share with my colleagues some of the comments that were \nmade by the people who were at that roundtable discussion.\n  Caroline Frederickson, the president of the American Constitution \nSociety, discussed the lengthy delays for trial and appellate court \ndecisions. Lengthy delays in filling vacancies mean that justice \ndelayed is justice denied. We have seen a growing number of judicial \nemergencies as a result of the Senate leadership's slow-walking of the \nconsideration of judicial nominations, as I discussed recently on the \nfloor of the Senate. One of these is my own State of Maryland's \ndistrict court vacancy, in which Paula Xinis has been waiting for floor \naction now since she was reported out of the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously in September of 2015. She has waited over 7 months for \naction on the floor of the Senate.\n  Ms. Frederickson also noted the increasing number of 4-to-4 decisions \nbeing issued by the Supreme Court. She warned that a Court that is \nsplit on a tough 4-to-4 decision might be tempted to ``legislate'' a \nsolution by asking the parties to reshape the legal questions before \nthe Court and go beyond the narrow case or controversy that is properly \nbefore the Court. That is something all of us want to avoid. We don't \nwant the Court legislating.\n  John Greenbaum, chief counsel and senior deputy director of the \nLawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told the group that if \nRepublicans hold to their pledge to block the filling of the Supreme \nCourt vacancy until a new President takes office, this vacancy would \nspan and negatively impact two terms of the Court and could last more \nthan a year.\n\n[[Page S2356]]\n\n  The Presidential election occurs in November of 2016, but the new \nPresident is not sworn into office until late January 2017. Allowing \nfor several months, which is the standard time for consideration of a \nSupreme Court nominee, it could be next spring of 2017, more than a \nyear after Justice Scalia's death before the vacancy is filled.\n  Mr. Greenbaum noted that the Court issued a number of 5-to-4 \ndecisions in the current term, many of which drew a wide range of \namicus briefs from all sides on the issue, and that the Court was \ntrying to resolve circuit splits in a number of these cases. It cannot \nresolve circuit splits with a 4-to-4 vote, leaving us with different \nlaws in different parts of the country.\n  Michele Jawando, vice president of legal progress at the Center for \nAmerican Progress, discussed focusing the American people's attention \non the third branch of government--the judiciary--which often does not \nreceive the same level of focus as the executive and legislative \nbranches.\n  Professor Charles Tiefer, a professor at the University of Baltimore \nSchool of Law, previously served as deputy general counsel of the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives and served as assistant legal counsel for the \nU.S. Senate. He formerly clerked on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit, the court that Chief Judge Garland \ncurrently sits. Professor Tiefer cited two interesting precedents we \nshould keep in mind as the Senate considers--or, frankly, fails to \nconsider--Chief Judge Garland's nomination.\n  In 1988, the Senate confirmed Justice Kennedy to the Supreme Court, \neven though the Senate was controlled by a Democratic majority and \nPresident Reagan was in his final year of office--very similar to the \ncircumstances we have today. In 1991, when Democrats controlled the \nSenate, they allowed the nomination of Clarence Thomas to reach the \nSenate floor even though the Judiciary Committee had not favorably \nrecommended him. The Judiciary Committee, under Chairman Biden, \nbelieved the full Senate should debate a nomination for the Supreme \nCourt of the United States and that each Senator should cast their vote \neither for or against the nomination. Ultimately, the Senate narrowly \nconfirmed Justice Thomas by a 52-to-48 vote.\n  Indeed, turning to Judge Garland, no nominee--and, really, no \nPresident--has ever been treated this way by the Senate. Since public \nconfirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominations began a century ago \nin the Judiciary Committee, the Senate has never denied a Supreme Court \nnominee a hearing and a vote. This would be the first. By refusing to \nfollow this practice, the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senate \nleadership are abrogating their constitutional duties. This is an \naffront to the Constitution. It is not a political assault. This is an \nassault on the Constitution.\n  Turning to article II, the Executive power in the Constitution, the \nSenate Republican leadership is trying to unilaterally alter the term \nof the President from 4 years to 3 years and somehow argue that the \nPresident in his or her final year of office cannot do his or her job, \nwhich includes nominating Supreme Court Justices if a vacancy occurs. \nThis flies in the face of the plain text of the Constitution. The \nConstitution commands that the President ``shall'' nominate Supreme \nCourt Justices in the event of a vacancy. The Senate is failing to \nexercise its constitutional duty to advise and consent.\n  Turning to article III, the judicial power of the Constitution, the \nSenate leadership is trying to unilaterally shrink the Supreme Court \nfrom nine justices to eight by creating an artificial vacancy for an \nindefinite period of time. Congress, by enacting a statute, has already \nset the size of the Supreme Court as consisting of nine justices. There \nis an odd number for a reason--to enable the Court to break tie votes. \nThe Senate Republican leadership is pursuing a strategy that will \nhobble the Court for two terms.\n  This results in an increasing number of circuit splits and a \nnonuniform application of Federal law across the country, with no \nresolution in sight, meaning that an individual's rights and \nresponsibilities under Federal law would depend on what circuit they \nhappen to live in or do business in.\n  Article VI of the Constitution provides that ``the Senators and \nRepresentatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State \nLegislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the \nUnited States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath of \nAffirmation, to support this Constitution.'' And I will say that what \nwe are doing right now is abrogating that right.\n  Professor Michael Higginbotham is the Dean Joseph Curtis Professor at \nthe University of Baltimore School of Law, and he was a former law \nclerk to a U.S. circuit judge. Professor Higginbotham agreed it is \nunprecedented for the Senate not even to consider or vote on a \nnomination for a Supreme Corporate Justice. He cited the famous case of \nMarbury v. Madison, decided by the Supreme Court in 1803. The case held \nthat a constitutional right without a remedy is no right at all, and \nthat a right must have a remedy. But what happens when the Supreme \nCourt cannot issue a final decision on a complex or controversial case \nin the law? What is the remedy that follows that right? What happens \nwhen one branch of government refuses to do its job, endangering the \noperation of another equal and independent branch of government? A \nSupreme Court that divides by a vote of 4 to 4 in major decisions leads \nto uncertainty and lack of specificity in the law, due to splits in the \nvarious circuit courts of appeal around the Nation.\n  Amy Matsui is the senior counsel and director of government relations \nat the National Women's Law Center. She reminded us that women's lives \nare affected every day by the decisions of the Supreme Court and lower \nFederal courts. Lawyers have an innate respect for the rule of law and \nlegal process. If lawyers report to work and do their job every day, \nwhy can't the Senate? She asked a good question.\n\n  Thiru Vignarajah is the Deputy Attorney General of Maryland, serving \nunder the leadership of Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh. He \ndiscussed the importance of the judiciary being able to function \nindependently and efficiently. Out of the thousands of petitions for \ncertiorari, the Supreme Court grants about 1 percent of the cases, \nultimately deciding about 150 cases a year. Dozens of these cases were \n5-to-4 decisions of a divided Supreme Court. These are hard cases where \nreasonable jurists can disagree, and indeed a number of these cases \nhave split circuit courts around the Nation, with judges issuing \nconflicting decisions on differing interpretations of Federal law.\n  This uncertainty is bad for the marketplace, bad for business, bad \nfor lawyers, bad for judges, bad for litigants, and ultimately bad for \nthe American people. Quite frankly, in some cases, businesses would \nprefer any ruling because it at least gives certainty about what the \nlaw is. Businesses do not want Federal law to become a patchwork and \nvary from circuit to circuit and State to State because a divided \nSupreme Court cannot resolve the issue.\n  Kyle Barry, the director of justice programs at the Alliance of \nJustice, discussed the importance of judicial independence. While the \nPresident has the power of the sword and controls government agencies \nand the Congress has the power of the purse and the ability to enact or \nchange laws, the judiciary relies on the other branches of government \nand the American people to carry out its decisions.\n  The Framers of our Constitution gave the Justices lifetime tenure \nbecause it insulates them from the political pressures under Article \nIII, Section 1, of the Constitution, so that they would not have to \nworry about losing their job through congressional impeachment if they \nreached an unpopular decision. Note that these are the only lifetime \npositions in the Federal Government. The Framers forbade Congress from \ncutting the salaries of the Justices while in office under Article III, \nSection 1, of the Constitution, to avoid retribution from Congress for \nunpopular decisions of the Court.\n  By undermining the independence of the Supreme Court and by making \nthe Court appear to be a political entity, Republican Senate leadership \nis undermining the public's confidence in the Court and ultimately the \nvery legitimacy of the Court. Our Framers intended with these very \nspecific constitutional provisions to protect the Court and the Federal \njudiciary from politics.\n\n[[Page S2357]]\n\n  The Senate should do its job and carry out its mission to fill \nvacancies of the Supreme Court, so that Americans will have confidence \nthat the Supreme Court decides cases based on the law, Constitution, \nand facts of the case and so that politics does not play a role. The \nAmerican public supports Congress doing its job and giving Judge \nGarland the hearing he deserves.\n  The stakes at the Supreme Court can involve matters of life and \ndeath. In death penalty cases, if the Court splits 4 to 4, a defendant \nwould be put to death even though the Court decision did not \ndefinitively resolve the legal issue in the case.\n  Chief Judge Garland is a nominee for the Supreme Court and should be \ndealt with in this term of Congress. It is not a matter for the next \nPresident or the next Congress. There are 9 months left in this year, \nand to suggest that we don't have the time and the President doesn't \nhave the authority to appoint a nominee is absolutely outrageous. It is \nan affront to the Constitution.\n  We need to go through the process and give Chief Judge Garland a \nchance. I have met with Chief Judge Garland and believe he is eminently \nqualified to be a Supreme Court Justice. But before the Senate makes a \nfinal decision, we need to do our job and vet the nominee, hold a \nhearing, and hold a vote that puts all Senators on the record. How can \nSenators in good conscience reject this Supreme Court nominee without a \nfair vetting and hearing or process? I think it is hard to understand \nhow you can be excused from doing your job for 9 months by not having a \nconfirmation hearing and vote. The President did his job, and it is now \ntime for the Senate to do its job.\n  The American people want to see nine justices on the Supreme Court \nwhen it convenes its new term in October. The Senate now has the \nresponsibility and duty to respect the independence of the Federal \njudiciary, the authority of the President to nominate Justices, and the \npowers of the Senate to advise and consent on nominations.\n  Let's remember our oaths to support the Constitution. Let's do our \njob. Let's take up the Garland nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We saw rivers literally catch on fire as \na result of polluted waterways. We had Lake Erie, which was considered \ndead. The Chesapeake Bay was one of the world's first marine dead \nzones. That is nothing to be proud of. The environment and status of \nour water was a national disgrace, and through congressional \nleadership, we passed the Clean Water Act. We did that because we \nunderstood that the status of upstream water affects the status of \ndownstream water--that we are all in this together. We understood that \nhaving clean water was a public health issue, from swimming in the \nwater to the source of our drinking water supplies. One third of our \ndrinking water supplies come from regulated waters.\n  We also understood it was important for our economy. The status of \ntourism very much depended upon the quality of our water. Literally, \npeople were concerned about going close to some of our inner harbor \nwater areas. The Baltimore Inner Harbor is a tourist attraction, as are \nthe inner harbors of many of our cities. It is important for our \neconomy for agriculture. Agriculture depends upon clean water. We \nunderstood that when we passed the Clean Water Act in 1972. And we also \nunderstood it was a matter of quality of life for the people in our \ncountry. From those who hike and do bird watching to those who enjoy \nfishing and hunting, the status of clean water very much affects the \nway we enjoy life.\n  As Senators from Maryland, Senator Mikulski and I both understand the \nimportance of clean water for the Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay is \na national treasure and the largest estuary in our hemisphere. It was \nat great risk because of waters coming in from other States into the \nChesapeake Bay watershed, affecting the quality of water of the \nChesapeake Bay.\n  It was for all those reasons that we passed the 1972 Clean Water Act. \nWe understood the enforcement of the waters that were regulated under \nthe 1972 Clean Water Act. It was based upon best science.\n  Science told us what we needed to do in order to have clean water--\nclean water for our environment, clean water for safe drinking water--\nand it was well understood until a Supreme Court decision. That \ndecision in 2006, known as the Rapanos decision, was a 5-to-4 decision \nof the Supreme Court, which remanded the case, but it was a 4-to-4 \ndecision on the merits of the case. Since that time, there has been \nuncertainty as to what bodies of water can be regulated under the Clean \nWater Act. So this was a situation caused by the ambiguity of the \nSupreme Court case. It is interesting that the decision on the merits \nwas 4-to-4, as we are now debating whether we are going to have a full \nSupreme Court in order to make decisions that affect the clarity of law \nin this country.\n  The Rapanos decision sent back to the lower courts a decision on how \nto decide this. Since that time, there has been uncertainty as to what \nbodies are legally regulated under the 1972 Clean Water Act. Remember, \nthis was 2006. The easiest way to resolve this was for Congress to pass \na law clarifying the Clean Water Act, but Congress has chosen not to do \nthat. So the Obama administration has done what it should do, using its \npower to promulgate a regulation that would provide clarity as to which \nbodies of water are regulated. Guess what. They have done that in a way \nthat is consistent with how the law was enforced prior to the Rapanos \ndecision--without much complaint before the Rapanos decision. It \nbasically goes back to best science and tells us logically what needs \nto be regulated. That is what this rule would do: Protect our clean \nwater.\n  There is a lot of misinformation that has been given about the clean \nwater rule. Quite frankly, normal farming activities don't require any \npermits under the Clean Water Act. If we listen to some of the \narguments against the Clean Water Act, we would have a hard time \ncomparing that to what, in fact, is in the bill.\n  The Clean Water Act would reestablish the well-thought regulatory \nframework for protecting our clean water so that we don't return to the \ndays of jeopardizing the Chesapeake Bay or jeopardizing our rivers or \njeopardizing our clean water supplies or our environment.\n  Tomorrow is Earth Day. Forty-six years ago, our colleague Senator \nGaylord Nelson established Earth Day. What will this Congress's legacy \nbe? What will we be remembered for in regards to protecting this \nplanet, protecting our country, and protecting our environment for \nfuture generations? I\n\n[[Page S2358]]\n\nhope we will work together to build on the proud accomplishments of our \npredecessors for clean air and clean water. The first thing we can do \nis to make sure we reject the Hoeven amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today in support of \nthe Energy and Water Appropriations bill. I am pleased to see Senators \nAlexander and Feinstein working to put together a good, bipartisan bill \nwith no ideological or partisan policy riders.\n  They remind us of the way that we should be doing business here in \nthe Senate. This legislation provides increased funding for \ninfrastructure across the Nation and in my home State of Illinois, and \nI was proud to support it in the Appropriations Committee.\n  The bill provides strong funding for the National Labs through the \nDepartment of Energy, including critical research programs at Fermi \nNational Accelerator Laboratory and Argonne National Laboratory in \nIllinois. These labs are supporting thousands of scientists from across \nthe country and around the world as they perform pioneering research \nand transform technologies for science and industry. Lab facilities in \nIllinois perform cutting-edge research and are a bright example of \nAmerican innovation.\n  The Energy and Water Appropriations bill would invest $6 billion in \nthe Army Corps of Engineers, which will help support important \ninvestments in Illinois infrastructure. Waterways in Illinois, \nincluding the Mississippi River, are critical to commerce around the \ncountry. They provide access for shipped goods, connecting the Great \nLakes with the Gulf of Mexico. The Army Corps also plays an important \nrole in flood control projects, something we saw firsthand in Illinois \nand across the Mississippi valley area after flooding this past winter.\n  But there is always more work to be done. According to the American \nSociety of Civil Engineers, America scores a D-minus in investment in \nlevees and inland waterways, and a D in investment in dams. This bill \nis a good start to making the critical investments we need in American \ninfrastructure.\n  So I am not sure why, after Senator Alexander and Senator Feinstein \npulled together such a strong bipartisan bill, Republicans would want \nto try to add a poison pill rider preventing an EPA rule that keeps our \nwater clean.\n  Many economists and military leaders tell us that water will be to \nthe 21st century what oil was to the 20th century. Water is going to be \nthat indispensable commodity that makes progress possible; an essential \ncommodity over which wars will be fought. The United States has more \nclean water today than any other nation on the planet, and it is \nbecause of the Great Lakes. Why would we knowingly, deliberately, spoil \nthis precious commodity that is a source of conflict between other \nnations?\n  We can't afford to stop making a real difference in our clean water \nsupply, and let me tell you why.\n  The EPA and Army Corps clean water rule provides stronger water \nquality standards to protect our Nation's streams, wetlands, and \nnavigable water. These are all resources that we rely heavily on for \ndrinking water and recreation. And one in three Americans, or 117 \nmillion people, get drinking water from sources that were vulnerable to \npollution before the clean water rule. Now, more than ever, we must \nwork to ensure our water is safe.\n  We know what can happen when our water supply isn't protected. The \nFlint, MI, water contamination crisis and high lead levels in the water \nsupply in other communities across the country and in Illinois are \nreminders of this. But it is not just lead that we have to worry about. \nPollutants from factories and sewage treatment plants; waste from \nconfined animal feeding operations; pesticides used on crops; and \nmining wastewater all flow into tributaries that eventually flow into \nthe Great Lakes, the source of clean water for 35 million people.\n  Attempts to roll back the clean water rule will not only return us to \na patchwork of water protections that make it difficult for businesses, \nfarmers, and others to know whether waterways are covered by the law. \nIt will also risk one of our greatest commodities that supports \nagriculture, recreation, tourism, and energy production.\n  To see the impacts of rolling back these protections, we need to look \nno further than the Gulf of Mexico, which has one of the largest dead \nzones in the world. Let me tell you what a dead zone is: Dead zones are \nthe result of an overabundance of algae growth, which eventually \ndecompose and steal oxygen from the water, making it hard for anything \nto live. Nutrient runoff from 12 States along the Mississippi River \ntrickles down into the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Last year, the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico reached 6,474 square \nmiles, roughly the size of the State of Connecticut. The State of \nIllinois was one of the largest contributors to this nutrient overload, \na combination of runoff from our farm fields and point source pollution \nsuch as wastewater plants. We need to reduce this nutrient runoff while \nprotecting our agriculture economy in Illinois. The clean water rule \ndoes exactly that by exempting agricultural activities from its \nprovisions.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against any ideological poison pill \namendment that would prevent clean water appropriations from moving \nforward to protect our children, our communities, and our economy.\n  Without ideological riders like the clean water rule amendment, the \nEnergy and Water Appropriations bill is a bipartisan effort that proves \nwe can make smart investments that make the most sense for our \ncountry--right now and as we plan for our future. The current lead \ncrisis has shown that we need to get serious about investing in \ninfrastructure programs and support regulations to ensure that every \nAmerican--especially children--has access to safe, clean drinking \nwater.\n  Now is the time for Congress to act responsibly to develop a budget \nthat enables our country to thrive.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this is No. 40 of ``Waste of the Week.'' \nFor the 40 weeks the Senate has been in session this cycle, I have come \ndown to the Floor to talk about a waste of taxpayers' dollars through \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. This week I am going to talk about yet another \nFederal program which has, at best, a questionable track record.\n  I filed an amendment to the Energy and Water appropriations bill \ncurrently in the Senate, which is related to this program, and \nhopefully we will be voting on the amendment I will be offering in a \nfew moments to address this issue. This amendment, which I offered with \nSenators Fischer, Toomey, and Flake, would finally wind down the \nDepartment of Energy's failed Advanced Technology Vehicles \nManufacturing Loan Program.\n  Remember the stimulus? Remember how we were throwing all kinds of \ntaxpayers' money out there? We talked about advanced vehicle programs, \nand many of these distributions of funds have been misused or simply \nhave not come to fruition, and a great deal of money has been wasted.\n  The ATVM Loan Program continues to sit on billions of dollars of \nunused funds that could be put to better use. I am glad there are some \nunused funds there because it means that when we look at the history of \nthis program, perhaps we will have an opportunity to better use those \nunused funds or to help return it back to the Treasury so the taxpayer \nisn't on the hook for this kind of thing going forward.\n  Let me explain this program. The Department of Energy's Advanced \nVehicle Technology Manufacturing Loan Program was created in 2007. It \nwas created to provide very low-interest loans to manufacturers that \nmake vehicles or components of vehicles that use alternative energy.\n  I am not here to downplay the use of alternative energy. I think that \nis something that is happening throughout our country. Hopefully, it is \non a market basis. To qualify for this loan, there were a couple of \nrequirements applicants must meet: No. 1, the vehicle or component must \nbe new or significantly improved from what is currently available in \nthe U.S. marketplace; No. 2, it has to be manufactured in the United \nStates. The purpose of the program, partly, was to encourage \nmanufacturing here--not in China, not somewhere else.\n\n[[Page S2359]]\n\n  Last month, nearly 10 years since the program's inception, the \nGovernment Accountability Office took a look at the program's finances \nand found that the Department of Energy has billions of unused and \nunspent funds. I am glad they do because a lot of things that have \ntaken place under this program have not proven to be worth their \nweight.\n  I have spoken before on a number of programs, but in 2011, under this \nfund--the Alternative Vehicle Fund--the Obama administration approved a \n$730 million loan to a company called Severstal Steel Company, a \nRussian-owned company with operations in Michigan.\n  Remember, to qualify for this loan, the alternative fuel vehicle or \nvehicle part needs to be manufactured in the United States and--here is \nthe key--it must be a new product. Technically, Severstal was \nmanufacturing in the United States, but the Obama administration \ncertainly walked the line in this case. The U.S. Government was \nproviding American taxpayer dollars to a Russian company owned by one \nof Russia's richest oligarchs, Alexei Mordashov.\n  The New York Times has reported that Mr. Mordashov has ties to the \nKremlin and to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Apparently, this \nRussian looked at this program and said: Hey, here is a way I can get a \nlow-cost, low-interest loan. All I have to do is operate this plant and \nthe government will loan me $750 million and I will produce a new part, \na new component of steel that is used in automobile manufacturing.\n  After working with the Department of Energy's inspector general, \nSenator Toomey and I learned that the type of steel made by this \nRussian company was identical to the steel already being produced in my \nhome State of Indiana and Senator Toomey's home State of Pennsylvania. \nObviously, that violated one of the basic criteria in that the product \nhas to be an alternative that is brand new or significantly improved \nand not something that is already being produced in Indiana.\n  Fortunately, with the help of the inspector general, we were able to \nensure the Obama administration voided the loan. To their credit, when \nwe brought it to their attention, they said: OK. We have a Russian \noligarch we are giving money to--and that doesn't sound very good. We \nare giving money to this multibillionaire in Russia with close ties to \nVladimir Putin. Secondly, we now have learned what they are producing \nis already produced in the United States--in my State of Indiana and in \nSenator Toomey's State of Pennsylvania. Thus, fortunately, the \nadministration canceled this loan.\n  This example calls into question the integrity of this program. The \nATVM Program also has a lackluster success rate. For example, Fisker \nAutomotive received a $529 million loan to produce a $100,000 plug-in \nhybrid sports car. You will not see any of these on the road because \nthe company went bankrupt after drawing down $193 million of taxpayer \nfunds.\n  Another loan recipient, VPG, planned to sell natural gas-powered \nvans. It went bankrupt after receiving a $50 million government loan.\n  Of the five projects funded by this program to date, two of them have \ngone bankrupt. I think these examples demonstrate what happens when the \ngovernment tries to pick winners and losers instead of letting the free \nmarket determine how we are going to go forward.\n  The Coats-Fischer-Flake-Toomey amendment that will be offered would \nwind down this program and it would make much better use of the unspent \nfunds from this program.\n  I want to be clear. This amendment prohibits DOE from reviewing any \nnew loan applications after the bill's enactment. There are currently \nsome pending applications. We do not address those pending \napplications. I hope serious evaluation will be made relative to \nwhether they qualify under the criteria that is laid out and we will \nnot end up with any more Severstals.\n  Those who argue that this shuts down an alternative energy program is \nnot valid. Anything that is now being currently evaluated up through \nthe end of 2020, the next 5 years--will be allowed to go forward and be \nevaluated under the program. The amendment doesn't take that away.\n  CBO scored this amendment as saving at least $300 million over the \nnext 10 years. I have been down here every week talking about a waste \nof the week. I have just identified another waste of taxpayer dollars. \nWe are not counting that, but we are counting what we can save if this \namendment is adopted. It is $300 million. I think that is a significant \namount it raises our waste, fraud, and abuse level to $162 billion and \nchange.\n  I encourage my colleagues to work with us so we can offer this \namendment. Remember, it does not affect anybody who has a proposal \nbefore the Department of Energy under this loan program. If that is \nunderway, it can be evaluated--hopefully successfully evaluated, and if \nit doesn't qualify the criteria, won't be accepted. The amendment does \nnot free funds for anything that is not currently before the evaluators \nof this program.\n  I trust we can gain the support of my colleagues in saving the \ntaxpayers some dollars.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3811\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are going to vote on the Hoeven \namendment shortly. I rise to speak against that amendment, which would \nundermine one of our Nation's landmark environmental laws, the Clean \nWater Act. It is very difficult for me to understand how we could be at \nthis point in time attacking a clean water rule--a clean water rule in \nlight of what has happened in Flint, MI. This is what the water looked \nlike as it came out of the tap in Flint at the height of the crisis. By \nthe way, people were told this was safe. Why on Earth would we be going \nagainst the clean water rule at a time when we are fighting against \nthis kind of problem?\n  This is what the pipes looked like in Flint: the corrosion, the \nobvious problems with lead. This was all getting right into the \ndrinking water. While we look for ways to help the people of Flint--and \nI would love do it on this bill. If we can't do it on this bill, I \nwould love do it on the WRDA bill. If we can't do it on the WRDA bill, \nI will do it on any bill. We need to take care of what happened there, \nand we also need to help other communities from the east coast to the \nmiddle of our Nation, to the west coast and help us help our families.\n  Here we have in the face of Flint an attack on the clean water rule. \nLet's see what else we have to say and what else we learned about what \nhappened in Flint. Pregnant women, kids cautioned over Jackson water. \nThis is in Mississippi. Jackson, MS, also has a problem with lead. What \nis our response to that today? To stop a clean water rule. What are my \nRepublican friends thinking? It doesn't make sense.\n  The Associated Press wrote this: ``Elevated lead levels found in \nNewark schools' drinking water.''\n  Here we are talking about elevated levels of lead in Newark. We have \nplaces in California where the kids can't drink the water out of a \nwater fountain. So what is the response of the Republican Senate? Turn \nback a clean water rule. It makes absolutely no sense.\n  What we have going on, on the Senate floor, is a very heated debate, \nas I speak, about how to handle the issue in Flint. Let me tell you \nthis. The first thing to do in the light of Flint is not to weaken \nenvironmental law, is not to stop a clean water rule. It is completely \nridiculous.\n  My friends will say: All we are doing is delaying implementation for \na year while the court looks at it. We shouldn't be doing anything that \nplays into the hands of those special interests that simply don't want \nto clean up the water in our Nation. The clean water standards that are \na target of this amendment are designed to safeguard drinking water for \nAmerica's families and businesses.\n  This dangerous amendment rolls back protections of small streams and \nwetlands that provide drinking water to one in three Americans. That is \n117 million people put at risk because this U.S. Senate, run by the \nRepublicans,\n\n[[Page S2360]]\n\nthinks the best thing to do in the light of Flint is to roll back the \nClean Water Act. Come on. Get a life. Read the paper. Look at what \nhappened to those people. This is the time to provide reliable drinking \nwater to all Americans and to clean up our waterways. Now is not the \ntime--and it should not be the time--to attack the Clean Water Act, \nwhich is vital to the health and safety of our families.\n\n  I want to mention that I have received opposition to the Hoeven \namendment from numerous sportsmen's groups, including Backcountry \nHunters and Anglers, International Federation of Fly Fishers, National \nWildlife Federation, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, and \nTrout Unlimited. These groups understand the important link between \nclean water and the outdoor recreation economy. When you go right after \nthe clean water rule, you are going after the people who enjoy outdoor \nrecreation, and they are against the Hoeven amendment.\n  Leading environmental and conservation groups oppose the amendment, \nincluding American Rivers, Clean Water Action, Earthjustice, \nEarthworks, Environment America, Environmental Defense Fund, League of \nConservation Voters, Natural Resources Defense Council, Prairie Rivers \nNetwork, Sierra Club, and Southern Environmental Law Center. These are \nsome of the most popular groups in the country.\n  Does anyone know what the rating of this Republican Congress was in \nthe last polls I saw? It was 14 percent.\n  Do you know what the rating of the President was in the last poll I \nsaw? Over 50.\n  So what does the Republican Senate do today? They are going after the \nPresident with their 14-percent rating in the polls. I say to my \nfriends on the other side--and believe me, they are my friends: What \nare you doing? How do you expect people to support you when you, after \nseeing what happened in Flint, continue to go after landmark \nenvironmental clean water laws like you are doing today?\n  In addition, public health groups, including the American Public \nHealth Association, Physicians for Social Responsibility, and Trust for \nAmerica's Health, have opposed similar legislation to block this \nimportant rule, and 200,000 businesses represented by the American \nSustainable Business Council have called on Senators to oppose efforts \nto block the clean water rule. These experts understand the importance \nof the clean water rule, and they know that our drinking water remains \nvulnerable to pollution.\n  Just last month, EPA released a report showing that nearly half of \nU.S. waterways are in poor condition. In fact, one in four waterways \nhave levels of bacteria that fail to meet human health standards, and \nour children go swimming in these very waterways. We have cities across \nthe United States with sewer systems that discharge raw, untreated \nsewage in waterways--again, where our children swim. It is a disgrace. \nDespite enormous successes since passage of the Clean Water Act, we \nhave more work to do. Nothing is more important than protecting the \nlives of the American people, whether it is through our military or \nthrough our public health laws. When we weaken the Clean Water Act, as \nthe Hoeven amendment will do, we put our families and our children at \nrisk. Why are we here?\n  Flint has put a spotlight on the need to keep our families safe from \ntoxins and pollutants in their drinking water. The first thing the \nRepublicans do in light of Flint is to try to roll back the clean water \nrule.\n  I have to say that one of my deepest regrets--and I have written \nabout it--is how partisan this place has become over environmental \nlaws. When I started a long time ago, Republicans were the ones leading \nthe way on the environment. I remember there was a Republican State \nsenator named Peter Behr, whom I supported because he understood how \ncritical it was to protect and defend the environment, not only as a \nlegacy to our children in terms of the beauty of our planet but also \nfor the very health and safety of our families.\n  I have been in office for 40 years. It is hard to believe that it has \nbeen 40 years. I guess time flies when you like your work. The fact is \nthat no one has ever come up to me and said: Barbara, our water and air \nis too pure and way too clean. You need to do something about that. You \nneed to dirty it up. Repeal the landmark laws, Barbara, that protect \nour water.\n  They don't do that. They come up and say: We are worried about the \nfact that we are not sure what contaminants are in our water.\n  I see my good friend is going to close out the debate, and I promised \nhim that when he came to the floor, he wouldn't have to listen too \nlong.\n  I say again: Please vote against the Hoeven amendment. This is not \nsmart legislation in light of what we face.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I will yield the floor to the good Senator \nfrom Michigan for a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wanted to make a quick statement about \nan amendment that will come up for consideration on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, of course I support my friend from \nMichigan, but we need to quickly move to a vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wanted to quickly take a moment to \nspeak about the vehicle program from two sides. When I authored this \nlegislation back in 2007, we began to see fuel economy standards \nincrease in the United States. Part of our focus at that time was to \nkeep jobs in America and make sure we had low-cost financing available \nfor companies, such as retool plants, so that smaller, fuel-efficient \nvehicles would be made in the United States rather than have those jobs \nshipped overseas. We saw that with the initial loan made to Ford Motor \nCompany. They were able to bring jobs back from Mexico and also focus \non electric vehicles.\n  As we fast forward to today, we are looking at fuel economy for \ntrucks and larger vehicles. A loan was recently made to Alcoa. They are \nfocused on aluminum materials so companies can make lighter weight \ntrucks in order to meet new fuel economy standards. There are \npositives, but there are also areas under this loan program that have \nnot been successful.\n  I come to the floor to specifically say that when it is time to \nconsider the Coats amendment, which will completely eliminate this \nprogram, my colleagues need to know that we are undercutting a \ncarefully crafted bipartisan compromise with Senator Inhofe, Senator \nPortman, and others to move forward on a water infrastructure plan to \ndeal with lead in water that will not only help 100,000 people in the \ncity of Flint, but it will also help people in Jackson, MS, Cleveland, \nOH, and other States across the country.\n  Our proposal responsibly phases out this program and uses the funds \nfor critical water infrastructure needs. We strongly oppose pulling the \nrug out from under not only Flint but also Jackson, MS, Cleveland, OH, \nand communities across the country that are counting on us to come \ntogether and pass what we have done in a bipartisan way to address \ncritical water infrastructure needs and deal with the lead poisoning \nissues.\n  I ask colleagues to vote no on the Coats amendment and allow us to \nphase out this program in a way so that we will be able to use this \ninvestment in a critical way to address water infrastructure needs \nacross the country.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I am willing to yield to the junior \nSenator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I concur with my colleague from Michigan, \nSenator Stabenow. We urge our colleagues\n\n[[Page S2361]]\n\nto vote no on the Coats amendment. This is part of a very carefully \ncrafted amendment to deal with water infrastructure around the country, \nand in particular Flint.\n  I think this will be a win-win for those folks who may want to see \nthis program go away. We have a plan to do that while also dealing with \nan incredibly important issue not only for our State but that is also \nincredibly important to other States across the country.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3811\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to \nsupport an amendment I offered, amendment No. 3811, that prevents the \nEPA and the Corps of Engineers from implementing its waters of the \nUnited States final rule. The language for my amendment is actually \nidentical to the waters of the United States provision in the \nunderlying bill. It is already in the bill, H.R. 2028, which we are \nconsidering right now. My amendment will make sure that this waters of \nthe United States provision stays in the bill and that our bill is \nconsistent with legislation supported by the House.\n  It is critical to preserve the prohibition on implementing the waters \nof the United States because this rule will greatly expand the scope of \nEPA regulations over nearly every water in the United States, \nthreatening farmers and job creators with permitting requirements and \nlitigation that will make it more difficult for them to produce our \nNation's food and complete needed construction projects.\n  Moreover, this regulatory overreach by the Army Corps of Engineers \nand the EPA is inconsistent with the law. Let's look at what the courts \nare saying. When granting a preliminary injunction against this rule, \nthe North Dakota Federal District Court stated:\n\n       The Rule allows EPA regulation of waters that do not bear \n     any effect on the ``chemical, physical and biological \n     integrity'' of any navigable-in-fact water.\n\n  It went on further to state:\n\n       The rule asserts jurisdiction over waters that are remote \n     and intermittent waters. No evidence actually points to how \n     these intermittent and remote wetlands have any nexus to \n     navigable-in-fact water.\n\n  That is the key. EPA has jurisdiction over navigable bodies of water, \nnot ephemeral water that might be in a ditch today and gone tomorrow.\n  Meanwhile, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a nationwide \nstay of the rule, in Cincinnati, citing that EPA and the Corps of \nEngineers did not identify ``specific scientific support substantiating \nthe reasonableness of the bright-line standards they ultimately \nchose.''\n  To get a sense of the size of the Federal power grab we are talking \nabout here, consider that under the administration's final rule, all \nwater located within 4,000 feet of any other water or within the 100-\nyear floodplain is considered a water of the United States as long as \nthe EPA or the Army Corps of Engineers decides that it has \n``significant nexus.'' That is the argument the EPA is making--\n``significant nexus.'' They are saying: Well, we can regulate navigable \nbodies of water. They just decided, without statutory authority \nprovided by this Congress or any other authority, that because other \nwaters run into navigable bodies, they can regulate all water, and they \nhave issued a regulation to do that.\n  The waters of the United States is clearly flawed from a legal \nperspective, but it is even more important to take a look at how this \nrule, if implemented, affects hard-working Americans with excessive \nregulations. For those of you who haven't had the opportunity to visit \nwith a farmer from my State or any farmers across this country, do so. \nThey will tell you how difficult it is to deal with excess water on \ntheir property, particularly when they face an overbearing regulation \nlike this one. Those farmers can tell you that just because there is \nwater in a ditch or field one week doesn't mean that there will be \nwater there next week. It certainly doesn't make the water worthy of \nbeing treated the same as a river, a lake, or a navigable body of \nwater. A field with a low spot that has standing water----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask that the Members of this body not \nonly consider the underlying issue and the impact it will have on \nfarmers and ranchers. It will also affect everybody's private property \nrights. I also ask my colleagues to consider their own prerogative. \nUnder our Constitution we have legislative, judicial, and executive \nbranches, and each has its own authority. We have to stand up on this \none when an agency overreaches and takes statutory authority we have \nnot provided.\n\n  I ask that Members join with me in support of this vitally important \namendment.\n  With that, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nlocking in the votes, the Senator from California have an opportunity \nto speak and then that we move to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder to call up the following amendments: Franken amendment No. 3833, \nCoats amendment No. 3814, and Murray amendment No. 3813; further, that \nfollowing the disposition of the Hoeven amendment No. 3811, the Senate \nvote on the Coats amendment No. 3814, with a 60-affirmative-vote \nthreshold for adoption of the amendment; and that at 1:45 p.m. today, \nthe Senate vote on the Franken amendment No. 3833; finally, that at \n5:30 p.m. on Monday, April 25, the Senate vote on the Murray amendment \nNo. 3813, with no second-degree amendments in order to any of the \namendments prior to the votes, and that there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided prior to each vote.\n  May I say before the Senator from California speaks, I see the \nSenators from Michigan are here and the Senator from Indiana. I wish to \nthank the three of them for working with Senator Feinstein and me \ntoward the goal of making sure that Senators who have a germane \namendment have the opportunity to have an up-or-down vote. If we are \nable to follow that practice generally, we will be able to have an \nappropriations process and the Senate will function well. They all \nresponded quickly and promptly on issues they feel very strongly about, \nand I thank them for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3811\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to say a few words.\n  The junior Senator from California has been speaking in opposition to \nthe waters of the United States amendment sponsored by Senator Hoeven. \nI just want to put before the body a little bit of the history.\n  In 2006 the Supreme Court introduced real uncertainty regarding which \nwetlands and water bodies were subject to Federal jurisdiction under \nthe Clean Water Act. Since 2006 the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers have been working on new rules to clarify their jurisdiction \nand address the Supreme Court's ruling.\n  EPA and the Army Corps just finalized the new rule last May. This new \nrule helps resolve almost a decade of confusion by clearly stating \nwhich types of water bodies are subject to Federal jurisdiction and \nwhich are not. It will make Federal permitting easier, faster, and less \ncostly for business and industry. It maintains all previous exemptions \nand exclusions for normal farming and ranching practices and \nagricultural discharges, such as irrigation return flow and storm water \nrunoff.\n  Nevertheless, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has issued a stay \nsuspending implementation of the rule. I strongly believe we should let \nthe courts decide whether the executive branch has overreached in its \ninterpretation of congressional statute, just like the Constitution \ncalls for.\n  The President has threatened to veto the entire Energy and Water \nappropriations bill if this amendment is included in it. Right now, we \nhave the best opportunity in 7 years to pass this bill as a stand-alone \npiece of legislation and\n\n[[Page S2362]]\n\nget the Senate appropriations process working again.\n  So I am very hopeful and would strongly recommend that the Senate \ndefeat the Hoeven amendment.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Hoeven \namendment No. 3811.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, in a moment Senator Coats will call \nup his amendment, the Coats and Toomey amendment.\n  I want to thank the Michigan Senators and others for making the \nschedule work today. For the information of all Senators, after the \nCoats amendment, the next vote will be at 1:45 p.m. on the Franken \namendment. That will be the last vote today.\n  The next vote will be on the Murray amendment on Monday afternoon.\n  Senators and their staffs have been very good about getting their \namendments in. We think we have all the amendments. We have asked to \nhave them by 1 p.m. so we could by consensus finish up on Monday and \nTuesday, giving everybody a chance to have their vote if it is a \ngermane amendment and to speak on the germane amendments.\n  My request on behalf of Senator Feinstein and me is that if there are \nany amendments still out there, we would like to have them by 1 \no'clock.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3814 to Amendment No. 3801\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on amendment No. 3814, to be offered by the \nSenator from Indiana, Mr. Coats.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 3814.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3814 to amendment No. 3801.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To limit the use of funds made available for the Advanced \n            Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program)\n\n       On page 30, line 9, strike the period at the end and insert \n     the following: ``: Provided, That none of the funds made \n     available under this heading shall be used to administer, \n     review, or approve any loan or loan application that was not \n     submitted as of the date of enactment of this Act: Provided \n     further, that none of the funds available to the Secretary of \n     Energy to provide any credit subsidy under subsection (d) of \n     section 136 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of \n     2007 (42 U.S.C. 17013) as of the date of enactment of this \n     Act shall be obligated for new loan commitments under that \n     subsection on or after October 1, 2020.''.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, 205 loans issued by the Department of \nEnergy under the alternative vehicle program have failed, costing \ntaxpayers $500 million in losses. DOE currently sits on $4 billion of \nunused money. It is time to wind down this program. This will not \naffect any proposals that are currently with the Department of Energy \non this program, but it will prevent any new programs going forward.\n  We can save the taxpayers a lot of money and use this for other \nalternatives if we adopt this amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, this is exactly the kind of program our \nconstituents hate. It is the crony capitalism where taxpayers are \nforced to subsidize preferred companies, special interests. How many \nhundreds of millions of dollars do taxpayers have to lose?\n  I understand there is some discussion that maybe on some bill in the \nfuture, this will get phased out as part of another deal, but who knows \nif that is ever going to happen. Here is a chance to wipe out some \ncrony capitalism, some corporate welfare, and a huge loss for \ntaxpayers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Let's adopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I would certainly urge all of my \ncolleagues to oppose the Coats amendment. What this does is eliminate a \nprogram that basically pays for a very carefully crafted agreement on \nwhich we are working to deal with the Flint water issue, as well as \nwater infrastructure issues all across this country. This is part of \nthe proposal Senator Stabenow and I have been working on and have been \nbuilding support.\n  We are looking to move to this very shortly to deal with this broad \nissue. A vote against this amendment allows us to continue to move \nforward with a bipartisan plan, critical for our whole country.\n  I yield my remaining time to the senior Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, the bottom line is that we have \ndeveloped a bipartisan bill that phases out this program in a \nresponsible way for the businesses that are currently involved and uses \nthat to pay for water infrastructure needs across the country, not only \nin Flint but in Jackson, MI, and Cleveland, OH--across the country.\n  So we can achieve what the Senators are talking about in a way that \nhelps us with water infrastructure.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3814.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Missouri (Mr. Blunt) and the Senator from Texas (Mr. \nCruz).\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Sandy Ledy\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, I rise today to recognize Sandy Ledy, a \ndedicated Senate staff member who will retire after more than two \ndecades of public service in my office.\n  Soon after being elected to the Senate in 1994, Senator John Kyl was \nwise enough to offer Sandy--a standout campaign volunteer--a job on his \nnew staff. Sandy was given two options: She could work as a staffer in \nWashington, DC, or she could serve in Arizona and serve as John Kyl's \nmilitary case worker. Sandy knew she couldn't pass up an opportunity to \nserve those who serve our Nation. It was an easy decision for Sandy and \na fortuitous one for Arizona's military servicemembers, veterans, and \ntheir families.\n  Sandy's genuine passion for our military service men and women, \ncombined with her meticulous approach to her work, has made her an \ninvaluable staffer. Sandy is well-versed in all things military, from \nregulations, to benefits, to the service academies. Her vast knowledge \nhas ensured that Arizona's military service men and women have had \nnothing but the best assistance for more than the past two decades.\n  Her reputation preceded her, and when I was elected as Senator in \n2012, I had an easy decision of my own--offering Sandy a job on my \nstaff. Thankfully, she said yes.\n  Sandy is probably best known around the State as the point person for \nservice academy nominations. Her understanding of that process and what \nit takes for a student to be an excellent nominee has helped so many \nstudents fulfill their dreams of attending one of our prestigious \nservice academies. Her focus on preparation and attention to detail has \nturned what can be a very daunting task into a seamless production, \nresulting in countless nominations and appointments to the service \nacademies.\n  While we all marvel at Sandy's meticulousness, it is her compassion \nand calm demeanor that make her such an asset. This is never more \nevident than when she is working with students and parents in the long \nand complicated process of applying to attend one of these service \nacademies.\n  Beyond her work on behalf of the military, she is an active and \ncherished member of her community in Cave Creek, AZ. She is a member of \nher church choir, a regular volunteer at the Cave Creek Museum, and a \nlongtime swim coach, sometimes judging local meets. But there is no \nbetter testament to Sandy's example as a public servant than her two \nchildren, Amy and Joe. Amy is a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy \nwho herself recently retired after a career in the military. Joe served \nin the U.S. Marine Corps. They have made her the proud grandmother of \nthree, and she is looking forward to spending a well-deserved \nretirement looking after those grandkids.\n  Sandy, thank you for more than 20 years of dedicated public service \nin the Senate and, in particular, for the 4 years of stellar service as \na member of my staff. Your knowledge and passion will be greatly \nmissed. I wish you well in your retirement.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n               Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Bill\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am on the floor with my colleague \nSenator Portman to join him in urging the House to take prompt action \non the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, which passed with such \na stunning bipartisan vote in the Senate.\n  As Senator Portman has pointed out, years of careful preparation went \ninto the drafting of this bill. There were five separate national \nhearings held in Washington with people from all over the country. This \nis a very polished and carefully developed piece of legislative work \nthat has the support not only of the addiction and recovery community \nbut of the law enforcement community and many others.\n  Senator Portman has been very diligent about coming to the floor to \npress for action from the House of Representatives. My view is that \nsince the House of Representatives is under Republican control, they \nare more likely to be attentive to the urgings of a Republican \nSenator--particularly one who has served in the House of \nRepresentatives--than they are to me.\n  But I want to make sure the record is clear that I fully support \nrapid passage of this bill, whether it is something that is close \nenough that we can quickly get it through conference or whether it is \nour bill, to which they are free to add things as they wish over time, \nbut can get to the President now--the reason I think it is important \nthat it get to the President now is we are in the appropriations \nprocess. The appropriators for these accounts need to know what they \nare appropriating to. So time is of the essence, not just because of \nthe lives that are being lost day-to-day and month-to-month out there \nbut also because our appropriators need to know.\n  I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, to listen to the distinguished Senator from Ohio. \nLet's try to get this done.\n  With that, I yield to Senator Portman with my thanks and \nappreciation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. First, Madam President, I want to thank my colleague \nfrom Rhode Island who just spoke. We did work together for the past few \nyears in putting together this legislation, and we did it, by the way, \nwith the House of Representatives. So Senator Whitehouse and I took \ngood ideas wherever we could find them, in whatever part of the country \nit came from, including ideas from the House of Representatives. We \ndidn't ask who had the idea; we asked whether it was a good idea. We \nkept this entirely nonpartisan, not just bipartisan. Therefore, we \nbuilt something that makes sense for our communities back home to deal \nwith this epidemic of prescription drug and heroin addiction and \noverdoses.\n  I appreciate his partnership in this, and I appreciate the fact that \nhe came to the floor today to talk about the importance of moving ahead \nwith this legislation. After all, it is very rare around here to get a \n94-to-1 vote on anything, and we did it on this bill. After 2\\1/2\\ \nweeks on the floor of the Senate talking about this heroin and \nprescription drug epidemic, every single Senator here realized this was \na problem in their States, and 94 Senators stood up and agreed this \nlegislation will help address it.\n  By the way, since we passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery \nAct, or CARA, as it is called, on March 10 in the Senate, 42 days have \npassed. That is more than a month. Every day, we lose about 120 \nAmericans--120 Americans--to drug overdoses. That means in these 42 \ndays we have lost over 5,000 fellow American citizens to drug \noverdoses. Think about that.\n  I do urge the House to act and act quickly. These numbers keep \ngetting higher and higher. This is not getting better. Back in Ohio, \nthis is getting worse, and I assume the same is true in your State, if \nyou are a Senator or if you are a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives in your district.\n  Since 2007, we have looked at these numbers, and drug overdoses have \nkilled more Ohioans than car accidents. It is now the No. 1 cause of \naccidental death in Ohio. It has tripled\n\n[[Page S2364]]\n\nfrom 1999 to 2010. We are now told, by the way, that 200,000 Ohioans \nare addicted to opioids--opioids are prescription drugs--and heroin--\n200,000 Ohioans. That is the size of a significant city in any State \nrepresented here in this body or any district on the other side.\n  In fact, it is the same size as the city of Akron, OH, where I was on \nMonday of this week, meeting with their opioid task force. They are \nalarmed at what is happening, and they want to be sure we are making \nevery possible effort we can on the prevention side, the education \nside, to get more people into treatment, to get them into longer term \nrecovery, to provide police officers and other first responders with \nNarcan, the miracle drug they need to stop overdoses from turning into \na death. They want our help. They support the CARA legislation. They \nneed it, and they need it now.\n  The Cincinnati Enquirer had some really troubling news last week. \nThey wrote a story about a new poll that is out. It is a group called \nInteract for Health. They do an annual Ohio health issues poll. They \nfound in the poll in 2014 that 2 of every 10 Ohioans knew someone who \nwas abusing prescription drugs. A year later, it is 3 in 10, so this is \nnot getting better. This is getting worse. By the way, this is just \nprescription drugs. And by the way, of the 3 in 10 who knew somebody \nwho is abusing prescription drugs, 4 in 10--4 in 10--knew somebody who \nhad overdosed on those prescription drugs. So these percentages are \nincreasing across the board--every age group, every education level, \nevery income level. There is no demographic, no ZIP Code, no State, no \ncity, and no county that is safe from this epidemic. It is spreading, \nand it is spreading everywhere.\n  This poll is another indication that we have a lot of work to do. \nThis should be a motivation for us. This should get us to pass this \nlegislation. And, yes, can we work on additional legislation? Of \ncourse, we can and should. I am encouraged that the House is taking up \nnew bills and looking at this in different ways. That is good. But we \nknow here in the Senate and over in the House that this CARA \nlegislation will help and will help now.\n  By the way, there are over 120 cosponsors of the CARA legislation in \nthe House. Not only did we work with them and introduce identical \nlegislation in the House and the Senate, anticipating this day when we \ncould pass it in one House, but we wanted to pass it quickly in the \nother House and get it to the President for his signature. There are \nover 120 cosponsors over there. It is bipartisan.\n  Think of the impact we could have on the community if we could get \nthis passed. If we could turn around just one life, it matters, and we \nknow this can save many lives and make many people begin to look at \nthis issue differently--that this is a disease. Addiction is a disease \nand needs to be treated as such. Removing some of that stigma alone \nwill bring a lot more people into treatment, and that is part of what \nis important about this legislation.\n  There is another issue that is not prescription drugs, and it is not \nheroin, but it is another issue related to it, and that is fentanyl. \nFentanyl is being laced with heroin throughout the country. In \nCleveland, OH, a couple of weeks ago, we lost 12 people--12 people--in \n6 days to overdoses. That is one city. This was heroin, but it was \nlaced with this even more dangerous toxic substance called fentanyl. By \nthe way, it comes in the mail. The drug dealers are shipping it in the \nmail.\n  Fentanyl is so toxic--10 to 30 to 40 times more toxic than heroin--\nthat it is dangerous even to open up the mail if you are an inspector, \nwe are told. We had a hearing on this just this week. We talked to the \nCustoms and Border Patrol people: Our question was, Why can't we stop \nthis stuff from coming in? This, unfortunately, is something that is \nalso increasing. Ohio, they say, is one of the top States in the \ncountry in terms of fentanyl overdoses. But I will tell those who have \nnot dealt with this fentanyl issue yet that it creates even more issues \nbecause it is so deadly.\n  After 3 years of work on this CARA legislation, Senator Whitehouse \nand I and others, including Senators on both sides of the aisle--we did \nhold five forums, as he said, on various aspects of this debate. We \nconsulted with the experts on treatment and recovery, the experts who \nare focused on how to keep kids and other people from making these bad \ndecisions in the prevention and the education community. We met with \nthe drug experts from the administration, such as the White House \nOffice of National Drug Control Policy. We brought in people from all \nover the country, including from my home State of Ohio.\n  This is the third time I have come to the floor. I have come once \nevery week that we have been in session since we passed it to say to \nthe House: Let's move on CARA. Let's get it done. It will help \nimmediately.\n  The majority leader in the House has said he wants the House to take \non the drug epidemic and pass legislation soon. I believe him. He is a \ngood man. I appreciate that. But I would ask him again to please work \non the other legislation. It is fine to take them through hearings and \nmarkups, but we cannot delay. We know CARA will work, and it will work \nnow. It is sitting over there and ready for action. It can be taken to \nthe floor immediately under suspension and can be passed. We are one \nvote away from having this go to the President and having it go to help \nin our communities.\n  The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Fred Upton, \nwho is a good friend and a man with a big heart and cares about this \nissue, has said he would like the House to move quickly with, as he \nsaid, an ``all hands on deck effort.'' Good for him.\n  One of his subcommittees, the Health Subcommittee, recently marked up \na dozen bills. This happened yesterday; they marked up 12 bills. Look \nat those bills. A number of them are actually a part of CARA already. \nThey are in CARA. They are smaller bills. None of them is \ncomprehensive, like CARA.\n  One reason we have to get CARA passed is this is a problem that has \nto be addressed from all angles, from all sectors, and that is why it \nhas to be comprehensive. But of those 12 bills that were marked up \nyesterday, many of them are identical, and others are very similar to \nthe CARA legislation. So this shouldn't slow us down. In fact, it is \neven more an indication that if these are the kinds of bills the House \nthinks are the right way to go, let's get CARA passed and then we can \nwork on the other legislative ideas Members may have.\n  I respect my colleagues--Chairman Upton, the majority leader over \nthere, and Chairman Pence, the chairman of the subcommittee and also a \nguy who cares a lot about this issue--but let's give CARA a vote. There \nare 125 cosponsors. That is the latest number I have as of this \nmorning, and the number keeps growing. It is bipartisan, it is \nbicameral, and it is the right thing to do.\n  Again, I know there are other ideas out there, and that is fine. We \nneed to take those up as well. But let's go ahead and get this passed. \nPut it under suspension, and take it to the floor. It will pass. We are \none vote away from having this help our communities.\n  CARA is not just comprehensive; it does the right thing in terms of \nfocusing on what is evidence based. In other words, we didn't just say \n``Let's throw more money at this problem,'' we said ``Let's actually \nfind out what is working and what is not working.''\n  I was in Dayton, OH, with a group called Project C.U.R.E. on Friday. \nI had the chance to visit with some of the administrators there, some \nof the recovery coaches, as they call themselves, many of whom, by the \nway, are recovering themselves. They are doing an amazing job. I talked \nto many of the patients who were there. They are people who are \nrecovering addicts. Some have been clean for 2 weeks, some clean for 2 \nyears. But I asked them the same question I ask all over our State: \nWhat works? What doesn't work? How did this happen?\n  Most of them, by the way, told me the same story you hear time and \nagain: It started with prescription drugs. In fact, one story was from \na man by the name of Anthony. He dropped out of high school at age 14, \ngot into drugs, and made some mistakes in his life, which he readily \nacknowledges. He ended up in prison. He said he had eight convictions \nand was in and out of prison, in and out of the drug world. He decided \nto go straight.\n\n[[Page S2365]]\n\nHe made a decision. For him, a lot of it was faith based and a lot was \nbeing sure he was going to be able to take care of his family and be a \ncontributing member of his community, so he gave back.\n  Anthony had a good job, had gotten married, and was on the right \ntrack. He was on his way to work one day, and he was in a car accident. \nFor those experts who are listening to this today, you probably know \nhappened. I don't even have to tell you. When he got in the car \naccident, he was injured. They sent him to the hospital. What did they \ngive him at the hospital? Narcotic pain pills, Percocet, prescription \ndrugs.\n  Immediately--immediately--Anthony became addicted again. He is now \nstruggling, but he is back at the treatment center. He is getting his \nlife back together again. But in the meantime he has lost his family \nbecause the drugs became everything. He lost his job because the drugs \nbecame everything.\n  We talk a lot about the overdoses, and they are horrible--120 \nAmericans a day. We don't talk enough about those who aren't overdosing \nbut who have lost their ability to achieve their own God-given purpose \nin life because the drugs are everything. So they have lost their \nfamilies--torn apart. They have lost their jobs. They have lost their \nability to be contributing members of our society. And those people who \nget into treatment and longer term recovery, as Anthony is doing, can \nturn their lives around. There is hope. It can work.\n  Anthony is back for a second chance. Having talked to him, I believe \nhe is not just on the right track but he will work through this. This \nlegislation is needed to help him.\n  When I do meet with recovering addicts, I ask them to look at the \nlegislation, look at the summaries, and tell me what they think. What \nthey tell me is they like it because they are convinced it would help \nothers to have the access to treatment they have. Probably only 1 out \nof 10 of those people who are addicted are getting treatment. That is \nthe best number I have. Maybe it is a little higher than that in your \nState or congressional district, but this is an issue where, if we \nprovide more resources for treatment and begin to remove that stigma \naround treatment and get more people into a system where they can begin \nto get their lives back together with treatment, we know that works.\n  Our legislation supports veterans task forces and veterans courts \nbecause we know this will help with our veterans who are coming back \nwith PTSD, 20 percent of whom have this addiction. People say it is \nself-medicating. They have self-medicated to the point that they are \nnow addicts. We need to put them not into a prison cell but into a \ntreatment program. That is what these veterans courts do, and they \nsurround these veterans with other veterans. They do an awesome job. I \nhave been to them in Ohio. You have them probably in your State. If you \ndon't, this legislation will help because it creates more veterans \ncourts.\n  We have talked on the floor before about the fact that there has been \na huge increase--a 750 percent increase in the State of Ohio--in babies \nborn with addiction. That is just in the last 12 years in Ohio. Go to \nany neonatal unit in your State or congressional district, and you will \nsee these babies. They are being lovingly cared for by doctors and \nnurses. They are taking these addicted babies you could hold in the \npalm of your hand, and they are literally taking them through \nwithdrawal. They have to because these babies are addicted and showing \nthe symptoms you might see in an adult of addiction.\n  We don't know what the long-term consequences are. We are having a \nhearing on this tomorrow in Cleveland, OH, at one of our great \nhospitals--University Hospitals Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital. \nIt is one of the best children's hospitals in the country. Their \nneonatal unit is doing awesome work. I have been there and seen it. We \nare going to talk to the experts about this and how we can do even \nbetter to help these babies. But wouldn't it be great if we didn't have \nso many babies born with addiction because mothers, knowing the \nconsequences, dealt with their addiction problem to avoid it through \nprevention and education efforts? Wouldn't it be great if we didn't \nhave this 750-percent increase in children whose futures are uncertain \nbecause of being born with this addiction?\n  Again, there is hope. I have been to a women's recovery center in \nCleveland and Columbus and also in Eastern Ohio and Athens, OH, where I \nhave met with women in long-term recovery with drug addiction. They are \nthere with their kids. There is hope.\n  With this legislation, we do have the ability to give people more \nhope. Getting rid of that stigma, not judging people, is part of \nbeating this epidemic, and CARA will do that by treating addiction like \na disease.\n  There is an opportunity for us to move, and move quickly, to address \nthis growing crisis we have in our States and our communities; that is, \nto pass this CARA legislation. Is it all we should do? No. Of course we \nshould do more. I know the House of Representatives will have some \ngreat ideas. I know there are some great ideas in this body. The HELP \nCommittee is working on additional ideas on how to get more medicine \ninto this area of addiction, science, and treatment. They are working \non ways to ensure that we can provide more help to people. That is \ngreat, and we should continue to work on that.\n  Meanwhile, we know this legislation will help. We know that if it is \nsitting on the desk in the House of Representatives, having passed the \nSenate by a 94-to-1 vote, it is not going to help. But we know if it \ncan get off the desk and onto the floor for a vote, we are one vote \naway from getting it to our communities to begin to help, to keep \npeople from making the wrong decision--but then if they get into a drug \naddiction, it can help them to be able to turn their lives around and \nto achieve their potential in life, their God-given potential.\n  That is what this argument is about. It is not about the fact that \nthe Senate has all the answers. By the way, we wrote this legislation \nwith the House. They were engaged from the start. We introduced \nidentical bills and they had 125 cosponsors. All we are saying is, \nlet's let this one piece of legislation go, let's allow it to begin to \nhelp right away, and then let's continue to work on other ideas.\n  Again, we have lost nearly 5,000 Americans to drug overdoses since \nthe Senate passed CARA with a 94-to-1 vote. To begin to reverse this \ntide--this trend of addiction, of overdoses--we can and should act now. \nIt is urgent. There is a crisis. There is no time to waste.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I wish to thank my friend for his \ncomments about addiction. I agree with the Senator from Ohio, talking \nabout the victims from Ohio. I can assure him we have victims in \nVirginia and all across the country, and we need to get this \nlegislation to the President's desk so people who are hurt by the \nscourge of drugs can get the treatment they need. Again, I thank him \nfor his leadership.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Merrick Garland\n\n  Madam President, I rise to again express my disappointment that many \nof my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have continued to \nobstruct consideration of an eminently qualified candidate to fill the \nvacancy on the Supreme Court.\n  It has now been 36 days since President Obama nominated Judge Merrick \nGarland; that is, 36 days that our highest Court has been relegated to \nfalling short of its full constitutional obligations. Make no mistake. \nThe Senate's inaction is already having a tangible impact on the \nCourt's ability to function effectively. During the current session, we \nhave seen our eight current Justices end up in a 4-to-4 deadlock in \nthree separate cases since Justice Scalia's passing--effectively muting \nthe Court's voice in consequential judicial proceedings.\n  President Reagan himself said: ``Every day that passes with a Supreme \nCourt below full strength impairs the people's business in that \ncrucially important body.''\n  More recently, retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor put it quite \nsimply, as she always does. She said: ``I think we need somebody there \nnow to do the job, and let's get on with it.''\n  Indeed, the Supreme Court has granted only three cases since Justice \nScalia\n\n[[Page S2366]]\n\ndied--a number experts say is extraordinarily low and an indication \nthat the eight sitting Justices are acutely aware of the precarious \nposition the Court is in with a vacancy.\n  Many Senators apparently believe that President Obama shouldn't be \nable to make appointments under article II because he is in the last \nyear of his term. The record shows there is nothing in the Constitution \nthat says the President is only President for 3 of the 4 years of his \nor her term. I don't understand that reasoning. Under that reasoning, \nany of those same Senators who have made that argument shouldn't be \nvoting on any bill that comes before this body in the last year of \ntheir Senate term. If we continue with that rationale, the President's \noffice and the Senate would lead to further dysfunction. Quite \nhonestly, that logic is beyond the pale.\n  It is clear as well that the American people expect us to do our job. \nRecent polls show that by a 2-to-1 margin Americans want the Senate to \nhold hearings and vote on Judge Garland's nomination. That is why I \nremain so perplexed by the logical contortions that many of my \ncolleagues are undertaking to justify their obstruction and quite \nhonestly their failure to do their job.\n  I had the chance to meet with Judge Garland last week. His \nqualifications and dedication to public service are beyond reproach. He \nhas received strong bipartisan support in the past, but what also stood \nout to me are his measured view of the role of the judiciary, his \nstrong record on national security, and commitment to keeping our \ncountry safe.\n  This past Tuesday marked the 21st anniversary of the bombing of a \nFederal building in Oklahoma City. On that tragic day in 1995, 168 \npeople, including 19 children, lost their lives. To this day, the \nOklahoma City bombing remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism \nin our Nation's history.\n  Judge Garland at that time was Principal Associate Deputy Attorney \nGeneral. He was the guy who led the criminal investigation and \nsupervised the prosecution of the bombers. Merrick Garland fought for \njustice for the victims and the families in Oklahoma City. Through his \ntireless efforts, deep understanding of the law, and attention to \ndetail, he ensured that the prosecution had an airtight case. \nUltimately, both bombers were successfully convicted.\n  This is the highest profile instance in which Judge Garland exhibited \nhis commitment to making and keeping our country safe, but it is far \nfrom the only one. In my meeting with him, it was clear that the safety \nand security of our citizens is an issue that quite honestly keeps him \nup at night.\n  What also stands out about my conversation with Judge Garland is his \nsense of humility. Our conversation and his judicial record demonstrate \nto me that he is a moderate, thoughtful, consensus candidate. As Judge \nGarland said in the Rose Garden on the day he was nominated:\n\n       People must be confident that a judge's decisions are \n     determined by the law and only the law. For a judge to be \n     worthy of such trust, he or she must be faithful to the \n     Constitution, and to the statutes passed by Congress.\n       He or she must put aside his personal views or preferences \n     and follow the law; not make it. Fidelity to the Constitution \n     and the law has been the cornerstone of my professional life, \n     and is the hallmark of the kind of judge I have tried to be \n     for the past 18 years.\n\n  These are not the words nor the track record of a judicial activist. \nIn my opinion, this is the kind of judge that Merrick Garland has been: \nnot a judicial activist but someone who recognizes the important role \nand the important balance between the executive, legislative, and \njudicial branches.\n  I am encouraged that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave at least begun to give Judge Garland the courtesy of a meeting, \nbut meetings alone are not sufficient. The American people deserve the \nopportunity to hear Judge Garland's qualifications debated in a public \nhearing in the Judiciary Committee, and they deserve an up-or-down vote \non the Senate floor. That is all we ask.\n  I again urge my colleagues to give Judge Garland the consideration \nother nominees have received. At the end of the day, if they choose to \nvote against him, that is their right, but the idea that somehow they \nare interpreting the Constitution to say that in the last year of a \nPresidency a qualified judge should not even receive consideration of a \nhearing and a vote is quite honestly beyond the pale.\n  Too often these debates end up going on and become extraordinarily \ncomplicated. In many ways, what I hear from Virginians--regardless of \nwhether they want me to support Judge Garland--is a very simple \nmessage: Do your job. In the coming days and weeks, I hope the Senate \nwill do its job and give Judge Garland the consideration of a hearing \nbefore the Judiciary Committee and then take up this eminently \nqualified jurist's nomination on the floor and give him the vote he \ndeserves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Paris Climate Agreement\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise to recognize the importance of \nthe signing of the Paris Agreement.\n  Tomorrow marks the 46th anniversary of Earth Day--the first Earth \nDay--the Earth Day that occurred when I was in seventh grade. My \nseventh grade teacher made a point of making sure all the students were \naware of it. They made sure we had a chance to do a field trip to the \ncommunity college to learn about some of the issues related to \nstewardship of the planet.\n  It is a day to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of our blue-green \nplanet but also to recognize, to remind ourselves of the fact that we \nhave a huge responsibility to be good stewards of the wonderful planet \nwe have.\n  It was Theodore Roosevelt who said that ``our greatest central task \n[is] leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it \nis for us.'' That is the definition of stewardship, and that is what \nEarth Day is all about. This is why it is so fitting that tomorrow, on \nEarth Day, America will join other nations in signing the Paris \nAgreement.\n  This international climate accord is a tremendous step forward. It \nmakes clear the world recognizes that global warming is a very \nsignificant and grave concern facing human civilization on this planet. \nIt is, indeed, the moral challenge of our generation.\n  I am proud and inspired by the global community's unprecedented \ncommitment to avert global warming, to avert a climate crisis. We know \nwhat the stakes are. We don't need computer models to look 50 years \ninto the future because the impacts are here today. We see it in our \nown communities. We see it in our own States. We see it through the \nimpact of droughts, the impact of wildfires, the impact of heat waves, \nthe storms, the hurricanes, the tornadoes. We see it through story \nafter story of this year or this month being the warmest ever recorded \nby humans. These events have profound costs that can be measured in \nlost lives, lost homes, lost businesses, billions of dollars in \ndisaster relief.\n  It is important to understand that global warming's major assault is \non our rural communities, on our farming, our fishing, and our \nforestry. You can see it across the world. You can see it across the \ncountry. You can see it just inside my home State of Oregon. We have \nhad significant droughts greatly impacting our agricultural community \nin my State.\n  We have had a loss of snowpack in the Cascades, a trend over decades \nimpacting the availability of water for irrigation in farming. We have \nseen the impact on fishing, with streams that are warmer and smaller \nthan they were in the past. We have seen it on our oyster population on \nthe coast, where now the oysters are having trouble reproducing because \nthe Pacific Ocean is 30 percent more acidic than it was before we \nstarted burning fossil fuels on this planet. That greater acidity is \naffecting the ability of baby oysters to form shells. That should \nfrighten us all--the ability of shellfish to form shells being \nthreatened.\n  It is hard to imagine that we have burned enough fossil fuels to \nactually\n\n[[Page S2367]]\n\nimpact the acidity of the oceans. But we have, and the problem is \ngetting worse. We see the impact on our forests. We see it in my home \nState of Oregon through the red zone. That is the term given to the \nvast swaths of forests that have been killed by pine beetles because \nthe winters now are not cold enough to kill off the pine beetle. So the \ninfestations are much more aggressive, much more widespread.\n  We see the impact on our forests from more vigorous wildfires and a \nlonger forest fire season--a season that has grown by 60 days over 40 \nyears. That is 2 months. In fact, we have even had forest fires in \nOregon in the month of January. It is a huge loss, a huge impact on the \necosystem, and a huge impact on the economy.\n  If you care about rural America and our farming, our fishing, and our \nforestry, you must care about carbon pollution and global warming. \nScientists agree that we must keep the warming of our planet under 2 \ndegrees Celsius in order to avoid the catastrophic impacts of climate \nchange--impacts much worse than what we are seeing now. But we have \nalready warmed the planet by 1 degree. So we are halfway toward that \nboundary, which is why an important component of the Paris agreement is \nnot just the substance of the agreement itself but also a compact that \nthe international community will revisit every 5 years, because the \nmeasures taken in the Paris agreement are not enough to fend off \ncatastrophe.\n  What they do represent is virtually every nation in the world coming \ntogether and saying we understand the challenge to our planet, and we \nunderstand that we must be part of the solution. To have more heads of \nstate come together in December for the Paris agreement than at any \nother time in human history is very impressive. But the commitments \nmade, even if they are fully fulfilled, don't go far enough. We are \ngoing to have to come back together every 5 years to add to our \nunderstanding and to increase the speed with which we are pivoting from \nfossil fuels to renewable fuels.\n  At those 5-year gatherings, we will strengthen our pledges, we will \nwork to reduce the emissions even further, and we will review the \nchanging technologies. There is so much investment going on. There is a \nprogram called Mission Innovation, which is a number of countries \ncoming together, private companies coming together, and foundations \ncoming together to develop the best ideas--out-of-the-box ideas--to be \nable to take on the challenge of global warming. Those technologies are \ngoing to be a key part of accelerating our ability to tackle this \nchallenge.\n  We have to keep working to drive down the cost curve on renewable \nenergy so that it makes a positive contribution to our economy in every \npossible way, lowering the cost of power while at the same time putting \nthousands or, in some technologies, millions of individuals to work. We \nhave to make sure developing countries can afford these options in \nsolar, wind, and other renewable strategies.\n  Together, we must invest in paradigm-shifting technology. One of \nthose might be battery storage, to make better use of solar energy when \nthe solar energy exceeds current demand, or to capture wind energy when \nthe wind is blowing strongly and our wind turbines are producing more \nthan the current demand.\n  It means we have to do things such as investing in a broader grid to \nship those amps of electricity around the country--those watts of \nenergy around the country. Here at home, we can't keep up business as \nusual. If we need to pivot from fossil fuels to renewables, then we \nshouldn't keep subsidizing fossil fuels. We can't keep drilling oil \noffshore and opening up drilling in new places like the Arctic. The \nArctic nation should come together and reach a pact not to drill in the \nArctic and to put it off-limits.\n  As American citizens, you and I own a lot of oil, a lot of coal, and \nwe must recognize that we need to keep those fossil fuels that we own \nin the ground because here is the size of the problem. For us to \nsucceed in keeping the temperature of our planet below 2 degrees \nCelsius above the pre-industrial age, we have to leave 80 percent of \nthe identified proven fossil fuel reserves in the world in the ground.\n  If we are going to do that, then it makes no sense at all--for what \nyou and I own as citizens--to be pulling it out of the ground. It makes \nno sense to be doing contracts today--leases--that provide a legal \ncontract for extraction of our coal, our oil, and our gas, which you \nand I own as citizens, three decades, four decades, or five decades \ninto the future--long after the world has to have pivoted off of fossil \nfuels.\n  It is said that when you are in a hole, stop digging. In this case, \nwe are in a carbon pollution hole, and we need to stop digging fossil \nfuels out of the ground. Instead, we must seize the opportunity to \ninvest in the infrastructure of the future, to spur a clean energy \nrevolution, and to build a green economy creating living-wage jobs. It \nhas been said that we are the first generation to feel the impact of \nglobal warming, and we are the last generation that can do something \nabout it.\n  That is a huge responsibility. The signing of this agreement consists \nof doing something about it, something major about it, something \nimportant about it, something that all the Nations in the world have \ncome together to do together to take this on and to recognize our \ncollective responsibility. It is a breakthrough moment in the fight--\nthe international fight, the human civilization fight--to take on this \nmoral, major challenge to our planet.\n  While this deal is by no means the end of the work we must do, having \nthe global community come together around a vision of action is a huge \nmilestone in the path to averting climate catastrophe. This agreement \nshould only strengthen our Nation's resolve to build a sustainable \nfuture, to protect our beautiful blue-green planet, and to work harder \nto fight climate change not just on Earth Day but every day of the \nyear. In fact, this agreement is very much central to the task that \nTheodore Roosevelt put before us: to leave our land a better land for \nour descendants than it is for us. Let's get to work.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3833 to Amendment No. 3801\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 3833.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota, [Mr. Franken] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3833 to amendment No. 3801.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide funding for the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee \n                                Program)\n\n       On page 29, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n                  Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program\n\n       For the cost of loan guarantees provided under section \n     2602(c) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (25 U.S.C. 3502(c)), \n     $8,500,000, to remain available until expended: Provided, \n     That the cost of those loan guarantees (including the costs \n     of modifying loans, as applicable) shall be determined in \n     accordance with section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act \n     of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 661a): Provided further, That, for \n     necessary administrative expenses to carry out that program, \n     $500,000 is appropriated, to remain available until expended: \n     Provided further, That, of the subsidy amounts provided by \n     section 1425 of the Department of Defense and Full-Year \n     Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (Public Law 112-10; 125 \n     Stat. 126), for the cost of loan guarantees for renewable \n     energy or efficient end-use energy technologies under section \n     1703 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16513), \n     $9,000,000 is permanently canceled.\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, Federal programs in Indian Country are \nchronically underfunded. I have served on the Indian Affairs Committee \nfor the past 7 years, and I have been shocked by what I hear almost \nevery week from tribal leaders about the challenges in Indian Country. \nTribes struggle with crumbling schools, dilapidated roads, lack of \nhousing, and lack of basic infrastructure. Many of the crises we hear \nabout in Indian Country come from lack of opportunity, lack of hope. \nIndian youth have the highest rate of suicide among all ethnic groups \nin the United States. Suicide is the second-leading cause of death for \nNative youth aged 15 to 24. The Indian suicide rate is 62 percent \nhigher than it is for\n\n[[Page S2368]]\n\nthe general population. Unemployment on Indian reservations averages 19 \npercent, and on some reservations it is above 50 percent.\n  Senators Murkowski, Heitkamp, and Udall understand the dire needs of \nIndian Country, which is why they have cosponsored my amendment. \nChairman Barrasso also understands the needs of Indian Country, and \nthat is why he also supports this amendment. They understand that we \nhave to support economic development for tribes whenever we can.\n  My amendment sets aside $9 million, which can be leveraged into about \n$50 to $85 million worth of loans for energy projects in Indian \nCountry. Developing tribal energy resources will help tribes bring \npower to the most remote parts of Indian Country--improving access to \nreliable and resilient energy and providing much needed jobs. That is \nwhy Congress authorized the loan program in the Energy Policy Act of \n2005--to help tribes access the capital they need for energy projects. \nBut this program has never received funding.\n  My amendment doesn't cost anything. We are simply putting $9 million \nof already-appropriated money toward a new use.\n  I thank Senators Heitkamp, Udall, and Murkowski for cosponsoring my \namendment. I thank Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Feinstein for \ntheir leadership. Finally, I thank Secretary Moniz, who has been a \nchampion for this program.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Franken amendment No. 3833 to bring \njobs to Indian Country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank Senator Franken for the way \nhe worked with our committee. I will vote for the amendment, and I \nrecommend that others do as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3833.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Missouri (Mr. Blunt) and the Senator from Texas (Mr. \nCruz).\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I was necessarily absent from this \nafternoon's vote on Franken amendment No. 3833, which was adopted to \nthe pending business--Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, H.R. 2028.\n  On rollcall vote No. 59, had I been present, I would have voted to \nsupport the amendment. Senator Franken's amendment will further \nstrengthen the deployment of clean energy by creating a Tribal Energy \nLoan Guarantee Program to fund energy projects in Indian Country. This \namendment will help Indian tribes access much needed financing as they \nseek to develop energy projects and create well-paying jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise as the vice chair of the \nAppropriations Committee to express my appreciation to the majority \nleader of the Senate, Senator McConnell, and Senator Cochran, the chair \nof the Appropriations Committee, for moving the process forward.\n  We have on the floor today the Energy and Water Committee bill. This \nis the first bill of the Appropriations Committee to come to the floor. \nIt signals that we are ready to do regular order. I so appreciate the \nleaderships' commitment to do that, so we don't end up with a big \nomnibus bill at the end. Every bill comes, they can be amended, and \neveryone can have their day and their say.\n  It is an excellent kickoff to what I hope will be the ability to move \nall 12 bills and some crucial, urgent supplementals. I also compliment \nSenators Alexander and Senator Feinstein for the excellent job they \nhave done on this particular subcommittee. They have followed the \nbipartisan agreement. They have a bill that is free of poison pill \nriders. When you look at what they have done in terms of energy and \nwater, it is an excellent bill from the standpoint of national security \nand economic development, whether it is the funding for the Army Corps \nof Engineers that is so important to those of us who have ports, to \nscience in terms of our fields of energy. We win Nobel prizes, but we \nneed to win the markets. It has an excellent approach in terms of tech \ntransfer.\n  Maryland benefits from this bill. It provides over $100 million for \nthe Port of Baltimore. That is going to support the port's nearly \n14,000 jobs and a tax base of over $300 million. The Port of Baltimore \nhas always been the gateway to Ohio and the West. First, supported by \nthe B and Ohio--Railroad and now CSX. Funding in this bill \ndredges the port's 50-foot channel, making it ready for megacontainer \nships coming through the expanded Panama Canal and supporting the \nport's competitive edge over its East Coast competition. The bill also \nfunds construction of Poplar Island, where clean dredge material is \nrebuilding the natural ecosystem of a former Chesapeake Bay island.\n  This bill exceeds the target level for the harbor maintenance trust \nfund, providing approximately $1.3 billion. Dredging is the primary \nactivity of the trust fund. This funding is knocking out the nationwide \nbacklog of dredging projects, supporting the U.S. economy and local \neconomies.\n  Across Maryland, this bill makes critical investments, protecting \nAssateague Island, a national seaside treasure, for future generations, \nprotecting Cumberland from flooding, and protecting this area's water \nsupply at the Jennings Randolph Lake in Garrett County.\n  This bill also supports a unique public-private partnership between \nthe U.S. Department of Energy and commercial truck manufacturers. \nTogether, they are developing the next generation of fuel-efficient \nheavy-duty trucks. Total funding is $20 million. Volvo has been a \npartner and is competing again for a portion of this funding. Its \nHagerstown, MD plant produces Mack Trucks with 1,600 jobs. Their \ntalented professionals have been leaders on truck engine research and \ndevelopment, discovering technologies to reduce oil consumption and \ndecrease greenhouse gas emissions.\n  For the Appalachian Regional Commission, this bill provides $75 \nmillion for the base program, an increase of $5 million. The commission \nmeets both physical and human infrastructure needs. This is a hands-\nacross-the-aisle program that all Appalachia Senators support. There \nare 13 States in the commission.\n\n[[Page S2369]]\n\n  Maryland has three counties in the commission: Washington, Allegany, \nand Garrett.\n  Maryland's mountain counties receive nearly $5 million annually, \nmaking investments to rebound from lost manufacturing jobs. The \nrecession was another setback.\n  Now, through their community colleges, they are retraining and \nretooling their residents. The commission's grants, matched with local \nand other Federal funding, are making a big difference.\n  I recently visited Garrett College where I announced two grants. The \nfirst was to establish new allied health programs with a simulation \nmanikin. This was a grant award for $110,000.\n  The second grant was to buy Westernport a new water tank. This grant \nfor $400,000 was matched with $2.4 million in other Federal loans and \ngrants. It means more capacity for Westernport, new service to nearby \ntowns of Luke and Bloomington, and a huge cost savings to Luke Mill. \nThe paper mill has been supplying drinking water to the town of Luke. \nThis grant is protecting the 880 employees at Luke Mill and 3,000 \nregional jobs in timber and trucking.\n  If this is the way it is going to be to move appropriations, I think \nit is a good day. It is not only a good bill, but it shows when the \nSenate practices the ability to work together to bring legislation to \nthe floor, to follow regular order, we can get our job done. It can be \nopen, it can be transparent, and we can have amendments. I so look \nforward to this being the tone and the tempo of the rest of the \nappropriations season.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           National Park Week\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, this week I encourage Arkansans and all \nAmericans to take a moment and enjoy your local national parks as we \ncelebrate National Park Week 2016. This year National Park Week is \nparticularly important because it also happens to be the 100th \nanniversary of the National Park Service, a milestone we will celebrate \nall year long.\n  For those of you who don't know, our National Park System began in \n1872 with the establishment of Yellowstone National Park. The \norganization charged with managing these parks, the National Park \nService, was established four decades later in 1916. Today we have over \n400 national parks and historic sites around the country, all full of \nwildlife, beautiful landscapes, and rich culture. These sites are all \ncared for by over 20,000 dedicated employees of the National Park \nService, including park rangers who patrol our parks and keep visitors \nsafe.\n  Arkansas is home to several national parks and national historic \nsites, some of the prettiest and most interesting in the country, in my \nopinion. For those of you who have not been to Arkansas, I encourage \nyou to visit Hot Springs National Park to see our natural springs and \nthermal pools.\n  If you are a history buff, you can visit Arkansas Post, the site of \nthe only Revolutionary War activity in the State of Arkansas. If you \nare into the outdoors, you can float the Buffalo River. The list goes \non. Each of the national parks and historic sites in Arkansas and \naround the country has its own unique appeal and holds its own \nadventure.\n  So happy National Park Week and happy 100th birthday to the National \nPark Service. I encourage everyone to take advantage of free admission \nto all national parks in Arkansas and across the country through this \nSunday, April 24. Have a little fun, learn a little bit about your \ngreat country, and show your support and thanks for the men and women \nwho serve us in the national parks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto complete this speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Corporate Inversions\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, over the past couple of years I have spoken \nnumerous times on corporate inversions, the problems they cause, and \nvarious proposed solutions. I wish to take a few minutes today to \ncomment on some of the recent developments with regard to this \nimportant issue.\n  Inversions are a matter of great concern in our country. This is true \namong members of both parties, both in and out of government. As the \nchairman of the Senate's tax-writing committee, I have to say that for \nyears now, most major discussions I have had on tax policy and reform \nwith various private sector stakeholders eventually end up focusing on \ninversions.\n  Virtually everyone acknowledges that inversions are a problem. When a \nU.S. company reidentifies itself as a foreign entity and moves its tax \nheadquarters overseas, it shrinks our tax base. It means lost \ninvestment and growth for our country and a further demonstration of \nthe failure of the government to create a tax environment in this \ncountry that allows businesses to flourish, create jobs, and, of \ncourse, help grow our economy.\n  As I said, members of both parties see inversions as a problem, one \nthat needs fixing. Sadly, the debate surrounding this national issue \nhas too often become mired in politics and partisanship, which thus far \nhas prevented Congress from making any real progress. Some in \nWashington--in the Capitol and on the other end of Pennsylvania \nAvenue--would rather talk about inversions than solve the problem.\n  When a wave of U.S. companies announce that they are merging with \nother entities and moving their headquarters offshore, the strategy \nseems to be to publicly attack those companies; accuse them of, among \nother things, lacking ``economic patriotism''; and put forward \nunworkable policy proposals while labelling anyone opposing those \nproposals as somehow being in favor of or at least indifferent to \ninversions. Most of the policy ideas that get put forward tend to be \npunitive and burdensome, with the goal, not of incentivizing companies \nto stay in the United States, but to forcibly prevent them from \nleaving.\n  Over the past year or so of political campaigning, we have heard a \nlot of talk about building walls and who will be made to pay for them. \nSome are proposing that we build a literal physical wall to keep \ncertain people from coming into the United States, with a supposedly \nclever plan to force other countries to pay for it. Well, at the same \ntime, most of the proposals we have seen to deal with inversions would \namount to building a virtual wall--a wall forged in regulation and \npunitive tax treatment--around the country to keep companies from \nleaving and making every business in America and all of their employees \nand individual customers pay the cost.\n  The latest wall-building exercise came earlier this month with \nTreasury's temporary anti-inversion regulations and proposed \nregulations aimed at earnings stripping. Of course, the \nadministration's anti-inversion approach is essentially the regulatory \nequivalent of a doctor who wastes all of his time and energy treating a \npatient's symptoms one by one as they arise without making any effort \nto diagnose, let alone treat, the underlying illness.\n  Inversions are not in and of themselves a disease; they are merely \nsymptoms of a much broader illness that will continue to infect our \neconomy so long as we refuse to treat it. I won't keep you in suspense, \nMr. President. That illness is not a lack of proper regulation; it is \nan overly burdensome tax system and an environment that is, on the \nwhole, unfriendly to American businesses.\n  U.S. companies don't move their tax headquarters offshore because \nthey like the weather in other countries. If that were the case, I \ndon't think so many of them would be moving to Ireland or the U.K. No. \nAmerican companies invert because they face global competition, and our \nsystem forces them to compete on an uneven playing field with at least \none, if not both arms tied behind their back. For example, we have the \nhighest corporate tax rate in the developed world, and we have a tax \ncode that effectively pays U.S.\n\n[[Page S2370]]\n\nmultinationals to keep their foreign earnings offshore and punishes \nthem when they decide to bring capital back into the country. It is \nthese factors--not a lack of appropriate regulation by the government \nor a shortage of ``economic patriotism'' on the part of American \nbusinesses--that make foreign countries more attractive destinations \nfor American companies.\n  If we want to prevent future inversions, we should spend less time \ntinkering around the regulatory edges and engaging in partisan rhetoric \nand more time trying to find common ground to actually fix our Tax \nCode.\n  For the record, it isn't just inversions that are the problem. As I \nhave noted repeatedly, even if the administration and Congress found a \nway, through punitive and burdensome means, to block all inversions, \nour tax system would still make American companies even more attractive \ntargets for foreign takeovers, which are every bit as problematic as \ninversions, if not more so, and much harder to address through a purely \nregulatory approach. Foreign takeovers are already a problem. According \nto an Ernst and Young study released last year, the U.S. economy \nsuffered a net loss of $179 billion--with a ``b''--in business and \nassets to foreign buyers in the decade between 2003 and 2013. The same \nstudy also found that a reduced corporate tax rate would have greatly \nreduced these losses, possibly eliminating them entirely.\n\n  Keep in mind that unlike most inversion transactions, U.S. management \nis almost always fired after a foreign takeover. Other employees--local \nservice providers and suppliers--are often targeted for elimination as \nwell.\n  Sadly, many Democrats in Washington, both here in Congress and in the \nadministration, don't seem to grasp the full nature of this problem. \nThey talk a great deal about inversions and the need to prevent them. \nBecause the picture of a big American company moving offshore to escape \ntaxation is particularly distressing for populist audiences, they tend \nto ramp up that talk and couple it with ideas on how to punish \ninverters in even-numbered years. Yet they have taken precious little \naction to fix the underlying problems that lead companies to want to \ninvert in the first place.\n  There was a glimmer of hope with the findings and recommendations of \nthe Finance Committee's bipartisan International Tax Reform Working \nGroup. However, as is far too often the case, that glimmer of hope may \nvery well be overtaken by the politics of the moment.\n  So instead of acknowledging that our tax system is the cause of the \ninversion problem, my friends on the other side have generally opted to \nput forward regulations that may very well be effective in curbing \ninversions in the short term but will do nothing to improve business \nconditions in the United States and could be in the order of causing \ncompanies to sell themselves to foreign buyers, which is what is \nhappening.\n  Within days of the release of the Treasury's latest regulations, \nPfizer, a major American drug company, announced it was backing out of \nits proposed inversion deal with Allergan. Many observers were quick to \ncredit the Obama administration for a supposed job well done while \nDemocratic candidates for President openly celebrated the fact that an \nAmerican company chose to subject itself to hundreds of millions of \ndollars in losses and penalties in order to avoid even greater losses \nas a result of these regulations.\n  That is the kind of world we are living in--one where there is a \nwillingness to demonize an iconic American company that employees tens \nof thousands of American workers and to cheer when it suffers massive \nlosses. That is viewed as an affirmative qualification to be the \nDemocratic nominee for President.\n  Now, to be fair, I will acknowledge that, in addition to unveiling \nthe proposed anti-inversion measures, the Obama administration also \nlaid out a basic framework for corporate tax reform. Of course, this \nframework, which closely resembles similar proposals the President has \nincluded in past budgets, is woefully short on details. It is not a \nreform proposal with any serious potential for bipartisanship nor one \nwith a detailed list of specific goals and objectives. It is more or \nless just a vaguely worded wish list of tax ideas they would like to \nsee enacted at some point. The reaction from many sectors of the \nbusiness community, including from CEOs who more often than not support \nmy friends on the other side, proves the point.\n  We know, basically, that the President's version of international tax \nreform consists of a one-time mandatory repatriation of foreign \nearnings to be taxed at a rate designed not to maximize any benefit but \nto hit a revenue target for increased spending--in other words, so they \ncan spend more money. This would be coupled with a high minimum tax on \nforeign earnings, also designed specifically for increased spending, \nnot for significantly bringing down the statutory tax rate, which, \nafter all, is one of the few ways you can really help our American \ncompanies.\n  Put simply, there is virtually nothing in the President's nebulous \ntax reform framework that would discourage companies from moving \noffshore. In fact, one could argue--and many have--that the President's \nproposed high minimum tax on foreign earnings would actually encourage \nmore U.S. companies to invert.\n  For example, this past November, the vice president of global taxes \nat Procter & Gamble, another iconic American company, was quoted as \nsaying: ``If we take a step towards a [minimum] tax at the corporate \nlevel, we're exacerbating the problem; we're actually guaranteeing that \ninversions are more attractive.''\n  On top of these new taxes, there is no real effort in the President's \ntax framework to improve the business climate in the United States more \ngenerally. After all these changes, the framework would still leave the \nUnited States with a corporate tax that would be well above the average \nin the developed world, leaving us right where we have been. In short, \nthis framework is par for the course with this administration.\n  We have heard quite a bit of blame thrown in Congress's direction for \nnot acting to prevent inversions. What we haven't heard is any serious \neffort on the part of the President or anyone in his administration to \nengage with Congress on meaningful tax reform. Like I said, the \nPresident and his supporters are far more willing to assign blame for \nthe problems caused by our tax system than to actually work toward a \nsolution. This is particularly true in election years, when the motto \nseems to be this: Why fix a problem when you can blame it on the other \nside?\n  For my part, I am working to take specific steps to address these \nproblems. I have been the Republican leader on the Senate Committee on \nFinance for about 4\\1/2\\ years now, and for 4\\1/2\\ years I have been \ncalling on my colleagues and imploring officials in the administration \nto engage on tax reform. To date, I have seen little in the way of a \nmeaningful response.\n  Currently, I am working on a relatively simple but potentially \neffective tax reform proposal that I believe will be bipartisan and \nmany believe would relieve a great deal of the inversion pressure on \nAmerican companies and, at the very least, significantly alter the \neconomic calculation for inversion transactions. Best of all, it would \ndo so without punishing companies or imposing burdensome mandates. In \nshort, my proposal would provide more carrots to keep companies from \ninverting and fewer sticks to punish companies that try to go in that \ndirection.\n  While I am still working with the Joint Committee on Taxation to \nfinalize the details of this proposal, the basic idea behind my \nproposal would be to streamline the taxation of business income and \neliminate instances in which profits and earnings are subject to \nmultiple layers of taxation at the company and shareholder levels.\n  I will have more to say on this proposal in the coming weeks. Today, \nI am simply trying to counter the narrative that American companies can \nand should be forced to remain in the United States by regulation. I am \ntrying to demonstrate that you cannot fix the inversion problem by \nbuilding a virtual wall around the country to keep businesses from \nleaving, while at the same time keeping tax rates so high that they \nhave to leave to be able to compete.\n  I am trying to show why you can't build that wall expecting some \nother\n\n[[Page S2371]]\n\ncountry to pay for it. Indeed, if an anti-inversion wall goes up \nwithout any real changes to improve the tax and business environment in \nthe United States, it will be American workers and consumers that will \nend up footing the bill.\n  What we are working on is corporate integration. Right now the work \nwe have done seems to be getting some positive feedback from the Joint \nTaxation Committee, but they are not through with their work yet and so \nwe are going to wait until they are. They should be through by the end \nof May, or at least that is what they have indicated will be their \ntarget. Hopefully, they will have some preliminary results before the \nend of May.\n  But let me say, if we are right on corporate integration, then both \nparties should come together to resolve these problems so that we can \ncompete with any company anywhere in the world.\n  I can just say, in short, that this program we are devising will \nallow the companies themselves to bring down their own tax rates \nwithout worrying about what the wonderful Members of Congress are going \nto do. At the same time, by bringing down those rates, they will be \nable to help this economy to go forward.\n  So far this has been revenue positive. All we want for this program \nis to be revenue neutral. But I think we can get there, and I hope my \nfriends on the other side will seriously look at this because this is \nsomething we could do this year to help this country resolve its \nproblems with regard to corporate inversions. I believe it will work. I \nbelieve it will work. But a lot will depend on the Joint Taxation \nCommittee, and we will see what they are doing. So far the work they \nhave done is positive. They have worked on it for a number of months \nnow. They want to cover every possible ramification, and we are very \nappreciative of the work they are doing.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, today I filed two amendments very important \nto my home State of Florida that I want to discuss. The first is an \namendment that would authorize the Central Everglades Planning Project. \nThe Florida Everglades are a national treasure. We have to work \ntogether to restore these lands.\n  The State has experienced a wetter-than-average winter. The rains \nhave elevated the levels of Lake Okeechobee which triggered the Army \nCorps of Engineers to discharge billions of gallons of water to the \neast through the St. Lucie River and to the west through the \nCaloosahatchee River. These discharges have been ongoing for months and \nhave negatively impacted the delicate ecosystem in the area as well as \nthe agricultural and tourism industries.\n  In order to diminish these discharges, we must authorize the Central \nEverglades Planning Project. Once complete, this project will allow \nwater to flow south from Lake Okeechobee to Everglades National Park \nand to Florida Bay.\n  I had hoped this project would be authorized in 2014 by the \nadministration, but the administration delayed the Army Corps of \nEngineers' Chief's report, which is the final step before Congress can \nauthorize new projects, but this year we have a real chance to get this \ndone. Thanks to the good work of Chairman Inhofe of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, I expect the Central Everglades Planning \nProject to be included in the forthcoming water bill, which is slated \nto be marked up in committee next week.\n  I will not ask for a vote on this amendment today, but I want to draw \nattention to this essential Everglades restoration project. I am \nhopeful this body can come together to restore our Everglades, but in \nthe meantime I will continue to push for this vital authorization.\n  Mr. President, the other amendment I filed today, cosponsored by \nSenators Shelby, Nelson, and Sessions, also highlights the importance \nof water management. The issue at hand there involves water that is \nnaturally supposed to flow south, but it has not done so due to the \nArmy Corps' actions in and around the State of Georgia.\n  The results of this mismanagement have led to a 2013 Department of \nCommerce fishery disaster. It was declared for oysters in the \nApalachicola Bay. During that same year, Senator Nelson and I held a \nfield hearing in Apalachicola, where we heard from local fishermen \nwhose livelihoods and family traditions were injured by the collapse of \nthese fisheries.\n  While we must continue to explore ways to fish more sustainably, a \nlarge part of the fisheries' collapse was the lack of freshwater flows. \nI have long supported the role Governors play in water allocation when \nthe water in question greatly impacts multiple States. However, absent \nsuch an agreement between Governors, water continues to be withheld, \nand the situation has now become dire in my home State of Florida.\n  The bottom line is, the status quo is only working for one State. I, \nalong with the senior Senator from Florida and our colleagues from \nAlabama, have stood lockstep to bring our respective States to the \ntable to finalize water allocations that will take into account our \nshared goals.\n  Today we filed an amendment to do just that--to require the Governors \nto agree on water allocation before the Army Corps of Engineers can \nreallocate waters between the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River \nBasin and the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa River Basin. The amendment also \nstipulates no funds would be available for reallocation of water within \nthe States if an agreement between the Governors is not finalized. I \nurge my colleagues to support this commonsense measure.\n\n\n                             Eureka Gardens\n\n  Mr. President, on a different matter, I want to take this moment to \napplaud the residents of Eureka Garden Apartments in Jacksonville, FL, \nfor coming together as a community during a time of hardship. While \nthey face dangerous living conditions and bureaucratic indifference to \ntheir concerns, they have remained united and resilient.\n  The bottom line is, the Federal Government has failed them. The \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development has for years certified a \nliving facility that has put hundreds of families at risk. When HUD \ninspected the property in question last summer, they passed the \napartment complex, and they passed it with flying colors. Eureka \nGardens received an 85 out of 100, but less than a month later, \nresidents were complaining at tenants' association meetings and to \ntheir city council members about how bad their living conditions had \nbecome.\n  When my staff visited the complex, what they witnessed was literally \nunbelievable. They saw crumbling stairs and black mold. They saw \nexposed electrical wiring that had been covered up by a trash bag. They \nsmelled the natural gas that would soon hospitalize residents just days \nlater.\n  That was and that is unacceptable. My office, along with Mayor Curry \nof the city of Jacksonville and the city council and the tenants \nassociation, pushed for months to have improvements and repairs done to \nthis complex. In February, HUD finally had a date by which all repairs \nmust be completed.\n  When they came back to reinspect Eureka Gardens, it passed the \ninspection, and they eventually renewed their contract with the \nproperty's owner, but the residents continued to say what they have \nbeen saying all along--HUD's inspections weren't working.\n  Just recently, HUD revealed that Eureka Gardens passed with a score \nof 62. The passing score is a 60. However, a senior HUD official \nadmitted that HUD officials do not believe the property would currently \npass another inspection. So HUD has just admitted it has certified a \nfailing facility. Something is clearly wrong with the HUD inspection \nprocess and Floridians are being hurt because of it.\n  I would like to read part of an article from the Florida Times-Union, \nwhich was published on Monday that quotes one of the residents at \nEureka Gardens.\n\n       Dwan Wilson, who said she has had to go to the hospital at \n     least six times with asthma issues since the mold \n     remediation, cried as she spoke about her apartments' \n     problems.\n\n[[Page S2372]]\n\n       ``We thank you all for what you're trying to do,'' Wilson \n     said. ``We thank you all for pushing. But we're telling you \n     they aren't doing anything.''\n\n  How many more years must the residents of Eureka Gardens suffer under \nthis mismanagement? How many more children have to be put at risk due \nto lead poisoning and gas leaks? How many more facilities will HUD \ncontinue to rubberstamp approval of only to further sell slumlike \nconditions for the most vulnerable tenants? How many taxpayer dollars \nwill be wasted by this agency on failing projects such as this?\n  These are the questions HUD must answer. In the meantime, the \nresidents of Eureka Gardens are forced to deal with the consequences of \nHUD's failures. I will continue to look for solutions to make sure what \nhas happened at Eureka Gardens isn't repeated elsewhere. Americans \ndeserve better from their government.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter I wrote to the Secretary of HUD, and it is dated April 18.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 18, 2016.\n     Hon. Secretary Julian Castro,\n     U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Secretary Castro: For over five months, my office has \n     been involved in the investigation of shocking health and \n     safety conditions at Eureka Garden Apartments (Eureka Garden) \n     in Jacksonville, Florida. It is appalling that American \n     taxpayer dollars have been wastefully spent over the years to \n     fund a facility that has repeatedly put hundreds of people \n     and their families at risk. I am writing to highlight these \n     many problems and to ask for the U.S. Department of Housing \n     and Urban Development (HUD) to conduct a thorough review of \n     its inspection process.\n       As you may know, following reports of code violations at \n     the Westside complex, my Jacksonville staff toured Eureka \n     Garden in early October 2015. They witnessed crumbling stairs \n     disguised with duct-tape and covered with apparent black \n     mold, faulty electric wiring covered with a garbage bag, and \n     a distinguishable natural gas odor being sucked from an \n     outdoor piping system into residents' air-conditioning, among \n     other obvious health and safety issues. HUD confirmed these \n     conditions in an inspection of the property in October 2015, \n     in which physical deficiencies were found in at least 340 of \n     the 400 units. According to HUD's own criteria, almost 50 of \n     those deficiencies represented ``Exigent Health and Safety \n     concerns,'' including mold, water damage, exposed wires, \n     carbon monoxide hazards and leaking gas pipes.\n       Despite these findings, just three months earlier in July \n     2015, HUD gave Eureka Garden Apartments an 85 out of 100 \n     score in its Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) inspection. \n     Although many of the problems were witnessed during the \n     summer inspection, HUD representatives defended the passing \n     score to my staff in a meeting last October, saying they did \n     not contribute to the assessment of the property as they are \n     not relevant criteria under HUD's inspection process. Had it \n     not been for the residents calling attention to their dire \n     situation, the facility would not have been reviewed again \n     for another two years.\n       Your Department recently notified my office that the most \n     recent inspection of Eureka Garden gave the complex a REAC \n     score of 62 out 100, despite the many repairs that have been \n     completed since the last REAC inspection. This discrepancy \n     indicates something is clearly wrong with the REAC scores. \n     Your Department visited Eureka Garden again on March 17th and \n     18th and witnessed what my staff and the city of Jacksonville \n     has seen all along--Eureka Garden remains in poor condition.\n       After visiting Eureka Garden most recently, the Deputy \n     Assistant Secretary for Multifamily Housing wrote in a letter \n     that ``HUD officials do not believe the property would \n     currently pass another REAC inspection.'' However, HUD's \n     protocol has placed enough confidence in the previous \n     inspection that it has renewed GMF's $6 million contract for \n     Eureka Garden. In doing so, HUD has knowingly certified a \n     substandard facility because of a faulty inspection process.\n       Your Department is ultimately responsible as the steward of \n     the taxpayer funding that supports this property. Therefore, \n     to address these concerns, I respectfully request a timely \n     response to the following questions:\n       With conditions at Eureka Garden going unidentified for so \n     long, what does HUD plan to do about reforming its inspection \n     process to identify problems earlier and to ensure passing \n     grades are not given to failing properties?\n       Will HUD explore a broader reform of inspection that \n     expands the role of and resources available for state and \n     local partners to regularly check the status of HUD-certified \n     facilities to ensure greater accountability?\n       Does the Department plan a re-inspection of the complex?\n       During this difficult time, I am proud of the Eureka Garden \n     community for standing up and coming together on behalf of \n     their vulnerable neighbors. This community has demonstrated \n     great strength by collectively voicing their concerns and \n     showing resiliency in the face of bureaucratic indifference \n     and property mismanagement. It is time they are given the \n     respect and quality of life they so deserve after waiting far \n     too long for critical improvements to be made at Eureka \n     Garden.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter and continued \n     work on this issue. I look forward to your prompt response.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Marco Rubio,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n\n      Calling for the Release of Raif Badawi and Waleed Abulkhair\n\n  Mr. President, one last item I want to discuss today, and I think it \nis appropriate, given where the President finds himself at this moment \nin Saudi Arabia. It is regarding a letter I sent earlier this week, \nalong with Senators Durbin, Risch, Leahy, and Johnson to President \nObama asking him to raise human rights issues during his meetings in \nSaudi Arabia--in particular, the case of Raif Badawi and his lawyer \nWaleed Abulkhair. Raif Badawi is a Saudi blogger. He was arrested in \n2012 on the charge of insulting Islam and indicted on several charges, \nincluding apostasy. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 \nlashes.\n  In January of 2015, Raif received his first set of 50 lashes in \npublic. This resulted in an international outcry. Raif's subsequent \nlashes have been postponed. They have been postponed on health grounds. \nThey have been postponed because just the first 50 lashes were so \nbrutal, there were doubts whether he would survive 50 more, but he \ncontinues to serve his sentence in prison.\n  Last week I met with Raif's wife to discuss his case. Raif and his \nlawyer should be immediately and unconditionally released. While I \ndeeply value and think it is a very important alliance between the \nUnited States and Saudi Arabia, this alliance cannot allow our country \nto turn a blind eye to human rights abuses. I hope we will take up this \ncause.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record our letter, \ndated April 19, 2016, that we wrote to the President.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 19, 2016.\n     Hon. Barack Obama,\n     The President, The White House\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As you prepare for your upcoming trip \n     to Saudi Arabia, we are writing to express concern regarding \n     the Government of Saudi Arabia's continued treatment of human \n     rights advocates, particularly the documented prosecutions of \n     non-violent activists who are engaging in freedom of \n     expression. Intolerance for freedom of speech and the \n     imposition of travel bans and lengthy prison terms for \n     peaceful dissidents harm Saudi Arabia's reputation \n     internationally and stifle Saudi innovation and creativity. \n     We are concerned that unless you make these issues a priority \n     during your trip, human rights abuses will continue to occur \n     with impunity and the full potential of the U.S.-Saudi \n     relationship will continue to be impeded.\n       Specifically, we request you raise the case of blogger Raif \n     Badawi, who was sentenced to 10 years in jail and 1,000 \n     lashes for launching a website that suggested a peaceful \n     discussion about religion. Mr. Badawi endured a first round \n     of 50 lashes in January of 2015 but the remainder of his \n     lashes has been postponed due to his health condition. During \n     his unjust imprisonment, Mr. Badawi has been a recipient of \n     prestigious international awards such as the Sakharov Prize \n     for Freedom of Thought. We are also concerned for the case of \n     Mr. Badawi's lawyer, prominent human rights activist Waleed \n     Abu al-Khair, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison. \n     Additionally, we are concerned about the 2014 travel ban \n     placed on Mr. Badawi's sister Samar Badawi, for her activism \n     defending human rights. In 2012, Ms. Badawi received the U.S. \n     State Department's International Women of Courage Award. In \n     recent months, Ms. Badawi has been called in for questioning \n     by security forces on several occasions and is subject to \n     ongoing harassment.\n       In your meeting with King Salman, we urge you to advocate \n     for the immediate and unconditional release of Raif Badawi \n     and Waleed Abu al-Khair. Additionally, we urge you to request \n     that Ms. Badawi's travel ban be lifted and ensure that she is \n     not harassed further for her work. This is an important time \n     for Saudi Arabia to play a leadership role in the region and \n     the world by setting an example of religious tolerance and \n     civility.\n       We value the United States and Saudi Arabia close \n     partnership and support efforts to\n\n[[Page S2373]]\n\n     find common approaches to addressing such critical issues as \n     combating terrorism. However, true partners need to be able \n     to have a frank dialogue about disagreements and areas of \n     concern in our relationship. It is thus essential that the \n     United States does not turn a blind eye to Saudi Arabia's \n     human rights abuses.\n           Sincerely,\n     Marco Rubio.\n     James E. Risch.\n     Ron Johnson.\n     Richard J. Durbin.\n     Patrick Leahy.\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Energy Policy Modernization Bill\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the bipartisan \nEnergy Policy Modernization Act, which passed the Senate yesterday with \nmy strong support. This bill will help improve the energy efficiency of \nour buildings and appliances, saving Michiganders money on their \nheating and electric bills by incentivizing weatherization and other \nactivities. Many of these cutting-edge building efficiency \ntechnologies, such as insulation and window sealing, are designed and \ndeveloped in my great State of Michigan.\n  The bill also included a number of conservation provisions that will \nnot only protect our environment, but they will boost our economy by \nsupporting the $646 billion outdoor recreation industry. Permanent \nauthorizations of the Land and Water Conservation Fund and \nreauthorization of the North American Wetland Conservation Act are just \ntwo examples that will protect wildlife habitat and improve access to \npublic lands for all kinds of outdoor recreation.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to take a moment to focus on a \nbipartisan provision that I authored with my colleagues Senator \nStabenow and Senator Alexander, the Vehicle Innovation Act. This \nlegislation will provide the tools that researchers, engineers, \nmanufacturers, and others need to create the next generation of cars \nand trucks built in Michigan and in States all across our country.\n  Southeast Michigan is home to more engineers per capita than anywhere \nelse in the country. We must ensure that our automakers, part \nsuppliers, and other advanced manufacturers have the right tools to \ndevelop and incorporate new vehicle innovations that will improve \nsafety, innovation, and vehicle performance in the cars and trucks of \nthe future.\n  Exciting innovations are already underway. Cars and trucks are being \nmade with high-strength, light-weight materials that can improve fuel \neconomy without compromising safety. Improved combustion technologies \ncan increase the efficiency of traditional engines while decreasing \nemissions. Researchers are making batteries more affordable and \nrecyclable while enhancing battery range and performance, making \nhybrids and electric vehicles even more competitive.\n  The Department of Energy's Vehicle Technologies Program is leading \nthis effort, working with a wide range of partners, manufacturers, \nmaterial suppliers, universities, energy suppliers, and our National \nLaboratories. The Department of Energy's vehicle technology activities \nare authorized by a patchwork of different laws, and these authorities \nwere last renewed almost a decade ago. A lot has changed in that time. \nVehicles today are wired with cutting-edge electronics and sensors.\n  While my favorite part of Detroit cars and trucks remains horsepower \nand torque, advances in onboard computers and new technologies are \nmaking our cars safer, more efficient, and more competitive globally.\n  The Peters-Alexander-Stabenow Vehicle Innovation Act provides for a \nsteady increase in funding for critical DOE programs through the year \n2020. This will create more certainty for companies and entrepreneurs \nengaged in public-private partnerships and ensure that critical \nresearch and development can keep up as technologies continue to \nemerge.\n  Our bill also establishes a clean authorization for DOE's advanced \nvehicle technology activities. This will improve collaboration with \nlight-duty automobile and medium- and heavy-duty commercial truck \nengineers, manufacturers, and suppliers to conduct cutting-edge \ntechnology-neutral research that will improve fuel economy and minimize \nfossil fuel use.\n  With over 256 million vehicles on our roads, it takes decades of \nsustained effort to turn over our fleet. It is absolutely critical that \nwe continue developing these advanced technologies here in the United \nStates in order to achieve major fuel savings in the future and become \ntruly energy independent.\n  The Vehicle Innovation Act has support from major manufacturers, \nlabor, and environmental groups. This is something that just makes \nsense. I appreciate the support of Senators Murkowski and Cantwell and \nall my colleagues who supported including this legislation in the \nbipartisan energy package. While I was pleased to see this commonsense \nmeasure included, I continue to be frustrated and disappointed that \nthis body has held up an up-or-down vote on a bipartisan package \nauthored by Senator Stabenow and me to help the people of Flint, MI.\n  Flint is still in crisis mode as families still do not have safe, \nreliable water flowing from their taps. Senator Stabenow and I will \ncontinue pursuing all paths to fight for the assistance that the people \nof Flint deserve. We will not give up. We remain fully committed to \ndelivering to Flint families the assistance they need to be able to use \ntheir tap water for bathing, cooking, and drinking without the fear \nthat it may harm them or their children.\n  I know that many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are \nwilling and able to join us in our efforts to help Flint. I urge them \nto continue working with us to pass this package through the Senate as \nsoon as possible. The people of Flint cannot wait any longer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                   Judiciary Committee Investigations\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to take this time to respond to \nSenator Reid's juvenile attacks on my Judiciary Committee's \ninvestigations and to Senator Reid's frequent crying about my previous \nState Department holds.\n  Over the past several months, Senator Reid has been obsessed with \nmentioning holds on nominees--holds which I no longer have. Holds are \noften necessary to force the executive branch to comply with \ncongressional investigations. If you want proof of that, just ask the \nObama administration. In a Federal court filing during the Fast and \nFurious litigation, the Obama administration argued that the court \nshould not even consider that particular case. The Justice Department's \nbrief said courts should not enforce subpoenas at all. Instead, the \nJustice Department reasoned that Congress should use other powers to \nget documents.\n  Here is exactly what the government brief said: ``Among other powers, \nCongress can withhold funds from the Executive Branch, override vetoes, \ndecline to enact legislation, refuse to act on nominations, and \nadjourn.'' Later in the brief, the Obama administration specifically \nsuggested that Congress can ``tie up nominations'' in order to get \ndocuments.\n  If the administration can say that, why would Senator Reid think that \nis a wrong act for Congress to take? It is this simple: If the minority \nleader doesn't like Senators using holds to get documents from \nagencies, perhaps Senator Reid should talk to his friends in the Obama \nadministration who suggested that in the first place.\n  In addition, Senator Reid shows his hypocrisy since Members on his \nown side have held up Obama nominees, and Senator Reid never said a \npeep about Democrats exercising their rights. Further, Senator Reid's \nattempts to politicize the Judiciary Committee's oversight work are \nvery uninformed and result in misguided statements, and Senator Reid's \naccusation that taxpayer money is being wasted by engaging in oversight \nof the executive branch rings hollow.\n  Secretary Clinton's nongovernment server and private email \narrangements effectively walled off her official communications from \nthe normal Freedom\n\n[[Page S2374]]\n\nof Information Act and other Federal recordkeeping requirements. So to \nSenator Reid, I say: The Freedom of Information Act is squarely within \nthe jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee and subject to oversight.\n  The former Secretary's use of a secret, private server to conduct all \nof her official business led to an avalanche of Freedom of Information \nAct litigation. It also caused inaccurate responses to Freedom of \nInformation Act requests. For example, in December 2012, Citizens for \nResponsibility and Ethics in Washington submitted a Freedom of \nInformation Act request for records of Secretary Clinton's email \naddresses. The Department responded by stating: ``No records responsive \nto your request were located.'' That response is very misleading, at \nbest. Senior Department officials knew about Secretary Clinton's use of \nprivate email for official correspondence since they were sending \nemails to her nongovernment email address. They would have known \ninstantly of records responsive to that request that the Citizens for \nResponsibility and Ethics in Washington submitted. Yet those senior \nofficials apparently failed to communicate with the State Department's \nFreedom of Information Act office. Even then, if State's FOIA office \nwere to search Secretary Clinton's government email account, they would \nfind nothing since she operated a private account not subject to \nfreedom of information.\n  Separate from her email address, Secretary Clinton's nongovernment \nserver was a secret to high-level officials at the State Department who \nwere responsible for information technology and security.\n  These officials had no idea the Secretary was operating a separate \nunofficial system. She did not get their approval to do so, so how \nwould they know?\n  The Judiciary Committee has interviewed the Chief Information \nOfficer, the former Chief Information Officer, the former Deputy Chief \nInformation Officer, and the Director of Diplomatic Security at the \nState Department. The Chief Information Officers oversaw the work of \nthe information technology staffer who Secretary Clinton secretly paid \nto maintain her nonpublic server, yet all of these people knew nothing \nabout that nonpublic server. That staffer didn't ask permission to have \noutside employment. While working at the State Department, he didn't \ndisclose his outside income on his financial disclosure forms. Now, \nthink about that. Officials whose job it is to know were kept in the \ndark about this ``home brew'' email server. If a government agency \nhopes to be transparent with the American people--and that is the point \nbehind the Freedom of Information Act legislation--it must first be \ntransparent with itself.\n\n  Now we know that highly classified material was transmitted to and \nstored on Secretary Clinton's secret server. What is important about \nthat is this is an issue of national security.\n  State Department diplomatic security personnel have informed the \nJudiciary Committee that they were unaware of Secretary Clinton's using \na nongovernment server for official business. So how, then, could they \npossibly secure it from security threats?\n  Now, the FBI is investigating this matter as well as several other \ninvestigations. We keep hearing that the FBI's inquiry is just a \nsecurity review and not a criminal inquiry. So let me tackle that. \nHowever, one witness asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-\nincrimination rather than answer questions about his work on Secretary \nClinton's secret server. And he is relying on the Fifth Amendment to \nwithhold his personal emails as well. Recently, the Department of \nJustice granted him immunity. So, quite naturally, we are searching for \nother ways to get information before deciding whether it might be \nappropriate to seek an immunity order for his testimony.\n  Now, to Senator Reid: These are legitimate oversight inquiries for \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  Further, Secretary Clinton did not turn over all of her official \nemails. Emails between GEN David Petraeus and Secretary Clinton, which \nSecretary Clinton failed to provide to the State Department, were later \nturned over to the Defense Department. Secretary Clinton also failed to \nturn over emails with Sydney Blumenthal, whom Secretary Clinton views \nas an off-the-books intelligence resource, while Secretary of State.\n  If Secretary Clinton had used a government email address for official \nemails, we wouldn't have this problem in the first place.\n  So how many more official emails were not turned over but should have \nbeen? The Judiciary Committee cannot ignore these important issues \nsimply because the former Secretary decided to run for President. And \nto be perfectly clear, I started this investigation before Secretary \nClinton announced her candidacy.\n  Senator Reid suggested that the committee's work on these issues is a \nwaste of money. Senator Reid, that is nonsense. Congressional oversight \nis not a waste of money; it is a constitutional responsibility. The \nminority leader fails to understand that Congress is obligated to \noversee that the executive branch of government faithfully executes the \nlaws and faithfully spends the money the way Congress intended. Without \nsuch constitutional oversight, Congress will not know if there are \nfailures in the executive branch's duty to faithfully execute the laws \nthat we pass.\n  But do my colleagues know what is a real waste of money? This \nadministration fought tooth and nail in the courts against Congress for \nmore than 4 years. Why? Just to avoid disclosing documents in the Fast \nand Furious scandal that they eventually turned over. That is a waste \nof money--a 4-year waste of money.\n  The Obama administration has fought against the press and watchdog \norganizations for years in the Freedom of Information Act litigation \nover former Secretary Clinton's email records.\n  Senator Reid, that is a waste of money.\n  It is shocking that the Obama Justice Department devotes so much \ntaxpayer resources to avoiding the very transparency that President \nObama promised on January 21, 2009--1 day into office. This \nadministration was going to be the most transparent in the history of \nthe entire country, and it has turned out to be the most stonewalling. \nNone of that would be necessary if the administration would just comply \nwith congressional subpoenas and the Freedom of Information Act. That \nis the way to save money.\n  By the way, I would like to ask how much taxpayers' money does \nSenator Reid spend having his staff write daily speeches trying to \nundermine the work of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Senator Reid also fails to understand that we are not only focused on \nSecretary Clinton. The committee is conducting dozens of investigations \non a broad range of issues under the jurisdiction of the committee.\n  Some of the executive branch agencies have complained about the \namount of oversight work the committee does on other matters. To \njustify my statements for this part of my remarks, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record two letters. The first is from \nthe Department of Homeland Security, and the second is from the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                U.S. Department of\n\n\n                                            Homeland Security,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 18, 2015.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley: Since I became Secretary of \n     Homeland Secretary almost two years ago, I have worked to \n     make the Department more responsive to congressional \n     correspondence, directives, request for reports, briefings \n     and hearings, and other requests for documents and \n     information. Given that some 108 committees and subcommittees \n     of Congress (depending on how you count) assert oversight \n     jurisdiction over this Department, this is a full-time, time \n     consuming task. We have also participated in about 100 \n     hearings and over 2000 non-hearing engagements with \n     Congressional members and staff since the beginning of the \n     114th Congress. Members on both sides of the aisle have \n     acknowledged our increased responsiveness.\n       So far in 2015, I have received 46 letters from you alone--\n     almost one per week. I know because I read them all. Many of \n     these letters request reams of information, data, and \n     documents that take hundreds of hours and dozens of staff to \n     compile. We work diligently to respond to your letters \n     promptly, but there is a huge cost to this.\n\n[[Page S2375]]\n\n       Senator, I ask for your help in focusing and prioritizing \n     these oversight letters. I want to continue to be responsive \n     to your requests, and I want to do so as quickly as possible. \n     At the same time, I must ensure that my staff remains focused \n     on all our other priorities.\n       I welcome the opportunity to discuss with you.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jeh Charles Johnson.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 18, 2015.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This responds to your letters to the \n     Attorney General, dated June 12, 2015, July 10, 2015, August \n     13, 2015, September 14, 2015, and September 15, 2015, \n     regarding the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). \n     The Department of Justice (the Department) has provided \n     responses in our letters of August 14, 2015, August 25, 2015, \n     and September 11, 2015. As noted in those letters and \n     discussed with your staff, we continue to collect and review \n     information, including the information noted in your letters, \n     so we may provide a complete and thorough response to all of \n     your inquiries as expeditiously as possible. We will continue \n     to keep an open line of communication with your staff as we \n     work toward additional responses to your questions. The \n     Department takes these issues seriously, and we thank you for \n     bringing them to our attention.\n       As you know, this year the Department has received from \n     your office almost 100 letters containing more than 825 \n     questions and document requests, including the five letters \n     received to date on this matter. While we have made and will \n     continue to make all reasonable efforts to meet your stated \n     deadlines, our ability to respond in a timely manner to your \n     inquiries is impacted by the significant volume of letters we \n     receive.\n       We hope this information is helpful. Please do not hesitate \n     to contact this office if we may provide additional \n     assistance regarding this or any other matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Peter J. Kadzik,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, both of the letters note the many dozen \nletters and hundreds of requests that I have sent, and both essentially \ncomplain about the volume of our investigation and requests for \ninformation.\n  The Judiciary Committee is hard at work doing the people's business, \nand the committee is doing much more than just oversight. The committee \nhas reported 16 executive nominees and 37 judicial nominees. It has \nprocessed 27 bipartisan bills out of committee, and every bill that has \ncome out of committee is a bipartisan bill. Eighteen of those bills \nwere passed out of the Senate over to the House, eight of which have \nbeen signed into law by the President.\n  Just last week, the committee unanimously adopted bipartisan \nlegislation to finally protect FBI whistleblowers who report wrongdoing \nto their supervisors and provide for independent review of FBI \nwhistleblower cases for the first time.\n  So reviewing that record, it seems to me we can ask Senator Reid to \njustify his claim that this committee is partisan.\n  The committee concluded an investigation into the abuse and misuse of \npaid administrative leave. The committee took the results and worked \nhard with Members on both sides of the aisle to actually fix that \nproblem.\n  In February, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \napproved the bipartisan, commonsense reforms in the Administrative \nLeave Act of 2016. Similarly, the committee has worked with Democrats \nand Republicans alike to overturn an Office of Legal Counsel opinion \nthat allows the agencies across government to stonewall their \ninspectors general.\n  Now let me tell my colleagues how Senator Reid is involved in \nstonewalling that effort. We came up with a legislative solution called \nthe IG Empowerment Act and attempted to pass it in December by a live \nunanimous consent request. But Senator Reid objected to the bill even \nthough it is supported by seven Members of his own caucus and supported \nby the New York Times editorial board and a host of civil liberties and \ngood-government groups. Even the largest circulating daily newspaper in \nthe home State of Senator Reid urged him to work with us on a \ncompromise. But rather than engaging us in a productive and civil \nmanner, Senator Reid publicly slandered the bill as a legislative \noverreach. He claimed that he was concerned about a provision that \nallowed inspectors general to issue testimonial subpoenas to fight \nwaste, fraud, and abuse.\n  In fact, Senator Reid voted--Senator Reid actually voted--to give the \nexact same authority to the Office of Special Counsel in 1989. That \n1989 bill passed the Senate unanimously and is now law.\n  Senator Reid, was that legislative overreach when you did it?\n  Like that bill, the IG Empowerment Act has near unanimous support and \nis designed to root out wrongdoing from government, while ensuring \nproper safeguards of the use of subpoenas. So there is no reason to \nobject to this bill on policy grounds. Yet Senator Reid stands in the \nway of getting that done.\n  The Judiciary Committee will continue its work. I say that to just \none Senator: Senator Reid. And during the course of my oversight work, \nI will use every tool at my disposal to obtain answers for the American \npeople.\n  So, Senator Reid, I will keep faith with my oath of office and ``we \nthe people.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n  Oklahoma City Bombing Anniversary and Nomination of Merrick Garland\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, 21 years ago this week, the families of \n168 people--19 of those 168 people children--received some of the worst \nnews of their lives. That news was that a beloved member of each of \ntheir families had been killed in the bombing of the Federal building \nin Oklahoma City.\n  We all watched the news that day, that night, the next day, and that \nweek and beyond, as we took in the devastation caused by that blast. \nThat horrible crime was carried out by a radical, anti-government \nextremist. It remains the deadliest act of homegrown terrorism in our \nNation's history.\n  For the families who lost a loved one that day in 1995, there is no \nway to fill the void left by a life taken too soon, but I know that our \ngovernment's pursuit of justice for the lives lost that day serve as a \nsmall source of comfort for the people who were left in mourning.\n  At the time of that heinous crime, Judge Merrick Garland, President \nObama's nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, was the \nPrincipal Associate Deputy Attorney General at the U.S. Department of \nJustice. He immediately flew to Oklahoma City to lead the criminal \ninvestigation and supervise the prosecution of the bombers. In fact, he \ninsisted on being sent. He didn't just volunteer. He didn't just say: \nWell, OK, I will go. He told his supervisors they had to let him go. He \nwas the highest ranking Justice Department official on the ground in \nOklahoma City following the bombing. He helped oversee every aspect of \nthe investigation and the subsequent trial. His colleagues at the time \nhave attested to Judge Garland's commitment to following the letter of \nthe law in every aspect of that investigation. He refused to take any \nshortcuts that could somehow compromise the integrity of the case that \nhe and his team were building. Through their tireless efforts, his \ntireless leadership, his deep understanding of the law, and scrupulous \nattention to detail, Judge Garland ensured the prosecution had an \nairtight case.\n\n  Ultimately, both bombers were convicted, giving the families of the \n168 victims not their sons, their daughters, their children, their moms \nor dads back again, but at least providing a small measure of \nvindication for the losses they had incurred.\n  Judge Garland's work was so appreciated by the families and friends \nof those victims 21 years ago that last year, on the 20th anniversary \nof the bombing, the Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum awarded \nJudge Garland its annual Reflections of Hope distinction--not the year \nafter the bombing but 20 years after the bombing.\n  Judge Garland has established an unparalleled reputation as a \nbrilliant, dedicated prosecutor and jurist. He has received strong \nbipartisan support in the legal community, including from Alberto \nGonzales, the former U.S. Attorney General and White House Counsel in \nthe administration of President George W. Bush. So today it is not just \ndiscouraging that most of my Republican colleagues are refusing to \nconsider Judge Garland's nomination to serve on our highest Court; \npersonally, I believe it is outrageous.\n\n[[Page S2376]]\n\n  I served for 8 years as Governor of Delaware, a State that is \nrenowned for its own courts--supreme court, court of chancery, superior \ncourt--courts that play a national role, not just on a State level. As \nGovernor of my State for 8 years, I nominated men and women to serve on \nthose courts. In every one of those nominations there were hearings \nheld, whether they were Democrat or Republican. I think during that \nperiod of time I nominated an equal number of Democrats and Republicans \nto the judiciary. That is the constitution of our State, and, frankly, \nthat is a great example because in Delaware we have one of the highest \nregarded judiciaries.\n  My obligation as Governor was to nominate outstanding candidates for \nthese judgeships as they became vacant. The role of the State Senate in \nDelaware was to consider them. They never waited a year and left a seat \nvacant for a year awaiting the end of my time as Governor or any other \nGovernor's time. That would never happen. We wouldn't waste 10 months. \nState senators in our State wouldn't wait 10 weeks. They did their \njobs. They did their jobs.\n  We are not doing ours, and we need to. The fact that we haven't is \noutrageous. When we elect Presidents to this country, we elect them for \n4 years, and if they are reelected, then it is for another 4 years. \nThey are not Presidents for 3 years and 11 months; they are not elected \nto a term of 3 years and 10 months. We elect them to a term of 4 years. \nThey need to be on the job for 4 years.\n  Our President is doing what he is supposed to do, and that is sending \nus the names of exceptional people who serve in incredibly important \npositions like the Supreme Court. He has done his job.\n  I very much want to do mine, and I want to be joined by Democrats and \nRepublicans in doing our jobs. Every Member of this body has taken at \nleast one oath to uphold the Constitution--some of us, many times over.\n  At 17 years old, not much older than the young interns who are \nsitting here in the Chamber, I took my first oath as a midshipman. I \nwas a freshman at the Ohio State Navy ROTC, where I was privileged to \ngo on a Navy scholarship. Four years later, I took another oath and \nraised my right hand as an ensign in the Navy. I took an oath to defend \nthe Constitution and the country and headed to Pensacola, FL, to become \na naval flight officer right in the middle of the Vietnam war. I ended \nup serving three tours over there during that conflict.\n  As a Congressman, I took an oath to defend the country and \nConstitution. As Governor, I also took a similar oath to defend our \ncountry's Constitution--at least to defend our State's constitution. \nThen, as a U.S. Senator I have taken an oath any number of times.\n  I am regarded by my colleagues as one of the least partisan people \nhere, but I think the refusal of the majority to even consider this \nnomination is more than an abdication of our responsibility. I believe \nit is an example of playing politics with the very Constitution we have \nsworn to uphold.\n  For those who don't know, Delaware is known as the First State. We \nare known as the First State because on December 7, 1787, before any \nother State had ratified the Constitution, we did. I joke with people \nthat for 1 week Delaware was the entire United States of America. We \nopened things up and let in Maryland; we let in Pennsylvania and New \nJersey and eventually Louisiana--even Iowa. I think for the most part \nit has turned out pretty well, but the idea of playing politics with \nthe Constitution that we have sworn to uphold is deeply troubling to \nme. I hope that is not what is going on here, but I fear that it is.\n  The right and just way to proceed is to begin consideration of Judge \nGarland's nomination, not next month and not some other year, but now--\nfirst in committee and then on the Senate floor.\n  We have something we call the Delaware way. We are focused on the \nthree C's--communicate, compromise, and collaborate. That is a good \nexample for 49 other States, and I think it is a good example right \nhere. After all, we have been sent by the people to this hallowed \nplace, this Senate Chamber, to put democracy into action, to protect \nliberty and to protect justice for all.\n  Nearly 50 years ago, former Chief Justice Warren Burger, a \nconservative--I believe he was from California and was appointed or \nnominated by Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican. Former Chief Justice \nWarren Burger said, ``A sense of confidence in the courts is essential \nto maintain the fabric of ordered liberty for a free people.''\n  He went on to say that ``inefficiency and delay will drain even a \njust judgment of its value.'' I think the shorthand version of that is \njustice delayed is justice denied. Justice delayed is justice denied. \nBy dragging our feet and trying to get into a new Congress, maybe with \na new President--certainly, with a new President--that is delaying \njustice, I believe.\n  In the face of the prospect of any number of potentially 4-to-4 \ndivided verdicts in the Supreme Court with only eight members, we \ncannot just stand aside and let that happen.\n  Justice Burger was right when he said those words all those years \nago, and he is right today.\n  Mr. President, I think it is time to stop this delay. It is time for \nus to serve the people. It is time for us to deliver justice.\n  It is time for us to give this President's nominee the consideration \ndemanded of us by the Constitution, which we are sworn to uphold.\n  Mr. President, I see no colleague seeking recognition, and with that \nI yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Remembering Prince\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to \nspeak of the loss of the one of Minnesota's own, and that is Prince.\n  Like all Minnesotans, today we were shocked and saddened. I grew up \nwith Prince's music, starting with ``Little Red Corvette'' in the \nseventies and eighties. We won't forget ``Purple Rain'' in Minnesota. \nWe were so proud of that movie, and everyone would point at every spot \nin the movie they knew from growing up.\n  He was a superstar, composer, amazing performer, and a music \ninnovator with a fierce belief in the independence of his art. He lived \nhis art. He believed his words were his own, his name was his own, and \nhe wasn't going to let anyone own him. There was absolutely nobody like \nhim, and there never will be.\n  Prince sold more than 100 million records worldwide. He released 39 \nstudio albums. He had five No. 1 Billboard hits and 40 in the top 100. \nHe won seven Grammys, an Oscar, and a Golden Globe. He was inducted \ninto the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the first year he was \neligible.\n  But even with all that success, even with all that fame, Minnesota \nnever lost that sense that he was a beloved son--our neighbor, the \nsuperstar next door. I was always so proud to say: ``Prince--you know \nhe's from Minnesota.'' He was born there, and he still lives there.\n  The fact that Prince was a proud native of my State came through in \nall of his music. He pioneered the Minneapolis sound--that mixture of \nfunk, rock, and pop that emerged in the late 1970s and 1980s and \ninfluenced music for decades to come. Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Janet \nJackson, Bruno Mars, Mark Ronson, Justin Timberlake, The Weeknd, \nBeyonce--these are just some of the many artists who were influenced by \nthat sound.\n  But that sound didn't just influence artists, it influenced everyone \nwho heard it. Prince's music touched our hearts, opened our minds, and \nmade us want to dance. That is his legacy, and that is what we will \nalways remember.\n  Prince made ``Purple Rain'' a household name. Like most Minnesotans, \nI remember the first time I listened to that album. It was, as his band \nwas then called, a revolution. It changed music forever and is \nconsidered among the best in music history.\n  Two of the songs on that album--``When Doves Cry,'' which is \nespecially notable because he plays all of the instruments in the song, \nand ``Let's Go Crazy''--rose to the top of the charts.\n\n[[Page S2377]]\n\n``Let's Go Crazy'' includes a lesson important to remember on days like \ntoday. There is a world waiting for us after this life, Prince sang, \n``a world of never ending happiness, where you can always see the sun, \nday or night.'' I know that today all of us hope Prince is standing in \nthat Sun.\n  Prince sang that song at First Avenue--the venue in downtown \nMinneapolis--when he introduced his band to the city in 1983. There, \ntoo, Prince shot some of the scenes for his classic ``Purple Rain'' \nfilm. Today the club is a landmark and a must-play venue for some of \nthe best artists. I personally stood in Prince's dressing room \nsurrounded by pictures of him. The building is covered in stars with \nthe names of artists who have performed there, and there will always be \none star that will shine the brightest, and that is the man who made it \nthe landmark it is--Prince.\n  Minnesota loves Prince, and Prince loved Minnesota. He was born in \nMinneapolis. He went to Central High School, where he played piano and \nguitar for a band called Grand Central. He recorded his early demo \ntapes with Chris Moon and at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis.\n  Throughout his life, he called Minnesota home. He wrote a song about \nthe Minnesota Vikings--he was always a big fan--appropriately titled \n``Purple and Gold.''\n  At the end of last year when the Minnesota Lynx--our women's \nbasketball team--won the WNBA championship, he held a concert at his \nrecording studio, Paisley Park, for local fans, who got to enjoy his \nmusic well into the night. Just a few days ago, he hosted a dance party \nthere and made a brief appearance. In some way, it was his last gift to \nour State. But his best and lasting gift? His music, his innovation, \nhis energy.\n  When accepting BET's Lifetime Achievement Award, Prince said:\n\n       The future's in your hands now. And the world really is \n     yours.\n\n  Well, that world is a whole lot cooler because Prince was in it, and \nit is a whole lot sadder today now that he is gone.\n  My heart goes out to his friends and family and to all who mourn his \nloss today. We will miss the artist Prince.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Paris Climate Agreement\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am on the floor I guess just a few \nmoments ahead of the ranking member of our Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, my friend Ben Cardin, who is on his way but has authorized \nme to proceed with a few remarks on the topic that he and I, and \nperhaps others, would like to address, which is tomorrow's signing in \nNew York of the Paris climate agreement.\n  Over 160 nations around the world are going to be participating in \nsigning that agreement that will move many of them immediately into \ntheir program of compliance and signify for others a statement of \nintention to join. I think it is the largest international agreement, \nin terms of the number of countries involved, ever, certainly the \nbiggest one I can think of. So it is very significant in that respect.\n  One other thing about Paris that I think was also very significant is \nwhat took place in America's corporate sector in support of a strong \nParis Agreement. The President and groups like Ceres, with particular \nleadership from companies like Unilever, got together and created a \nremarkable American corporate coalition with more than 150 companies, \nincluding ones like Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, Ford and GM, \nNike, and VF industries, General Mills, Cargill, Apple, Google--a \nterrific coalition; kind of the who's who of corporate America. They \ngot together to urge the countries of the world to be bold in Paris, to \nhave it be a strong agreement, and to show their support for an \ninternational program to address climate change, which I think is \nterrific.\n  The distinguished junior Senator from Louisiana is presiding, and I \ncan't think off the top of my head what Louisiana-based companies are \npart of that coalition, but certainly companies that are based in \nvirtually every State we represent in the Senate--major companies: \nWalmart, for instance, out of Arkansas; Coca-Cola, out of Georgia; VF \nindustries, out of North Carolina; some of our biggest electric \nutilities; the bulk of the property casualty insurance and reinsurance \nindustry. It is very significant that America's corporate community \ncame so strongly together. I hope very much that is a message that not \nonly resonated in Paris but that will resonate in Congress as well \nbecause I would bet that every single one of us have a significant home \nState corporation that has signed that pledge, and some of us will have \nmany significant home State corporations that will have signed that \npledge.\n  So when you have gotten to the point where the leadership of \nAmerica's corporate community has signed on to the fact that something \nneeds to be done and that America ought to lead--that is our role in \nthe world--that will begin more and more to have an effect in this body \nto counter some of the nonsense and mischief that a very small slice in \nthe fossil fuel industry has been propagating at the expense of the \nbroader American corporate community, which, by and large, has been \npretty outstanding on this.\n  Let me also mention one other thing that has happened just this \nafternoon, which I am very encouraged by; that is, an amendment that \nhas been filed by 10 Senators--bipartisan, 5 and 5. It is the Graham-\nWhitehouse amendment. The cosponsors on the Republican side are \nSenators Graham, Kirk, Ayotte, Collins, and Portman. On the Democratic \nside, they are Whitehouse, Merkley, Schatz, Markey, and Brown.\n  The amendment reads: Climate change is real, and human activity \ncontributes to climate change. Climate change is already affecting the \nAmerican people and poses an increasing risk to our health, security, \neconomy, and infrastructure. Over 180 nations, including China, India, \nand Brazil, have made commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nthat contribute to climate change, creating opportunities for American \nworkers and innovative private industry benefits from global clean \nenergy markets. Therefore, it is the sense of the Senate that the \nUnited States should be a world leader in addressing climate change; \nthat Congress is best positioned to address policies that leave a \nprosperous economy and healthy environment for future generations; that \nCongress has a responsibility to take actions that reduce emissions and \ncombat climate change; and, finally, that Congress should support \nresearch and development to bolster clean energy technology.\n  In that latter regard, let me note the Mission Innovation Initiative \nthat has come out of Secretary Moniz's Department of Energy and out of \na significant group of major investors around the world. The deal \nbasically is that countries involved will try to double our clean \nenergy R, and in return these major investors from around the world, \nled by Bill Gates, will set up a significant fund that will take the \nemerging technologies that early R can discover and bring them \nthrough the various early investment stages of what investors and \nstartup folks call the valleys of death on the way to becoming a \nsustainable company so those technologies can be brought forward on an \naccelerated basis.\n  So when you look at Paris, you not only see this enormous array of \nnations coming together in a common cause, you see right behind it \nvirtually the entirety of the leadership of America's corporate sector \ncoming right in with it and saying: This is what we want. This is what \nwe encourage. We want it to be strong. You have the biggest investors \nin the world, most of them coming together and saying: We are going to \nhave your back with investment into new types of clean energy funding. \nAnd then you have the governments of the world not only signing up \nfor--not all of them but the ones participating in Mission Innovation--\nsigning up, in addition to the treaty, for this commitment to increase \nR and press innovation in this space forward.\n  So for all those reasons and more, tomorrow is a good news day for \nour country. It is a good news day for\n\n[[Page S2378]]\n\nprogress and innovation, it is a good news day for the enormous array \nof American corporate leaders who have supported and cheered on this \nparticular occasion, and I think it is an occasion for pride on the \npart of the United States of America that the signing will be taking \nplace in the United States in New York, that Secretary Kerry will be \nattending, that the Chinese leader will be attending, and that people \nfrom all around the world will be there not only recognizing the need \nto do this but recognizing America's leadership in getting us to this \nplace.\n  I will close with a personal note of appreciation for a gentleman \nnamed Todd Stern. Todd was the climate negotiator for the Department of \nState for many years, and some of those were rather bleak years in \nwhich the United States was not showing leadership. So Todd had to hang \nin there and endure that frustration and keep his candle of faith \nburning until the day came when we finally began to kick in at last. \nHis role was very important in getting us prepared for and through the \nParis Agreement. He is retiring and has served his country well. So I \nwill close with a word of good will for that particular public servant \nwho has done right by his duty and done right by his country.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and with any luck, we can await the \narrival of Senator Cardin in due course.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Remembering Prince\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks today regarding \nclimate change, I wish to say a few words about a Minnesota icon who \npassed away today.\n  Prince was a phenomenal artist who was beloved by people all over the \nworld, but as Minnesotans, we are particularly proud to call him one of \nour own.\n  Prince got his start in a Minneapolis jazz band and went on to share \nhis talent throughout Minnesota and all over the globe. His artistry, \nhis innovation, and his unparalleled presence inspired and will \ncontinue to inspire millions of people. In Minneapolis, he put one of \nour most cherished venues, First Avenue, on the map. Up until just a \nfew days ago, he was still performing, having held a concert in \nAtlanta. He is truly going to be missed.\n  Someone once said: A brain isn't a mind, and a mind isn't a soul, and \nthat is why we need the artists.\n  I think the outpouring of appreciation we are seeing today for Prince \nhas to do with that unique role artists play, and it speaks to the \nimportance of the arts and to human beings.\n\n\n                        Paris Climate Agreement\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in celebrating the \nofficial signing of the Paris climate agreement.\n  Tomorrow, more than 160 countries will send representatives to New \nYork to sign onto this historic agreement. This gathering is set to \nbecome the most well-attended signing event in the history of the \nUnited Nations--highlighting the importance of this issue for people \naround the entire world. I think it is very fitting that this event is \ntaking place on Earth Day.\n  This agreement has been nearly 25 years in the making. International \nclimate efforts date back to 1992, when governments met in Rio with the \nobjective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations. Nations have \nmet every year since then to further this goal. While some meetings \nhave been more successful than others, most have been met with \ndisappointment and lack of action. After all, climate change is a \ncomplex issue, and achieving consensus for any international issue is \nno small fete, which is why this agreement is truly, truly impressive.\n  Last December, I traveled to Paris with nine of my colleagues. We met \nwith United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, with U.S. Energy \nSecretary Ernest Moniz, and with our then top climate change negotiator \nTodd Stern. I would like to congratulate all of them for their stellar \nwork. I would also like to thank Todd Stern for his service at the \nState Department and his dedication to combating climate change. Mr. \nStern played a critical role in achieving a successful resolution in \nParis, and I have no doubt that his successor, Dr. Jonathan Pershing, \nwill effectively continue his work.\n  Climate change is an existential threat to our planet and to future \ngenerations. My colleagues have been on the floor of the Senate today \nto talk about the impacts of climate change on their States and the \nneed to address it. So I wish to take a minute to talk about how it is \ngoing to impact Minnesota.\n  Minnesota is one of the top producing agricultural States in the \ncountry, where one out of five jobs is tied to agriculture. Climate \nchange will have significant impact on our food system, both through \nwarmer temperatures and more intense droughts. A recent study estimates \nthat global crop production could decrease by more than 40 percent by \nthe end of the century. That is why I joined Dave MacLennan, the CEO of \nCargill--the largest privately owned company in the country--in penning \nan op-ed in the Minneapolis StarTribune to highlight this threat, \nespecially considering that the global population will reach 9 billion \nby midcentury. As the CEO of a company focused on agriculture, David is \nconcerned about what climate change is going to do to our food supply.\n  Climate change will also impact our waters. Minnesota is the Land of \n10,000 Lakes. Actually, it is about 14,000 lakes, including Lake \nSuperior, which contains about 10 percent of the world's fresh surface \nwater. Lake Superior has about 10 percent of the fresh surface water on \nEarth. Lake Superior is warming by 2 degrees per decade. We are seeing \nmore evaporation and lower water levels in the lake. Plus, rising \ntemperatures allow for more favorable conditions for invasive species \nand hazardous algal blooms. Warmer temperatures could also have severe \nconsequences to fish like walleye and trout, which are so important to \nMinnesota fisheries and to our ecosystems.\n  Let's not forget the threat of climate change to our forests. Like \nour lakes, warmer temperatures elevate the threat of invasive species--\ninvasive species such as the emerald ash borer and gypsy moth, which \nare rapidly changing the composition of our forests. In other parts of \nthe country, we are seeing longer wildfire seasons--wildfires that are \nburning hotter, more intense, and bigger. The Forest Service is \nspending more and more fighting these fires--now more than half of its \nentire budget.\n  So we can see that climate change poses a very serious threat to \nMinnesota, our country, and the world.\n  The Paris Agreement that we will sign tomorrow marks an important \nstep forward to address this threat. But, of course, our job is not \ndone. We have to remain vigilant and build upon the success of the \nagreement. Internationally, we have to hold other nations accountable, \nensure that they commit to stronger emission reduction targets over \ntime, and make sure that those reductions are transparent and \nverifiable. Domestically, we have to build on the success of our cities \nand States--like Minnesota--that have been working hard for a long time \nnow to become more energy efficient and reduce emissions.\n  I have two grandchildren, and I am expecting a third later this year. \nGod willing, they will live through this century and into the next. I \nwant them to know that when we had the opportunity to put the Earth on \na safer path, we seized the moment.\n\n  Let's recognize the historic nature of this year's Earth Day, and \nlet's celebrate this climate agreement because it is an important \nmilestone. Let's build on it to make the planet a safer and more \nhabitable place for our grandchildren, their children, and their \ngrandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend from Minnesota, \nSenator Franken, for his comments concerning an important day tomorrow. \nIt is important for many reasons. We have worked a long time to get the \nglobal community engaged on climate change.\n  As Senator Franken pointed out, tomorrow is Earth Day. It will be the\n\n[[Page S2379]]\n\n46th anniversary of Earth Day, which was started by our former \ncolleague Senator Gaylord Nelson. He did that because he recognized it \nis important for this country to recognize our global responsibilities \nto our environment and to our future.\n  There is no greater challenge that we face than climate change \nbecause climate change has been caused, in part, by our own activities \nhere on Earth, by the emission of greenhouse gases. We have a \nresponsibility to reverse the current trends. We can do that.\n  Tomorrow in New York City, many leaders will come to sign the COP21 \nagreement that was negotiated in Paris earlier this year by 16 nations \nrepresenting 98 percent of the global greenhouse emissions. This is a \nhistoric moment.\n  I want to reflect for a moment about the U.S. leadership that has \nbrought us to this moment in which we now have an agreement among so \nmany countries of the world. We have been trying to do this now for a \nlong time. We have not been successful. At last, the global community \nhas come together with meaningful commitments that will put us on the \nright path, and the U.S. leadership made this possible.\n  I want to congratulate President Obama for his leadership on this. I \nwas with Secretary Moniz in Paris. Ten members of the U.S. Senate went \nto Paris during the COP21 negotiations. We were there less than 48 \nhours, but I think we were able to broadcast the united support for \nU.S. leadership for a global commitment.\n  Secretary of Energy Moniz took us to the exhibit where we saw \nfirsthand U.S. technology that will help us meet the challenges of \nclimate change--how we can produce energy more efficiently and how we \ncan use energy more efficiently. It was U.S. technology, and that \ntechnology will be used around the world.\n  I mention that because U.S. global leadership is critically important \nto help save our planet from the adverse impacts of climate change, \nyes, but it also will help our economy. It will help our economy, \nobviously, in dealing with the effects of climate change but also in \nU.S. technology being used around the world, creating jobs here in the \nUnited States.\n  This is an urgent issue. If I might, let me first quote from Pope \nFrancis. He said:\n\n       The urgent challenge to protect our common home includes a \n     concern to bring the whole human family together to seek a \n     sustainable and integral development, for we know that things \n     can change. . . . I urgently appeal, for a new dialogue about \n     how we are shaping the future of our planet. We need a \n     conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental \n     challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and \n     affect us all. . . . Climate change is a global problem with \n     grave implications: environmental, social, economic, \n     political, and for the distribution of goods. It represents \n     one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day.\n\n  I couldn't agree with him more. This is a global challenge with \nglobal, grave consequences if we don't get it right.\n  I see that in my own State of Maryland's Smith Island, which is \ndisappearing into the Chesapeake Bay. I see it in the Chesapeake Bay \nwith the loss of sea grasses because of warmer water temperatures. Sea \ngrasses are critically important to the survival of the Maryland blue \ncrab. I see it in our coastal safety, as we see more and more storms \nwith more consequences.\n  Recently I traveled to the southern part of Africa, and I had a \nchance to see from a helicopter the impact of climate change. In the \nsouthern part of Africa, they have only two seasons: the rainy season \nand the dry season. They are now at about one season: the dry season. \nWe were there during the rainy season, and by helicopter we flew over \nland that should have been part of a pond. Instead, it was dry, no \nwater. We saw the carcasses of animals that couldn't survive because of \nthe drought.\n  Climate change is real and is affecting our planet. There are \nvulnerable nations--from the Marshall Islands to Bangladesh and so many \nothers--whose very existence is at risk because of climate change.\n  This is an urgent issue that requires an urgent response. But here we \ncan make a difference. We can make a difference through conserving and \nusing less energy and producing our energy in a more environmentally \nfriendly way in a carbon-free environment.\n  I am joined by Congressman Delaney and many Members of both the House \nand Senate in saying that the United States should make a commitment to \nproduce at least 50 percent of our electricity through a carbon-free \nsource by the year 2030. We can do that.\n  Here is the good news. It will not only be good for our environment, \nit will be good for our economy and good for our national security. \nRenewable energy sources can be produced here in America. You don't \nhave to depend on the fossil fuels from countries who disagree with our \nway of life. For the sake of our national security, for the sake of our \nnational economy, there are more jobs in clean energy than there are in \nfossil fuel industry.\n  For all those reasons--for our economy, for our security, and for our \nenvironment--U.S. leadership in dealing with these solutions can help \nAmerica's security. Yes, U.S. leadership is absolutely vital. We saw \nthat in COP21. Without U.S. leadership, it could not be done.\n  Here is where I really call upon our colleagues. I have said this \nmany times on the floor of the Senate. It is a great honor to serve in \nthe Senate; it is a great honor to represent the people of Maryland. \nEvery Congress has tried to add to its record to protect the future \ngenerations as it relates to our environment.\n  The protection of our environment has never been a partisan issue. I \nwould urge our colleagues to find ways that we can work together to \nbuild the legacy of this Congress to further protect our environment \nfor future generations. We should be part of the solution.\n  Tomorrow is Earth Day. Let's make a difference. With what we see \nhappening in New York and by our actions, let us protect future \ngenerations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Alexander, I ask \nunanimous consent that it be in order to call up the following first-\ndegree amendments: Merkley amendment No. 3812, Reid amendment No. 3805, \nand Flake amendment No. 3820; further, that at 11 a.m., on Tuesday, \nApril 26, the Senate vote on the amendments in the order listed and \nwith no second-degree amendments in order prior to the votes, and that \nthere be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Some may know that there is a section of the Washington \nPost called the Kids Post--a section of interesting stories written for \nkids in the Washington area. The writers ask area grade schoolers about \ntheir favorite books, tv shows, hobbies, and sports. Sometimes the kids \nare asked what they think is one of the biggest problems in the world. \nLast week, a fifth-grade class in Virginia was asked this question.\n  About half the class mentioned an environmental problem such as \nglobal warming. In other recent editions when this question was asked, \nclimate change is something these young people consistently worry \nabout. It only makes sense.\n  Failure to do anything about climate change today, when we still have \na chance, will leave future generations--our grandchildren and their \nchildren--with a changed world--and not for the better.\n  I know every time I look at my beautiful young grandchildren, I feel \na responsibility--a moral responsibility--\n\n[[Page S2380]]\n\nto address this problem for them and future generations. It makes me \nwonder why there are still so many here in this chamber and among the \nleading Republican Presidential candidates who deny climate change even \nexists, not to mention refuse to even do anything about it. How will \nfuture generations look back upon such denial and obstinance in the \nface of overwhelming evidence? Not kindly, I expect.\n  I know that science tells us that our human brains evolved to address \nmore immediate dangers, and slowly evolving dangers, especially ones \nthat may take decades or more to materialize, don't trigger the same \nsense of importance. But that is not the only thing at work here.\n  For decades, the fossil fuel industry and those in their pocket have \ntried to blur the debate--to blur the science--and create divisions \namong us instead of looking for what we have in common to solve this \nshared problem. Make no mistake. This is a deliberate campaign financed \nby the fossil fuel industry, a campaign that peddles the pseudo-science \nof manufactured doubt.\n  As we approach Earth Day, all you need to do is look at the daily \nnews to see the destructive impact of climate change. Scientists \nrecently gained an improved understanding of the complex climate \nscience of Antarctic ice, and they showed that, if carbon emissions \nwere to continue unabated over the next few decades, the oceans could \nrise as much as 3 or 4 feet by 2100. The situation would then grow far \nworse in the 22nd century and beyond, likely forcing people to abandon \nmany coastal cities. How can any member of the Senate ignore this \npotentially catastrophic and costly disaster?\n  Just the other week, scientists announced troubling evidence in the \nSouth Pacific that we are reaching a point where many coral reef \necosystems may not be able to adapt to the relentless progression of \nclimate change. Whole ecosystems that affect all of us and our food \nchain are being impacted.\n  And just recently, the New York Times reported that forest fires in \nparts of the United States, from Alaska to New Mexico, were no longer \njust happening in a single season, as was the case historically. They \nhave become year-around threats. New Mexico has had 140 such fires this \nyear alone, double the number over the same period last year. Such \nfires have arrived earlier each year, are happening in winters, and in \nsome cases burning all year along. The culprit for the drier conditions \nleading to these fires? Climate change.\n  Climate change also has significant national security implications, \nones we simply cannot ignore because they will impact our shores. The \ncrisis in Syria and the flow of refugees from unstable parts of the \nworld is an early warning of how humanitarian crises, particularly from \nless stable parts of our shared planet, are likely to get worse if we \ncontinue to let climate change go unaddressed. Back in 2011, when pro-\ndemocracy protests began in Syria, many of those joining were displaced \nfarmers, who had suffered their fourth year of drought made worse by \nthe effects of climate change. The National Academy of Sciences \npublished findings earlier this year showing that extreme drought in \nSyria between 2006 and 2009 was most likely due to climate change and \nthat the drought was a factor in the uprisings in 2011.\n  Just last week, Pulitzer Prize Winner New York Times columnist Tom \nFriedman wrote about massive migration out of parts of West Africa, \nthrough the Sahara Desert, to Libya hoping to eventually cross the \nMediterranean Sea into Europe. I ask unanimous consent that his April \n13, 2016, column ``Out of Africa'' be printed in the Record following \nmy remarks.\n  He writes, ``Just as Syria's revolution was set off in part by the \nworst four-year drought in the country's modern history--plus \noverpopulation, climate stresses and the Internet--the same is true of \nthis African migration wave.''\n  Friedman further explains that a United Nations official in the \nregion showed him three maps of Africa with an outline around dots \nclustered in the middle of the continent. The first map showed the most \nvulnerable regions of desertification, made worse by recent droughts, \nin Africa in 2008. The second map showed conflicts and food riots in \nAfrica during 2007 and 2008. And the third map showed terrorist attacks \nin Africa in 2012. All three outlines cover the same territory.\n  Anyone serving in the U.S. Senate or running for President who claims \nto be serious about national security simply isn't credible without \naddressing the long-term threats posed by weak states and climate \nchange in the decades to come.\n  And now, insurance companies are tuning in because they understand \nthe threat is real and that business assets are at stake. Lloyd's of \nLondon, the world's oldest and biggest insurance market, has recognized \nthe threat climate change represents to business assets, risks ranging \nfrom property damage to forced displacement to food insecurity. Lloyd's \nhas issued a call for the insurance industry to take into account the \neffects of climate change in their insurance modeling.\n  The London School of Economics studied the economic impacts of \nclimate change and put out a new report earlier this month. What they \nfound is that, on a global scale, climate change could cost the world \nas little as $2.5 trillion--or, within the range of possibilities, as \nmuch as $25 trillion.\n  This is not only a problem in the Arctic or Africa or in remote \ncorners of the world. This is a problem close to home for us, right \nhere and right now. In the past 6 years, Illinois has experienced \nhistoric storms, floods, and droughts that have caused millions of \ndollars in damage. The city of Chicago has been hit by four historic \nstorms in the last 7 years, meaning that the flooding of basements and \noverflowing of wastewater systems has become an annual event.\n  Because of climate change, U.S. growing seasons have shifted so \ndrastically that crops which previously could survive only in the \nsouthern half of the country can now be successfully grown in northern \nIllinois. If current global warming trends continue, climate models \nestimate that Illinois will have a climate similar to that of the Texas \nGulf coast by 2100. For Illinois farmers, these changes to the \nenvironment have a direct effect on their livelihood.\n  The need to act is urgent. We are reaching the tipping point. The \nscience is clear; the debate is settled. The destructiveness of climate \nchange is clear and growing. Climate change is a dire threat to the \nglobal economy and global stability. It will cause catastrophic \nconsequences for global health, food security, and habitats on land and \nin the ocean. If we don't act in time, there is no backup plan.\n  No one nation can do this alone. The good news is that, together, the \nnations of the world can act to avoid irreversible disaster. President \nObama, Secretary of State Kerry, and climate envoy Todd Stern have \nhelped lead the way. The Paris climate agreement is a historic step in \nthat direction. Never before have so many nations come together to \ntackle this threat. The draft Paris climate treaty was negotiated and \nadopted by consensus by 195 countries, unprecedented international \ncooperation in the face of the crisis.\n  I want to congratulate President Obama for his leadership in this \ncomplex but crucial task. He and his team lead the way for an \nambitious, balanced, and fair agreement. And I would like to thank Todd \nStern for his contributions, steadily working over several years to \nbuild up to the success of the Paris negotiations. I wish him and his \nfamily well as he retires from the climate envoy position.\n  Getting 195 countries to consent on the treaty is no small feat, and \nhe achieved all this in the face of so much opposition at home.\n  The agreement opens for signatures on April 22, Earth Day. The United \nStates and China made a joint announcement that we will be signing the \nagreement on that day, the earliest possible time. I encourage other \nnations to follow our lead.\n  Our generation has a moral obligation to leave the world in at least \nas good a shape as we inherited from our parents and grandparents. We \ncannot run away from our responsibility.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S2381]]\n\n\n  \n\n\n                            [Apr. 13, 2016]\n\n                             Out of Africa\n\n                        (By Thomas L. Friedman)\n\n       Agadez, Niger.--It's Monday and that means it's moving day \n     in Agadez, the northern Niger desert crossroad that is the \n     main launching pad for migrants out of West Africa. Fleeing \n     devastated agriculture, overpopulation and unemployment, \n     migrants from a dozen countries gather here in caravans every \n     Monday night and make a mad dash through the Sahara to Libya, \n     hoping to eventually hop across the Mediterranean to Europe.\n       This caravan's assembly is quite a scene to witness. \n     Although it is evening, it's still 105 degrees, and there is \n     little more than a crescent moon to illuminate the night. \n     Then, all of a sudden, the desert comes alive.\n       Using the WhatsApp messaging service on their cellphones, \n     the local smugglers, who are tied in with networks of \n     traffickers extending across West Africa, start coordinating \n     the surreptitious loading of migrants from safe houses and \n     basements across the city. They've been gathering all week \n     from Senegal, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Liberia, \n     Chad, Guinea, Cameroon, Mali and other towns in Niger.\n       With 15 to 20 men--no women--crammed together into the back \n     of each Toyota pickup, their arms and legs spilling over the \n     sides, the vehicles pop out of alleyways and follow scout \n     cars that have zoomed ahead to make sure there are no pesky \n     police officers or border guards lurking who have not been \n     paid off.\n       It's like watching a symphony, but you have no idea where \n     the conductor is. Eventually, they all converge at a \n     gathering point north of the city, forming a giant caravan of \n     100 to 200 vehicles--the strength in numbers needed to ward \n     off deserts bandits.\n       Poor Niger. Agadez, with its warrens of ornate mud-walled \n     buildings, is a remarkable Unesco World Heritage site, but \n     the city has been abandoned by tourists after attacks nearby \n     by Boko Haram and other jihadists. So, as one smuggler \n     explains to me, the cars and buses of the tourist industry \n     have now been repurposed into a migration industry. There are \n     now wildcat recruiters, linked to smugglers, all across West \n     Africa who appeal to the mothers of boys to put up the $400 \n     to $500 to send them to seek out jobs in Libya or Europe. Few \n     make it, but others keep coming.\n       I am standing at the Agadez highway control station \n     watching this parade. As the Toyotas whisk by me, kicking up \n     dust, they paint the desert road with stunning moonlit \n     silhouettes of young men, silently standing in the back of \n     each vehicle. The thought that their Promised Land is war-\n     ravaged Libya tells you how desperate are the conditions \n     they're leaving. Between 9,000 and 10,000 men make this \n     journey every month.\n       A few agree to talk--nervously. One group of very young men \n     from elsewhere in Niger tell me they're actually joining the \n     rush to pan for gold in Djado in the far north of Niger. More \n     typical are five young men who, in Senegalese-accented \n     French, tell a familiar tale: no work in the village, went to \n     the town, no work in the town, heading north.\n       What's crazy is that as you go north of here, closer to the \n     Libya border, to Dirkou, you run into streams of migrants \n     coming back from Libya, which they found ungoverned, abusive \n     and lacking in any kind of decent work. One of them, Mati \n     Almaniq, from Niger, tells me he had left his three wives and \n     17 children back in his village to search for work in Libya \n     or Europe and returned deeply disillusioned. In Libya, say \n     migrants, you can get beaten at any moment--or arbitrarily \n     arrested and have the police use your cellphone to call your \n     family in Niger and demand a ransom for your release.\n       Just as Syria's revolution was set off in part by the worst \n     four-year drought in the country's modern history--plus \n     overpopulation, climate stresses and the Internet--the same \n     is true of this African migration wave. That's why I'm here \n     filming an episode for the ``Years of Living Dangerously'' \n     series on climate change across the planet, which will appear \n     on National Geographic Channel next fall. I'm traveling with \n     Monique Barbut, who heads the U.N. Convention to Combat \n     Desertification, and Adamou Chaifou, Niger's minister of \n     environment.\n       Chaifou explains that West Africa has experienced two \n     decades of on-again-off-again drought. The dry periods prompt \n     desperate people to deforest hillsides for wood for cooking \n     or to sell, but they are now followed by increasingly violent \n     rains, which then easily wash away the topsoil barren of \n     trees. Meanwhile, the population explodes--mothers in Niger \n     average seven children--as parents continue to have lots of \n     kids for social security, and each year more fertile land \n     gets eaten by desertification. ``We now lose 100,000 hectares \n     of arable land every year to desertification,'' says Chaifou. \n     ``And we lose between 60,000 and 80,000 hectares of forest \n     every year.''\n       As long as anyone could remember, he says, the rainy season \n     ``started in June and lasted until October. Now we get more \n     big rains in April, and you need to plant right after it \n     rains.'' But then it becomes dry again for a month or two, \n     and then the rains come back, much more intense than before, \n     and cause floods that wash away the crops, ``and that is a \n     consequence of climate change''--caused, he adds, primarily \n     by emissions from the industrial North, not from Niger or its \n     neighbors.\n       Says the U.N.'s Barbut, ``Desertification acts as the \n     trigger, and climate change acts as an amplifier of the \n     political challenges we are witnessing today: economic \n     migrants, interethnic conflicts and extremism.'' She shows me \n     three maps of Africa with an oblong outline around a bunch of \n     dots clustered in the middle of the continent. Map No. 1: the \n     most vulnerable regions of desertification in Africa in 2008. \n     Map No. 2: conflicts and food riots in Africa 2007-2008. Map \n     No. 3: terrorist attacks in Africa in 2012.\n       All three outlines cover the same territory.\n       The European Union recently struck a deal with Turkey to \n     vastly increase E.U. aid to Ankara for dealing with refugees \n     and migrants who have reached Turkey, in return for Turkey \n     restricting their flow into Europe.\n       ``If we would invest a fraction of that amount helping \n     African nations combat deforestation, improve health and \n     education and sustain small-scale farming, which is the \n     livelihood of 80 percent of the people in Africa, so people \n     here could stay on the land,'' says Barbut, ``it would be so \n     much better for them and for the planet.''\n       Everyone wants to build walls these days, she notes, but \n     the wall we need most is a ``green wall'' of reforestation \n     that would hold back the desert and stretch from Mali in the \n     west to Ethiopia in the east. ``It's an idea that the \n     Africans themselves have come up with,'' she adds. It makes \n     enormous sense.\n       Because, in the end, no wall will hold back this surging \n     migrant tide. Everything you see here screams that unless a \n     way can be found to stabilize Africa's small-scale \n     agriculture, one way or another they will try to get to \n     Europe. Some who can't will surely gravitate toward any \n     extremist group that pays them.

Mr. President, I want to applaud Senators Murkowski and \nCantwell, the chair and ranking member of the Energy Committee, for \ntheir leadership and tenacity in passing yesterday's bipartisan Energy \nbill on the floor. This kind of bipartisanship has always been the \npolitical fuel that has driven some of our most important energy \nlegislation. I thank them for their commitment to working together in a \nbipartisan fashion to pass this bill, and I look forward to working \nwith them and all of my colleagues going forward to capture all of the \npotential for America's clean energy future.\n  There are many good provisions in this bill. The bill promotes energy \nefficiency in our buildings and appliances. It will help to modernize \nour electrical grid and support energy storage technologies. It \npermanently reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  The bill includes a number of provisions and amendments that I \nauthored that were accepted on the floor.\n  I was pleased that my bipartisan legislation with Senators Inhofe, \nRounds, and Booker to reauthorize EPA's brownfields program through \n2018 was included in the Energy bill. This legislation will help clean \nup the decades of abuse our lands have experienced at the hands of \ncorporate polluters. It will help to create jobs and spur economic \nactivity in Massachusetts and around the country, while revitalizing \nunderutilized and polluted lands.\n  In December, Congress voted to lift the 40-year old restrictions on \nexporting U.S. oil overseas. During that debate, I and other Senators \nraised concerns regarding the impacts that exporting American oil \nabroad could have on U.S. consumers and refined fuel prices, \nindependent refineries, and other sectors of the U.S. economy such as \nshipbuilding. However, the final legislation did not even include any \nrequirement for analyzing and reporting on any potential impacts that \nexports could have on these industries or on U.S. consumers. Therefore, \nI offered an amendment, which the Senate adopted, that would require \nthe Government Accountability Office, GAO to review and report back \nannually for 3 years on the impacts of crude oil exports on U.S. \nconsumers, independent refineries, shipbuilders, and energy production.\n\n[[Page S2382]]\n\n  Exporting American crude oil could be a disaster for independent \nrefineries in regions such as the east coast. Upwards of 55 percent of \nour refining capacity on the east coast could potentially close as a \nresult of oil exports. The Energy Department has said that exports \ncould lead to as much as $9 billion less investment and 1.6 million \nbarrels less refining capacity in 10 years. It could lead to up to $200 \nbillion less revenue for the U.S. refining sector over the next decade. \nIt could raise prices for consumers who are currently saving $700 a \nyear at the pump and $500 on heating oil this winter because of low oil \nprices. And it could harm U.S. shipbuilders. We have been having a \nshipbuilding renaissance in this country. We are currently seeing the \nbiggest shipbuilding boom in 20 years. But exports could stop all of \nthis in its tracks.\n  We should know how exporting American oil is affecting American \nconsumers. We should know how it is affecting key sectors of our \neconomy such as refining and shipbuilding. And we should know how it is \naffecting energy production in the United States. That is what my \namendment would help us do, and I am pleased that it was adopted into \nthe bill.\n  The bill also includes a bipartisan amendment that I authored with \nSenator Cassidy to improve the way that we are going to be selling oil \nunder a law passed last year to better protect taxpayers.\n  Our Nation's oil stockpile is supposed to be there to protect \nAmerican consumers and our security in the event of an emergency. We \nshouldn't use it as a piggybank to fund other priorities. But that is \nprecisely what we did in two bills passed last year.\n  But if we are going to sell oil from our strategic stockpile, we \nshould do so strategically to get the best deal for taxpayers and drive \ndown prices for consumers. That is what the Cassidy-Markey amendment \nwould help us do.\n  For the sales of SPR oil required by the Budget Act that became law \nlast year, the Cassidy-Markey amendment would give the Secretary of \nEnergy more flexibility to sell oil when prices are high. This fix \nshould allow us to sell fewer overall barrels from the SPR and get a \nbetter return on these sales for American taxpayers. I am pleased that \nthe Senate voted to adopt this commonsense amendment.\n  However, there are a number of provisions in the bill with which I \nhave concerns. The bill would apply a 45-day shot-clock to the \nDepartment of Energy's review of liquefied natural gas export \napplications. There is no problem with the Energy Department delaying \nits review of LNG export applications. If there is any problem, it is \nthat the Energy Department is moving too fast to approve these exports \nof American natural gas overseas.\n  Exporting less than half of the volumes of natural gas that the \nDepartment has already approved for export could drive prices up by \nmore than 50 percent for American consumers and businesses. This would \nbe a disaster for consumers in many regions of the country, such as the \nNortheast. It would be a disaster for domestic manufacturing, where low \nU.S. prices give us a competitive advantage with the rest of the world. \nI have urged the Department to take a time-out from approving new LNG \nexports until we more fully understand how the volumes we have already \napproved will affect various regions of our country and our energy \nsecurity. That is what we should be doing, not artificially truncating \nthe review process.\n  I am similarly concerned that a provision about forest bioenergy \nwould interfere with the EPA's scientific review process of the carbon \npollution implications of biomass electricity and potentially \ninterfere--with EPA's statutory responsibilities. The provision directs \nFederal policies to ``reflect the carbon neutrality of forest \nbioenergy.'' But not all biomass energy is created equal. The timeframe \nfor any climate benefits from biomass energy can vary. In many \ninstances that timeframe can be very long--on the order of 50 to 100 \nyears. Some practices, like clearcutting forests and burning whole \ntrees for energy should never be considered carbon neutral. That is why \nit is critical to incorporate what science tells us about forests and \ntheir interaction with the global carbon cycle into policies governing \nbiomass energy. Biomass energy is already contributing to the U.S. \nenergy mix in ways that help reduce carbon pollution that causes global \nwarming. I look forward to working with my colleagues as this bill \nmoves through conference to ensure that the United States has a smart, \nsustainable, and scientifically-backed policy for biomass energy.\n  The bill also contains provisions regarding hydropower relicensing. I \nappreciate the willingness of Senators Murkowski and Cantwell to engage \nwith stakeholders on hydropower relicensing and that they have crafted \nlanguage that is a vast improvement compared to the House version.\n  It took me much of 1985 and 1986 to reach consensus on the bipartisan \nElectric Consumers Protection Act of 1986 that for the first time \nrequired FERC to give equal consideration to the environment, fish and \nwildlife, and other nonpower values as it gives to power and \ndevelopment objectives in making licensing decisions. I know how \nchallenging it can be to find solutions that all stakeholders can \nsupport. But these hydropower licenses are good for decades, and we \nneed to make sure that FERC's decisions are informed by the best, most \nup-to-date information, especially in the face of changing rainfall \npatterns driven by global warming. So I am concerned that this \nprovision in the Energy bill could limit the ability of Federal \nagencies to require companies to undertake new analyses on the impacts \nof their dams by emphasizing the use of existing studies and data.\n  I am also concerned that the provision could require agencies to \nevaluate the impact of their recommendations on issues beyond their \ncore abilities. Rather than speeding up the relicensing process, this \ncould slow it down. Rather than saving taxpayers money, it could \nrequire more financial resources for Federal agencies.\n  Finally, I am concerned about what is not in this bill. The tax \nbreaks for the oil, gas, and coal industries are permanent pieces of \nthe TAX CODE that never expire. Meanwhile, tax breaks for wind power \nwill begin phasing down in 8 months and be gone by the end of 2019. The \ntax breaks for solar will expire in 2021. That schedule would be a \ndisaster for offshore wind in particular, which has the potential to \ncreate tens of thousands of jobs in Massachusetts and up and down the \neast coast. In fact, the Department of Energy has found that that there \nwould be no offshore wind projects that would be able to qualify for \nthese tax credits before they expire. That is just wrong. We need to \nput clean energy technologies on equal footing with mature fossil fuel \nindustries, whose tax breaks date as far back as 100 years.\n  Senators Cantwell and Wyden put forward a Democratic energy bill \nwhich I was pleased to be an original cosponsor of, which would repeal \nthese fossil fuel tax breaks and invest in clean energy. It would \ncreate a goal for reducing our emission of carbon pollution. And it \nwould create an energy efficiency standard such as I have proposed. \nThese are some of the measures that we should be considering to truly \nallow us to be a leader in developing clean energy technologies and \njobs here in the United States.\n  As we work with the House on this Energy bill, we need to build on \nthe bipartisan efforts that have been done in this bill and ensure that \nthe Senate continues to reject the damaging and highly partisan \nprovisions that the House has included in its bill. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure a final \nEnergy bill that improves America's economy and environment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/21/senate-section/article/S2382-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2382-S2383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my hometown \nof Scranton, PA, as it celebrates its 150th anniversary, or \nsesquicentennial.\n  Ever since William Penn invited carpenters, masons, weavers, and \nother skilled workers to settle in Pennsylvania, the story of our \nCommonwealth, and in particular northeastern Pennsylvania, has been the \nstory of working people.\n  At the dawn of the 19th century, what would become known as the city \nof Scranton became a home to new immigrants who fought desperately to \nescape the horrors of religious persecution, famine, and poverty in \nEurope and dreamed of a better life. Many of\n\n[[Page S2383]]\n\nthe new settlers worked in the darkness and danger of the anthracite \ncoal mines in order to provide for their families. My grandfather, \nAlphonsus Casey, at the age of 11, was one of those workers. He was a \n``mule boy'' who was once kicked in the face by a mule, sustaining a \ndeep cut from his forehead, across his face. As my father would recall \nyears later, ``There were no benefits--no worker's compensation, no \nsafety net in place to take care of the adult worker, much less an \ninjured child.''\n  A 2002 book, ``A History of the Commonwealth,'' described the lives \nof our region's coal miners as ones of ``danger and economic \nuncertainty.'' The great novelist Stephen Crane recounted a visit to \none mine in the region by describing an ``extraordinary, black puzzle'' \nin which the ``shouts of mule-boys'' were sometimes the only sounds.\n  The work ethic of those who descended into the depth and darkness of \nthose mines shaped Scranton and impacts the city all these years later. \nAs the coal jobs were lost, the city and the region went through a \npainful transition that left scars on our land and our people. What has \nundergirded the city of Scranton's resilience over all these years has \nbeen a heritage of hard work and sacrifice and an enduring belief in \nthe promise of tomorrow.\n  Today Scranton's economy has been transformed by so-called ``meds and \neds.'' The city is home to some of our State's top universities and \nmedical facilities. It is a community of entrepreneurs and is being \nshaped by a new generation of immigrants seeking the same better life \nas Scrantonians of an earlier era.\n  Driving the city's education sector are the five colleges and \nuniversities that are preparing thousands of students for careers in \nthe 21st-century economy--advanced manufacturing, technology, and \nenergy. The Commonwealth Medical College, which is the first M.D.-\ngranting medical school built in Pennsylvania since 1962, is providing \nstate-of-the-art medical education to medical students from across the \nglobe. In addition, Commonwealth Health and Geisinger have entered the \nmedical market in Lackawanna County and are investing over $300 million \nin innovative technology and improved medical care.\n  For the last 150 years, Scranton's story has been part of the fabric \nof our Nation. As the city looks forward to the next 150 years, it is \nuniquely positioned to create its own future.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the city of Scranton \non its 150th anniversary and highlight the rich and industrious \nheritage that has continued to drive the Electric City well into the \n21st century.\n  The story of Scranton is unique and yet distinctly American. The \ncity's visionary founders, brothers George and Selden Scranton, arrived \nin the Lackawanna Valley in the early 1840s and, after early failures, \nbecame the first Americans to produce iron rails on a mass scale. \nRailroads expanded dramatically throughout the United States once these \ncrucial components became available, and Scranton became a hub of \ncommerce, manufacturing, and transportation. By the 1860s, the Scranton \nfamily's company had grown into the second largest iron-manufacturing \ncenter in America, employing thousands of people. With 35,000 residents \nat the time, Scranton was officially incorporated as a city on April \n23, 1866, and would become the county seat for the newly formed \nLackawanna County in 1878.\n  The success of Scranton's coal, iron, and steel industries served as \na catalyst for other important enterprises in the region. Large-scale \ntextile, printing, and food-processing operations, together with \nincreased educational opportunities, all played a vital role in the \nregion's growth. Between 1860 and 1910, Scranton's flourishing \nindustrial activity drew thousands of new immigrants.\n  The story of the Scranton family's endeavor, now known as the \nLackawanna Steel Company, is one of the greatest success stories of \nAmerican manufacturing. Through perseverance and dedication, Scranton \ngrew from a small, agrarian village to a thriving, multicultural city.\n  Today Scranton is a leader in higher education, medicine, and \nmanufacturing. Driving Scranton's development are five institutions of \nhigher education preparing thousands of students for a 21st century \neconomy. For example, the Commonwealth Medical College provides state-\nof-the art medical education to students from across the globe, and \ncompanies in Lackawanna County have made significant investments in \ninnovative technology and improved medical care. Scranton is well-\npositioned to be a beacon for entrepreneurs and businesses looking to \ntake advantage of the high-quality workforce that Scranton's colleges \nand technical schools are producing.\n  Today I wish to recognize the profound contributions that the city of \nScranton and its residents have made to the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania over the last 150 years. I wish them all the best as the \npeople of Scranton celebrate the city's sesquicentennial anniversary on \nApril 23, 2016.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/21/senate-section/article/S2383-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2383-S2384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CIVIL AIR PATROL\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Civil Air \nPatrol as it celebrates its 75th anniversary this year. The Civil Air \nPatrol has been a tremendous contributor in our great State, and I am \nhonored to recognize and congratulate it on this important milestone.\n  The Civil Air Patrol was founded on December 1, 1941, the week before \nthe Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, by a group of brave civilians \ninterested in donating both their aviation skills and free time to \nprotecting the Nation's coastlines during World War II, in addition to \ncontributing to other civil defense missions. During this time, pilots \nvolunteering with the Civil Air Patrol flew more than 500,000 hours and \nhelped in a variety of ways, including patrolling the coastline for \nsubmarine activity, monitoring our forests and southern borders, and \nsearching for ships and personnel in distress.\n  On July 1, 1946, the Civil Air Patrol was established as a federally \nchartered nonprofit corporation by President Harry Truman. Following \nthis, on May 26, 1948, Congress passed a law, designating the Civil Air \nPatrol as the Air Force Auxiliary and establishing primary missions for \nthe Civil Air Patrol. The legislation established that the Civil Air \nPatrol would focus on emergency services, cadet programs, and aerospace \neducation. Today this important organization is a national community \nservice group with 31,000 professionally trained civilian volunteers \nand serves as a partner to the U.S. Air Force as a member of its total \nforce. The Civil Air Patrol serves to assist Federal, State, and local \ngovernments and offers assistance for homeland security missions, \ncounterdrug efforts, search and rescue missions, and disaster relief.\n  The Nevada Wing Civil Air Patrol upholds these values, maintaining \nstrong search and rescue programs, cadet programs, and aerospace \neducation, and has a far-reaching positive impact on both urban and \nrural communities throughout the Silver State. The many volunteers \ncontributing to the Nevada Wing have helped at a variety of events, \ndepartments, and facilities across the State, including the State \nVeterans Home, the Boulder City and Fernley Veterans Cemeteries, \nOperation Home Front, Blue Star Widows, Nevada Department of Emergency \nManagement Search and Rescue Board, and many more.\n  In addition, the Nevada Wing has strengthened its relationship with \nthe Nevada Department of Emergency Management and has reinforced its \nincident management action team, triggering a quicker and more thorough \nresponse to support calls from across the Nation. This incredible \nwing's contributions to both adults and children across the State are \ninvaluable. I extend my deepest gratitude to the many men and women who \nvolunteer for the Nevada wing for their genuine concern and services in \nhelping others. The legacy they have built for the Nevada Wing will \nlive on for generations to come.\n  For three-quarters of a century, the Civil Air Patrol has proven its \nunwavering dedication to our State and to our country. The hard work of \nthose that have served both nationally at the Civil Air Patrol and \nwithin the Nevada Wing has not gone unnoticed. These courageous men and \nwomen stand as role models in their pursuits to help others in states \nof emergency and in\n\n[[Page S2384]]\n\neveryday events. I ask Nevadans across the Silver State and my \ncolleagues to join me in honoring the Civil Air Patrol on its 75th \nanniversary and in thanking the Civil Air Patrol for its commendable \nmissions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/21/senate-section/article/S2384-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RUTHERFORD B. HAYES PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY & \n                                MUSEUMS\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the 100th \nanniversary of the Hayes Presidential Library & Museums in Fremont, OH. \nOn May 30, 1916, COL Webb Hayes, son of President Rutherford B. Hayes, \nmade his father's papers and artifacts available to the public for \nresearch with the opening of a library and museum on his parents' \nestate, Spiegel Grove. It was the first in what is now a Federal \npresidential library system.\n  Spiegel Grove is unique in that the former President's home, tomb, \nmuseum, and library are all on the same site, which sits on 25 acres \nsurrounded by six sets of gates originally located at the White House. \nThe site has continued to grow and change since its opening. In 2012, a \n$1.5 million restoration of the Hayes Home was completed. Major \nadditions to the museum in 1922 and 1968 brought the building to its \npresent configuration comprising of 52,640 square feet. In January \n2016, the museum temporarily closed to the public to undergo a $1.6 \nmillion renovation, which will premiere Memorial Day weekend 2016.\n  It is the mission of the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Library & \nMuseums ``to enrich lives through the historical preservation of \nSpiegel Grove and to provide a greater understanding of President Hayes \nand his contributions to the State of Ohio, the country, and his fellow \nAmericans.'' In keeping with that mission, the organization uses its \nresources, including 21,000 artifacts, 80,000 books, and 6,000 linear \nfeet of manuscript collections, to illustrate the life and times of \nRutherford B. Hayes, his family, and his Presidency.\n  We are honored to have this American treasure located in the State of \nOhio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/21/senate-section/article/S2384-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2384-S2385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO FUTURE MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor 461 high school \nseniors in eight northeast Ohio counties for their commendable decision \nto enlist in the U.S. Armed Forces. Of these 461 seniors from 127 high \nschools in 94 towns and cities, 141 will enter the Army, 126 will enter \nthe Marine Corps, 61 will enter the Navy, 25 will enter the Air Force, \n1 will enter the Coast Guard, 103 will enter our Ohio Army National \nGuard, and 4 will enter the Ohio Air National Guard. In the presence of \ntheir parents/guardians, high school counselors, military leaders, and \ncity and business leaders, all 461 will be recognized on May 4, 2016, \nby Our Community Salutes of northeast Ohio.\n  In a few short weeks, these young men and women will join with many \nof their classmates in celebration of their high school graduation. At \na time when many of their peers are looking forward to pursuing \nvocational training or college degrees or are uncertain about their \nfuture, these young men and women instead have chosen to dedicate \nthemselves to military service in defense of our rights, our freedoms, \nand our country. They should know that they have full support of this \nSenate Chamber and the American people, who are with them in whatever \nchallenges may lie ahead.\n  These 461 young men and women are the cornerstone of our liberties. \nIt is thanks to their dedication and the dedication of an untold number \nof patriots just like them that we are able to meet here today in the \nU.S. Senate and openly debate the best solutions to the many diverse \nproblems that confront our country. It is thanks to their sacrifices \nthat the United States of America remains a beacon of hope and freedom \nin a dangerous world. We are grateful to them, and we are grateful to \ntheir parents and their communities for instilling in them not only the \nmental and physical abilities our Armed Forces require but, more \nimportantly, the character, the values, and the discipline that leads \nsomeone to put service to our Nation over self.\n  I would like to personally thank these 461 graduating seniors for \ntheir selflessness and the courage that they have shown by volunteering \nto risk their lives in defense of our Nation. We owe them, along with \nall those who serve our country, a deep debt of gratitude.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the names of \nthe 461 high school seniors.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                        UNITED STATES ARMY--141\n\n       Achterhof--Medina;

It is this philosophy that serves as the \ncornerstone for the cycling team's three straight--2013, 2014, 2015--\nUSA Cycling Club of the Year awards, which evaluates not only on-bike \nperformance, but team GPA, retention, postgraduation success, and \ncommunity engagement.

Mr. President, I am proud to recognize and \ncongratulate the University of North Dakota, UND, men's hockey team for \nwinning the 2016 National Collegiate Athletic Association, NCAA, Frozen \nFour Division I Men's Hockey National Championship. I was proud to join \nmy colleague from North Dakota, Senator John Hoeven, in sponsoring an \nadopted resolution honoring the hard work of the men's hockey team and \ncommending UND students, fans, and alumni for their tremendous support \nthroughout the 2015-16 season.\n  On April 9, 2016, the UND men's hockey team won the men's hockey \nnational championship game held in Tampa, FL, defeating the Quinnipiac \nUniversity Bobcats of Connecticut by a score of 5-to-1. The hockey \nteam, under the leadership of athletic director Brian Faison and Coach \nBrad Berry, had an incredible season with a record of 34-6-4, which \nculminated in UND winning its eighth Division I men's hockey national \nchampionship.\n  Coach Berry also became the first head coach to win a Division I \nmen's hockey national championship in a head coach's inaugural season. \nCoach Berry and his staff have instilled character and perseverance in \nthe UND players and have done an outstanding job with the UND hockey \nprogram. Under the university's leadership, UND has worked to support \nand further both academic and athletic excellence, so students have the \nopportunity to excel in the classroom as well as in sports.\n  I am excited that thousands of UND fans attended the championship \ngame to support the Fighting Hawks, reflecting the tremendous fan base \nof the University of North Dakota and highlighting the spirit and \ndedication of UND hockey fans. The enthusiasm and steadfast support of \nthe fans has helped propel the team's success. Year after year, the UND \nmen's hockey team has provided the Nation a glimpse of North Dakota \nvalues: playing honestly with heart, determination, and sportsmanship. \nThis year, Coach Berry and his team of hard-working young men \nstrengthened UND's proud legacy of dedication and respect for the game.\n  The 2016 NCAA Frozen Four Division I Men's Hockey National \nChampionship was a victory not only for the UND men's hockey team, but \nfor the entire State of North Dakota. As UND looks to the future, I \nlook forward to seeing the Fighting Hawks hockey program build on this \nmoment of excellence to strengthen the school's already proud legacy. \nCongratulations again to all involved who made this national \nchampionship possible, and thank you for your hard work and service to \nthe University of North Dakota and our great State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/21/senate-section/article/S2386-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2386-S2387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DR. RON ARYEL\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Dr. Ron \nAryel, pediatrician, biosurveillance expert, and founder of Reno Center \nfor Child and Adolescent Health. The advanced health care this facility \nprovides to our citizens is invaluable to northern Nevada, bringing an \nimproved quality of life to children who are disabled or chronically \nill and, in turn, the lives of their parents as well.\n  Dr. Aryel founded Reno Center for Child and Adolescent Health in \nJanuary of 2010. Prior to that, he served as a pediatrician and \ndisaster response officer for the Public Health Service, treating \npatients in a variety of settings, including private offices, emergency \nrooms, psychiatric treatment centers, homes, field hospitals, and at \nthe rear of utility vehicles in national emergency situations. During \nthe 1999 North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit, he served on a team \nthat included a disaster response unit and the U.S. Marine Corps \nChemical Biological Incidence Response Force Unit, protecting the U.S. \nPresident from radiological chemical and biological threats. In \naddition, he has volunteered as a clinical supervisor at the University \nof Nevada, Reno Student Outreach Clinic and served on the board of \ndirectors for Project Restart in Reno.\n  Dr. Aryel has received a number of accolades, including the 2008 Good \nNeighbor Award from Kansas City, MO, Reno Center for Child and \nAdolescent Health and was also recognized with a Silver Syringe Award \nfor its significantly high vaccination rates. Dr. Aryel's unwavering \ndedication to bringing first-class medical care to\n\n[[Page S2387]]\n\nthose around him goes without question. I am grateful to have him \nworking to help those in need in the Silver State, and I extend my \ndeepest gratitude for all he has done to help Nevada's youth.\n  Reno Center for Child and Adolescent Health offers preventive and \nmedical care to infants, children, adolescents, and young adults who \nrequire attention for serious or life-threatening illnesses and \ndisabilities, as well as those requiring complex health care \nmanagement. The facility is truly one of a kind in that it welcomes all \nchildren, including those with extremely difficult medical cases, and \nhas the highest quantity of chronically and seriously ill children and \nadolescents in northern Nevada. Those leading the way at the center, \nincluding Dr. Aryel, are truly role models, demonstrating a genuine \nconcern in improving the health and well-being of Nevada's future \ngenerations. Our State is fortunate to have a facility like this \navailable to those in need.\n  I am both humbled and honored to acknowledge Dr. Aryel for his \noutstanding work, especially for what he has done for families \nthroughout northern Nevada, and I wish him the best of luck in all of \nhis future endeavors. Today I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to \njoin me in recognizing an upstanding Nevadan, Dr. Ron Aryel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/21/senate-section/article/S2387-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING DELTA CONTRACT INTERIORS\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, in recent weeks our State has faced \ndisastrous storms and flooding, but with true Louisiana strength, \nfamilies and communities are already banding together for the recovery. \nIn that spirit, I would like to recognize Delta Contract Interiors as \nSmall Business of the Week, whose community has rallied together to \nrespond to and recover from the recent storms.\n  In 1976, John and Martha Peters founded Delta Contract Interiors in \ntheir hometown of Homer in northwest Louisiana with the goal of \nproviding quality interior design services and unique gifts to clients \nin their community. Offering additional services in custom drapery and \ndesign in their factory in Homer, they produce draperies, hospital \ncurtains, blinds, and other items for hotels and hospitals nationwide, \nfrom Massachusetts to Washington to California to Florida. One of their \nmost well-known project was providing the interior designs for the \nhistoric Waldorf Astoria hotel in New Orleans.\n  Today, the company boasts a statewide and nationwide clientele, \nlargely due to their commitment to personally measuring, producing, and \ninstalling each order that many large corporations sometimes cannot \nprovide. The company has earned a reputation among large hotel brands, \nenabling Delta Contract Interiors to grow and employ more and more \nlocal workers in their manufacturing factory.\n  In the aftermath of a strong upper level storm system that brought \ndangerous thunderstorms and flooding across Louisiana this month, the \nPeters found themselves in a seemingly impossible situation: their \nlife's business was literally underwater. The Homer community came \ntogether to help the Peters recover all undamaged products and remove \nwhat had been destroyed by the rising water. With friends, family, and \nneighbors coming to their aid, the Peters have been inspired to pick up \nthe pieces and rebuild their small business.\n  In the next several months, countless businesses like Delta Contract \nInteriors will put the pieces of their businesses back together again \nwith the help of family, friends, and neighbors. As the Peters family \nand their team at Delta Interiors rebuild after these disastrous \nstorms, I am honored to name Delta Interiors as Small Business of the \nWeek, and I wish them a quick recovery and many more years of growth \nand success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/21/senate-section/article/S2387-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:24 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1206.

A bill to amend the National Dam Safety Program Act to \nestablish a program to provide grant assistance for the rehabilitation \nand repair of high hazard potential dams, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing, along with \nSenator Capito, the High Hazard Potential Small Dam Safety Act. This \nlegislation seeks to provide grant assistance for the rehabilitation \nand repair of non-Federal high hazard potential dams.\n  High hazard potential dams are those dams where failure is probable \nto cause loss of human life and endanger population centers and \necosystems, especially in periods of extreme weather and flooding. \nAccording to the Association of State Dam Safety Officials, ASDSO, the \nnumber of high-hazard potential dams increased nationally from 9,281 in \n1998 to more than 14,700 in 2013. In testimony before the Senate \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, on February 10, 2016, the \npresident of the American Society of Civil Engineers, ASCE, Norma Jean \nMattei, indicated that the average age of dams in the United States is \n52 years, and she called for a dam rehabilitation program to address \nthis growing problem. In Rhode Island, we have dozens of high hazard \npotential dams in need of rehabilitation, many of which date back to \nthe nineteenth century.\n  Currently, there is no Federal program to assist states with the \nrepair or removal of non-agricultural, non-hydroelectric, non-Federal \nhigh hazard potential small dams. Such a program does exist to address \ndams built by the Department of Agriculture, but this leaves many dams \nvulnerable and some states without the ability to address the risks \nposed by small dams whose failure would likely result in the loss of \nhuman life.\n  The bill Senator Capito and I are introducing today expands FEMA's \nexisting National Dam Safety Program to allow non-Federal entities to \napply for\n\n[[Page S2390]]\n\nmatching grants for the repair and removal of non-Federal, non-\nagricultural, non-hydroelectric small dams that have been identified by \na state dam safety agency as a high hazard potential. The program is \nnon-mandatory, allowing states to determine which, if any, dams they \nwould submit for assistance. The allocation of funds is based on a one-\nthird equal distribution and 2/3 need-based formula, with a 65-35 \npercent cost share, to ensure the participation of a wide number of \nstates. This legislation builds upon a bipartisan bill introduced in \nthe 110th Congress by our former colleague, Senator Akaka of Hawaii, of \nwhich I was a cosponsor.\n  By assisting in the repair or removal of high hazard dams before they \nfail, the bill makes an investment in future cost savings, not to \nmention lives and property saved. Estimates show that one dollar of \npre-disaster mitigation spending can save between $3-$14 in post-\ndisaster spending.\n  This bipartisan bill, which is supported by the Association of State \nDam Safety Officials and the American Society of Civil Engineers, will \nimprove dam safety across the Nation. I look forward to working with \nthese and other stakeholders as well as Senator Capito and our \ncolleagues to pass the High Hazard Potential Small Dam Safety Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Franken, \n        Mr. Hatch, Mr. Coons, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Vitter):\n  S. 2840.

A bill to provide emergency supplemental appropriations to \naddress the Zika crisis; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I rise to announce that Senator Reid of \nNevada and I will be introducing legislation that is the President's \nemergency funding request to respond to the Zika virus. I have been on \nthe floor many times talking about the ravages of the Zika virus. It is \nup to 91 cases in my State of Florida. Fortunately, none of them \noriginated in the State. It is all because of a mosquito bite or some \nother means of transmission, such as sexual contact, that has been done \noutside of Florida. That is particularly true in the warmer climates of \nthe Caribbean, Central America, and Latin America.\n  We know the devastating consequences of someone getting this virus--\nnot as a virus, because it has the effects of a mild flu, but if a \nmosquito infects a pregnant woman, the researchers understand that if \nit is any time during the 9 months of the pregnancy, it has the \ndisastrous consequences of severe deformities. What is the result of \nthat? The result is not only trauma to the family involved, enormous \ntragedy, but look at what the social cost is going to be.\n  The World Health Organization declares this a public health emergency \nof international concern. The last time the World Health Organization \ndeclared such an emergency was for Ebola.\n  Last week our CDC announced that it is ``scarier than they had \ninitially thought'' and that it could be linked to other birth defects, \nnot just the shrunken head and brain that is so horrendous to see \npictures of.\n  This isn't just in Florida; 800 Americans in 40 States and \nterritories have been infected. Of course, my State, with 91 cases, has \nbeen hit the hardest, and it has spread across 15 counties. The three \nmost recent cases were in the Miami area, and in Florida it includes \nfive pregnant women.\n  Now we are going into the warmer summer months, and this is when the \nmosquitos breed all the more. This particular mosquito carries the \ndengue virus, which has its own drastic consequences.\n  This mosquito is all over Puerto Rico. There is an estimate that 20 \npercent of the population of Puerto Rico may eventually be infected. If \nthat is the case, you can wonder, out of that 20 percent of the \npopulation, how many are pregnant women. In a territory of the United \nStates where American citizens reside, you can start to see the extreme \ndepravity and social cost that will result, all at the same time that \nPuerto Rico is going through this tremendous financial crisis.\n  Yesterday I spoke at length to Senator Hatch, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee. I believe he and his staff director are quite \nsincere about trying to do something about the financial condition of \nPuerto Rico, but now, on top of that, this additional plague is added.\n  At the end of the day, we have to do whatever we can to help Puerto \nRico in its financial crisis but now especially to help curb the spread \nof this virus.\n  It is also in Haiti. It just so happens that we have a large Haitian \nAmerican population in Florida. It is particularly running rampant \nthroughout South America, including Brazil. Guess what is going to \nhappen this summer. The Olympics will be in Brazil, and people from all \nover the world will be going.\n  It is time to address this problem head-on with the administration's \nrequest for $1.9 billion in emergency funding. There are rumors that \nthe Appropriations Committee is looking at a figure of $1.1 billion by \nstripping out the $250 million that would go through CMS because of the \nFederal Medicaid assistance increase to support Puerto Rico's Medicaid \nProgram.\n  What have I just said? They are already in crisis, their Medicaid \nfunds have already been cut, and now we are not going to give this \nassistance to a population where 20 percent is going to be infected? \nThe Appropriations Committee shouldn't cut out that $250 million.\n  There is also the rumor that the Appropriations Committee is going to \ncut out some $589 million of the request that would go back to \nreplenish the Ebola crisis fund; that in order to meet the emergency, \nthe administration took that money--just under $600 million--over to \naddress the Zika crisis until we can get off our duffs here in Congress \nand appropriate the emergency appropriations.\n  I hope the Appropriations Committee will think twice before they cut \nout the money for Medicaid in Puerto Rico and replenishing the Ebola \nfund. That crisis still goes on, but the success of our being able to \nget on the Ebola crisis from 2 years ago is why we need to receive that \nadded source to stop it. Otherwise, the consequences will be that the \nEbola crisis will come back to the United States.\n  This is truly an emergency. I am calling on our colleagues to approve \nthe President's $1.9 billion emergency funding request now, in the \nimmediate future, not later. The cost of inaction would be great and \nthe consequences devastating. We don't want to have to say in the \nfuture: I told you so.\n  I am introducing this legislation. More than likely, it will later be \nconsidered possibly as a stand-alone bill but possibly also as an \namendment to one of these appropriations bills.\n  I urge our colleagues to support this $1.9 billion emergency \nassistance request.\n\n[[Page S2391]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. NELSON.

Res. 435\n\n       Whereas the sixth annual Kids to Parks Day will be \n     celebrated on May 21, 2016;\n       Whereas the goals of Kids to Parks Day are to promote \n     healthy outdoor recreation and environmental stewardship, \n     empower young people, and encourage families to get outdoors \n     and visit the parks and public land of the United States;\n       Whereas, on Kids to Parks Day, individuals from rural and \n     urban areas of the United States can be reintroduced to the \n     splendid national, State, and neighborhood parks located in \n     their communities;\n       Whereas communities across the United States offer a \n     variety of natural resources and public land, often with free \n     access, to individuals seeking outdoor recreation;\n       Whereas the people of the United States, young and old, \n     should be encouraged to lead more healthy and active \n     lifestyles;\n       Whereas Kids to Parks Day is an opportunity for families to \n     take a break from their busy lives and come together for a \n     day of active, wholesome fun; and\n       Whereas Kids to Parks Day will broaden an appreciation for \n     nature and the outdoors in young people, foster a safe \n     setting for independent play and healthy adventure in \n     neighborhood parks, and facilitate self-reliance while \n     strengthening communities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 21, 2016, as ``Kids to Parks Day'';\n       (2) recognizes the importance of outdoor recreation and the \n     preservation of open spaces to the health and education of \n     the young people of the United States; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and \n     activities.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution to \ndesignate May 21, 2016, as Kids to Parks Day.\n  From the Painted Hills to Crater Lake and from Mt. Hood to the Oregon \nCaves, nature has given Oregon many wondrous treasures in every corner \nof my State. As a whole, Oregon boasts some of the most beautiful \nlandscapes, varied ecosystems, and unrivaled outdoor recreation \nopportunities in the nation. Given Oregon's unmatched scenery, enjoying \nthe outdoors is imbedded in the DNA of Oregonians, and opportunities to \nget outside and enjoy our treasures brings in visitors from all over \nthe world.\n  Kids to Parks Day builds on Oregon's outdoor culture, inspiring \nchildren and families to spend time together, enjoy nature and parks, \nand recreate on public lands across the country. Over 70,000 people \nhave pledged to participate in this year's Kids to Parks Day, and over \n200 cities have proclaimed May 21 as the day in which to celebrate \nThose who choose to celebrate Kids to Parks Day will find that \ncommunities all across the country offer a variety of natural resources \nand public lands--often with free access--that promote healthy outdoor \nrecreation and empower young people to become stewards of the \nenvironment.\n  I am pleased to be joined on this resolution by my colleague from \nUtah, Senator Orrin Hatch, who has worked with me over the years to \npromote healthy recreation.\n  This resolution promotes the values of healthy outdoor recreation and \nenvironmental stewardship, for kids of all ages, by encouraging them to \nget outside and visit local parks and public lands. Research shows that \noutdoor recreation has positive impacts on children's performance in \nschool and their overall health. In addition, when kids have a \nconnection to nature, they are more likely to get involved in efforts \nto preserve public lands for future generations of young \nconservationists.\n  This resolution--designating Kids to Parks Day--is about more than \njust one day of recreation. It is about promoting the year-round use of \nparks and public lands by kids and their families. While National Parks \nare the crown jewels of this country's parks system, State and \nneighborhood parks serve as important year-round conduits to the \noutdoors, attracting the everyday dog walker, jogger, and birdwatcher. \nNeighborhood parks are easily accessible, and can broaden the \nappreciation for nature and the outdoors in young people, while \nfostering a safe setting for healthy adventure. Local parks and the \nmiles of trails on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land, \nnot to mention the widely-used reservoirs managed by the Army Corps of \nEngineers, are the backbone that supports recreation and access to \npublic lands all across the country.\n  Kids to Parks Day recognizes the significance of all open spaces and \nthe need to preserve these areas for the health and education of young \npeople. Today, I am pleased to celebrate the importance of our public \nlands and the importance of recreation. I want to take this time to \nencourage children and their families to spend time in the outdoors and \ncelebrate Kids to Parks Day on Saturday, May 21, 2016.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/21/senate-section/article/S2393-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2393-S2394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 436--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF WORLD MALARIA \n                                  DAY\n\n  Mr. WICKER (for himself, Mr. Coons, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \nBoozman, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Isakson, Mrs. Murray, \nand Mr. Brown) submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 436\n\n       Whereas April 25 of each year is recognized internationally \n     as World Malaria Day;\n       Whereas malaria is a leading cause of death and disease in \n     many developing countries, despite being preventable and \n     treatable;\n       Whereas fighting malaria is in the national interest of the \n     United States, as reducing the risk of malaria protects \n     members of the Armed Forces and other people of the United \n     States serving overseas in malaria-endemic regions, and \n     reducing malaria deaths helps to lower risks of instability \n     in less developed countries;\n       Whereas the elimination of malaria remains a bipartisan \n     priority of the United States Government;\n\n[[Page S2394]]\n\n       Whereas, on December 14, 2006, President George W. Bush \n     stated at the White House Malaria Summit, ``So we are acting, \n     and we're leading. And with partners across the world, we are \n     helping the people of Africa turn the tide against malaria. \n     The goal of defeating malaria is a challenging goal, yet it \n     can be done. It's not going to require a miracle, it just \n     requires a smart, sustained, focused effort.'';\n       Whereas, on September 27, 2015, President Barack Obama \n     stated at the United Nations General Assembly, ``Billions of \n     our fellow human beings are at risk of dying from diseases \n     that we know how to prevent. Many children are just 1 \n     mosquito bite away from death. And that is a moral outrage. \n     It is a profound injustice. It is literally a matter of life \n     and death, and now the world must act.'';\n       Whereas support for efforts to fight malaria is in the \n     diplomatic and moral interest of the United States, as that \n     support generates goodwill toward the United States and \n     highlights the values of the people of the United States \n     through the work of governmental, nongovernmental, and faith-\n     based organizations of the United States;\n       Whereas efforts to fight malaria are in the long-term \n     economic interest of the United States because those efforts \n     help developing countries--\n       (1) identify at-risk populations;\n       (2) provide a framework for critical emergency disease \n     treatment;\n       (3) provide better health services;\n       (4) increase local governance needed to address substandard \n     and counterfeit medicines that exacerbate malaria resistance;\n       (5) produce healthier and more productive workforces;\n       (6) advance economic development; and\n       (7) promote stronger trading partners;\n\n       Whereas, in 2015, malaria transmission occurred in 95 \n     countries and territories;\n       Whereas an estimated 3,200,000,000 people are at risk for \n     malaria, with 214,000,000 active cases, the vast majority of \n     whom are in sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for 90 percent \n     of malaria deaths in the world;\n       Whereas young children and pregnant women are particularly \n     vulnerable to and disproportionately affected by malaria;\n       Whereas malaria greatly affects the health of children, as \n     children under the age of 5 account for an estimated 70 \n     percent of malaria deaths each year;\n       Whereas malaria poses great risks to maternal and neonatal \n     health, causing complications during delivery, anemia, and \n     low birth weights, and estimates indicate that malaria \n     infection causes approximately 400,000 cases of severe \n     maternal anemia and between 75,000 and 200,000 infant deaths \n     annually in sub-Saharan Africa;\n       Whereas heightened national, regional, and international \n     efforts to prevent and treat malaria during recent years have \n     made significant progress and helped save hundreds of \n     thousands of lives;\n       Whereas the World Malaria Report 2015 by the World Health \n     Organization states that, in 2014, approximately 55 percent \n     of people in sub-Saharan Africa slept under an insecticide-\n     treated mosquito net, and household surveys indicated that 90 \n     percent of people used an insecticide-treated mosquito net if \n     such a net was available in the household;\n       Whereas, in 2014, approximately 116,000,000 people were \n     protected by indoor residual spraying;\n       Whereas the World Malaria Report 2015 further states that, \n     between 2000 and 2015--\n       (1) malaria mortality rates decreased by 60 percent around \n     the world;\n       (2) in the African Region of the World Health Organization, \n     malaria mortality rates decreased by 66 percent; and\n       (3) an estimated 6,200,000 malaria deaths were averted \n     globally, primarily as a result of increased interventions;\n\n       Whereas the World Malaria Report 2015 further states that, \n     out of 95 countries and territories with ongoing transmission \n     of malaria in 2015--\n       (1) 10 countries are classified as being in the pre-\n     elimination phase;\n       (2) 10 countries are classified as being in the elimination \n     phase; and\n       (3) 9 countries are classified as being in the prevention \n     of malaria reintroduction phase of malaria control;\n\n       Whereas continued national, regional, and international \n     investment in efforts to eliminate malaria, including \n     prevention and treatment efforts, the development of a \n     vaccine to immunize children from the malaria parasite, and \n     advancements in insecticides, are critical in order to--\n       (1) continue to reduce malaria deaths;\n       (2) prevent backsliding in areas where progress has been \n     made; and\n       (3) equip the United States and the global community with \n     the tools necessary to fight malaria and other global health \n     threats;\n\n       Whereas the United States Government has played a leading \n     role in the recent progress made toward reducing the global \n     burden of malaria, particularly through the President's \n     Malaria Initiative (referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``PMI'') and the contribution of the United States to the \n     Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria;\n       Whereas an independent, external evaluation, prepared by \n     Boston University, examining 6 objectives of the PMI, found \n     the PMI to be a successful, well-led program that has \n     ``earned and deserves the task of sustaining and expanding \n     the United States Government's response to global malaria \n     control efforts'';\n       Whereas the PMI Strategy 2015-2020 articulates the malaria \n     goal of the United States Government of working with \n     countries and partners to further reduce malaria deaths and \n     substantially decrease malaria morbidity, towards the long-\n     term goal of elimination;\n       Whereas the United States Government is pursuing a \n     comprehensive approach to ending malaria deaths through the \n     PMI, which is led by the United States Agency for \n     International Development and implemented with assistance \n     from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the \n     Department of State, the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, the National Institutes of Health, the Department \n     of Defense, and private sector entities;\n       Whereas the PMI focuses on helping partner countries \n     achieve major improvements in overall health outcomes through \n     improved access to, and quality of, healthcare services in \n     locations with limited resources; and\n       Whereas the PMI, recognizing the burden of malaria on many \n     partner countries, has set a target by 2020 of reducing \n     malaria mortality by \\1/3\\ from 2015 levels in PMI-supported \n     countries, achieving a greater than 80 percent reduction from \n     original 2000 baseline levels set by the PMI, reducing \n     malaria morbidity in PMI-supported countries by 40 percent \n     from 2015 levels, and assisting not fewer than 5 PMI-\n     supported countries to meet the criteria of the World Health \n     Organization for national or sub-national pre-elimination: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of World Malaria Day;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of reducing malaria \n     prevalence and deaths to improve overall child and maternal \n     health, especially in sub-Saharan Africa;\n       (3) commends the recent progress made toward reducing \n     global malaria morbidity, mortality, and prevalence, \n     particularly through the efforts of the President's Malaria \n     Initiative and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, \n     and Malaria;\n       (4) welcomes ongoing public-private partnerships to \n     research and develop more effective and affordable tools for \n     malaria diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination;\n       (5) recognizes the goals, priorities, and authorities to \n     combat malaria set forth in the Tom Lantos and Henry J.

Con. Res. 36\n\n       Whereas the annihilation of 6,000,000 Jews during the \n     Holocaust and the murder of millions of others by the Nazi \n     German state constitutes 1 of the most tragic and heinous \n     crimes in human history;\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of Jews survived persecution \n     by the Nazi regime despite being imprisoned, subjected to \n     slave labor, moved into ghettos, forced to live in hiding or \n     under false identity or curfew, or required to wear the \n     ``yellow star'';\n       Whereas in fear of the oncoming Nazi Einsatzgruppen, or \n     ``Nazi Killing Squads'', and the likelihood of extermination, \n     hundreds of thousands of Jewish Nazi victims fled for their \n     lives;\n       Whereas whatever type of persecution suffered by Jews \n     during the Holocaust, the common thread that binds Holocaust \n     victims is that they were targeted for extermination and they \n     lived with a constant fear for their lives and the lives of \n     their loved ones;\n       Whereas Holocaust victims immigrated to the United States \n     from Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, and the former \n     Soviet Union between 1933 and the date of adoption of this \n     resolution;\n       Whereas it is estimated that there are at least 100,000 \n     Holocaust victims living in the United States and \n     approximately 500,000 Holocaust victims living around the \n     world, including child survivors of the Holocaust;\n       Whereas tens of thousands of Holocaust victims are at least \n     80 years old, and the number of surviving Holocaust victims \n     is diminishing;\n       Whereas at least 50 percent of Holocaust victims alive \n     today will pass away within the next decade, and those living \n     victims are becoming frailer and have increasing health and \n     welfare needs;\n       Whereas Holocaust victims throughout the world continue to \n     suffer from permanent physical and psychological injuries and \n     disabilities and live with the emotional scars of a \n     systematic genocide against the Jewish people;\n       Whereas many of the emotional and psychological scars of \n     Holocaust victims are exacerbated in the old age of the \n     Holocaust victims;\n       Whereas the past haunts and overwhelms many aspects of the \n     lives of Holocaust victims when their health fails them;\n       Whereas Holocaust victims suffer particular trauma when \n     their emotional and physical circumstances force them to \n     leave the security of their homes and enter institutional or \n     other group living residential facilities;\n       Whereas tens of thousands of Holocaust victims live in \n     poverty and cannot afford, and do not receive, sufficient \n     medical care, home care, mental health care, medicine, food, \n     transportation, and other vital life-sustaining services that \n     allow individuals to live their final years with comfort and \n     dignity;\n       Whereas Holocaust victims often lack family support \n     networks and require social worker-supported case management \n     in order to manage their daily lives and access government-\n     funded services;\n       Whereas in response to a letter sent by members of Congress \n     to the Minister of Finance of Germany in December 2015 \n     relating to increased funding for Holocaust victims, German \n     officials acknowledged that ``recent experience has shown \n     that the care financed by the German Government to date is \n     insufficient'' and that ``it is imperative to expand these \n     assistance measures quickly given the advanced age of many of \n     the affected persons'';\n       Whereas German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer acknowledged, in \n     1951, the responsibility of Germany to provide moral and \n     financial compensation to Holocaust victims worldwide;\n       Whereas every successive German Chancellor has reaffirmed \n     that acknowledgment, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, who, \n     in 2007, reaffirmed that ``only by fully accepting its \n     enduring responsibility for this most appalling period and \n     for the cruelest crimes in its history, can Germany shape the \n     future''; and\n       Whereas Congress believes it is the moral and historical \n     responsibility of Germany to comprehensively, permanently, \n     and urgently provide resources for the medical, mental \n     health, and long-term care needs of all Holocaust victims: \n     Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) acknowledges the financial and moral commitment of the \n     Federal Republic of Germany during the 7 decades prior to the \n     date of adoption of this resolution to provide a measure of \n     justice for Holocaust victims;\n       (2) supports the goal of ensuring that all Holocaust \n     victims in the United States and around the world are able to \n     live with dignity, comfort, and security in their remaining \n     years;\n       (3) applauds the nonprofit organizations and agencies that \n     work tirelessly to honor and assist Holocaust victims in the \n     communities of the nonprofit organizations and agencies;\n       (4) acknowledges the ongoing process of negotiations \n     between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Conference on \n     Jewish Material Claims Against Germany (referred to in this \n     resolution as the ``Claims Conference'') in order to secure \n     funding for Holocaust victims and for vital social services \n     provided through nonprofit organizations and agencies around \n     the world;\n       (5) acknowledges that the Federal Republic of Germany and \n     the Claims Conference have established a new high level \n     working group that will develop proposals for extensive \n     assistance for homecare and other social welfare needs of \n     Holocaust victims;\n       (6) urges the working group described in paragraph (5) to \n     recognize the imperative to immediately and fully fund \n     medical, mental health, and long-term care needs of surviving \n     Holocaust victims, with full transparency and accountability, \n     to ensure all funds for Holocaust victims from the Federal \n     Republic of Germany are administered efficiently, fairly, and \n     without delay;
