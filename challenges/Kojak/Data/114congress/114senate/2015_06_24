Mr. President, yesterday's TPA vote was a long-overdue \nvictory for the American worker and the American middle class. It was \nnot easy. Many thought it would never happen. We even saw corks pop in \nthe facts-optional lobby a few weeks ago. But that proved to be \npremature because here is what we have always known about the \nlegislation we will vote to send to the President today. It is \nunderpinned by a simple but powerful idea: For American workers to have \na fair shot in the 21st-century economy, it makes sense to remove the \nunfair barriers that discriminate against them and the products they \nmake.\n  Some may disagree. They certainly were not quiet in voicing their \nopinions. It is OK if they do not share our passion for ending this \nunfair discrimination against American workers. It is OK if they would \nrather rail against them tomorrow. But a bipartisan coalition in the \nHouse and the Senate thought it was time for forward progress instead.\n  We were very pleased to see President Obama pursue an idea we have \nlong believed in. We thank him for his efforts to help us advance this \nmeasure. We thank all of our friends across the aisle for their \nefforts, too, Senator Wyden most of all. Over in the House, I commend \nSpeaker Boehner and Chairman Ryan for everything they have done. It \nhasn't been easy, and without them it would not have been possible. Of \ncourse, let me thank Chairman Orrin Hatch for demonstrating such \npatience, persistence, and determination throughout this process. He \nnever lost sight of the goal. He never gave up. The people of Utah are \nlucky to have him.\n  The Senate's work on trade does not end today. I said the Senate \nwould finish pursuing the rest of the full trade package, and it will. \nWe will take another cloture vote today to that end. That process \ncontinues. But the key victory for American workers and products \nstamped ``Made in the U.S.A.'' comes today. The bill we are about to \npass will assert Congress's authority throughout the trade negotiation \nprocess. It will ensure that we have the tools we need to properly \nscrutinize whatever trade agreements are ultimately negotiated. It will \nmake clear that the final say rests with us.\n  We had plenty of bumps along the road--frankly, a few big potholes, \ntoo--but we worked across the aisle to get through all of them. That is \nan example of how a new Congress is back to work for the American \npeople. I thank everyone who helped us get where we are. Now let's vote \nagain to support the American worker and the American middle class by \napproving the bipartisan TPA bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4557-6", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4557-S4558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CYBER SECURITY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on another matter, here is a headline \nfrom an Associated Press article that ran yesterday: ``Federal Agencies \nAre Wide Open to Hackers, Cyberspies.'' That headline is scary enough, \nbut read just a little further, and it gets even worse.\n\n       Passwords written down on desks. Outdated anti-virus \n     software. ``Perceived ineptitude'' in information-technology \n     departments.\n       The federal government, which holds secrets and sensitive \n     information ranging from nuclear blueprints to the tax \n     returns of hundreds of millions of Americans, has for years \n     failed to take basic steps to protect its data from hackers \n     and thieves, records show. In the latest example, the Office \n     of Personnel Management is under fire for allowing its \n     databases to be plundered by suspected Chinese cyberspies in \n     what is being called one of the worst breaches in U.S. \n     history. OPM repeatedly neglected to implement basic \n     cybersecurity protections, its internal watchdog told \n     Congress.\n\n  Let me repeat that--``one of the worst breaches in U.S. history.'' If \nyou are looking for something scary to tell the kids around the \ncampfire tonight, I would suggest reading the rest of the article. It \ngets a lot worse. To call this alarming would be quite an \nunderstatement.\n\n[[Page S4558]]\n\n  So when the head of the agency that allowed that big breach to happen \ntestified before a Senate subcommittee yesterday, you would think she \nwould have come with a detailed action plan. You would think she would \nhave announced that heads were rolling. You would think she said this \ncould never ever be allowed to happen again under her watch. That is \nwhat the American people expect when a breach happens in the private \nsector and information is stolen. Why should they not expect as much \nfrom the public sector? But what did we hear instead? World-class buck-\npassing. World-class buck-passing. A complete lack of accountability \nand urgency. That tired and predicable excuse that the absence of \nleadership can be solved by throwing a few more dollars at the problem.\n  Well, Congress can certainly look at the funding angle. I know we \nwill. But as we learned yesterday, it was not just the old stuff that \nwas breached, it was the new stuff, too. More money is not going to \nsolve a management problem, either. Let's be honest. This appears \nprimarily to be a management problem. This appears primarily to be a \nmanagement problem.\n  Here is what the American people were really looking for the OPM \nDirector to address: Accountability. Accountability. A plan for the \nfuture. Confidence in the ability of the bureaucracy they hired and \nrarely, if ever, can fire to break out of the stereotype and show they \ncan put the people's concerns first.\n  I thank Chairman Boozman for holding that hearing. We learned a lot, \nbut it is not the end of the story. The OPM Director will testify \ntomorrow before Chairman Ron Johnson's homeland security committee, \ntoo. I hope she will take that opportunity to articulate a credible \nplan of action. I hope she will better address the legitimate concerns \nof the American people. That means a resolve to get to the bottom of \nwhat happened. That means giving the American people renewed confidence \nin a creaking bureaucracy. And that means pledging to work with \npolicymakers to enact real reforms rather than simply accepting \nfailure.\n  Whatever happens tomorrow, one thing does not change: the need for \nthe Intelligence Committee's cyber security bill we tried to pass \nearlier this month. I am going to continue working with my colleagues \ntoward that end. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing what happens \nin tomorrow's committee meeting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4558-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the senior Senator from Kentucky is \ncertainly right that we need to move on cyber security. I have known \nthat for many years, and we have tried. Why have we not done something \non it? Because of filibusters by the Republicans. We had a bill that \nhad been worked on for years that we brought before the Senate. But \ninstructions were given from the Chamber of Commerce, and the \nRepublicans dutifully walked down here and voted no, stopping us from \nmoving forward on the bill. The Chamber said--and obviously Republicans \nagreed--this is not something for the government. It should be done in-\nhouse.\n  Well, my friend the Republican leader rails against the government, \nbut he should also understand that this is a situation which involves \nthe private sector also. We could name 25 companies, 50 companies, 100 \ncompanies that have been hacked and hacked very badly, not the least of \nwhich are Sony and Target.\n  It is hard for me to comprehend that my friend, my counterpart, is \nhere talking about the need to do something about cyber security when \nhe is the leader of the Republicans who have stopped us from doing \nthis.\n  There is a bill--it is not a perfect bill; it is far from it--a \nbipartisan bill. It has the support of the chairman and ranking member \nof the Intelligence Committee. We could get to work on that right now. \nWe should do that. I repeat, it is not perfect legislation, but it is \ncertainly a step forward.\n  My friend said he wants heads to roll. If that were the case, then \nthere are a lot of heads to roll in the public sector and the private \nsector because they do not have the tools to do much about this \nhacking. We need to help them with appropriate legislation. I hope we \ncan do that and do it very soon. I remain committed to turning to cyber \nsecurity as quickly as we can. We need to get that done. I hope we can \nget that done. On that issue, we could go to that legislation right \nnow. Do you know why we are not going to go to it right now? Because \nthe Republicans have holds on the bill. So the Republican leader will \nfile a motion to invoke cloture on moving forward on this legislation. \nWe are ready to move on it now. Again, the problem is on the Republican \nside, not our side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4558-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4558-S4559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRANSPORTATION FUNDING\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, our great country faces yet another \nmanufactured crisis. In just a few weeks from now, the end of July--and \nthat is coming quickly--on July 31, the authority for the recent \nextension of the highway trust fund will expire. The U.S. Department of \nTransportation will not be able to make payments to our States for \nhighways, bridges, railways. All transportation agencies will likely \npostpone or cancel roadwork during the busy summer construction season. \nWhy? Because they have no money. They know the highway Surface \nTransportation Program has been stymied as a result of 33 short-term \nextensions forced upon us by the Republicans in the Senate--33. How can \nthese agencies plan ahead? They can't.\n\n  Before this crisis becomes full-blown, Democrats want to work with \nRepublicans on a long-term reauthorization of the highway program. I \nknow there are Members of the majority who want to do something about \nthis.\n  The Presiding Officer has a plan to take care of highways. Is it a \nperfect plan? Of course it is not perfect, but it sure is a good step \nforward to do something about this program, something that is long \nterm.\n  This crisis is about jobs, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of \nhigh-paying construction jobs throughout the country. That is why we \nchallenged the Republican leader to move forward with a robust, long-\nterm surface transportation bill ahead of that deadline.\n  I am pleased Republicans have joined with Democrats to schedule a \nmarkup--in fact, it is going on right now in the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee--on a 6-year surface transportation bill. This, of \ncourse, is an authorization only, but what terrific work done by \nSenators Boxer and Inhofe. They are an unmatched pair usually in all \nissues that come before this body, but on this legislation they are a \nmatched pair. I admire and appreciate what they are going to mark up in \njust a few minutes. It is an authorization but a big step forward.\n  But next comes the need for funding what they authorize and maybe a \nlittle more. Their legislation will modernize our Nation's crumbling \ninfrastructure. The bill the EPW Committee will consider is $275 \nbillion. That includes modest increases of funding over the next 6 \nyears. But modest increases, while important, will not allow us to make \nthe investments our transportation system really needs. Every day we \nlearn of new examples about the state of disrepair of our roads, \nbridges, our highways, and of course our transit systems.\n  The highway trust fund is no longer sufficient to fund the \ninvestments we so desperately need to rebuild them. Why? Because \npeople's habits have changed. Vehicles have changed. People don't \ndrive--every car they have is not a gas guzzler. We have a lot of \nelectric cars. We have cars that run sometimes on gasoline, sometimes \non electricity. We have cars that run on gasoline all the time, but \nthey don't burn much gasoline.\n  So the trust fund, which was set to take care of all the road needs \nwe have, surface transportation needs--we simply don't have the \nresources anymore, so we have to look for other resources because, I \nrepeat, the highway trust fund is no longer sufficient to fund these \ninvestments we so desperately need to rebuild them. We know this \nbecause over the past few years Congress has transferred billions of \ndollars to make up the shortfall in the trust fund revenues.\n  Today, it is important to thank again Senators Inhofe and Boxer for\n\n[[Page S4559]]\n\ntheir leadership in marking up this bill.\n  I hope the new chairmen of the Banking, Commerce, and Finance \nCommittees will demonstrate the same sense of urgency and schedule \nmarkups for their portion of the surface transportation legislation. \nDespite the common knowledge about the expiration of surface \ntransportation funding, Republicans have delayed the important work of \nwriting a bipartisan bill for far too long.\n  Our good citizens don't deserve another exercise in crisis management \nlike we are seeing this week in the Export-Import Bank. Democrats have \nlaid out a clear timetable and process for bipartisan negotiations. A \nlong-term, robust bill can pass before the August recess.\n  To recap, we requested a number of things, but let me mention a few \nof them: hearings in each of the authorizing committees by June 23--we \nknow how that has already passed--bipartisan markups in all authorizing \ncommittees by July 10 that include robust increases for highways, \ntransit, passenger rail, and of course all kinds of new safety programs \nand maintain those we have; and basically a long-term bill on the \nSenate floor by July 20.\n  If the Republican leader continues to avoid conducting business on \nFridays, we have only 15 session days in the month of July; that is, 15 \ndays to address our country's major surface transportation needs and \nhelp our struggling economy by providing lots and lots of jobs. The \nclock is ticking.\n  At a hearing on the funding gap last week, Senator Hatch said: ``As \nchairman of the [Finance] committee, I intend to solve this problem.''\n  Well, I appreciate that very much. I am taking him at his word. \nSenate Democrats are ready to work with Republicans to grow, not cut, \nour transportation funding. But I say to my friend the senior Senator \nfrom Utah, please, please do something that is more than another short-\nterm extension. We need a 6-year bill. Every State in the Union needs \nthat. We have had them in the past, but now the Republicans, learning \nhow to filibuster--they have stopped, basically, everything we have \ntried to do in this regard.\n  We cannot--I say to my friend from Utah--we cannot have another \nextension. I repeat, this would be the 34th short-term extension. \nEnough is enough. We need to move forward with a plan that funds our \nNation's infrastructure, supports jobs, and grows our economy, creating \nhundreds of thousands of jobs. Americans rely on a strong \ntransportation system to travel. They do this to commute and also, of \ncourse, to move goods across the country.\n  This program was the brainchild of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the \nPresident of the United States, when he called upon his experience as a \nyoung military officer in trying to bring military equipment and men \nacross the country. It was very difficult. As a young military officer \nhe said: Someday, if I have any ability to change this, I will--and he \ndid. The National Highway System is Eisenhower's highway system. This \nis not a program that was developed by anyone other than Dwight \nEisenhower.\n  So temporary funding for the highway trust fund leads only to \nuncertainty, slowing construction, and of course hurting economic \ndevelopment in every State of our Nation. The Republican leadership \nshould act now to avoid this looming deadline and support long-term \ninvestment into our Nation's crumbling infrastructure.\n  Mr. President, I see no one on the floor so I would ask what the \nbusiness of the day is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4559-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, we had a wonderful event last night here \nin Washington that I was able to attend. It was a night honoring \nchampions for anti-gun violence measures across the country. It was put \non by Sandy Hook Promise, which is an organization that has grown up \nout of the tragedy in Sandy Hook. A number of parents have become the \norganizers of an effort to try and learn from what happened at Sandy \nHook and make sure we don't repeat the mistakes of the past.\n  We actually got to honor two of our colleagues there. We honored \nSenator Pat Toomey for his work 2 years ago on the background checks \nbill, as well as Senator Stabenow, who, of course, has been a great \nadvocate for increasing resources in our mental health system. And as \nwonderful a night as it was to honor these champions of change, it also \nwas a night in which we were reminded about that terrible morning in \nDecember of 2012.\n  We watched a short video of the news coverage, and we listened to the \nparents of Daniel Barden and Dylan Hockley. The husband of Mary \nSherlach talked to us about what their lives have been like in the \nyears since that shooting at Sandy Hook.\n  I remember the hours and days after the shooting. I remember feeling \nlike I needed to be really restrained about talking about the obvious \npolicy issues that, to me, were due for airing and that sort of tumbled \nout of the facts surrounding that tragedy. I mean, this kid--this \nreally troubled young man--walked into a school with a semiautomatic \nweapon designed for the military and shot 20 kids in less than 5 \nminutes. This gun was designed for the military, designed to kill as \nmany people as quickly as possible, and it killed every single kid it \nhit. There were 20 kids shot. Twenty kids were dead in a matter of \nminutes.\n  So it seemed to me we should have an immediate discussion about why \nthis kind of gun is still legal. But I held back because it felt like \nthe mourning and the grieving should take precedence over action. It \ntook me only up to the first wake that I attended to realize I was \nwrong. Senator Blumenthal and I went to every single wake and every \nfuneral we could over the course of that first week--and there were \ndozens.\n  At first, I remember waiting in a really long line, standing next to \nSenator Blumenthal. I remember as if it were yesterday, talking to a \nsobbing mother, who was standing in front of us waiting in that line \nand telling us about how her child survived the shooting only because \nshe had been sick that day and she stayed home from school. But all her \ndaughters' friends were dead. As we approached that family, I remember \nstruggling with what to say. I am lucky that the senior Senator from \nConnecticut, who sits behind me in the Chamber, had the right words \nready. He said to the parents something like this: If you are ever \nready or willing to talk about how we make sure this doesn't happen \nagain, we will be waiting. The dad didn't pause more than a few seconds \nbefore he said, clear as day: We are ready now.\n\n[[Page S4560]]\n\n  In the years since, these mass shootings have become as commonplace \nas rain storms. Since 2011, the number of mass shootings in the United \nStates has tripled--tripled. After each one, the forces of the status \nquo--the defenders of the gun industry--tell us we can't talk about \npolicy reform in the days after a shooting. One prominent commentator \ncalled those of us who dared talk about change in the wake of \nCharleston ``sick.'' How convenient that is. How convenient that, at \nthe moment when the world is watching, when the country is asking \nitself what we can do to make sure another mass slaughter doesn't \nhappen again, the rules say we can't say a word.\n  But think about how these rules would work, because Charleston \nhappens 10 times over, every single day, across this country. Eighty-\nsix people die, on average, every day because of guns.\n  Last Thursday the families of Clementa Pinckney, Cynthia Hurd, \nTywanza Sanders, Sharonda Coleman Singleton, Myra Thompson, Ethel Lee \nLance, Susie Jackson, Daniel Lee Simmons, Sr., and DePayne Middleton-\nDoctor mourned the loss of their loved ones in Charleston.\n  But the day before, on Wednesday, the families of Angel Feliciano, \nMalik Mercer, Eric Ferguson, Michael Kidd, Jr., Thomas Whitaker, Roy \nBrown, Martarese Gentry, Keith Battle, and Ronald Collins mourned their \nloss. And those were just nine. There were dozens more on Wednesday, \nthe day before the Charleston shooting, who were killed by guns.\n  If we can't talk about anti-gun violence policy the day after a large \nnumber of Americans are shot, then we will never talk about anti-gun \nviolence policy, because on average 86 people die from gun violence \nevery single day. But even if we accept that there is never a bad time \nto talk about how we can end this carnage, then we also have to have \nthe courage to take on all the other ridiculous arguments about why we \ncan't act.\n  Now, the first one is familiar because it comes right after the mass \nshooting happens. A former NRA board member trotted this one out within \nhours of Charleston: He said that the solution was to just arm more \npastors and parishioners in churches so they can defend themselves. The \nmore there are people who have guns, the less people will die from \nguns--so goes this logic. So don't act.\n  The simple argument is that more good guys with guns equals less gun \ndeaths. The problem with that argument is it is a boldfaced lie. Study \nafter study shows that the more guns there are in a community, the more \ncrime there is. The more guns there are, the more gun homicides there \nare. New evidence makes the case even clearer. As States more clearly \nseparate between those with lax gun laws and those with stricter gun \nlaws, we can look to see what happens.\n  The second argument is one that I have heard from my Republican \ncolleagues in the Senate just in the last few days--that these laws \ncan't stop a madman such as Dylann Root or Adam Lanza from perpetrating \nviolence. Some of my colleagues say the only recourse is to close our \neyes and pray this doesn't happen again. But again, these stubborn \nfacts betray that argument. As I said, now that we have States that \nhave loose gun laws and States that have tougher gun laws, we can see \nwhat happens. Over and over research shows us that jurisdictions that \nmake it a little bit harder for bad guys to get guns have less gun \ndeaths.\n  In my State of Connecticut, Johns Hopkins researchers concluded that \nour permit-to-carry laws have reduced gun crimes by 40 percent. \nSimilarly, they concluded that in Missouri, the repeal of a similar law \nincreased gun homicides by 25 percent. Now, both studies controlled for \nall other possible factors influencing gun crimes, and they still found \nthese shocking results.\n  While the facts are still fresh out of Charleston, there is evidence \nthat a different set of laws could have--not would have--stopped Dylann \nRoot without having any effect on law-abiding gun owners in South \nCarolina.\n  Root had charges pending for trespassing and drug crimes. Alone, \nneither would have disqualified him from owning a gun. But what if our \nlaws were different so that multiple misdemeanors--a pattern of \ncriminal behavior--disqualified you from buying a firearm? Or what \nabout a permit-to-carry law?\n  Maybe local law enforcement knew enough about Root--his criminal past \nor his association with extremist rightwing organizations--to know he \nshouldn't carry a weapon. Now, maybe not, but if South Carolina had a \npermit-to-carry law, at least there would have been a chance law \nenforcement would have withheld a permit from a young man as plainly \nunstable as Root.\n  But even if you don't believe that any specific law could have \nprevented the tragedy in Charleston or in Newtown, I am not sure that \nit matters, because separate and aside from the specific case-by-case \nimpact of any law is the collective moral and psychological effect of \nnonaction. No matter how maligned Congress becomes, we still set the \nmoral tone for the Nation. When we declare something to be morally out \nof bounds, especially when we do it in a bipartisan or nonpartisan \nmanner, Americans listen. They take cues from our endorsements and from \nour approbations.\n  That is why, in my heart of hearts, I believe that our silence has \nmade us complicit in these murders. I don't care that an assault \nweapons ban or universal background check maybe wouldn't have stopped \nthe slaughter in Charleston. When we do nothing year after year, our \nsilence sends a silent message of endorsement to the killers. I am not \nsaying we are in conscious alignment with these assassins, but when all \nwe do in the wake of Newtown, Tucson, Aurora, and Charleston is \nrhetorical, then those on the fringe, those hanging on the edge of \nreason, those contemplating the unthinkable take a cue that we don't \nreally mean it when we condemn mass violence, because if we did, we \nwould, at the very least, try to do something--anything--to stop it, \nand we don't.\n  Quite frankly, removing one flag from one building in South Carolina \ndoesn't cut it, and neither does a handful of retailers ceasing to sell \nConfederate flag paraphernalia. Don't get me wrong. I actually think \nthe tidal wave of sentiment to remove the last vestiges of this symbol \nof slavery and racism is significant. That flag has quietly endorsed \nconscious and subconscious racism, particularly in the South--but \nreally all across the country--for as long as it has continued to be \nperceived as a mainstream American symbol.\n  The events of the last few days are also important because they show \nthat people of all political stripes--conservatives and liberals, \nDemocrats and Republicans--have been so emotionally moved by the \nshooting in Charleston that they were inspired to some sort of action. \nThat matters.\n  But removing the Confederate flag is a necessary but totally, \ncompletely insufficient response to Charleston. Taking down a flag from \na building is a pretty easy giveback. Deciding to spend billions of \ndollars to make sure that troubled young men get the help they need for \ntheir sickness is harder, and so is taking on the gun industry and \nlistening to the 90 percent of Americans who want to make sure \ncriminals aren't a continued profit center for the gun makers and \nsellers.\n  Now, Walmart should be congratulated for ceasing sales of the \nConfederate flag, but they still advertise an assault weapon online \nthat even their description concedes is designed for use by law \nenforcement and the military. Did you know that last year there were at \nleast 92 shootings in Walmart? Some 16 people died, and 42 people were \ninjured by guns in Walmart. Getting rid of the Confederate flag from \ntheir shelves isn't going to help that unbelievably disturbing trend.\n  So we need real action, a real debate. We need a real, honest policy \nto happen here. And, no, it is not all about guns. It is about mental \nhealth, it is about law enforcement, and it is about a culture of \nviolence and hate that we have just become immune to.\n  In South Carolina, Reverend Pinckney knew something about real \naction. He supported things like expanded background checks and body \ncameras for police, maybe because he came from a family of action. His \nfather and grandfather were both pastors who fought to end White-only \npolitical primaries and segregated school busing. He wasn't just about \ncondemnation. He lived his life to effectuate political\n\n[[Page S4561]]\n\nchange. Last night, at the Sandy Hook Promise dinner, I chatted with my \nfriend Mark Barden. His son, Daniel, massacred at Sandy Hook Elementary \nSchool by a young man wielding a military-style assault weapon with \ncartridges of 30 bullets apiece, would have just finished third grade \nlast week. Mark recalled how special Danny was and how Daniel, just 6 \nyears old, lived a life of action, too. Daniel was that kid who sensed \nwhen other children were hurting. His dad told me last night how Daniel \nwould see little kids sitting alone at lunch with no one to talk to, \nand Daniel would go over, sit down next to them, and make a new friend, \njust because it was the right thing to do.\n  Reverend Pinckney and little Daniel Barden knew the difference \nbetween words and actions. They understood that actions are what really \ncount.\n  The U.S. gun homicide rate is 20 times higher than that of our 22 \npeer nations. And 86 people die every day from guns--that is 4 Sandy \nHooks, 10 Charlestons every day. Since Sandy Hook, there has been a \nschool shooting, on average, every week.\n  How on Earth can we live with ourselves if we do nothing or, worse, \nif we don't even try.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        King v. Burwell Decision\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to spend the next few minutes \nspeaking about the Supreme Court and particularly the fact that the \nSupreme Court has some big cases they are going to hand down probably \ntomorrow, Friday, and Monday, before they adjourn for the summer.\n  I particularly wish to speak about King v. Burwell, which, as the \nPresiding Officer knows, could be the beginning of the end of \nObamaCare. In the process, it also will potentially disrupt the health \ncare coverage for more than 6 million Americans. The Court could issue \nits decision, as I said, as early as tomorrow. What they will decide is \nwhether the IRS is bound by the law which Congress writes and which is \nsigned by the President or whether they can make it up on their own.\n  Specifically, the case challenges the legality of subsidies provided \nto 6 million people in up to 37 States that they have depended on to \nbuy their ObamaCare-approved policies, including about 1 million in my \nState of Texas.\n  If the Court rules against the IRS, it will literally be the third \nstrike against ObamaCare from the Supreme Court of the United States. \nIt would serve as yet another reminder of the administration's \noverreach of its authority under the Constitution--a practice that has \nbecome disturbingly routine.\n  This administration and our friends across the aisle have failed to \nown up to the repeated demonstrations of the flaws of ObamaCare since \nit passed in March of 2010. The biggest problem is that this is \npartisan legislation jammed through Congress that no Republican in the \nSenate voted for, so the responsibility lies clearly at their feet.\n  Through this law, the administration has wasted billions of dollars \non exchanges that have failed to function properly. My colleagues may \nrecall that the President even called the healthcare.gov exchange--\nwhich was so broken and just didn't work--a disaster. The President \nhimself said that.\n  It is also based on a system that grows the bureaucracy at the \nexpense of legitimate, needed health care delivery. I would have \nthought that if Congress was going to reform health care, it would \ncertainly include reducing the cost and making it more affordable. \nHowever, time after time, we have seen that ObamaCare has actually \ndriven up costs. Just last month, one study noted that nearly $274 \nbillion of projected ObamaCare spending will end up going to its \nimplementation--bureaucratic and administrative costs--and not actually \nfor health care. That is $274 billion. Do we think that money could \nhave been better spent providing people with health care policies they \ncan afford and access to the doctors and the hospitals they need?\n  Today, ObamaCare has utterly failed to live up to the many promises \nthe President and congressional Democrats made to the American people. \nSeeing the Presiding Officer in the chair reminds me that both he and I \nserved as attorneys general in our States. One of my responsibilities \nin Texas--and no doubt the Presiding Officer's as well--was to enforce \nour consumer protection laws. Can my colleagues imagine, if anybody \nother than the Federal Government had made the series of promises the \nPresident and congressional Democrats made under ObamaCare that proved \nover time to be demonstrably false, whether a company in the private \nsector could withstand the flood of lawsuits by the Attorney General \nand other consumer protection officials against that company?\n  I guess the fact is that there is very little recourse to the \nAmerican people--certainly the courts--to enforce our consumer \nprotection laws against the outright deceit and misleading promises \nthat were made in order to sell ObamaCare, which are clearly, as time \nhas demonstrated, not true.\n  The President's trail of broken promises has instead led us to a \ndamaged health care system and a limping economy. There is a reason why \nthe economy shrunk last quarter by 0.7 percent. What that means is that \nfewer people can find work and their wages are depressed. We need our \neconomy to grow. But as long as additional and heavy burdens, such as \nObamaCare and unnecessary regulations, are imposed on the private \nsector, those jobs and those rising wages are simply not going to \nexist.\n  This week, many are rightly concerned that, depending on what the \nSupreme Court decides, millions of people will lose their access to \nhealth care should the Court rule against the President. I must point \nout that is a feature of ObamaCare. That is not the fault of the \nSupreme Court, and it is not the fault of the opponents of ObamaCare; \nit is the fault of the President and of the people who passed ObamaCare \nbecause this will be a feature of ObamaCare, this failed law.\n  Having said where the responsibility lies, while we didn't contribute \nto getting the country in this mess, we are ready, willing, and able to \nprovide an off-ramp for the millions of people who may have their \nhealth care interrupted. My State, as I indicated earlier, is not \nimmune. Close to 1 million Texans could suddenly see their costs shoot \nup. So I am here to emphatically say to the Texans whose health care \ncoverage may be disrupted: We will not leave you out in the cold as a \ncasualty of this flawed law, and we will no longer allow this flawed \npiece of legislation to cause additional hardship for hard-working \nTexas families.\n  In order to protect Americans and Texans who may lose their health \ncare coverage if the Court decides against the President and against \nthe IRS, we are prepared, having worked for months now, to protect \nthose who need it as they transition out of ObamaCare.\n  Make no mistake about it--this will be the beginning of the end of \nObamaCare if the Court rules for the plaintiff in King v. Burwell.\n  At the same time, we plan to provide an end to the individual and \nemployer mandates, the opportunity for States to opt out of ObamaCare, \nand finally, an end to government-backed health care that the American \npeople don't want, don't need, and cannot afford.\n  There is a better alternative. If the Supreme Court rules for King, \nwe will offer the American people what ObamaCare never could--options, \nchoices, and the freedom to choose the health care coverage they want \nat a price they can afford. Most importantly, we want to allow \nindividuals as well as the States to opt out of this disastrous law all \nacross the country. In doing so, Americans can get what they actually \nneed and not what government tells them they must buy. By empowering \nStates to opt out, we put the States back in the driver's seat. I must \nsay, every public opinion poll I have seen indicates that the people \nhave a lot more confidence in the ability of the States to deal with \ntheir health care needs than they do the Federal Government, \nparticularly in light of the failed experiment over the last 5 years. \nWe put the States back in\n\n[[Page S4562]]\n\nthe driver's seat and allow them the flexibility they need to more \neffectively lower costs and increase choices.\n  So while we didn't create this mess, we are ready to do our best to \nwork together to protect the American people from any more harm caused \nby this legislation. The American people deserve real, patient-centered \nreforms which, again, lower costs, making it more affordable, and \nincrease access to care--not the opposite.\n  If the Court delivers what could be a third strike against ObamaCare, \nmy colleagues and I are eager to provide the American people with the \nfreedom and the options they need in order to get the best health care \navailable at a price they can afford.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, as we are moving toward concluding debate \non trade promotion authority, I rise to speak about what the Trans-\nPacific Partnership will mean for our Nation's global standing. As we \nhave heard throughout this debate, the potential economic benefits from \nTPP for our Nation are simply enormous. According to the Congressional \nResearch Service, total trade in goods between TPP member countries \nreached $1.6 trillion in 2014; that is, the nations represented in TPP, \n$1.6 trillion in trade between those countries, representing nearly 40 \npercent of all global trade.\n  In my own State of Colorado, trade with countries involved in TPP \ncurrently supports over 265,000 jobs. The nations represented by the \nTPP agreement--the negotiations that are taking place right now--\n265,000 jobs in Colorado result from those nations. But we know the TPP \nis more than just an economic agreement. It is a critical test of U.S. \nstrategic leadership in the Asia-Pacific region, a region that will be \nintegral to our economic and national security for generations to come.\n  As stated in the 2015 National Security Strategy:\n\n       Sustaining our leadership depends on shaping an emerging \n     global economic order that continues to reflect our interests \n     and our values. Despite its success, our rules-based system \n     is now competing against alternative, less-open models. . . . \n     To meet this challenge, we must be strategic in the use of \n     our economic strength to set new rules of the road, \n     strengthen our partnerships, and promote inclusive \n     development.\n\n  Those are important words from the National Security Strategy issued \njust this year. Defense Secretary Ash Carter echoed that sentiment when \nhe said on April 6, 2015, the ``TPP is as important to me as another \naircraft carrier.'' If we fail to pass the TPP, we know others will \nrush to fill the vacuum left behind with such ``alternative, less-open \nmodels,'' as the National Security Strategy laid out.\n  So we should not be surprised when a rising China tries to fill the \nvacuum and that they would, indeed, exert efforts to fill that vacuum \nwith policies and programs crafted from their own vision of what is \nbeneficial for themselves and their region.\n  Let's take China's recent establishment of the Asian Infrastructure \nand Investment Bank, the AIIB, as an example. On the face of it, the \nAIIB is a positive response to address the infrastructure challenges in \nthe region. It is also the clearest evidence yet that the United States \nfaces a very serious credibility gap in the Asia-Pacific region. The \nAIIB is envisioned as a $100 billion enterprise, with China as the \nlargest shareholder that will hold veto power over major investment \ndecisions. Its rules of governance and standards remain unclear.\n  Yet 56 nations, including some of the strongest U.S. allies, \nincluding the United Kingdom, Australia, South Korea, have indicated \nthey will join the Chinese-led AIIB. We need to understand why. Do they \nbelieve the AIIB is primarily an economic opportunity for their \ncompanies? They might. But I would contend that the reason is a lack of \nleadership from the United States, again going back to that credibility \ngap.\n  China is also part of ongoing negotiations for another regional trade \npact, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which would join \nChina, Australia, India, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea with \nnations comprising the Association of Southeast Asian Nations or ASEAN. \nIn addition to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, Beijing \nis also entering negotiations to consider 6 agreements comprised of an \nadditional 11 countries.\n  That brings China's total trade agreement portfolio to 33 countries. \nWhile the United States should continue bilateral and multilateral \neconomic engagement with China that brings high levels of transparency \nand accountability, the fundamental question before us today is this: \nDo we want the United States or do we want China writing the rules?\n  It is clear that while our partners and allies in the region may \nwelcome additional Chinese investment, they want more American \nleadership, not less. They want more American standards, not fewer.\n  We know the standards TPP and U.S. engagement brings include not only \nimportant economic benefits, such as removal of tariff or nontariff \nbarriers, but fundamental American values such as transparency, good \ngovernance, respect for the rule of law, and basic human rights.\n  U.S. economic statecraft in the Asia-Pacific reflects our values and \ncements our leadership in the critically important region. We must look \nat TPP as just one step forward in this enduring commitment. Despite \nthe crises of the day that are occurring in the Middle East, where the \nUnited States does and should play an important role, our Nation's \nfuture lies in Asia.\n  Just consider the following estimates from the Asian Development \nBank. By 2050, Asia will account for over half of the global population \nand over half of the world's gross domestic product. The Asian middle \nclass will rise to a staggering 3 billion people. Per capita GDP income \nin the region will rise to around $40,000, making it similar to the \nEurope of today.\n  We cannot miss the opportunity to be a part of this historic \ntransformation. Working with Japan and regional partners, we must \nensure that our policies strengthen existing friendships and build new \npartnerships that will be critical to U.S. national security and \neconomic well-being for generations to come. Unfortunately, the \nadministration's efforts to date with regard to the Asia-Pacific region \nhave fallen short.\n  While I commend the President's leadership on TPP and our Asia \nrebalance, which many of us agreed to, the Asia rebalance policy has \nyielded few tangible results, and it is in need of a serious overhaul. \nThe administration has consistently stated that the rebalance \nrepresented a ``whole-of-government'' effort to redirect U.S. military, \ndiplomatic, and commercial service resources toward the Asia-Pacific \nregion.\n  But in April of 2014, just a year ago, the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee released a report stating that ``while the United States has \nsuccessfully moved forward with the initial phases of implementing the \nmilitary aspects of the rebalance,'' the State Department and the \nDepartment of Commerce have not substantially prioritized their \nresources to increase engagement with the Asia-Pacific region.\n  The report concluded that ``the administration can improve the \neffectiveness and sustainability of the rebalance policy by increasing \ncivilian engagement, strengthening diplomatic partnerships, and \nempowering US businesses.''\n  It is clear we need an integrated, multiyear planning and budget \nstrategy for a rebalancing of the U.S. policy in Asia. That is why I \nwas proud to offer an amendment to the National Defense Authorization \nAct that passed unanimously that would require the President to submit \na strategy within 120 days to promote U.S. interests in the Asia-\nPacific region. Our partners in the region must know every day that the \nUnited States is here to stay. The TPP is the first step in the \nprocess.\n  This is an important debate that we have this week. Later on today, \nwe will have the opportunity to vote for trade promotion authority. I \nhope this Chamber will see the wisdom of passing that legislation--\n265,000 jobs in Colorado from a region responsible for TPP,\n\n[[Page S4563]]\n\nresponsible for increasing economic opportunity, increasing wage \ngrowth, and the number of jobs that we have not only in Colorado but \naround this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to fast-track trade \npromotion authority.\n  I am a blue-collar Senator. My heart and soul lies with blue-collar \nAmerica. I spent most of my life in a blue-collar neighborhood. My \nmother and father owned a neighborhood grocery store and when Bethlehem \nSteel went on strike, my dad gave those workers credit.\n  Blue-collar workers in the labor movement stood with me during my \nfirst campaign for the House in 1976. I wish there were more of them \nleft to stand with me now, but the great manufacturing unions have been \nwhittled away. On this fast-track trade vote, and in my last years in \nthe Senate, I will continue to stand with the unions.\n  Let me be very clear that I support and encourage trade. Trade is \nvery important to my State. It is vital to The Port of Baltimore and \nMaryland's agricultural industries such as poultry on the Eastern \nShore.\n  In the past I have supported bilateral trade agreements. We have \nleverage in those situations to get strong enforceable labor and \nenvironmental provisions into those agreements. We can improve living \nstandards and stop child labor in sweatshops. And Maryland workers can \ncompete successfully in a global marketplace if they are given a level \nplaying field.\n  But I have always been suspicious of multilateral agreements such as \nNAFTA. I have seen too many of these big deals fail to deliver the \npromises of new jobs and businesses. Every time somebody talks about a \nbig multilateral trade agreement that will provide a cornucopia of \nopportunity, we lose jobs in Baltimore. And my constituents in Dundalk \ndon't have a steel industry anymore. They wonder why Congress didn't do \nmore to protect them from the effects of trade.\n  I believe that a renewal of fast-track trade authority for the Trans-\nPacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment \nPartnership means more Americans will lose their jobs.\n  We should use the leverage of our trade agreements to ensure fair \ncompetition. That means workers in other countries should have the \nright to organize into unions. Without the strength of collective \nbargaining, their wages will always be below ours. They should also \nhave worker safety protection and retirement and health care benefits.\n  We should use the leverage of our trade agreements to encourage \ncountries to respect the basic human rights of their citizens. Everyone \ndeserves the right to live in a healthy, clean, unpolluted environment. \nAnd every worker should be guaranteed fundamental rights at work.\n  Why is the role of Congress so important in trade agreements? To make \nsure that the American people get a good deal. I am ready to support \ntrade agreements that are good for America, good for workers, and good \nfor the environment. Congress should consider trade legislation and \namendments using the same procedures we use to consider other \nlegislation.\n  I have to base my decision on the facts and what I know to be true in \nmy State. I know that proponents of fast-track say it is inevitable \nthat there will be winners and losers. The problem with these big trade \ndeals is that America's workers and their families always seem to be \nthe losers. They lose their jobs. If they keep their jobs, or find new \njobs, they lose the wage rates they have earned. Working people have \nfaced the loss of jobs, lower wages, and a reduced standard of living, \nand a shrinking manufacturing base.\n  I have to stand with my constituents who have felt repeatedly \nbetrayed by the trade deals. I have to vote against fast-track trade \nauthority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                        King v. Burwell Decision\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, across the street from the Senate Chamber \nis the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court this week has several important \ncases pending. We are waiting anxiously for decisions, but probably the \none that affects as many Americans as any other is a case called King \nv. Burwell. King is a case that was brought by someone who was \nobjecting to the Affordable Care Act--ObamaCare.\n  They are arguing that the bill we passed in the Senate and the House \ndid not include a subsidy, a tax credit, for those who are under \nFederal marketplace plans. My State of Illinois is one of those States. \nIn Illinois, there are about 232,000 individuals who receive a tax \ncredit that allows them to pay for their health insurance. Their income \nlevels are such that they need a helping hand, otherwise the health \ninsurance premium would be too expensive.\n  In my State, the average tax credit that goes to these 232,000 is \n$1,800 a year--not insubstantial--$150 a month. Now, those who brought \nthe lawsuit say that the law does not provide this tax credit. I \nbelieve it clearly does. No one during the course of debating this bill \never suggested otherwise. In fact, there were many times when we \ncalculated the impact of this law. We always assumed the tax credit \nwould be there for families, whether their State had its own State \ninsurance exchange or used the Federal exchange, as we do in the State \nof Illinois.\n  But the big problem we have is that if the Court rules the other way, \nif those who are critical of the Affordable Care Act--and some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have been on the floor this \nmorning talking about getting rid of the Affordable Care Act--if the \nCourt rules in that direction, we are going to have a problem on our \nhands because at least in my State, 232,000 people will see their \nhealth insurance premiums go up 35 percent, on average, based on that \nCourt ruling.\n  There are not many working families who can face that kind of \nincrease and say, well, it really does not make any difference. It \nmakes a big difference--on average $150 a month. For families living \npaycheck to paycheck and struggling who qualify for this tax credit, it \nis a big problem. Many of them will not be able to afford health \ninsurance.\n  So what happens next? We go back to where we were before: More \nuninsured Americans. I don't know how many people in the Senate Chamber \nwho serve here have ever been in a position in their lives where they \ndid not have health insurance and needed it. I have. Newly married, my \nwife and I had a baby with a serious health issue. We had no health \ninsurance. It is a humbling experience, as a father, as a husband, to \nbe in that position. It means hoping you get the best medical care and \nhoping you can pay for it.\n  For many families across America, that was the standard before the \nAffordable Care Act. But because of the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, \nwe now have fewer people uninsured in America. That is a good thing, \nnot just because it gives you peace of mind and access to quality \nhealth care but because uninsured people still get sick. When they get \nsick and go to the hospital, their expenses that they can't cover \nbecause they don't have health insurance are passed along to everyone \nelse. How can that possibly be a good outcome?\n  So the Affordable Care Act has increased the number of people across \nAmerica who have health insurance by about 11 million people--not \ninsubstantial. It has reduced the uninsured rate, as I mentioned, 3\\1/\n2\\ percent in just a 1- or 2-year period of time. Six million receive \nthese tax credits. So there are 6 million families who may not know it, \nbut what happens across the street at the Supreme Court this week or \nnext week could have a big impact on the family budget.\n  I struggle to try to understand those who hate the Affordable Care \nAct like the devil hates Holy water. They cannot stand this notion that \n11 million people have health insurance. They want to get rid of it. \nThere are proposals from the other side of the aisle to get rid of the \nAffordable Care Act. They want to eliminate the individual mandate. \nWhat does that mean? That is the part of the law that says: You have a \npersonal responsibility to have health insurance.\n  Now, do we run into any other aspect of life where we are required to \nhave insurance? Drive a car in my State, you better have automobile \ninsurance. Buy a home in my State, virtually every bank requires fire \ninsurance. It is a matter of responsibility. So the individual mandate \nnot only says to everyone: You need to buy health insurance, it helps \nthose who are in low-income\n\n[[Page S4564]]\n\ncategories, and it is a critical part of the big picture.\n  Here is the big picture: If we are going to say, as we do in this \nlaw, that no health insurance company can discriminate against you \nbecause of a preexisting condition that you have or that someone in \nyour family has--if we are going to say that, the only way it works in \nthe insurance business is if you have a lot of people who are in that \ninsurance pool. That includes people with preexisting conditions.\n  So when the Republicans argue: We are going to get rid of the \nindividual mandate, you can sign up if you want to, the people who run \ninsurance companies say: It doesn't work. You have to have a pool with \na lot of people in it: healthy and those not so healthy. Otherwise, you \ncannot write insurance that is going to work. What else has happened \nbecause of the Affordable Care Act? The rate of growth in health care \ncosts has started--just started--to come down. It does not have to come \ndown much to have a dramatic impact on our economy.\n  This Affordable Care Act, incidentally, which many on the other side \nare cheering to have it abolished--this Affordable Care Act, according \nto the Congressional Budget Office, is going to cut $353 billion in \ndeficit. How could that be?\n  Because one of the largest drivers of cost to the Federal Government \nis the cost of health care. If the rate of growth in the cost of health \ncare just takes a little dip down and you project it out, it is big \ndollars.\n  We even used what many Republicans believe is holy writ called \ndynamic scoring. We even said: Take a look. Use dynamic scoring, and \ntell us what impact it has on the deficit.\n  It turns out that even with dynamic scoring, our Affordable Care Act \nreduces the deficit by $137 billion. It works. More people are being \ninsured. Folks cannot be denied insurance because of a preexisting \ncondition. The overall cost of health care is starting to dip down. It \nbrings down the deficit. What part of that isn't good news? I think it \nis all good news.\n  For a lot of individuals who live in my home State of Illinois, it is \npretty personal. I have met with them. Last week, in my newsletter I \nasked people to share with me their experiences with the Affordable \nCare Act. The response was overwhelming, and the majority was positive.\n  Danny Blight lives in Germantown Hills, IL. He was diagnosed with \nbladder cancer in 2005. At the time, he was lucky enough to have a job \nwith health insurance, but then he was fired and let go. He lost his \nhealth insurance, and he couldn't afford coverage because of his \npreexisting condition, his history of cancer, and he required surgery \nto treat his cancer. According to Danny, he relied on the local sisters \nof St. Francis to provide basic care for him and his family when he \ncouldn't afford health insurance until the Affordable Care Act became \nthe law. Now Danny Blight and his family have health insurance. Is this \nan important law for them? It may be the most important thing we have \ndone in Congress when it comes to this family.\n  I got in a debate back in my own hometown once with a group who \nopposes this law. They were of the opposite political faith, and I knew \nit. They had some pretty strong feelings about the role and the size of \ngovernment, and they said as much. I would answer them by saying: Well, \nlet me tell you about a family I met. Let me tell you about this \nfamily.\n  Finally, one man stood, raised his hand, and said: Stop telling \nstories. We don't want to hear these stories.\n  I know why they didn't want to hear it--because these stories are \nreality. These stories don't reflect political philosophy so much as \nthe reality of life for a lot of people across America.\n  We know that discriminating against families because of preexisting \nconditions is a real problem. We know there are many families, for \nexample, with a history of some illness, even mental illness, who in \ndays gone by had no chance to have health insurance.\n  There were two other things we did in this law, and I don't \nunderstand why the other party wants to get rid of these provisions. \nThe Affordable Care Act says that if you have a child graduating from \ncollege, your family health insurance plan can cover them until they \nreach the age of 26. Why is that important? Because many times young \npeople coming fresh out of college have a lot of student debt and no \njob--no full-time job--and very few of them have health insurance \nimmediately, and they think they are invincible.\n  I remember reaching out to my daughter when she graduated from \ncollege.\n  I said: Jen, what about health insurance?\n  Dad, don't worry about it. I feel fine.\n  Well, I did worry about it, and a lot of parents do. So our law says \nyou can keep your recent college graduate under your family plan until \nthey reach the age of 26. Why would you want to get rid of that? Why \nwould someone want to eliminate that provision in the law?\n  The other thing it says is that if you are a senior and you are on \nMedicare--the Part D, which provides your prescription drugs, used to \nhave what is called a doughnut hole in it. What that meant was Medicare \nwould cover your prescription drugs to a certain point and then stop, \nand you had to go to your savings account, pull out about $1,200, pay \nfor your prescription drugs, and then coverage would start again. The \ndoughnut hole is what we called it. We filled it. We filled it so \nseniors don't have to worry about going to their savings to make sure \nthey can keep taking prescriptions that keep them independent, strong, \nand healthy. What is wrong with that idea? Why do they want to get rid \nof that? That is part of the Affordable Care Act as well.\n  I just wonder sometimes if those who get all tied up over the \nphilosophy of this legislation deal with the reality of family life in \nAmerica.\n  Jean Terrien and her husband Michael live in Evanston, IL. They are \nboth cancer survivors. Jean had breast cancer at age 45, and Michael \nhad prostate cancer at the same age. Neither could purchase insurance \nbefore the Affordable Care Act because of preexisting medical \nconditions in their family. Because of this law, they have an \naffordable policy, and Jean is able to do freelance work without having \nto worry about health insurance. She told me she worries about losing \nher coverage if the Supreme Court goes the wrong way or if the majority \nparty here gets their wish and abolishes the Affordable Care Act. I \nthink we owe it to them to strengthen the law and not to repeal it.\n  The Affordable Care Act, incidentally, has been very good when it \ncomes to Medicare. Because of the Affordable Care Act and the slowdown \nin the rate of growth in health care costs, Medicare will have an \nadditional 13 years of solvency. How about that. I worried about it for \nmany years. I still do. But it is good news to us, to know that we \nhave, in the Medicare Part A trust fund, 13 years more solvency since \nthe passage of the Affordable Care Act. The trustees of the Medicare \nProgram in 2010 said that the Affordable Care Act ``substantially \nimproved'' the financial status of Medicare. Is that a good thing for \nAmerica? Forty million Americans think it is. Those are the people who \ndepend on Medicare.\n  The law is helping seniors with their prescription drugs, as I \nmentioned earlier, and it is a savings of about $925 a year for each \nsenior in America.\n  So for those who are cheering and hoping the Supreme Court will \nsomehow derail the Affordable Care Act, my questions are very direct: \nWhat do you have to replace it? What will you do to deal with \npreexisting conditions and denying health insurance? What will you do \nto make sure parents can keep their kids under their health insurance \nplans until the kids reach age 26? What will you do to fill the \ndoughnut hole? What will you do to replace the deficit reduction the \nAffordable Care Act has achieved? What will you do in terms of the \nlong-term solvency of Medicare to make up for the 13 years the \nAffordable Care Act has purchased?\n  And the answer is, they don't have an idea. They just don't like it. \nThey don't like ObamaCare, and they don't want to hear these stories, \njust like the folks whom I debated with in my hometown, because these \nstories reflect the reality of life.\n\n\n                    North Central Illinois Tornadoes\n\n  Mr. President, it was 2 months ago when I came to the floor and \ntalked about tornadoes in my State of Illinois, the north central part \nof the State. We\n\n[[Page S4565]]\n\nhad it again on Monday night. Nine twisters tore through the small \ntowns in five Illinois counties Monday evening, accompanied by \nbaseball-sized hail, flooding rains, and wind damage. Grundy, Lee, \nKankakee, Will, and Whiteside Counties all experienced severe damage.\n  One of the towns that was hardest hit was Coal City in Grundy County, \nIL. Here is a photo of Grundy County and some of the damage. You can \nsee the destruction. The National Weather Service said the tornado that \nstruck this town was an EF-3, winds of 160 miles an hour. Some of the \nhomes had the roofs ripped off and others were just flattened. Debris \nwas scattered across the town. Many roads were impassible. There were \ndowned power lines and trees, and there was flooding. This is the \nsecond tornado to hit Coal City in 2 years.\n  As soon as the twister passed Monday night, the first responders--God \nbless them--went door to door to try to make sure the 5,000 people \nthere were accounted for. Thank goodness there were no fatalities or \nlife-threatening injuries.\n  This tight-knit community is pulling together to help the victims. \nOne man who lives in Coal City, Rick Druse, said he was lucky that one \nof his neighbors came to find him and his family--they were trapped in \na crawl space. The homeowner across from Rick also was trapped in his \nhome, which had been flattened by the storm. Power was knocked out for \nroughly 61,000 customers, and some are still waiting for it to be \nrestored.\n  Yesterday, we reached out to Terri Halliday, the mayor of Coal City. \nWe have spoken with Grundy County Board chair David Welter and Lee \nCounty Board chair Rick Ketchum.\n  My staff connected with Sterling mayor Skip Lee and Whiteside County \nBoard chair Jim Duffy about the tornado that struck Sterling. That is \nanother town which is also dealing with flooding. I reached out to each \nof them last night and, not surprisingly, had to leave voice mails. I \nknow they were out and about. But we are there to help them if we can.\n  As is so often the case with disasters such as this, first \nresponders, friends, and family waste no time helping their neighbors. \nIt isn't just a Midwestern thing, but we are pretty proud of it in the \nMidwest. I have no doubt that the people in Coal City, Sublette, \nSterling, and all of the others are going to stand up and help one \nanother clean up, rebuild, and get on with their lives.\n  My thoughts are with the many people today who have lost their homes \nand other property.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish to speak a little bit about an \nagreement that very well could be reached between now and the time that \nthe Senate returns right after the Fourth of July. The agreement has \nbeen negotiated for 2 years now with Iran, although it seems to me that \nusing the term ``negotiation'' is a stretch. As to most of what we said \nwe wanted to achieve in this so-called negotiation, the Iranians have \nsaid they didn't want to achieve it. We seem then to move forward to \nthe next point once we concede that point.\n  Yesterday, I read in press reports that the State Department has now \ndecided it will not demand a full accountability for the past nuclear \nresearch on the part of Iran before they conclude a deal. One of the \nearly statements was: We want to know what Iran did, how long they had \nbeen doing it, what scientists were involved, what material, and what \ninformation they had achieved in their efforts to actually have a \nnuclear weapon.\n  It appears now that we are happy if Iran is just nuclear-weapons \ncapable, with a clock that would start at some time, and we seem to \nfeel we suddenly have a new ability to monitor everything Iran does \neven though we don't appear to have the ability to get them to tell us \nwhat they have done.\n  As I have said before, this is one of the areas where there is no \nquestion that no deal is better than a bad deal.\n  According to the State Department, which recently reported again that \nIran should still be considered a country that encourages terrorism; \nthat, in fact, you can make the case that there is no greater \nencourager of terrorist activities in the world today than Iran--but \nall of those things seem to be off the table as we talk to Iran.\n  The true nature of the regime, and why we want to have an agreement \non just a nuclear program and not all of the other things Iran has \ngoing on, continues to be of great concern to me.\n  The news reports today were that the Iranian Parliament, the Iranian \nlegislature will now finalize legislation demanding that we not be able \nto look at military sites as part of our inspection. If the goal here \nis to stop Iran from having a nuclear capability, having a nuclear \nweapon, having a military capacity to use a nuclear weapon, why would \nwe take military sites off the list of things we are supposed to pay \nattention to? Where would we expect them to be finally developing a \nweapon if not at a military site?\n  The Iranian Parliament appears to have a whole lot more to say about \nthis negotiation than the Senate. In fact, I am afraid we are going to \nfind with the legislation that we did vote on that it is going to be a \nlot easier to prevent disapproval than it would have ever been to get \napproval of this agreement that looks like it is headed toward a very \nbad agreement.\n  The Supreme Leader of Iran has ruled out any long-term freezes of \nnuclear activities and demands that sanctions be lifted immediately. A \nfew weeks ago, when the United States said what our understanding of \nthe framework moving forward would be--it seems to be about 180 degrees \ndifferent from what Iran is announcing every day. They want immediate \nsanctions relief. We say they are only going to get sanctions relief \nwhen they begin to comply. They don't want to have inspections at \nmilitary sites. We say one of the reasons we want to have this \nagreement is so we can ensure that nothing happens at military sites.\n  Meanwhile, Iran advances violence and instability around the world. \nSupported by Iran, Assad in Syria is massacring his own people. So far, \nat least 190,000 Syrians have been killed in what is going on in Syria \ntoday. Iran is supporting that regime. Shiite militias support Assad. \nThey promote division and wage violence outside of Syria, now into \nIraq, encouraged by Iran. Supported by Iran, Houthi rebels have seized \nkey territory in Yemen and seek to overthrow the government.\n  By the way, I remind the President that this was something which less \nthan a year ago President Obama said was a great example of how our \nforeign policy under his leadership was working, that Yemen was an \nexample. Only a few months later, we are fleeing the country and \nclosing our Embassy. Actually, the President may have been right. Maybe \nYemen is a great example of how our foreign policy is working.\n  Hezbollah and Lebanon wage terrorism against Israel, encouraged by \nIran.\n  Palestinian terrorists in Gaza, encouraged by Iran, continue to lob \nmortars and rockets into Israel.\n  Last April, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard stopped a Marshall \nIslands-flagged ship in the Strait of Hormuz.\n  Iran continues to hold hostages without any reasonable charge. Three \nAmerican citizens--Pastor Saeed Abedini, former U.S. marine Amir \nHekmati, and Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian--are being held \nby Iran. A fourth American, former FBI official Robert Levinson, is \nmissing and is in Iran, with no assistance from Iran to find him. In \nfact, they don't know exactly where he is. I have repeatedly called, as \nothers in the Congress have, on the administration to just stop \nnegotiations until there is a show of good faith to let these Americans \ngo.\n  I saw a few days ago that Pastor Abedini was beaten again in the \nprison he has been put in, the most dangerous prison in Iran.\n  How could we not get three people whom they are holding under charges \nthat will not stand up to any public view? How could we allow them to \ncontinue to hold these people while we continue to have talks about \nsomething like letting this country become nuclear capable?\n\n[[Page S4566]]\n\n  Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian was arrested after security \nforces raided his home. His case was referred to a Revolutionary Court \non January 14 of this year, but details of his charges and details of \nhis court date have not been released. His mother is concerned--as we \nall should be--about his health, which is deteriorating as he is being \nimprisoned. Recent reports would suggest that this Washington Post \nreporter is being charged with espionage.\n  Pastor Abedini was imprisoned in September of 2012. In January of \n2013, he was sentenced to 8 years in prison for ``practicing his \nreligion.'' That is his crime--practicing his religion. The Iranian \nGovernment charged that Pastor Abedini was undermining the Iranian \nGovernment by creating a network of Christian house churches and \nattempting to sway Iranian youth away from Islam. In August of 2013, \nhis appeal was denied. He was then put in the worst prison in the \ncountry. He has been beaten up in prison. I think he was beaten in the \nhospital when he had to be taken there, as his life had almost ended \nwith prison beatings. Why do they still have him?\n  Why do they have Amir Hekmati, a former U.S. marine who was arrested \nwhile visiting his family in Iran in August of 2011? The Iranian \nGovernment sentenced him to death for espionage. Fortunately, his death \nsentence was overturned by an appeals court in March of 2012. However, \nhe was still convicted of aiding a hostile nation--that would be us, by \nthe way--and was found guilty of espionage.\n  Bob Levinson, who is a retired DEA and FBI agent, disappeared in \nMarch of 2007 while visiting Iran's Kish Island. It is very likely, \nmany people believe, that Mr. Levinson is currently a prisoner in Iran. \nJust 3 weeks after he disappeared, Iranian state television reported \nthat he was in the hands of Iranian security forces.\n  Why are we assuming that the Iranians will agree to something much \nmore complicated when they will not let these four people go? Why \nwouldn't we insist on that?\n  Finally, Iran is responsible for killing and maiming thousands of \nAmerican service men and women in Iraq and Iran from deadly, armor-\npiercing improvised explosive devices that originated in Iran. They \ndon't deny it. I think they take pride in it.\n  The destabilizing impact of a nuclear weapons-capable Iran is hard to \noverstate. If you want to do one thing to cast a huge shadow over the \nnext decade and perhaps decades of this century--unless that shadow \nsomehow is removed before the end of the decade, it is hard to imagine.\n  Sanctions, with the credible threat of military force, were doing \ngood until we decided we would ease those sanctions if Iran would come \nto the negotiating table. That began 2 years ago. Two years ago we said \nthings we would insist on. Two years later, none of those things appear \nto be things that are still being discussed in these Iranian so-called \nnegotiations.\n  Sanctions should stay in place until Iran fundamentally changes its \ncourse and its behavior.\n  I am greatly concerned that the agreement on Iran's nuclear program \nwill not be presented to the Congress in a way that allows the Congress \nto really weigh in, and I am concerned that this program as it will be \npresented to the Congress will establish Iran as a nuclear-capable, \nnuclear-threshold state. When that happens, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the \nUAE, and Jordan have all stated they will claim the exact same rights \nto do whatever it is we allow Iran to do. If we come up with an \nagreement that says Iran will be within 6 months of having a nuclear \nweapon and that they have to tell us when they start that 6-month \nclock, other countries will also want to be within 6 months of a \nnuclear weapon.\n  If we believe we can monitor Iran within 6 months or 12 months or \nwhatever the number is, I think we are kidding ourselves, and most of \nthe world doesn't believe we can do this either.\n  Turkey and other countries outside of the immediate neighborhood will \nalso want to view nuclear weapons capability as a new status quo in a \ndangerous world.\n  An agreement that doesn't change the terror threat from Iran, an \nagreement that doesn't allow inspection of military facilities, an \nagreement that doesn't disclose past secret research for nuclear \nweapons, an agreement that doesn't ensure long-term inspections, an \nagreement that doesn't maintain sanctions in place until important \ncompliance benchmarks are made is not an agreement that would be good \nenough.\n  We are facing a dangerous time. Iran is one of the chief perpetrators \nof terrorism in the world today. How we let that country that has one \nexample of bad behavior after another, one example of hatred for Israel \nafter another, one example of contempt for the United States after \nanother, how we let that country become nuclear capable is amazing to \nme, as it is to the world. That is why our friends question whether \nthey can depend on the United States of America any longer and why our \nenemies aren't afraid of us, as you would want your enemies to be.\n  I hope we don't settle for a bad deal. I will say again that a bad \ndeal is worse than no deal at all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, last night a number of us from this \nChamber and many of us from across the country gathered for a \nremarkable evening to support and honor an organization called Sandy \nHook Promise. It is an organization that was created in the wake of the \nhorrific, unspeakable tragedy in Newtown that involved the mass murder \nof 20 beautiful, innocent children and 6 great educators. Sandy Hook \nPromise was created to make some good come of this horrific evil, to \nprotect children against violence and prevent more gun violence around \nthe country, to advance the cause of mental health and wellness, and to \nmake sure that no one is alone, no one eats alone, no one suffers \nalone, and no one endures mental illness alone.\n  Sandy Hook Promise is a wonderful, inspiring organization, and I was \nproud to serve as the cochairman of this event, along with my great \ncolleague, Chris Murphy, who has been a partner in efforts to stop gun \nviolence in this Chamber and in Connecticut and around the country. I \nwas also proud that the dinner and evening honored two of our \ncolleagues, Senator Debbie Stabenow, a wonderful friend and \ndistinguished Member of this body from Michigan, and Pat Toomey, our \nfriend from Pennsylvania, who added his name and the weight of his \nsupport to a measure in the last session that seeks to protect children \nagainst gun violence by imposing a universal background check.\n\n  The evening was designed to honor our two colleagues, but it was also \nso inspiring for me to hear from Nicole Hockley, Mark Barden, and Bill \nSherlach, whose lives were transformed and changed forever on that \nhorrific day.\n  I will never forget that day when I arrived at the firehouse in Sandy \nHook and seeing the grief and pain experienced by those families who \nlearned for the first time that their beautiful children would not be \ncoming home that night. The searing memory of their faces and voices \nwill be with me forever. Their courage and strength in the wake of that \ntragedy will inspire me forever.\n  It inspired many of our colleagues to vote for the commonsense, \nsensible measures that Senator Toomey and Senator Manchin of West \nVirginia helped to spearhead. It was a bipartisan package of measures \nthat was advanced and advocated so ably by them and many of us \ntirelessly in those days before the vote. A majority of Senators voted \nin favor of that package of measures. Unfortunately, that majority did \nnot reach 60 votes. But last night was a time to renew and redouble our \nefforts to prevent gun violence and to take positive, constructive, \ncommonsense, sensible steps to help prevent it around the country.\n  At the very outset of the evening, both Senator Murphy and I \nrequested a moment of silence to honor the loved ones and families in \nCharleston, SC. Our hearts and prayers go out to them, as they have \nsince that unimaginable tragedy. It was a violation of not only human \nlife but the sanctity of a place of worship, just as Newtown involved \nthe violation of a place we regard as among the safest, our \nschoolhouse--killing our schoolchildren.\n  When we finished that moment of silence, I am sure all of us retained \nthe\n\n[[Page S4567]]\n\ngrief and pain. We in Connecticut know and understand that grief and \npain and outrage because we remember that day when we felt it in the \nsame way the people of Charleston felt it when nine people were killed. \nTheir families were left with holes in their hearts just as we were on \nthat day in Newtown.\n  But the message of last night was not one of despair or desperation, \nit was one of hope and energy. That message came from Nicole Hockley, \nMark Barden, and Bill Sherlach, the families of the Sandy Hook tragedy \nwho came here to Washington. They have continued their work through \nSandy Hook Promise and other organizations to make some good come from \nthat evil.\n  We can do it. We can make sure this country does more than grieve and \nremember. We need to redouble our commitment as a nation to make our \nNation safer and better, not just for those 9 innocent people in the \nchurch in Charleston or the 26 innocent people in a schoolhouse in \nSandy Hook but for the 11,000 people who are killed every year on the \nstreets of Hartford, New Haven, Stamford, in our rural and suburban \ncommunities, and on our military bases. Every year, 11,000 people \nthroughout our country die from gun violence.\n  We will never eliminate all gun violence. We will never stop all of \nthe deaths and killings, but we can save lives. That is what the \nfamilies of Newtown said to me in the wake of their tragedy, and that \nis what I hope our Nation will say to itself in the wake of the \nCharleston tragedy. We will never stop all evil, but we can take a \nstand and stop some of it.\n  Last night, I recalled the conversation I had with one of the moms \nwhen I was at the funeral of her child. When I approached her, I said, \nsomewhat apprehensively: When you are ready, I would like to talk to \nyou about what we can do together to stop gun violence in this country. \nAnd she said, with tears in her eyes: I am ready now. That was the \nspirit the families from Newtown brought to our Capitol. That is the \nspirit I hope we can honor with action and not just with words on the \nfloor of the Senate or in the eulogies that will be given tomorrow.\n  We need to have an answer for those victims of Charleston and Newtown \nand the 11,000 people who die needlessly and senselessly every year \nfrom gun violence. We need to answer the question that all of us have: \nWhat can we do to stop gun violence? And there are some answers, such \nas background checks, a ban on illegal trafficking, an end to straw \npurchases, mental health initiatives, and school safety. Those are some \nanswers, and we should think of other solutions. We need to work \ntogether, just as Sandy Hook Promise has done, regardless of party, \nrace or religion, where we live or what our interest is because we have \na common, shared interest in making our Nation safer and better.\n  That is why honoring both Pat Toomey and Debbie Stabenow was so \nmeaningful, because they have given so much with their courage and \nleadership and have helped to make our Nation safer and better.\n  The killer in Charleston was not just a murderer, he was a domestic \nterrorist. He meant to terrify, not just kill. He meant to start a race \nwar. He was a racist and White supremacist, and, rightly, has been \nregarded as someone who came to that church not just to target innocent \nworshippers but an entire community. He targeted the town of \nCharleston, the State of South Carolina, and our Nation. His message \nwas not about hate for specific individuals, it was hate for an entire \nrace.\n  We should recognize domestic terrorism and racism for what it is. We \nare not the only country with racists, but we are a country with a \nuniquely high number of gun violence incidents.\n  The shooting in Charleston was a physical manifestation of ideas that \ngo beyond this murderer. To prevent future shootings, we must \nunderstand and undercut the ideas for which he killed so he could \nadvance. We need to call this problem for what it is and understand it \nand fight it. Hate-inspired domestic terrorism is an evil all its own.\n  We can make progress against gun violence. We know we can, just as \nsurely as 10 days ago no one thought the Confederate flag on State \ngrounds in South Carolina would ever be removed. No one ever thought, \nplausibly, that the Governor of South Carolina would ever advocate it, \nand now that has happened, just as commonsense, sensible measures \nagainst gun violence can happen. We can prevail. Nobody thought before \nRonald Reagan was almost assassinated and Jim Brady was paralyzed that \nthe Brady bill would ever be passed. In fact, it took 10 years.\n  So we are here in a marathon, not a sprint. We are here for the long \nhaul. We are not going away, not giving up, not abandoning this fight, \nand not surrendering to the forces of domestic terrorism or racial \nhatred or gun violence. We are better than that as a nation.\n  As we leave and go back home for this recess, I hope we will not only \nshare the grief and pain of those brave and courageous families in \nSouth Carolina who were so heroic in the face of evil but resolve that \nwe will redouble our efforts to raise awareness and organize people who \nare of good will and want to stop gun violence and who need to be heard \nbecause the vast majority of the American people want us to take \ncommonsense, sensible measures to make America safer and better.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, today, I am back on the floor of the Senate \nfor the 15th installment of the waste of the week. We all know the debt \nclock is ticking and that the Federal Government is racking up \ntrillions of dollars of debt, which will have to be paid off at some \npoint in the future by our generation and more likely our children and \nour grandchildren.\n  It is unsustainable. It is going to cause immense harm. It is \nsomething that has been ignored as of late, but we are unable to move \nforward with any kind of constructive solution to this problem or \nputting us on a path to deal with this because the President of the \nUnited States simply refuses to come to an agreement in terms of how to \ndeal with this and, in fact, doesn't even bother to mention it.\n  We also have an issue that is part of the problem; that is, an \ninefficient, ineffective use of taxpayer money here in Washington. The \nmoney that was hard-earned by the people back home and then deducted \nfrom their payroll income and sent to the Federal Government. It is not \nalways used in an effective, efficient way to address the necessary and \nessential issues the Federal Government deals with and that we talk \nabout here every day. Instead, it goes into programs that can only be \ndeemed as waste, fraud, and abuse, and that is what I have been trying \nto highlight for the past 15 weeks as we deal with the waste of the \nweek.\n  Today, what I would like to talk about is a sweet deal. Everyone \nlikes a sweet deal, right? Well, no, not quite everyone and not always. \nBut, unfortunately, in this case what is a sweet deal for some is \nactually a raw deal for the American taxpayer. I am talking about the \nsugar subsidy.\n  Currently, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the USDA, issues loans \nto sugar producers and allows them to repay those loans with raw sugar \nif sugar prices fall below a certain price. After obtaining the sugar \nthrough this so-called loan, the USDA ends up with a bunch of sugar \nthat it needs to resell, and it resells that sugar at a discounted \nprice. As a result, these loans function as a price support for sugar, \nensuring that sugar producers never sell their product below the price \ndetermined by the government--not the fair market but by the \ngovernment. This cost taxpayers nearly $300 million in 2013 alone. I \ndon't have the figures yet for 2014. I assume that they are the same or \nthat they may have fluctuated a little bit up or down, depending on the \nworld sugar price.\n\n  If this sweet loan deal for sugar producers isn't enough--$300 \nmillion a year in cost--there is more. In addition to providing a \nsubsidy to sugar producers through the program I just described, the \nFederal Government also enforces a system of quotas and tariffs on \nimported sugar, thereby blocking Americans' fair-market access to \ncheaper sugar and resulting in a large difference between the \ninternational or global price of sugar and domestic sugar prices. In \nfact, the USDA's sugar program has caused the price of American sugar \nto be about 40 percent higher than the global price, resulting in an\n\n[[Page S4568]]\n\nestimated cost to consumers of $3.5 billion annually between the years \n2009 and 2012.\n  So when we take these two programs and put them together, they \neffectively function as a mass Federal subsidy of sugar, which drives \nup prices for consumers and provides a double benefit to the sugar \nindustry.\n  As a result of these two sweet policies, thousands of jobs in sugar-\nusing industries, particularly candy manufacturers, have been lost, and \nthe American taxpayer pays for it all.\n  Now, why were these policies put in place in the first place? Well, \nthe global price of sugar was much higher in the early 1980s. So the \nidea was that higher sugar prices would result in more sugar growers, \nand the more sugar growers we had, the more sugar would be produced, \nthus lowering the price. That is how fair and free markets work. It is \na supply-and-demand issue. But government interference through \nsubsidies distorts the free-market price of goods, and in the case of \nsugar, it results in a direct hit to the taxpayer and much higher costs \nfor the consumer of sugar-based products.\n  To this day, the sugar subsidy remains a giveaway to sugar producers \nand a raw deal for sugar consumers. Ice cream, doughnuts, cakes, pies--\nwe know they are not the healthiest foods to eat, but they are some of \nthe more desirable foods that we like to eat, particularly after we \nhave been forced to eat broccoli and greens. Our mothers raised us \nsaying that you can't have ice cream or cake or pie after dinner unless \nyou eat what is on your plate. And so we should suffer through eating \nsome of that green stuff--I don't mean to belittle that, it is healthy \nand we should do that, but I'm not going to tell the public what to \neat. Nevertheless, it is these products and many others that \nincorporate the cost of sugar in making the product that drive up the \nprice of the product simply because of the subsidies that are provided \nby this government through its policies to sugar producers.\n  The end result is companies not being able to provide the jobs they \nwould like to provide or to be the dynamic industry they would like to \nbe, and that puts them in a less than competitive position against our \noverseas producers. Many companies in my home State of Indiana have \nbeen affected by this subsidy. Let me give a couple of examples.\n  The Albanese Confectionery Group, Inc., is a renowned Indiana-based \nmanufacturer of confections, including the World's Best Gummi Bears--in \nGermany they call them Gooies; here we call them Gummis--Gold Label \nChocolates, and other products. They are a very successful \nmanufacturer. They estimate they could save $3 million annually by \nhaving access to sugar from the world market price. But, no, they are \nnot allowed to do that. They are forced to buy it at the U.S.-\nsubsidized producer price, which is, as I indicated earlier, roughly 40 \npercent more than what they could otherwise pay.\n  Lewis Bakeries is headquartered in Evansville, IN, and is one of the \nfew remaining independent bakeries in the Midwest and the largest \nwholesale bakery in Indiana, and they have the same issue.\n  Artificially high sugar prices contribute directly to increased costs \nthat hamstring budgets of businesses such as Lewis Bakeries and other \nbakeries throughout Indiana.\n  Artificially high sugar prices affect the large companies also, such \nas Kraft Foods. It has a marshmallow and caramel plant in Kendallville, \nIN. They say that dismantling the sugar program would enhance the \ncompetitiveness of U.S. food manufacturers.\n  If Congress were to terminate the sugar subsidy program, which we \nhave tried to do year after year after year and have not succeeded in \npassing it, we could save billions of dollars for U.S. taxpayers, not \njust from the U.S. Treasury but also in the grocery bills of American \nfamilies. These savings could have extremely positive consequences for \nour economy if they were allowed to be used to support the economy.\n  According to an Iowa State University study, if the sugar program \nwere abolished, domestic sugar prices would fall by roughly a third--\nearlier we were talking about 40 percent--saving consumers, said this \nstudy, at least $2.9 billion to $3.5 billion a year. And according to a \nrecent report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, \neliminating this subsidy could save the Federal Government at least \n$116 million over 10 years.\n  So here we have a subsidized program by the Federal Government that \nis costing consumers billions per year. And here we have a second \nsubsidized program by the Federal Government that through its policies \nof pricing and unfair practices, in my opinion, is costing nearly $116 \nmillion a year to American taxpayers. This is a perfect example of an \noutdated government program that is hurting consumers and wasting \ntaxpayer dollars. The net effect of the program is that Americans are \npaying higher prices for sugar and more taxes to pay for the sugar \nsubsidy.\n  So what is a sweet deal for the sugar producers is a raw deal for the \nAmerican consumer. It is a subsidy--a package of subsidies that only go \nto the producers and deny the consumers the right to have reasonable \nprices for sugar in accordance with international pricing.\n  I have joined with a bipartisan group of my colleagues in supporting \nlegislation, the Sugar Reform Act, introduced by Senator Shaheen from \nNew Hampshire, that would end the sugar subsidy. If we could pass this \nlegislation, it would result in a savings of at least $116 million, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  So today I add to our chart $116 million of savings that the \ngovernment can claim, moving our chart ever closer to our goal of $100 \nbillion of savings.\n  How do we pay for some essential programs here, and where are we \ngoing to get the money? Why don't we start here? Why don't we start by \neliminating some of these programs? Better yet, why don't we let the \ntaxpayers keep their hard-earned money rather than send it to \nWashington to pay for waste and abuse that occurs almost on a daily \nbasis.\n  We are gradually creeping up to our $100 billion goal. I think we are \ngoing to have to go way beyond that, because these examples just keep \nrolling in. They are documented through nonpartisan agencies related to \nCongress and related to the Federal Government, including inspectors \ngeneral and various programs. Why are we spending this money in the \nfirst place? The program is wasted, it is abused, and it is misused. It \ndoesn't need to be in place.\n  So we are going to keep coming to the floor week after week talking \nabout the waste of the week. No. 16 is on the way. Stay tuned.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, in just a short period of time here in \nthe Senate Chamber we will be voting on fast-track legislation designed \nto create a very quick path through the Senate for the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership and for trade agreements to come thereafter.\n  So I rise now to share with my colleagues and to share with the \nAmerican people my concerns about this course of action. It is \nPresident Kennedy who once said: ``The trade of a nation expresses, in \na very concrete way, its aims and aspirations.'' What are our aims and \naspirations in the context of this trade agreement and fast-track?\n  From my perspective, the thing that really matters is whether this \ntrade agreement will create good-paying jobs or will destroy good-\npaying jobs. Will this trade agreement make the American economy work \nbetter for working Americans? I feel it fails the test. I am going to \nexplain why.\n  Now, it is true that the trade agreement is complex. It is \nmultidimensional. It has a dimension that deals with intellectual \nproperty, with the extension of copyrights and patents and protections \nfor trade secrets. That is certainly a win for protecting an innovation \neconomy and innovation by Americans and American companies.\n  It has an agricultural section. We have sought out an analysis of the \nagricultural section, but don't have one yet. But those in the know say \nthere is a good chance that the tariffs that are\n\n[[Page S4569]]\n\nstruck down and the nontariff barriers that are struck down as barriers \nto U.S. products may on balance benefit the U.S. agricultural economy. \nI look forward to an analysis to really examine that in detail.\n  But the heart of the trade agreement is about manufacturing. We have \nmultinational companies that are seeking to be able to make things at \nthe lowest possible cost. That is the heart of this trade agreement, as \nwith other trade agreements. That means being able to incorporate into \nan economic circle countries where the costs are very low to make \nthings. That is certainly the case with this trade agreement.\n  This trade agreement includes a couple of countries that have no \nminimum wage and others that have a very low minimum wage. We are \nreally talking about Vietnam, Malaysia, and Mexico. In Vietnam they \nhave a regional minimum wage. So it varies from place to place. You \nhear different amounts, but roughly it is 60 to 75 cents per hour. In \nMalaysia it is $1.54. In Mexico it is 66 cents. Well, those are all \nincredibly low compared to the American minimum wage of $7.25.\n  Of course, many of our States have State minimum wages that are \nhigher. But the minimum wage is only a part of the puzzle. When you \ninclude the cost of labor in the United States, you have to include \nsuch things as workers' compensation and set aside expenses for Social \nSecurity and disability insurance and the cost of maintaining safe \nworking standards, which are rigorously enforced.\n  So when you compare all of that, you probably have a labor ratio that \nis on the order of about 20 to 1. That is a playing field tilted \nagainst the American worker at a 20-to-1 ratio for manufacturing. That \nis certainly not a level playing field. Our companies will say time and \nagain: Here in America, we will thrive with anyone in the world on a \nlevel playing field. But when the costs are 20 to 1--that is, when the \ncosts overseas in countries such as Vietnam, Malaysia, and Mexico are \nlower than in the United States on a 20-to-1 ratio--that is a playing \nfield steeply tilted against the United States.\n  So it is no wonder that in previous agreements we have seen an \nincrease in trade deficits and a big loss of jobs here in the United \nStates of America. Let's take a look at three of those cases.\n  In 1993, we signed the North America Free Trade Agreement. That \nincorporated Mexico into our economic circle. So let's compare the \ntrade deficit in 1992, a year before, with 2014. In the course of those \nyears, the trade deficit increased from $5.3 billion to $53.8 billion. \nThat is a massive, massive change. Now, by various estimates that \ntranslates into a job loss of between 480,000 to 680,000 jobs. So half \na million Americans lost good-paying jobs as a result of NAFTA.\n  Let's take a look at China. China came into the World Trade \nOrganization, or WTO, in the year 2000. So let's compare 1999 with \n2014. The trade deficit went from $68.7 billion to $343 billion. That \nis an increase of one-quarter of a trillion dollars. That is not a \ncollective amount. That is an annual amount. By various estimates that \nresulted in job losses of between 2.7 million and 3.2 million American \njobs.\n  Or let's look at South Korea. Remember how folks said that this would \nfacilitate so much access to consumers in South Korea, and it would not \nhave a big impact on our trade deficit? The South Korea agreement was \nsigned in 2011 or ratified. So comparing 2010 to 2014--just 4 years--\nthe trade deficit ballooned. It ballooned from $10 billion to $25 \nbillion. The resulting job losses are estimated to have been between \n75,000 and 150,000 jobs. Now, when I say jobs, maybe that is abstract. \nSo let's translate this to families. Between the low estimates and the \nhigh estimates, we are talking about 3.3 to 4 million American families \nlosing their jobs--good-paying manufacturing jobs. You know, there is \nno better foundation for a family than a good-paying job.\n  So when we pull away that foundation by striking agreements that send \nour jobs overseas, that is utterly devastating to families across our \nNation and certainly to families in my home State of Oregon and \ncertainly to families in every single State. So you cannot be pro-\nfamily and also be for shipping our good-paying jobs overseas. There is \nno government program that substitutes for a good-paying job.\n  That is why I am so deeply disturbed about the outline of the \nagreement that we are undertaking. Each and every time that \nimprovements to wages here in the U.S. come up, the makers will say: If \nyou raise your wages, if you add family vacation or family leave or \nsick leave or medical leave or help with daycare for your children--you \nknow what--we may just have to move our manufacturing overseas or we \nmay have to move our supply chain overseas or we may have to produce \nless at the factory here and more at the factory overseas.\n  It does not stop there. The construction that is envisioned by our \nmultinational manufacturers in pursuit of their low-cost production is \nnot just to play off the United States against Malaysia or the United \nStates against Mexico or the United States against Vietnam--although \nall of that will happen--it is also to play off each of those low-cost \ncountries against each of them.\n  So they can say to China, which has a certain cost structure and is \nnot yet envisioned to be part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership but does \nbenefit from WTO access: China, your costs are going up. Oh, you are \nenforcing those environmental laws, and your costs are going up. Oh, \nyou are adding health standards, labor standards, and your costs are \ngoing up. You are paying overtime, and your costs are going up. We are \ngoing to shift more of our manufacturing to Malaysia, and if you keep \nat it, we will shift all of it.\n  Or to Malaysia: You are just close by to Vietnam. Your costs go up, \nand we are going to ship more to Vietnam.\n  Or to Vietnam: You raise your standards, you raise your costs, you \nraise your pay, and you raise your standard of living. So we are going \nto move those jobs to Mexico.\n  This is tremendous leverage if you are an owner of a multinational, \nif you own stock in a multinational, if you are an investor in a \nmultinational, because you can sell--you can produce your product at \nlower costs by playing off economy against economy--at the world market \nprice and you make more money.\n  But if you are a worker in the United States who is being played \nagainst a worker in Vietnam, it is a bad deal. If you are a worker in \nVietnam being played off against a worker in Malaysia, it is a bad \ndeal.\n  That is not all that is wrong with this arrangement. Let's look at \nthe various things that could have made fast-track stronger and that \nare not in fast-track. We have heard a lot of conversation and a lot of \npresentation that this is a gold-standard framework, that this is a new \nstyle of trade agreement. But the fact is that key provisions that \ncould have made it a gold standard or a new strategy are not there.\n  Let's start with the fact that there is no minimum wage required in \nthis agreement--not even a minimum wage of $1 an hour, which would have \ncertainly affected Mexico or Vietnam--and no mechanism for where there \nis a minimum wage, to increase it gradually over time to help lift up \nworkers in our poorest nations and to reduce the gap and level out the \nplaying field between low-wage countries and high-wage countries such \nas the United States.\n  Second, the agreement does not address currency manipulation. \nEveryone in international trade understands that tariffs can be \nreplaced by a pseudo-tariff through currency manipulation, through \nintervention in the currency market. In 2009, when I came to the \nSenate, our Congress estimated that the currency manipulation by China \namounted to a 25-percent tariff on American products and a 25-percent \nsubsidy to Chinese products. Why would we agree to an arrangement where \ncurrency manipulation can produce a tariff against our products and a \nsubsidy to our competitors within that framework?\n  Third, we have had a problem with the loss of our sovereignty on \nhealth issues, environmental issues, and consumer issues by giving that \nsovereignty away and that decisionmaking away to an international \npanel. Just weeks ago, under the World Trade Organization structure--\nthe WTO structure--we lost a case, and the outcome of that case was \nthat here in America we are not allowed to label our meat ``Produced in \nAmerica.''\n\n[[Page S4570]]\n\n  That is a loss of our sovereignty. I want to live in an America where \nif our consumers, if our policymakers, if our legislators believe it is \nin the best interest of this Nation for our consumers to be able to \nknow where their meat is raised, if our consumers want to exercise some \npatriotic decisionmaking and support American ranchers, they ought to \nbe able to do so. We ought to be able to have that law and not give \naway our lawmaking authority to an international panel.\n  So this is an investor-state dispute settlement panel of three \ncorporate lawyers, who can be advocates in one case and the judges in \nthe next. It does not provide anything close to an appropriate \nmechanism to decide issues of health, safety, and the environment. We \ncould have taken those off the table so that if we wanted to control a \ndangerous environmental toxin such as cancer-causing flame retardants \nin our carpets, we could do so without going afoul of trade agreements.\n  But there was no effort to protect our health and safety here in \nAmerica in this trade agreement. If we really believed that we were \ngoing to have a new-order agreement, we would have an enforcement \nmechanism for labor standards and for environmental standards. We have \nheard folks talk on the floor that there are such new enforcement \nstandards. So I am aggrieved to report to you that that is simply not \nthe case.\n  Now, let's start with the fact that we could have required the \npassage of laws before countries are admitted into the trade agreement \nand required that they bring their environmental standards, their legal \nstandards, and their labor standards up to snuff before admission and \nthen show that they were actually implementing them and have a 2-year \ndemonstration period to show that they were actually enforcing \nthem. Because that is the easiest point at which to bring nations \naccountable before they are members of the trade agreement, before they \nget the lower tariffs. That is the point you have incentive. That is \nthe point you have leverage. But there was no effort to force \ncountries, to require countries to meet those minimum standards before \nbeing admitted into this trade agreement.\n\n  We could have had some form of snapback provision that said: If you \nfail in bringing your laws into accordance on the environmental side or \nthe labor side, if you fail to enforce your laws, then tariffs snap \nback. But there is no snapback provision in this agreement.\n  We could have expanded the dumping provisions in international law to \ngive a way to take on situations where countries are producing at low \ncost because they are not abiding by the goals in the environmental or \nthe labor area, but there is no such provision envisioned or required \nin fast-track or anticipated in the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  In the course of our trade agreements, there has been only one \nsituation where we challenged labor laws, and it was with Guatemala. We \nchallenged them 7 years ago, and to date that case has never been \nadjudicated. It is virtually impossible, after a country has failed to \ncome up to standards, to go back and retroactively enforce those \nstandards without some new mechanism, some new strategy. But there is \nno new mechanism or strategy that applies in this situation, nothing \nthat would solve the Guatamala case and actually end with it being \nadjudicated.\n  To continue with the challenges to this fast-track, the failures of \nthis fast-track, there is nothing in this that provides for Congress to \nbe consulted when other nations dock; that is, tie on to the framework \nthat will exist in the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  We had an amendment here on the floor that if China was to try to \ndock with the TPP and become a TPP fully privileged member, it would \nhave to come back to the United States for consideration. That would \ngive us a chance to look at China's currency manipulation or China's \ncheating on international intellectual property. That would give us a \nchance to examine a whole facet of things. But no requirement like that \nexists.\n  To add on to everything else, now, because of the way this process \nhas proceeded, there is no guarantee that there will be trade \nadjustment assistance for families who lose their jobs when their jobs \ngo overseas, no assistance in training.\n  I find it absurd that the same folks who say that there will be \nvirtually no jobs lost proceed to say that the cost of compensating \nfamilies by giving some minimal training to them when they lose their \njobs will be vastly expensive and that America can't afford it. So on \nthe one hand they say there will be no jobs lost. On the other hand \nthey say that so many jobs will be lost that it will be too expensive \nfor our Nation to afford. So they are OK with leaving American families \nnot only stranded without jobs but stranded with no training to try to \nfind new jobs in the economy.\n  If we go back to where I started with President Kennedy and his \nvision that the trade of a nation expresses in a concrete way its aims \nand aspirations, our aim should be to create good-paying jobs here in \nAmerica. Our aspiration should be to create a trade agreement that \nworks for working families. Unfortunately, this trade agreement is \nconstructed around a different aspiration, one of maximizing the value \nof stock in the multinational manufacturing corporations, and that is \ndone by shipping our jobs overseas. That is the wrong aim for this \nNation. That is the wrong aim for our working families. We have seen \nthe impact of Korea. We have seen the impact of China joining the WTO. \nWe have seen the impact of Mexico and NAFTA. As a result, we have lost \nmillions of good-paying jobs in our Nation and undermined the success \nof millions of American families.\n  There is a lot of conversation on the floor of the Senate about \ninequality in our Nation. Do you know what drives inequality? Well, I \nwill tell you. It is this: When you create trade agreements that are \ngreat for investors but are terrible for workers, that drives \ninequality. That is why I encourage my colleagues to vote no when it \ncomes to the fast-track legislation being voted on later today. It is \nwrong for America because it is wrong as far as solving inequality. It \nis wrong for America because it is wrong for working families to have \ntheir jobs shipped overseas. It is wrong because it does not fulfill \nthe vision of working for working Americans.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am on the floor today for the 104th \ntime--one of these days, I am going to get it right--to urge that we \nwake up to the dangers of climate change.\n  The scientific community has been sounding the alarm for decades. Our \nmost respected scientific institutions are virtually unanimous in their \nverdict: Carbon pollution from humans' burning of fossil fuels is \nwarming our atmosphere and oceans, raising and acidifying our seas, \nloading the dice for more extreme weather, and disrupting the natural \nsystems upon which we all depend. They are not alone.\n  Our defense and intelligence communities warn us of the threats these \nclimate disruptions pose to our national security and to international \nstability.\n  Public health officials warn that greenhouse gas pollution and its \neffects trigger human health risks.\n  Economists--even very conservative ones--have long recognized the \ndistortion of energy markets ignoring the true cost of carbon \npollution.\n  Our government's accountants now list climate change as one of the \nmost significant threats to America's fiscal stability. The new \nRepublican CBO chief even put sea level rise and increased storm \nactivity from climate change into his budget outlook just last week.\n  Of course, voices of faith call to us. They plead that we heed the \nmoral imperatives of protecting God's creation, seeking justice for all \npeople, and meeting our own responsibilities to future generations.\n  His Holiness the Dalai Lama has called for us to ``develop a sense of \nthe oneness of humanity'' and address climate change.\n  The Archbishop of Canterbury recently issued a declaration, along \nwith other British religious leaders, warning of the ``huge challenge'' \nof climate change and supporting an international climate treaty to be \nnegotiated in Paris this December.\n\n[[Page S4571]]\n\n  Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of Orthodox \nChristians worldwide, has called climate change ``a matter of social \nand economic justice.''\n  More than 350 rabbis have signed a rabbinic letter on the climate \ncrisis calling for vigorous action against climate disruption and \nglobal socioeconomic injustice, reminding us that ``social justice, \nsustainable abundance, a healthy Earth, and spiritual fulfillment are \ninseparable.''\n  Last week, Pope Francis, the worldwide leader of the Catholic Church, \nwhich is the largest Christian denomination in the world, the largest \nChristian denomination in the United States, and the largest Christian \ndenomination in my home State of Rhode Island, added his charismatic \nvoice to the call.\n  In the Roman Catholic Church, an encyclical is a papal letter sent to \nall bishops. It is considered among the most authoritative documents of \nCatholic teaching. Rather than just an internal communication to the \nclergy, however, this encyclical of Pope Francis on climate change is \nexplicitly addressed to ``every single living person on this planet.'' \nIt is entitled ``Laudato Si','' or ``Praise Be to You,'' a reference to \nthe ``Canticle of the Sun'' by St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint \nof the environment, friend of the poor, and namesake of this Pope.\n  This encyclical accepts and affirms what we know about climate \nchange: that most is due to the greenhouse gases emitted by human \nactivity; that seas are rising, oceans acidifying, polar ice melting; \nthat weather is worsening at the extremes; and that basic systems of \nlife on our planet home are being disrupted.\n  He writes:\n\n       [W]e need only take a frank look at the facts to see that \n     our common home is falling into serious disrepair. . . . \n     [T]hings are now reaching a breaking point. . . . [H]umanity \n     has disappointed God's expectations.\n\n  The Earth herself, he says, ``groans in travail.''\n  Pope Francis tells us that ``humanity is called to recognize the need \nfor changes of lifestyle, production, and consumption, in order to \ncombat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or \naggravate it.'' Specifically, he says that ``technology based on the \nuse of highly polluting fossil fuels needs to be progressively replaced \nwithout delay.''\n  The Pope reminds us that as we in power sleepwalk through this \ncrisis, we are hurting people who have no voice today. First, we harm \nfuture generations, leaving them a world that, to use his own words, \n``is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth.''\n  ``[T]he world is a gift which we have freely received and must share \nwith others,'' the Pope writes. ``Intergenerational solidarity is not \noptional, but rather a basic question of justice.''\n  The Pope also emphasizes that when we damage that gift, we inflict \nparticular harm on the poor, who live close to the Earth--outside of \nour privileged bubble of consumption. They rely on agriculture, \nfishing, and forestry for their livelihoods and sustenance. As climate \nchange disrupts natural systems, the poor take the hit most directly. \nAs a result, Pope Francis says, we who have profited most from burning \nfossil fuels owe a debt to the rest of the world. He calls it our \n``ecological debt.''\n  The United States has produced more carbon dioxide than any other \nnation. Our historical responsibility calls us to help other nations \ndevelop cleaner energy, relieve their systematized poverty, and soften \nthe blow of climate change. This responsibility, this call from Pope \nFrancis matters particularly for America, the indispensable and the \nexceptional nation. Years ago, Daniel Webster described the work of our \nFounding Fathers as having ``set the world an example.'' From John \nWinthrop to Ronald Reagan, we have called ourselves a city on a hill, \nset high for the world to witness, to emulate.\n  Should we ignore the climate disruption we have caused, Pope Francis \nwarns, ``those who will have to suffer the consequences of what we are \ntrying to hide will not forget this failure of conscience and \nresponsibility.'' In saying that, Pope Francis aligns squarely with \nDaniel Webster's warning from that same speech--his warning about our \nAmerican experiment in popular liberty: ``The last hopes of mankind, \ntherefore, rest with us; and if it should be proclaimed that our \nexample had become an argument against the experiment, the knell of \npopular liberty would be sounded throughout the earth.''\n\n  Pope Francis's encyclical even has something to say directly to us in \nCongress. He says:\n\n       To take up these responsibilities, and the costs they \n     entail, politicians will inevitably clash with the mindset of \n     short-term gain and results which dominates present-day \n     economics and politics. But if they are courageous, they will \n     attest to their God-given dignity and leave behind a \n     testimony of selfless responsibility.\n\n  Remember the Pharisees. Remember the traders and the money changers \nin the temple. If we choose to ignore the call of the Pope and of \nleaders of faith around the world and choose to protect the side that \nis polluting and destroying, even when we see right before our faces \nits ravage of our natural world, its harm to the poor, its robbery of \nfuture generations, what are we then? What are we then? Jesus himself, \nthe Lamb of God, lost his temper twice, the Bible tells us; once at the \nPharisees and once at the traders and money changers in the temple. He \nwent after them with a lash, actually. Are we to take their side now? \nMust we, in the Senate, serve Caesar in every single thing? Is there no \nlight left here at all?\n  Here in the Senate, the hand of greed lies so heavily upon us. \nPlease, may the Pope's exhortation give us the courage to stand up \nagainst the power of these selfish forces and do what is right for our \npeople and for our planet.\n  The fossil fuel industry has been a particular disgrace, polluting \nour politics as well as our planet. Ever since the Citizens United \nruling gave polluters the ability to inject unlimited and untold \namounts of money into our elections, the tsunami of their slime has \ndrowned honest debate on climate change. Senators who once supported \ncommonsense legislation have gone silent as stones under the threat of \nthe polluters' spending. Getting past the dark influence of the fossil \nfuel industry will indeed take some light and some courage, especially \non the part of the Republican majority whom they so relentlessly bully \nand cajole. But we must do it. Again, mankind will not forget this \nfailure of conscience and responsibility.\n  Senator Schatz and I have even offered legislation rooted in \nconservative free-market principles. We would put a fee on carbon \npollution and return all the revenue to the American people. It would \nreduce carbon pollution 40 percent by 2025 and be a significant \ndownpayment on our ecological debt to the world and, by the way, it \nwould generate significant tax cuts and economic benefits for American \nfamilies and businesses in the process. I urge friends across the \naisle, please, take a serious look at our bill.\n  In seeking a solution to the climate crisis, Pope Francis asks each \nof us to ``draw constantly from [our] deepest convictions about love, \njustice, and peace.'' He dares us even ``to turn what is happening to \nthe world into our own personal suffering''--into our own personal \nsuffering--``and thus discover what each of us can do about it.'' He \nurges us to recognize the systems around us--the financial systems, the \nindustrial systems, the economic systems, the political systems--are \ndrawing us down a destructive and unjust path.\n  But his encyclical to the world illuminates another path--a \ncompassionate path, blazed with abiding faith in the human family, a \npath toward the preservation of our common home and our common decency. \nThe choice of which path we take will be a fateful one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, let me just \ncommend the Senator from Rhode Island. He has made a number of \nimportant points this afternoon, but I am particularly pleased my \ncolleague has laid out, in such a thoughtful way, the implications of \nthe Pope's encyclical. This was very important as a major new focus of \nthe debate, and I really commend my colleague.\n  I suspect we are now on 101 or 102--oh, 104. I was there for 100, so \nI must have missed one along the way. But I\n\n[[Page S4572]]\n\ncommend my colleague and thank him for his commitment. He knows I share \nmany of his views with respect to creating a fresh set of approaches to \ndeal with this climate change question, and I look forward to working \nwith him.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator very kindly.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today the Senate is taking major steps \ntoward a new, more progressive trade policy that will shut the door on \nthe 1990s North American Free Trade Agreement once and for all.\n  One of the major ways this overall package accomplishes this goal is \nby kicking our trade enforcement into high gear. Later today, the \nSenate is going to vote to go to conference with the House on strong \nbipartisan legislation that was passed by the Chamber only a few weeks \nago by a vote of 78 to 20.\n  It has long been my view that vigorous enforcement of our trade laws \nmust be at the forefront of any modern approach to trade at this unique \ntime in history. One of the first questions many citizens ask is, I \nhear there is talk in Washington, DC, about passing a new trade law. \nHow about first enforcing the laws that are on the books?\n  This has been an area I long have sought to change, and we are \nbeginning to do this with this legislation and I want to describe it. \nFor me, this goes back to the days when I chaired the Senate's \nSubcommittee on International Trade and Competitiveness. We saw such \nwidespread cheating, such widespread flouting of our trade laws, my \nstaff and I set up a sting operation. We set up a sting operation to \ncatch the cheats; in effect, almost inviting these people to try to use \na Web site to evade the laws. They came out of nowhere because they \nsaid: Hey, cheating has gotten pretty easy. Let's sign up. And we \ncaught a lot of people.\n  So we said, from that point on, that we were going to make sure any \nnew trade legislation took, right at the center, an approach that would \nprotect hard-working Americans from the misdeeds of trade cheats. In \nfact, the core of the bipartisan legislation that heads into conference \nis a jobs bill--a jobs bill that will protect American workers and our \nexporters from those kinds of rip-offs by those who would flout the \ntrade laws.\n  The fact is, when you finally get tough enforcement of our trade \nlaws, it is a jobs bill--a true jobs bill--because you are doing a \nbetter job of enforcing the laws that protect the good-paying jobs of \nAmerican workers.\n  I guess some people think we are going to get that tougher \nenforcement by osmosis. We are going to get it because we are going to \npass a law, starting today with the conference agreement that is going \nto have real teeth in it--real teeth in it--to enforce our trade laws.\n  Foreign companies and nations employ a whole host of complicated \nschemes and shadowy tactics to break the trade rules, and they bully \nAmerican businesses and undercut our workers. So what we said in the \nFinance Committee, on a bipartisan basis, is the name of the game will \nbe to stay out in front of these unfair trade practices that cost our \nworkers good-paying jobs. My colleagues and I believe the Senate has \noffered now the right plan to fight back against the trade cheats and \nprotect American jobs and protect our companies from abuse.\n  It really starts with what is called the ENFORCE Act, which is a \nproposal I first offered years ago that will give our Customs agency \nmore tools to crack down on the cheaters. Then, we have a bipartisan, \nbicameral agreement on the need for an unfair trade alert. That is \nanother major upgrade that responds to what we heard companies and \nlabor folks say again and again. What they would say is that trade \nenforcement laws get there too late. They get there too late. The plant \nis closed, the jobs are gone, the hopes and dreams of working families \nare shattered. So what we said is we are going to start using some of \nthe data and the information we have to have a real trade alert so we \ncan spot what is coming up and get that information to our communities \nand our working families and our companies to protect our workers. So \nthis unfair trade alert is another major upgrade in how we tackle \nenforcing our trade laws.\n  My view is that any bill that comes out of that enforcement \nconference, the Customs conference, needs to reflect important American \npriorities, and that should certainly include smart protection of our \nenvironmental treasures. When our trade agreements establish rules on \nenvironmental protection, they have to be enforced with the same vigor \nas the rules that knock down barriers for businesses overseas.\n  Our colleague from Colorado Senator Bennet offered, in my view, a \nvery constructive proposal that is going to accomplish this important \ngoal. It was overwhelmingly agreed to by the Committee on Finance and \npassed by the Senate, and I would like to note that much of the good \nwork done by Senator Bennet mirrors what my colleague in the other \nbody, Congressman Blumenauer, is doing on this issue as well.\n  It is my view--and why it was important to hear from Senator \nWhitehouse--that climate change is one of the premier challenges of our \ntime. It is critical to make sure this enforcement package sends the \nright message on environmental issues. Whether the issue at hand is \nclimate change, fisheries or conservation, this package--the package we \nare going to be dealing with in the Customs conference--strikes the \nright balance for the environment.\n  I also want to take a moment to build on what I discussed yesterday \nwith respect to the Democratic priorities that my colleagues and I are \ngoing to fight for in conference. This stems from an important point \nmade by our colleague from North Dakota Senator Heitkamp, who said we \nreally need to go into this Customs conference with some markers--some \nstrong markers that lay out a path for some of our priorities with \nrespect to enforcing the Customs law.\n  So after the pro-trade Democrats met on Monday night, I talked with \nChairman Ryan with respect to these issues. We intend to champion \nprovisions by Senator Shaheen which will help our small businesses take \nfull advantage of trade. A lot of people say, oh, trade bills are for \nthe big guys; the big guys are the ones who are going to benefit. I \nhave always thought big guys can take care of themselves. They have \nlots of people to stand up for them. But what Senator Shaheen is \nsaying--and it is particularly important in my home State, where we \nhave mostly small businesses. Senator Shaheen is saying she is going to \nmake sure, as part of the enforcement efforts, we beef up the effort to \nhelp small businesses, particularly at the State level--not at the \nFederal level, at the State level--promote these efforts to have more \nmarkets for our small businesses in the export field.\n  In addition to Senator Shaheen's amendment, as far as those Customs \nmarkers are concerned, we are also going to make the environmental \nprotection provisions I just described authored by Senator Bennet a \npriority and Senator Cantwell's trade enforcement trust fund. I am very \nhopeful about the trade enforcement trust fund as well. Suffice it to \nsay, there is interest on both sides of the aisle because there is an \nawareness that, again, we can have some trade laws, but we are going to \nneed some resources in order to make sure they are implemented. So I \nthink that trade enforcement trust fund is another very important \npriority, and it is one that the pro-trade Democrats have said would be \npart of our short list in terms of our Customs markers.\n  As I noted, when I have town meetings at home--I have had more than \n730 of them and am going to have more of them this upcoming week--I do \nfind people say that everybody in Washington talks about new laws, new \nproposals, trade ideas: Enforce the laws on the books first. It has \nbeen too hard--too hard in the past--for our businesses, particularly \nour small businesses, to get the enforcement that matters, enforcement \nwith teeth, enforcement that serves as a real deterrent to cheating.\n  So this legislation is our chance to demonstrate that strengthening \ntrade enforcement--enforcement of the trade laws--will now be an \nintegral part of a new modern approach to trade, an approach that says \nwe are not part of the 1990s on trade, where nobody had Web sites and \niPhones and the like. We have a modern trade policy with the \ncenterpiece enforcing our trade laws.\n  Our policies are going to give America's trade enforcers the tools \nthey\n\n[[Page S4573]]\n\nneed to fight on behalf of American jobs and American workers and stop \nthe trade cheats who seek to undercut them. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to vote yes later today on the motion to send the \nenforcement bill to conference and work on a bipartisan basis, as we \ndid in the Finance Committee, to put strong trade enforcement \nlegislation on the President's desk.\n  Now, I would also like to briefly make some remarks on the trade \nadjustment assistance package. As we have said, later today, the Senate \nis going to take a series of votes that again speak to how we kick off \na new progressive era in trade policy that closes the books on the \ntrade ideas of the 1990s once and for all.\n  Once again, a key part of that effort is protecting our workers and \nensuring that more trade means everybody has an opportunity to get \nahead. That is why the package of legislation under debate expands and \nextends the support system for America's workers called trade \nadjustment assistance.\n  Now, this program dates back to the days of President Kennedy. \nPresident Kennedy, during his push for the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, \ncalled it ``a program to afford time for American initiative, American \nadaptability and American resiliency to assert themselves.'' Since \nthen, this program has been extended by Republican and Democratic \nPresidents. The program is now a lifeline for more than 100,000 \nAmericans, including 3,000 Oregonians who receive job training and \nfinancial support. The heart of it is to provide a springboard to new \nopportunities, and it guarantees that workers and their families don't \nget knocked off stride when times are tough. In my view, it is a core \nelement of what I call trade done right.\n  As I noted yesterday, Tim Nesbitt, former past president of the \nOregon AFL-CIO, essentially said our legislation was a blueprint for \ntrade done right.\n  Now, for 1\\1/2\\ years, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program has \nbeen running at reduced strength. But that is going to change once this \nlegislation becomes law. The funding for trade adjustment assistance \ngoes back up to a level that will cover everybody who qualifies. Once \nagain, service workers will be eligible for the program because in \ntoday's economy they are facing competition from overseas as well. \nTrade adjustment assistance would take into account competition from \nanywhere in the world, not just from our trade agreement partners.\n\n  These are significant improvements that I will tell the Presiding \nOfficer and colleagues I fought very hard for in what were negotiations \nthat really lasted well over 6 months with Chairman Hatch and Chairman \nRyan. I believe these changes are going to make a big difference for \nworkers across our Nation who fall on tough times. If China manages to \nlure a manufacturer away from the United States, for example, now those \nworkers will be covered. They will have a chance to learn new skills \nand find a job that pays good wages, and they will not have to worry \nabout whether the bills will get paid or if they are going to have food \non their table.\n  Along with trade adjustment assistance, this legislation will \nreinstate the health coverage tax credit that expired at the end of \nlast year. The majority of workers in this country--tens of millions of \nmiddle-class people and their families--get health insurance through \ntheir employer. The health coverage tax credit guarantees that workers \nand families affected by trade are going to still be able to see their \ndoctor. If they get sick or suffer an injury, they aren't going to face \ncolossal medical bills or the threat of bankruptcy. They get \nprotection, and they get it until they are back on their feet.\n  In the process of bringing this legislation together, my friend and \ncolleague on the Finance Committee Senator Brown offered a proposal \nthat goes a long way, in my view, to strengthening our enforcement of \nkey trade laws. It is called the Leveling the Playing Field Act. I urge \nthe Senate majority leader to include this important legislation in the \nTAA bill, both because it is a good policy and it is a sign that both \nparties are working on issues that are logical bipartisan priorities. \nLeveling the playing field--and I can say this at this point in the \ndebate. If we look at the Senate Finance Committee files, leveling the \nplaying field was a top priority for those in the unions--the steel \nunions and others--and it was also a top priority for their companies. \nSo having this policy in trade adjustment assistance is exactly the \nkind of bipartisan work the American people want done--business, labor, \nDemocrats, Republicans--a strong record of evidence as to why it is \nneeded. This legislation is going to be the difference between \nsteelworkers and paper workers being on the job or being laid off \nbecause it ensures that the remedies of trade law--what is called \ncountervailing duty law, anti-dumping law--is going to be available to \nworkers and their companies earlier and in a more comprehensive way. It \nis going to protect jobs, which is a priority of both political \nparties.\n  I made mention how important this was to me. My first hearing--my \nfirst hearing when I became chairman of the Finance Committee's trade \nsubcommittee--was on trade enforcement. So I could have chosen a lot of \ntopics. We could have talked about exports, hugely important to my \nState. We could have talked about the fact that the trade laws haven't \nkept up with the digital age, hugely important to my State. I said my \nfirst hearing was going to be on trade enforcement.\n  My good friend from United Steelworkers, Leo Gerard, together with \nthe U.S. Steel chairman, Mario Longhi, spoke at length about how \nAmerican workers wanted to see the Senate and the Finance Committee \nstand up for them and finally fix the shortcomings in our trade remedy \nlaws. That is what we have done now. Getting behind Sherrod Brown's \nproposal to strengthen our trade laws, to stop unfair trade so foreign \ncompanies do not undercut American workers and manufacturers ought to \nbe an American priority--a red, white, and blue priority, a priority \nfor every Member of this body.\n  I am proud to have worked with Senator Brown on this important issue. \nI thank him for the fact that he has brought this up again and again \nand again. I said quite some time ago that we weren't going to let this \npackage become law without the Leveling the Playing Field Act authored \nby Senator Brown at the outset. That is going to be the case, and I \nthank him for his work.\n  The three programs--the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, the \nhealth coverage tax credit, Senator Brown's Leveling the Playing Field \nAct--are now moving through the Senate alongside legislation that \ncreates new economic opportunities for impoverished countries in Africa \nand other places around the world. This trade package will extend the \nbiggest of these programs, the African Growth and Opportunity Act--what \nis called AGOA--for 10 years. I am a strong believer in AGOA. It works \nfor our country, it works for Africa, and it builds a stronger economic \nfuture for so many around the world. We worked hard again on a \nbipartisan basis in the Finance Committee to find ways to strengthen \nAGOA. That was the point of our hearing, to find ways to strengthen it, \nextend it for another decade, and the committee came together on a \nbipartisan basis to make smart improvements.\n  Once again, we see the value of a progressive trade policy. Two of \nour very outstanding colleagues--my colleague Senator Coons on this \nside of the aisle and our friend Senator Isakson on the other side of \nthe aisle--are always working in a bipartisan way, pointing out that \nthis is what our country is all about, and certainly creating \nopportunities for impoverished parts of the world is a core American \npriority. Hearts and minds around the world are hoping we will have \nthis kind of leadership.\n  I will close, and I think this will be my last comment before the \nvote. It is my view that for all who want to see trade done right, for \nall who want American workers to thrive in the 21st century, getting \nbehind these key programs is an ideal way to do it. By supporting this \nlegislation, the Congress reaffirms what President Kennedy really \nrhapsodized over half a century ago: You get behind these programs, and \nit reaffirms America's commitment to American initiative, to \nadaptability, and resiliency.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to vote yes to support these \nimportant programs when we vote later today.\n\n[[Page S4574]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk briefly about trade \nadjustment assistance, or TAA, and about trade enforcement. I will be \nsupporting the TAA bill.\n\n\n                     Tribute to Casey Aden-Wansbury\n\n  But before I talk about that, I would like to recognize my chief of \nstaff, Casey Aden-Wansbury, who has never been on the floor before. She \nasked to be on the floor today, since she is leaving. Of course, I said \nyes.\n  But I said that so that I could talk about you, Casey. You didn't \nknow that. You have to sit through this.\n  Casey has served in my office since I joined the Senate in July of \n2009. She is leaving Washington next week and is heading to San \nFrancisco, where her husband will be starting an amazing new job. Jamo \nhas a great job, and he has been so supportive of you, Casey, and also \nof Casey's parents. You will now be much closer to them.\n  I am very excited for Casey, but I wish she weren't leaving. Everyone \nin my office is going to miss you--no one more than me.\n  When my grandson was 30 minutes old, I held him in my arms, and I \nsaid to him: It is all staff.\n  It is true. It is all staff. Casey has been an amazing chief of \nstaff. She is the most focused, determined person I know.\n  I am a member of the Writers Guild and the Screen Actors Guild. I get \nscreeners. We got ``Zero Dark Thirty'' sent to me during the awards \nseason. My wife and I were in our living room. We put ``Zero Dark \nThirty'' on. At a certain point in the movie, I said to Franni: The \nlead character reminds me of someone. Finally, I said: It is Casey. If \nCasey had been in the CIA, I think we would have gotten bin Laden a \nlittle earlier.\n  Casey deserves an enormous amount of credit for all the work that I \nand our office have been able to get done in my first term--the day-to-\nday work that we do to improve the lives of people in Minnesota and \nacross the country. Whether it was mental health in schools or \nimproving workforce training or protecting net neutrality or defeating \nthe Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal, I am so proud of the work we have \ndone in the Senate. And it is all staff. Casey has led that staff \nbrilliantly every step of the way. I will miss Casey more than anyone, \nincluding myself, really knows.\n  Whoever gets Casey next will be very, very lucky indeed.\n  Casey, I cannot express how deeply thankful I am for all you have \ndone for me, for our office, and for the State of Minnesota. Thank you.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would like to turn briefly to the trade \nadjustment assistance package. I believe that when trade is done right, \nit can benefit our workers, our communities, and our businesses. But I \nwas concerned that the fast-track procedures set up by the trade \npromotion authority bill will not do enough to make sure that we do \ntrade right. So I voted against that bill, and I will vote against it \nagain later.\n  Once we are done with that bill, we will consider the trade \nadjustment assistance bill that was originally packaged together with \nthe fast-track bill. I will support TAA. It is far from perfect. For \none thing, it simply does not provide enough assistance. But it will go \na long way toward providing help for workers who are displaced by \ntrade, as we know some will be.\n  I also strongly support the Leveling the Playing Field Act, which is \nincluded in this package along with TAA. Senator Brown's bill, of which \nI am proud to be a cosponsor, would help strengthen our trade remedy \nlaws--the laws that enforce our trade policies and protect our domestic \nindustries from dumped and subsidized imports from other countries.\n  In Minnesota, I have seen firsthand the damage that happens when we \ndon't have--and just as importantly, can't enforce--strong trade \nprotections. In the last few months alone, we have seen what happens \nwhen countries unfairly dump their goods here. Nearly 1,000 Minnesotans \nin the Iron Range are losing their jobs after a flood of dumped steel \nimports.\n  The Leveling the Playing Field Act would help improve our anti-\ndumping laws, including restoring Congress's original intent in setting \nthe standard for when a domestic industry is materially injured by \nunfairly traded foreign imports. We need to be able to respond \neffectively when dumped imports are harming our domestic iron and steel \nindustry and the workers in that industry or when those imports are \nharming other industries, as is happening now. This bill will be an \nimportant step in enabling that more effective response. With these \nprovisions, we are standing up for American manufacturers by putting in \nplace and enforcing fair trade practices.\n  For these reasons, I will be voting for the trade adjustment \nassistance bill, and I look forward to its being enacted into law.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me to say a few words about \nCasey and about TAA.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I have come to this floor a number of times \narguing against trade promotion authority. I have done that for months. \nThis body should not give up its authority to amend trade agreements, \nand it should not pave the way for a trade deal that looks like it is \ngoing to be more of the same--corporate and worker sellouts.\n  We have seen it with NAFTA, and we saw a similar kind of move on PNTR \nwith China, where our bilateral trade deficit almost literally exploded \nsince 2000, when this body and the other body moved forward on PNTR. We \nsaw it with the Central American Free Trade Agreement, when President \nBush had to wake in the middle of the night and get on the phone with \nRepublican Member after Republican Member to get them to change their \nvote on fast-track so he could get the Central American Free Trade \nAgreement, which he sold in the name of counterterrorism. We saw it in \nthe South Korean trade agreement, when this President made promises of \nmore job creation and higher wages, neither of which has borne out.\n  We have seen big promises and bad results on trade issue after trade \nissue after trade issue after trade issue. We have seen it through the \nPresidencies of George Bush 1, Bill Clinton, George Bush 2, and now \nBarack Obama.\n  As I said, this body should not give up its authority to make better \ntrade agreements. In essence, what we are saying in this body with this \nvote, which will take place within the hour or so, is that we are \nwilling to give up these powers to the executive branch to give us more \nof the same, trade agreements that don't work for our communities, \ndon't work for our workers, don't work for our families, and don't work \nfor our small businesses.\n  While this Chamber will vote on trade promotion authority today, so-\ncalled fast-track, it doesn't mean we throw in the towel on the \ncongressional oversight of our Nation's trade policy. Moving forward \nwith fast-track means it is more critical than ever that we protect \nCongress's prerogative to have a say on a deal that could offset 40 \npercent of the world's economy. Members on both sides of the aisle, \nMembers on both sides of this debate, supporters and opponents, \nRepublicans and Democrats, a good mix of each, have had conversations \nwith me and many others about how this deal, the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, is too secretive.\n  We have had conversations about how the U.S. Trade Representative is \nnot answering the concerns of Members, even supporters of TPA and TPP, \non issues such as currency, workers' protections, workers' rights, \ntobacco, and public health. Starting today, we need to make sure any \nTrans-Pacific Partnership deal--and that is the deal we will vote on \nlater. I am assuming TPA will pass today. I hope not. I assume it will \npass, go to the President, and I assume he will sign it.\n  The next question is, What happens with the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, which is 12 countries coming together. It includes a \nhandful of countries in the Western Hemisphere, including the three \nNAFTA countries--Canada, the\n\n[[Page S4575]]\n\nUnited States, and Mexico--a couple of South American countries and \nAsia and the Australian subcontinent countries will be part of this \ntrade agreement. If China is added to it, we hope there is a vote in \nthe Congress, although there is no promise of that from the \nadministration--but we need to make sure any deal on the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership includes strong labor protections. There are always big \npromises about labor protections, but a President has yet to deliver on \nthese labor protections.\n  I am particularly concerned about Vietnam, a large country of tens of \nmillions--approaching 100 million people. Vietnam is a country that has \none labor union controlled by the Communist Party. It is a country that \ndoesn't have collective bargaining rights. Yet we are assuming somehow \nthat wages will come up high enough in Vietnam that they don't undercut \nU.S. wages, even though they don't have free trade unions, they don't \nhave collective bargaining, and there is no mechanism so far in these \ntrade agreements, whether it is TPA or Trans-Pacific Partnership, that \nVietnam reach these wage levels and begins to move toward collective \nbargaining and free trade unionism prior to its admission to TPP.\n  We need to figure out all of those questions. We need to make sure \nthat any TPP deal has strong environmental protections. Again, there \nwere big promises on other agreements, but there is never much on the \ndelivery side of these promises.\n  We want to see strong currency provisions. Again, there have been big \npromises on TPP but with little results in the past, and so far we have \nan administration that is not willing to carry it out.\n  We need to make sure we protect Medicare and Medicaid from investor-\nstate dispute resolution, and we need to preserve access to medicines. \nWe know citizens in the developing world simply can't afford the high \ncost of Western medicines. Much of the time Americans can't afford the \nhigh cost of medicines, and we are an affluent country.\n  When we look at some of these TPP countries in South America and \nAsia, they can afford them even less. We need to make sure there are \nstrong preserve-access-to-medicine provisions. We need to include \nprotections that prevent this deal from being a tool for tobacco, which \nis perhaps the simplest to understand and one of the most troubling \nbecause of its moral bankruptcy.\n  This body is about to vote for fast-track legislation. If we don't \nstop this train from going down the track on which it seems to be \nheading, we are handing Big Tobacco even more power to addict children \nto tobacco in the developing world and countries that don't have nearly \nthe public health system we do and don't have the affluence to be able \nto fight back against Big Tobacco. We have been pretty successful in \ndoing that and protecting our children.\n  About 15 years ago when I was a member of the House Energy and \nCommerce Subcommittee on Health, I remember seven tobacco executives \ncame to our committee. There was a picture on just about every front \npage of newspapers in the country, where the seven CEOs of the biggest \ntobacco companies in the country, some of the biggest in the world, \nraised their right hands and pledged to tell the truth, the whole \ntruth, and nothing but the truth, and out and out lied to that \ncommittee about nicotine and cigarettes and the addictive qualities of \nnicotine.\n  These same tobacco companies, over time, pledged that they would no \nlonger put billboards near schoolyards, pledged that they would no \nlonger hand out sample packages of cigarettes near schools, pledged \nthat they would stop their Joe Camel promotions.\n  I remember the ranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator \nWyden, was as outraged as I was with Big Tobacco.\n  I asked them a question at this hearing. I said: You are willing to \ndo that in this country? You are willing to say that you will no longer \nhave billboards near high schools, and you will no longer hand out \nsamples of cigarette packs near schools, and you will stop your Joe \nCamel ads? I then said: Are you willing to do that in other countries \naround the world?\n  The answer was: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.\n  When these tobacco companies go to the developing world and peddle \ntheir poisons, they know public health in the developing world is about \nfighting cholera, fighting AIDS, fighting malaria, and fighting \ntuberculosis. They simply don't have the public health resources that \nwe do in our country to fight Big Tobacco. That is my concern about \nwhat could happen.\n  I will talk for a moment about how Big Tobacco uses trade agreements \ngenerally to undermine public health. We know tobacco use is the \nworld's leading cause of preventable death. It is why countries around \nthe world are passing stricter laws to protect their citizens from the \nmassive health risks tobacco poses. Big Tobacco has turned trade deals \ninto a tool for defeating commonsense international public health \nefforts.\n  How could that happen? Why would a trade deal be a vehicle to weaken \nanti-tobacco laws, the laws that especially protect children against \naddictive tobacco? Here is how it happens: It uses a trade agreement \nprovision known as investor-state dispute settlement to attack a \nnation's public health law. Under this process, corporations use trade \nagreements to dispute domestic laws that they say undermine their \ninvestments.\n  I will use the best example, but there are several. Not many years \nago, Australia passed the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act. Big Tobacco \nchallenged this law. First of all, they opposed it in the Australian \nLegislature. They lobbied against it, but they were unsuccessful. The \nAustralian Legislature passed the plain packaging consumer protection \nanti-addicting children tobacco law in 2011. Then, they sued, and it \nwent to the Australian supreme court. Big Tobacco lost that case too.\n  So you know what they did? I give them credit for being pretty \nclever. They paid their lawyers a lot of money. Big Tobacco challenged \nthis new law under the Australia-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment Treaty \nin a World Trade Organization dispute settlement proceeding. That means \nalthough Australian courts had ruled in favor of this law--their \nlegislature passed it and the supreme court said it is constitutional--\nBig Tobacco, from the platform of Hong Kong, sued the Australian \nGovernment, saying, fundamentally, that was takings, that would \nundermine their profits.\n  I believe a three-person tribunal will hear this case. These are not \nAustralian lawyers. Australia has nothing to do with this case except \nthat they are going to be victimized.\n  I know the Presiding Officer cares about sovereignty for our country. \nI know this cuts across party lines. Conservatives, as much as \nprogressives, care about sovereignty and public health. What we are \ndoing is turning over the sovereignty of our Nation to these tribunals \nthat can undercut our sovereignty.\n  Tobacco companies have launched similar cases against Uruguay and \nTogo over proposed laws. Cases like these can bankrupt small countries. \nTogo is one of the 10 poorest countries on Earth. It was forced to give \nup its tobacco labeling laws, bowing under pressure from Philip Morris, \na company whose sales, I believe, are larger than the GDP of Togo--\nbowing under pressure from Philip Morris, which threatened an \n``incalculable amount of trade litigation.''\n\n  So here are some U.S. trade lawyers who threatened to sue a poor \nAfrican government or, in some cases, Latin American government which, \nonce it exercised its sovereignty to protect its children against \npotential addictive tobacco marketing--marketing that will lead to \nchildren being addicted to tobacco--but they back off because they \ncan't afford to go to court against the deep pockets of Philip Morris. \nThis is Big Tobacco's strategy: Litigate and bankrupt countries into \nsubmission.\n  What we are facing is huge corporations using trade laws to blackmail \ncountries--call it another word if you want; I think ``blackmail'' is \nabout as close as it gets--into overturning laws that were passed by \ntheir legislature and usually ratified by their court system. People \nfrom another country--a\n\n[[Page S4576]]\n\nvery rich country--and one of the richest industries in that country, \nrepresented by some of the most privileged Harvard- and Yale-trained \nlawyers, are saying: We are going to overturn your democratically \nelected law because our profits are more important than protecting your \nchildren in Togo or your children in Uruguay, than protecting your \nchildren's health. That is fundamentally what they are saying.\n  So a vote today--since we haven't fixed tobacco--on fast-track is \nessentially saying--unless the people voting for it are going to go to \nbat, for a change, against Big Tobacco--fundamentally, we are saying it \nis OK for Big Tobacco and it is the privilege of the Big Tobacco \nlawyers to go to court and choose large tobacco profits over 15- and \n16--or may I say 12- and 13-year-old children's health in poor \ncountries in the developing world. That is a rather uneven match. Yet \nwe ratify that with a ``yes'' vote today.\n  (Mr. TOOMEY assumed the Chair.)\n  We also have a responsibility to look out for the American worker who \nwe know will be hurt by this deal. We know that--while I may disagree \nwith the Presiding Officer from Pennsylvania over whether these trade \nagreements produce net jobs or what he, I think, believes--I believe \nthese trade agreements produce a net loss of jobs.\n  That aside, people on both sides of this debate understand and have \nacknowledged that because of our actions, because of what we do here in \nthis body and in the House and in the White House--what we do here with \nthis trade agreement will throw some people out of jobs. We know there \nwill be dislocation. People will lose their jobs because of our \ndecisions. So how in the world could we possibly pass this without \nfirst taking care of those workers who lose their jobs? We make a \ndecision; you get thrown out of work. My colleague makes a decision; \nyou get thrown out of work. We are just going to turn our backs because \nwe don't really care about helping you even though you lost your job \nbecause of our decision.\n  So TAA is particularly important. It is not that we should pass the \ntrade adjustment assistance; it is what we should do with it. I am \ndisappointed that the TAA bill being considered today is significantly \nless generous to those workers than it should be. There will be many \nworkers who lose their jobs. Even if we pass TAA, there will be many \nworkers who lose their jobs who will not be taken care of under TAA. It \ndoes not make the program available to all workers.\n  I am disappointed that the bipartisan funding levels--which almost \nevery Democrat in this body cosponsored--in my legislation that \nincluded a more generous level for TAA--we agreed to it in 2011 in this \nbody, but for no reason at all, those numbers were cut. I want to \nexpand eligibility. I want to increase its funding.\n  We are making it easier to pass TPP, but we are cutting the TAA \nProgram by 20 percent. So how does that figure? We are saying we are \ngoing to pass this trade agreement--40 percent of the world's economy--\nyet we are cutting the protection for workers, the aid for those \nworkers who lose their jobs because of our decisions in this body. We \nare cutting those workers 20 percent.\n  Last, we have an opportunity in this bill today to once again support \nthe Leveling the Playing Field Act and ensure it gets to the \nPresident's desk. This will be the vote after the TPA vote. This bill \nis essential to protect our manufacturers from illegal foreign \ncompetition. We can't have trade promotion without trade enforcement. \nThis is not controversial. It shouldn't be partisan. Regardless of how \none votes on TPA, we need to make sure our deals are enforced.\n  Leveling the playing field will increase U.S. companies' ability to \nfight back against unfair trade practices. It is critical for our \nbusinesses, and it is critical for our workers who are drowning under a \nflood of illegally subsidized imports. It has the support of businesses \nand workers, Republicans and Democrats.\n  I want to particularly thank Senators Portman and Graham and Casey \nfor their work in support of this issue. No matter where we stand on \nTPA, we should all be able to come together to demand enforcement of \nour trade laws. We cannot have trade promotion without trade \nenforcement and without protecting those workers who we know will be \nleft behind.\n  We know these agreements cause wages to stagnate. We know these \nagreements cause factories to close. They cause imports to increase. \nThey devastate families and communities. This is a terrible mistake we \nwill make--which we have made over and over and over and over--if we \npass this today. If we pass TPA, it is the same mistake we made with \nNAFTA--big promises of job increases, wages going up. Bad results. We \ndid it when we passed PNTR. We did it when we passed CAFTA, the Central \nAmerica Free Trade Agreement. And we are about to do it again. Shame on \nus. At least take care of workers if we are going to pass this \nlegislation.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                        King v. Burwell Decision\n\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, there is a lot of talk about the imminent \ndecision of the Supreme Court ruling in King v. Burwell. I will get to \nthat a little bit later in my speech, but I wish to start by talking \nabout how we got here.\n  I would like to review what Americans were told were the reasons for \nObamaCare. It was supposed to help the 15 million people who are \ncurrently uninsured to get covered with quality, affordable insurance. \nEveryone else, we were promised, would be left alone. Remember that \npromise: If you like your doctor, you can keep him. If you like your \nhealth care, you can keep it. That is the first of several broken \npromises ObamaCare has ultimately produced. I will go through a few \nthis afternoon.\n  Let's take a look at what has happened since ObamaCare was \nimplemented and where we stand. Most of the uninsured nationwide are--\nand they were prior to ObamaCare--working families; 71 percent in 2013. \nThey either couldn't afford the cost-sharing of their employer plan or \ntheir employer didn't offer a plan. Of those who got insurance under \nObamaCare, too many were working families who actually didn't get \nprivate insurance under ObamaCare; they were ultimately forced into \nMedicaid, which is supposed to be a safety net, not a permanent \nsolution for working families.\n  Is Medicaid the quality, affordable insurance that we all want for \nAmericans and that people thought they were getting with ObamaCare? I \ndon't think so. The provider payment rates in Medicaid are so low that \nmany doctors refuse to see patients and participate in the plans. I \ndon't really begrudge the doctors and the health care providers for \nthis because the cost of care oftentimes exceeds the Medicaid \nreimbursement rates, and the redtape that comes with it absolutely is \ndestroying the administrative side of health care. That is why doctors \ndon't participate in the plan. That is why the doctors are not \navailable for the people who actually need good, quality health care.\n  It is not for lack of investment though. States are drowning in \nunaffordable Medicaid Programs that eat more and more of their budgets \nat the expense of other essential services. States are throwing \neverything they can and then some at Medicaid, but it is still \nunacceptable in terms of cost, quality, and access. That is exactly why \nNorth Carolina refused to participate in ObamaCare's Medicaid \nexpansion. I was speaker of the house in North Carolina at the time.\n  We know that if we are going to solve the health care problem, it has \nto be a real solution. We have to bring back a vibrant, robust, \npatient-centered, private insurance system, customized for our State \nrather than dictated by bureaucrats in Washington.\n  My constituents deserve a plan that pays doctors fairly so that \nprovider networks are big enough to ensure that people don't get turned \naway at the door. Herding more of our hard-working, proud neighbors \ninto a substandard welfare plan designed to be a temporary safety net \nis no solution at all, but that is exactly what ObamaCare has done. The \nPresident even brags about it.\n  In North Carolina, prior to the implementation of ObamaCare, there \nwere some 1.9 million of our citizens who were uninsured. Who are these \npeople? Ten percent were already Medicaid eligible before ObamaCare. \nMost of them are children. We could have enrolled them without ever \npassing ObamaCare and disrupting and destroying health care for \neveryone else. About a third\n\n[[Page S4577]]\n\nwere people who were eligible for subsidies on the exchange--almost \nhalf a million.\n  So did all of those folks get help? It might look as though they did. \nAfter all, 459,000 have signed up through the Federal exchange in North \nCarolina. But wait. Are those the same people, the same ones who were \ninsured before ObamaCare? It turns out that even more than that--\n473,000 people--had their plans canceled by ObamaCare. Again, 473,000 \nNorth Carolinians received a letter saying: The Affordable Care Act has \ndetermined you can't keep your plan. They didn't like it, even though \nthose who were insured were satisfied with their plans.\n  This was a nationwide trend. The Associated Press reported that 4.7 \nmillion people had their plans canceled because of ObamaCare. There was \nsuch an outcry that the President, by Executive fiat, actually \ninstructed the insurers to continue to allow the plans for a period of \ntime. So how many people lost their plan this time is still not clear. \nBut what is clear is that the individual mandate is going to cause \nproblems down the road because those who lost their plan or who will \nlose their plan, are going to be required by law to buy a Washington-\napproved insurance plan no matter how unaffordable ObamaCare has made \ninsurance.\n  Again, in North Carolina, more people received cancellation notices \nfor plans they liked than have actually signed up for ObamaCare. \nBetween the half million whose plans were initially canceled by \nObamaCare and the 1.9 million people who were already uninsured prior \nto ObamaCare, we should end up with a wash--with no change in the \nuninsured figures for my State of North Carolina, but, actually, we \ndon't. The uninsured rate has gone down 2.7 percent--from 19.9 percent \nin 2013 to 17.2 percent in 2014--after the first full year of the \nObamaCare implementation, so roughly equivalent to about 200,000 people \nin North Carolina. But were all of those people getting quality, \naffordable plans on the exchange as promised by ObamaCare? Hardly. The \nreason is Medicaid enrollment. The majority of the people who the \nadministration claims ObamaCare covered have been those who went to the \nexchange to get insurance but were then forced to enroll in Medicaid. \nAnd when I say forced, I mean forced. The law requires them to have \ninsurance, but the exchange doesn't allow them to buy a private plan if \nthey are eligible for Medicaid. It shows them one option: Medicaid.\n  Well, wait. You said North Carolina didn't expand Medicaid, so how \ndid this happen? It is true. Medicaid enrollment for my State has \nincreased by 300,000 people--the biggest enrollment increase of any of \nthe States that didn't expand Medicaid. What that means is much if not \nall of the drop in the uninsured rate is due to North Carolinians \nenrolling in Medicaid through the exchange. These are the same people \nwho were eligible before ObamaCare was ever passed.\n  Nationally, last year, nearly 90 percent of ObamaCare's net coverage \ngain was through Medicaid. A study from MIT released in April found \nthat Medicaid enrollees receive much less value from the program than \nthe cost of paying for services.\n  So far, I have been talking about people who were targeted by \nObamaCare, including the population of previously uninsured, as well as \nthose who became uninsured because ObamaCare forced them into the \nexchange. Again, ObamaCare didn't really make a dent in our uninsured \nnumbers--not to this point in North Carolina--and it actually harmed \nmany who were forced onto the exchange. It turns out that ObamaCare is \nan equal opportunity wrecking ball. It hurt the people it was supposed \nto help. It forced working families who needed quality, affordable, \npermanent care into a program that provides the lowest quality access \nthere is--Medicaid.\n\n  ObamaCare took over and removed the insurance options, the individual \nmarket for people who didn't have employer coverage, leaving those \nWashington-approved ObamaCare plans with increased premiums, increased \ndeductibles, and increased copays. You see, increased coverage doesn't \nnecessarily mean better health care. If you can't afford your plan or \nyou can't find the doctor, then your health care suffers.\n  But that is not all. ObamaCare broke health care for everyone else. \nThose of us who were supposedly happy with our doctors and happy with \nour health plans have been affected and will continue to be negatively \naffected.\n  What about the majority of Americans who actually have insurance \nthrough their employer? They haven't necessarily lost coverage yet, but \nthey have been harmed. Despite the President's promise to lower \ninsurance premiums, the average family premium for employer-sponsored \ncoverage has risen $3,500 a year between 2009 and 2014.\n  In North Carolina, during the first full year of the exchange \nrollout, premium price increases outpaced increases in wages and \ninflation, losing ground to the working family. Even worse, premium \nprices in individual insurance markets--a market my daughter was a part \nof--went up 147 percent as a result of a plan that promised to reduce \nour health care insurance costs.\n  I know I am not the only one who remembers what President Obama said \nabout ObamaCare. He said the average premiums would go down $2,500. The \nreality is they have gone up an average of $3,500 a year. All of this \nleads to the problem of people having insurance they can't afford, and \nthey are not able to use it because their deductibles and copays are \nsimply too high.\n  Between this group and the people who are now on Medicaid who can't \nget appointments with the small number of doctors who accept Medicaid, \nwhat one gets is a dramatic increase in the use of emergency rooms. \nThat is exactly the opposite of what supporters of ObamaCare predicted. \nThey predicted that emergency room visits would go down. We were told \nthat once everyone was insured under ObamaCare, people could go to \ntheir doctors in outpatient settings and not show up at the ER. \nInstead, people can't afford the copays and deductibles or they can't \nget an outpatient appointment, so they wait until their problem is \ncritical and end up in the ER.\n  In fact, Kaiser Family Foundation reports that emergency room \nutilization is up significantly among ObamaCare participants. In a \nsurvey of more than 2,000 emergency room doctors, three-quarters of \nthem said emergency room visits have risen since January 1, 2014. \nMedicaid recipients covered under ObamaCare are struggling to find \ndoctors who will accept their coverage, so they have no choice but to \nend up at an emergency room, where the costs skyrocket.\n  A spokesman for the Emergency Room Doctors Association, Dr. Howard \nMell, noted:\n\n       There was a grand theory the law would reduce emergency \n     room visits. Well, guess what, it hasn't happened. Visits are \n     going up despite the ACA, and in a lot of cases because of \n     it.\n\n  One of the most troubling elements of ObamaCare to me is the \nintergenerational wealth transfer from the young and the poor to the \nolder and the wealthier. When I say ``older,'' I don't mean elderly and \nfrail or the population who may be on Medicare; I am talking about a \nwealth transfer from young people in their twenties to people like me \nin their fifties. I would never ask my daughter, who is about to start \na career in nursing, to pay for her mother's insurance or for my \ninsurance, neither would any of you or any other American. That is not \nhow parents are wired. But an impersonal law that empowers an \nimpersonal bureaucracy does not have the same moral compass as a \nparent.\n  For example, ObamaCare's mandates have jacked up premiums for young \npeople to keep premiums down for older people like me. I am not sure \n``let's fleece our children and grandchildren'' is a winning talking \npoint, so the supporters of the bill try to hide the truth in \nWashington-speak. They call this ``age rating bands.''\n  Another talking point that tends to not fly too well with folks is \n``Let's kick seniors off of their Medicare Advantage plans.'' That is \nexactly what happened in North Carolina late last year. Many who know \nabout Medicare Advantage plans know they are very important and popular \namong seniors. In my State last year, 57,000 seniors--more than any \nother State in the Nation--were sent cancellation letters from the \nMedicare Advantage plans they liked. Many of these seniors were offered \na minimum benefit plan with\n\n[[Page S4578]]\n\nhigher copayments and higher premiums instead, all because ObamaCare \ncut reimbursement for Medicare Advantage plans out of some bizarre but \nlongstanding aversion to the program on the part of some of our friends \non the other side of the aisle. I have never understood it. Does \nMedicare Advantage somehow give seniors too much control, stability, \nand convenience in their Medicare benefits? I suspect my mom is \nwatching me right now in Nashville, TN. I bet if she was asked that \nquestion, she would say no.\n  Just when you think it is really bad, realize that some of the \ntoughest ObamaCare hits haven't even been taken yet.\n  First, the individual mandate penalty. The penalty for not having \ninsurance increases next year to almost $700 per adult or 2.5 percent \nof one's annual income, whichever is greater. This is a penalty which \nmany people will be surprised to see when they get their tax return and \nthey are expecting this amount and it is $700 or $1,000 less to pay for \nthe mandated care. If an individual's income is $50,000, they will pay \na penalty of $1,000. A family with two adults with an income of $50,000 \nwill pay $1,400. When adding a college kid to the mix, the penalty is \n$2,100. A lot of people are in for a shock when they open up that tax \nrefund and they see the additional hidden costs of ObamaCare on working \nfamilies. That penalty, however, is still dramatically lower than the \nout-of-pocket costs of an ObamaCare plan. So we are forcing Americans \nto pick between bad and worse.\n  Second, the employer mandate and penalty. President Obama knows the \ndevastation the employer mandate will cause not only for businesses \nbut, more importantly, for workers. Employers will be forced to cut \nworkers. They will be forced to reduce wages and drop employer-\nsponsored health plans altogether and pay the penalty because the \npenalty will cost less than the mandates will to provide the care, and \nmany employers simply can't afford it.\n\n  So far, people with employer-sponsored coverage have been harmed only \nby rising costs and shrinking provider networks, but they haven't for \nthe most part lost their plans yet. The day is coming when the \nPresident can no longer delay the employer mandate, and that is when \nthe plans they were promising you can keep will be canceled. We will \nsee a massive disruption in the group market where most North \nCarolinians get their health insurance.\n  Premiums are going up every year because fewer younger, healthier \npeople are enrolling than projected. This was completely predictable. \nYoung people are no dummies. They know this is a terrible deal for \nthem. As a result, insurance companies recalculate premiums based on \nthe cost of the pool actually enrolled. The largest insurer in my State \nannounced premium hikes for next year in the individual market of at \nleast 26 percent. You know it is a bad thing when I felt better about \nthe fact that our premium increases in North Carolina were only 26 \npercent because in some States they were upwards of 50 percent, and \nthere is more to come.\n  ObamaCare relies on people paying into the pool to subsidize the \nsicker and poorer members of the pool. That is how insurance works. But \nvirtually no one is signing up who isn't eligible for the subsidies.\n  CMS released data yesterday showing that 2015 exchange enrollment is \n30 percent below projections made just 3 years ago. And of those who do \nenroll, they are doing it because of the lure of the subsidy. Ninety-\nthree percent of the North Carolinians who are on the exchange have \nreceived those subsidies. That means the plans are unaffordable without \nmassive subsidies. Those ineligible for the subsidy don't bother to \nsign up. That is why we have seen almost no movement in our State for \nuninsureds.\n  ObamaCare is forcing employers to cut jobs and move full-time workers \ninto part-time positions. New data show a decline in the average hours \nworked per week by lower wage employees, and many workers are just \nbelow that 30-hour threshold, 30 hours per week.\n  I was at a restaurant in North Carolina a couple months back, and I \nwas talking with a manager, who said it was heartbreaking for her to go \nand talk to a single mom who was able to make ends meet between the \ntips and her salary at 40 hours a week and tell her that she can now \nonly work 30 hours a week because the restaurant simply cannot afford \nto be exposed to the mandates.\n  Now you have people who may have been able to make it on 40 hours a \nweek or 45 hours a week having to get two jobs to make ends meet. I \nhear employers talking about how they are having to call each other to \ntry to work out the schedules for these hard-working folks.\n  The CBO projects that ObamaCare will reduce employment as a result of \nall this by 2 million full-time equivalent jobs in 2017.\n  President Obama campaigned saying he wouldn't raise taxes on families \nmaking less than $250,000 a year. Let's talk a little bit more about \nthat. ObamaCare broke that promise as well by creating or raising 20 \ndifferent taxes amounting to more than $1 trillion in the first decade. \nSeveral taxes directly punished families making less than $250,000 a \nyear.\n  University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan modeled the \nmacroeconomic effects of ObamaCare and estimated that the damage would \nbe twice as large. He expects Obamacare to cause a 3-percent drop in \nemployment and work hours and a 2-percent drop in our gross domestic \nproduct and worker income. If he is right, the total loss of worker \ncompensation caused by the President's health care law will exceed $2 \ntrillion between 2017 and 2024.\n  Now let's talk about the King v. Burwell case that has everyone's \nattention, with the Supreme Court imminently in a position to issue a \nruling, probably sometime next week. The question for the Supreme Court \nis this: Did the President break the law by going around the will of \nthe people in the States that wanted to opt out of establishing a State \nexchange, like we did in North Carolina?\n  Mr. President, what I just finished was a very long list of broken \npromises and the fiscal disaster we call ObamaCare. But now I want to \ntalk about the King v. Burwell decision.\n  The question is this: Did the President break the law by going around \nthe will of the people in the States that wanted to opt out of \nestablishing a State exchange, such as North Carolina?\n  I am not interested in litigating this. I am not an attorney; I am a \nbusinessman. I will leave the lawyering to others. When I look at King \nv. Burwell, I don't see a legal battle; I see an opportunity. It may \nsound trite, but I see hope. The Court may give us the chance of a \ngeneration--the chance to fix health care once and for all. We can't \nfix ObamaCare, but we can fix health care.\n  But here is the thing. We don't come up with the solution ourselves. \nThe press is counting on us to come up with a solution. Others are \npressuring us on the other side of the aisle. But here is what I think \nwe need to do. I think we need to look beyond the traditional way of \ntrying to solve health care to a new way, and it starts with something \nfairly simple--humility.\n  I won't read the definition, but I think it is something that is \nsometimes missed in Washington. The solution is that we take the power \nout of Washington and we let the States do it. We give States, which \nare closer to the people, the chance--the privilege, really--to offer \nhealth care solutions that are local, accountable, and affordable.\n  Every State is different. Let's respect those differences. I believe \nthe solution is one that will give States the flexibility, the funding, \nand the control to decide how best to serve the people of their \nparticular State.\n  I just went through the long list of problems with ObamaCare. It has \nbeen problematic from the start, with higher costs, lower quality, less \nfreedom, and people losing their coverage. It is a badly written law, \nand it hurts almost everyone.\n  Washington had its chance. Now it is time to let the States decide \nwhat is best for their people, and let the people decide what is best \nfor their health care. To do that, we are going to have to do something \nwe don't always do up here. We are going to have to jump on this \nopportunity and work together--Republicans and Democrats, the Federal \nGovernment and the States--to find commonsense solutions that are truly \npatient-centered.\n  That is the type of patient-first approach that will give patients \nmore\n\n[[Page S4579]]\n\nfreedom, more choice, and control over their health care. That is what \nwill expand coverage--not bureaucratic power. That will promote genuine \nquality and innovation. It is also what is going to bring costs down. I \ndo not think my responsibility is to my party. I do not think our \nresponsibility is to the institution of the Senate or the prerogatives \nof the Federal legislative branch.\n  I think our responsibility is to the patients who deserve the highest \nquality care; to the patients who want the best treatments for their \nchildren; to the nurses and doctors who deserve freedom to heal \naccording to their wisdom, their experience, and their conscience; and \nto the businesses that deserve the freedom to design affordable \ncoverage that fits their workforce.\n  Finally, I think we are responsible to the seniors who have paved \nAmerica's road to prosperity before us and who deserve a strong, secure \nMedicare program. The Court may just give us the opportunity to firmly \nand finally reject ObamaCare so that we can deliver what everyone in \nAmerica deserves--a health care solution.\n  The law has not worked. It cannot work. It is time we return the \npower of medicine to the people. It is time to stop fighting and to \nstart cooperating and to find a permanent solution.\n  Patients deserve portability in their health insurance, and they \ndeserve affordability. They deserve their peace of mind when their \nparent or their child or they themselves are in their hour of crisis \nand when they can count on getting the best health care America has to \noffer.\n  Sometimes politicians in Washington forget that health care is not \nabout systems or rules and structure or even markets. It is about real \npeople and real families and real lives. So my commitment is simple. \nOur commitment should be simple. No one who has ObamaCare-subsidized \ncare today will lose that coverage tomorrow. We are equally committed \nto providing long-term, State-designed, patient-empowering solutions \nthat deliver better long-term results, and safe, secure, and affordable \nhealth care and an improved economy.\n  We commit that every patient with a preexisting condition will be \nable to find affordable coverage. No one will hit a cap on benefits. \nAnyone can renew their health plan. That is our commitment. Health care \nis about patients, not politics. It is about doctors and nurses, not \npoliticians. For the millions who have been affected, from the \ncancelled plans to the higher costs, we are committed to real solutions \nto protect patients and make health care genuinely personal and \ngenuinely affordable.\n  Hard-working taxpayers deserve certainty, stability, and peace of \nmind when it comes to health care. A temporary extension of subsidies \nalone would not be enough. It would just be another Washington gimmick. \nIt would not address the very real problems with the President's health \ncare law. Let's commit to each other--Republicans and Democrats--that \nwe will show a little modesty. We won't assume we know what is best for \nevery American, and we will let the States come up with solutions. We \nwill work together to return power to the States, to the people, and \nreally to the kitchen table, where most health care decisions are made.\n  I know what you are thinking: I am new and have been here for 6 \nmonths. Maybe I am a little bit naive. But I have herded a lot of cats \nin the North Carolina legislature. I have stepped up to very serious \nchallenges, and we produced a lot of good results for my friends and \ncolleagues and citizens in North Carolina. I know it can be done at the \nState level when policies are on the line that have a real impact on \nour neighbors--neighbors we have to face in the checkout line and in \nthe church pews.\n  I am looking forward to providing a solution to the health care \nproblems in the United States. I am looking forward to seeing \nbipartisan cooperation, to delivering on the promises that we make \nhere, and to fulfilling the promise of fixing health care for our great \ncountry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding rule XXII, at 4 p.m. today, June 24, all postcloture \ntime on the motion to concur with respect to H.R. 2146 be considered \nexpired, the pending motion to concur with amendment be withdrawn, and \nthe Senate vote on the motion to concur; that if cloture on H.R. 1295 \nis invoked, all postcloture time be considered expired, all motions and \namendments be withdrawn except the motion to concur with amendment, and \nthe Senate immediately vote on the motion to concur with amendment; \nfurther, that following the disposition of H.R. 1295, all time on the \ncompound motion to go to conference under rule XXVIII on H.R. 644 be \nyielded back and the Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture with \nthe mandatory quorum waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are now one vote away from final passage \nof our bill to renew trade promotion authority. One more vote and we \ncan finally, and at long last, send this important bill to the \nPresident's desk. That vote is expected to take place within the next \n25 minutes.\n  This is a critical day for our country. In fact, I would call it a \nhistoric day. It has taken us a while to get there, longer than many of \nus would have liked. But we all know that anything worth doing takes \neffort. Believe me, this bill has been worth the effort. This is, I \nbelieve, the most important bill we will pass in the Senate this year. \nIt will help reassert Congress's role over the U.S. trade negotiations \nand reestablish the United States as a strong player in international \ntrade.\n  Renewing TPA has been a top priority for me for many years, and as \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I am pleased that with the \nhelp of Ranking Member Wyden, we have been able to deliver a robust and \nbipartisan bill. It has also been a high priority for the Senate \nmajority leader. Thanks to his strong support and leadership, we are \none step away from completing this important task.\n  This bill will help farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and our \nentrepreneurs throughout our country get better access to foreign \nmarkets and allow them to compete on a level playing field. This bill \nwill help give these job creators and the workers they employ greater \nopportunities to grow their businesses, which will help create a \nhealthier American economy. The business and agricultural communities \nunderstand the importance of strong trade agreements. That is why they \ncame together in strong support of this important legislation. We have \nheard from all of them throughout this debate. I appreciate their \nenthusiasm and support.\n  This has, from the outset, been a bipartisan effort, and I am glad \nthat it has remained that way. Throughout this entire debate--here in \nthe Senate and over in the House and here in the Senate again--we have \nbeen able to maintain a bipartisan coalition in support of TPA, fair \ntrade, and expanded market access to U.S. exporters. This is no small \nfeat. I am appreciative of everyone who has worked so hard to make this \npossible.\n  With this final vote, we can complete the work we began so many years \nago. But let's be clear. Passing TPA is not the end of the story; it is \njust the beginning. As chairman of the Finance Committee, I intend to \nremain vigilant in our oversight as the administration pursues the \nnegotiating objectives that Congress has set with this legislation. If \nthey fall short, I will be among the first to hold them accountable. \nBut that is for another day.\n  Today, I urge my colleagues to help us finalize this historic \nachievement and join me in voting in favor of this bipartisan TPA bill. \nIf the vote moves the way I think it will, today will be remembered as \na good day for the Senate, the President, and the American people.\n  Once we vote to pass TPA, we will then be voting to invoke cloture on \nthe Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015. This bill will reauthorize \nand improve three of our trade preference programs: the Generalized \nSystem of Preferences, or GSP; the African Growth and Opportunity Act, \nor AGOA; and tariff preferences for Haiti. I want to take some time to \nreiterate why each of these programs is important.\n\n[[Page S4580]]\n\n  First, the GSP promotes trade with developing nations by providing \nduty-free tariff treatment of certain products originating in those \ncountries. The program helps beneficiary countries advance their \neconomic development and move toward more open economies. It also helps \nmanufacturers and importers in the United States to receive inputs and \nraw materials at lower costs.\n  Approximately three-quarters of U.S. imports under the GSP are raw \nmaterials, parts and components, or machinery and equipment used by \nU.S. companies to manufacture goods here at home.\n  The program expired in 2013. As a result, businesses that would \ntypically benefit from this program have had to deal with high tariffs \non these imports for the last 2 years. Last year alone, American \ncompanies paid over $600 million in tariffs that would otherwise have \nbeen eliminated with the GSP in place. Once we finally pass this bill, \nwe will take a long overdue step toward solving these problems.\n  The preferences bill also includes a long-term renewal of the AGOA \nProgram, which lowers U.S. tariffs on the exports of qualified sub-\nSaharan African countries, encouraging them to further develop their \neconomy. Since AGOA was enacted in 2000, trade with beneficiary \ncountries has more than tripled, with U.S. direct investment in \nbeneficiary countries growing more than sixfold during that time.\n  The program has also helped to create more than 1 million jobs in \nthose countries. The AGOA authorization in this preferences bill will \nimprove on this past success.\n  Some of our colleagues here in the Congress have voiced concerns \nabout the AGOA Program and the failure of some beneficiary countries to \nlive up to their commitments. I share many of these concerns. We tried \nto address them with this bill. Most notably, the bill creates a \nmechanism under the AGOA Program to allow for benefits to be scaled \nback if a country is found not to be making good faith progress on \neligibility criteria. We expect the administration to use this new tool \naggressively.\n  Finally, the preferences bill will also extend preferential access to \nthe U.S. market for Haiti. As we all know, Haiti is one of the poorest \ncountries in the Western Hemisphere. The Haiti preference programs \nsupport the creation of jobs and stability in a country dealing with \ndebilitating poverty and unemployment. I hope this extension will \nencourage continued economic development and democracy in Haiti.\n  It is easy to see why these programs have all received bipartisan \nsupport. I expect that support to continue. In addition to those \npreferences programs, the bill we will be voting on includes \nlegislation introduced by Senators Portman and Brown to strengthen the \nenforcement and administration of our antidumping and countervailing \nduty laws. As I have noted in the past, antidumping and countervailing \nduty laws are among the most important trade tools we have to protect \nU.S. companies from unfair foreign trade practices.\n  A number of Utah companies do benefit from these laws, which allow \nthem to compete against imports that unfairly benefit from the support \nof foreign governments. I am pleased we were able to include this \nlegislation in the preferences bill.\n  Finally, also included in this bill is an extension of the trade \nadjustment assistance, or TAA, Program. I think I have said enough \nabout my opposition to this program here on the floor over the past \nseveral weeks. I will not delve too deeply into that issue here. \nHowever, I do understand that for many of my colleagues who want to \nsupport TPA and free trade, passage of TAA is a prerequisite.\n  From the outset of this debate over trade promotion authority, I have \ncommitted to my colleagues to working to ensure that both TAA and TPA \nmove on parallel tracks. I plan to make good on this commitment, and \ntoday will show that. That is why, despite my misgivings about TAA, and \nwith the entire picture in view, I plan to vote for this latest version \nof the trade preferences bill.\n  Back in April, the Senate Finance Committee reported four separate \ntrade bills. All of these bills have enjoyed bipartisan support and are \npriorities for many Members of Congress. I committed to doing all that \nI could to get all of these bills through Congress and onto the \nPresident's desk. While the path has taken some unexpected turns, I \nthink the light at the end of the tunnel at this point is very visible. \nOnce again, we will shortly be voting to pass our TPA bill and send it \nto the President. Shortly thereafter, I expect that we will pass our \ntrade preferences bill, which includes TAA, and send it to the House, \nwhere I think it will pass, hopefully, without much difficulty.\n  Then we expect to appoint conferees on the Customs bill, which will \nget us closer to the finish line on that important legislation. \nNeedless to say, I am pleased with these developments. I think they \nspeak well of what Congress is able to do when Members work together to \naddress important issues and solve real problems.\n  Once again, I thank my colleagues for working with us on the \nbipartisan effort to update and improve U.S. trade policy. Most \nnotably, I once again thank Senator Wyden for his assistance and \nsupport throughout this effort and on all of these trade bills. He has \nbeen a great partner and deserves much of the credit for getting us \nthis far. I also thank our distinguished majority leader for his \nunwavering support, even in the most difficult times. I also need to \nthank Chairman Ryan of the House Ways and Means Committee, who has been \na coauthor and a key partner in this endeavor. Of course, I thank \nSpeaker Boehner and the House Republican leadership for their efforts \nin getting us through all the twists and turns we have had to take to \nget to this point.\n  We also need to give credit to President Obama and Ambassador Froman \nfor their work in building and maintaining a coalition of support for \nthis entire undertaking.\n  Ultimately, I need to thank everyone who supported our work on these \nbills in the Senate, in the House, in the administration, and \nelsewhere, but that list is too long for me to go through on the floor. \nI just hope everyone who had a hand in today's success knows I am \ngrateful for the work they have put in. I hope we can build on this \nsuccess and that we can find more ways to work together to help the \nAmerican people solve our Nation's problems.\n  I also praise my chief trade counsel on this matter, Everett \nEissenstat, who with his vast foreign policy experience and trade \nexperience has been nothing but a tremendous help to me.\n  Chris Campbell, who is our chief of staff on the Finance Committee, \nhas played another role; Jay Khosla, who is one of my chief policy \nadvisers; and the rest of my staff: Mark Prater, Jeff Wrase, Bryan \nHickman, Shane Warren, Rebecca Eubank, Kevin Rosenbaum.\n  I compliment Senator Wyden's staff as well: Joshua Sheinkman, Jayme \nWhite, Elissa Alben, Greta Peisch, Anderson Heiman, and Michael Evans. \nThey have worked long and hard and, really, we have had a lot of good \ndays together and a lot of tough days together, but hopefully it will \ncome out all right.\n  I can say without reservation that I look forward to tackling the \nbipartisan challenges that lie ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, it has been said that there is nothing \ncertain in life but death and taxes.\n  I would suggest there is a third item that can be included in that \nsaying, and that is bad news about ObamaCare, because if there is one \nthing that can be counted on, it is the regular revelation of new \nObamaCare failures.\n  This past week, we learned that the Obama administration cannot \nverify whether almost $3 billion in subsidies that it paid to insurance \ncompanies during the first 4 months of 2014 was properly paid. Thanks \nto the government's failure to ensure that a reporting system was in \nplace by the time exchange plans went into effect in 2014, the \ngovernment made payments to insurance companies without any way of \nverifying if the payments were correct or if the people it made \npayments for were still enrolled in their plans.\n  Unfortunately, missing systems are just par for the course when it \ncomes to the President's health care law.\n  I don't need to remind anyone of the massive breakdowns that occurred\n\n[[Page S4581]]\n\nwhen the partially finished healthcare.gov kicked off 2 years ago. The \nPresident himself referred to healthcare.gov last week as a ``well-\ndocumented disaster.''\n  But as bad as these problems have been for a health care law that the \nPresident once claimed would make purchasing health care as easy as \nshopping on Amazon, they are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes \nto ObamaCare.\n  Two weeks ago, I came to the floor to talk about the massive rate \nhikes customers on exchanges are facing for 2016. Let me just read a \ncouple headlines from the first week in June. CNN: ``Obamacare sticker \nshock: Big rate hikes proposed for 2016.'' From the New York Times: \n``Many Health Insurers Go Big With Initial 2016 Rate Requests.'' From \nthe Wall Street Journal: ``More Health-Care Insurers Seek Big Premium \nIncreases.'' From the Associated Press: ``8 Minnesota Health Plans \nPropose Big Premium Hikes for 2016.'' From the Newark Star-Ledger: \n``Premiums to jump more than 10 percent on many Obamacare policies.''\n  I could go on. Nationwide, insurers have requested double-digit \npremium increases on hundreds of individual and small group plans for \n2016. More than 6 million people are enrolled in plans facing average \nrate increases of 10 percent or more. Around the country, rate \nincreases of 20, 30, and even 40 percent are common.\n  Yet the President promised that his health care plan ``would bring \ndown the cost of healthcare for millions.'' Well, in fact, the \nPresident's health care law has been driving up the cost of health care \nfor millions since its inception. The average family health care \npremium has increased by almost $3,500 since 2009, despite the \nPresident's promise that health insurance costs for families would \ndecrease by $2,500 if his law were passed.\n  I could go on about ObamaCare's many failures. I could talk about the \nState exchanges that are failing or those that have already failed. I \ncould talk about the individuals who lost their health insurance \nplans--plans, I might add, that they liked--as a result of this law. I \ncould talk about the people who no longer can see doctors they saw for \nyears because their new ObamaCare plans have severely limited the \nnetwork of doctors they can see. I could talk about the small \nbusinesses that are struggling with the costs imposed by ObamaCare or \nthe fact that the Congressional Budget Office has stated that the law \nwill reduce work hours equivalent to 2 million full-time workers by the \nyear 2017.\n  I think every American gets the point. ObamaCare is broken. It has \nbeen broken from the beginning. It has failed to deliver on the \npromise--the President's promise--of more affordable, accessible health \ncare, and it has made things worse for American families.\n  In the next few days, the Supreme Court will release its decision in \nthe King v. Burwell case. If the Supreme Court abolishes or phases out \nthe ObamaCare subsidies, Republicans will take action to provide \neffective assistance to Americans to repeal the mandates that forced \nthese Americans to buy government-approved insurance in the first \nplace. Our plan will protect families while we move away from costly, \ntop-down, government-mandated health care and toward a system that will \nactually drive down costs and increase choices for American families.\n  President Obama promised that his health care law would be a solution \nto the problems plaguing our health care system. The last 5 years have \nproved that ObamaCare is anything but. Not only did ObamaCare fail to \nsolve the existing problems in our health care system, it has created \nentirely new ones, and American families are those who are suffering as \na result.\n  It is time for Democrats to stop defending this broken law and start \nworking with Republicans to replace it with real health care reform \nthat will lower costs, put patients back in charge, and provide greater \naccess to quality care. That is what we should be working on. That is \nwhat the American people expect, and it is long overdue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nspeak for up to 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the greatest \ndomestic policy train wreck we have seen in our lifetime, a \nfundamentally flawed law that is holding back our economy and limiting \npeople's freedom when it comes to choices in health care. Of course, I \nam talking about the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare.\n  ObamaCare was the creation of a Democratic supermajority that crammed \nObamaCare through Congress without open debate by the American people. \nIn the last 5 years since ObamaCare became law, the American people \nhave not yielded in their strong opposition to ObamaCare. In fact, \ntoday, more than a majority of Americans continue to disapprove of this \nlaw, and there is no wonder why.\n  When I am back home in Georgia, one of the most frequent and sobering \nconcerns I hear about is the insidious, negative economic impact of \nthis law. The consequences of ObamaCare are hurting Georgians in many \nways and millions of Americans.\n  First, the individual mandate is forcing people onto ObamaCare, \nwhether they can afford it or not. Like my wife Bonnie and I, many \npeople have had their insurance plans actually canceled, lost access to \ntheir preferred doctors or were forced onto insurance plans that cost \nmore, not less. In Georgia alone, dozens of ObamaCare plans are \nexpected to have double-digit rate hikes next year, with some people's \nplans skyrocketing over 60 percent. That is just unacceptable.\n  Second, ObamaCare's employer mandate is causing small businesses to \ncut back workers' hours and, in some cases, businesses have actually \nstopped hiring completely. Due to the 30-hour workweek rule inside \nObamaCare, many people are being forced to move from full-time to part-\ntime work. This is devastating the families already struggling to get \nfrom payday to payday. Without a full workweek, many moms and dads are \njuggling multiple part-time jobs to provide for their families and try \nto save for the future. Next year, for example, 2.6 million people are \nin danger of having their hours cut because of ObamaCare. Sixty percent \nof those individuals are female and over 60 percent are the young, \nfirst-time workers between 18 and 35 years of age.\n  Third, given the growing, aging population, ObamaCare is contributing \nto a dangerous doctor shortage. The Association of American Medical \nColleges is predicting a shortage of as many as 90,000 doctors by 2025.\n  Another survey by the Physicians Foundation found that 81 percent of \ndoctors describe themselves as either overextended or at full capacity, \nand 44 percent said they planned to cut back on the number of patients \nthey see, retire, work part time or actually close their practice to \nnew patients.\n  Ultimately, ObamaCare is raising costs, not lowering them; cutting \nworkers' wages, not growing them; decreasing access, not expanding it; \nand making it harder on the middle class, not easier.\n  While the sentiment of the Supreme Court on ObamaCare is still to be \ndetermined, one thing is crystal clear: ObamaCare is hurting people and \nour economy. It must be fully repealed and replaced.\n  We have to stop allowing Washington to dictate what is best for \nindividuals and their families. Putting bureaucrats between patients \nand their doctors, between patients and their insurance provider, and \nbetween doctors and the insurance providers is what created this \ncatastrophe in the first place.\n  ObamaCare was wrong from the start. We have seen the growing \nunintended consequences of this flawed law in its implementation over \nthe last 5 years. We now have the power to change course and create a \nbetter health care system for all Americans. I remain committed to \nusing every tool at our disposal to repeal ObamaCare.\n  Achieving consensus on repealing ObamaCare with a patient-based \nalternative will require diligence and robust debate, but I am hopeful \nwe can achieve that goal. I urge my colleagues to continue to work not \njust to fight against ObamaCare but to fight to protect the millions of \npeople who are hurt by it every day.\n\n[[Page S4582]]\n\n  We can create a health care system that offers the American people \naffordability, transportability, and yes, insurability. We can create \ncommonsense health care policy that lowers costs and doesn't harm the \neconomy like ObamaCare. And yes, we can create a bipartisan solution \nthat helps people by putting patients first and getting Washington out \nof the way.\n  It won't be easy, but is achievable. It must be achievable. For the \nsake of our kids and grandkids we must do this. We must get rid of \nObamaCare once and for all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner).

Mr. President, I stand before you today and before the \nNation not as a Senator, not as an elected official but as a humble \nSouth Carolinian. The past week has been one of terrible tragedy and \namazing unity.\n  Last Wednesday night, we experienced an unimaginable tragedy. Nine \nmen and women--nine mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, sons, \ndaughters--were lost forever. The hateful and racist actions of one \nderanged man have changed nine families forever. It has changed South \nCarolina forever and Charleston forever. But what we saw from the nine \nfamilies at last Friday's bond hearing was simple. It was powerful and \nabsolutely the best of who we are as Americans.\n  A few minutes ago I was in the cloakroom, and I had the opportunity \nto talk to one of the victim's sons, Daniel Simmons, Jr. I was talking \nto him back there.\n  I said: Is there anything you want me to share when I go on the floor \nof the Senate?\n  He said: Please share that God cares for his people. God still lives.\n  I was amazed.\n  Then he said with great enthusiasm and energy and a sense of \nexcitement: This evil attack will lead to reconciliation, restoration, \nand unity in our Nation.\n  Those are powerful words.\n  It is with great sadness and amazing hope that our future as a nation \nhas been changed. It has been changed because one person decided to \nmurder nine. It has been changed because the response of those nine \nfamilies has been so courageous and so inspiring.\n  If you permit me, I will read the names of those nine individuals.\n  We honor the Reverend Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, beloved teacher and \ncoach at Goose Greek High School. Her son Chris has shown us all what \nan amazing mother she was through his strength over the past 6 days.\n  We honor Cynthia Hurd, whose love for education has been shared for \nover 31 years as a librarian in the public library system.\n  We honor Susie Jackson, who at 87 years young still offered her \nbeautiful voice to the choir and had recently returned from visiting \nher family in Ohio.\n  We honor Ethel Lee Lance, who served her church with pride and whose \ndaughter calls her the strong woman who just tried to keep her family \ntogether.\n  We honor Depayne Middleton-Doctor, who dedicated her life to serving \nthe poor and helping her students as an enrollment counselor at \nSouthern Wesleyan University.\n  We honor my good friend, the Reverend Clementa Pinckney, an amazing \nman of faith, a great dad, and a wonderful father.\n  We honor Tywanza Sanders, beloved son of Tyrone and Felicia, whose \nwarmth and heartfelt spirit has kept us moving.\n  We honor the Reverend Daniel Simmons, Sr., whose granddaughter said: \nMy granddaddy was an amazing man. It seemed like every time he spoke, \nit was pure wisdom.\n  And we honor Pastor Myra Thompson, who served the Lord with grace and \ndignity. She loved her children, her grandchildren, and her great \ngrandchildren.\n  If you would pause for 9 seconds, I would appreciate it.\n  (Moment of Silence.)\n  Thank you.\n  In closing, I want to thank all of my colleagues in the Senate and \nthe House for their kind words over the past week and for the prayers \nthat continue to come into our city from across the Nation.\n  We are Charleston, we are South Carolina, and we are absolutely \nunited. We are committed to replacing hate with love, pain with \nkindness, and ill will and hostility with goodwill and comfort.\n  I yield to Senator Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to recognize Senator Scott. We all \nknow Senator Scott is a man of quiet\n\n[[Page S4583]]\n\nfaith. He does it when no one is looking, by the way. I remember being \nin the cloakroom watching a basketball game, which is consistent with \nme, and the Senator was over in the corner with headphones on. I said: \nWhat are you listening to or what are you doing?\n  He said very sheepishly: I am doing my Bible study.\n  Senator Scott has been a great comfort to our State because he is \ntruly a man of God.\n  To the rest of you, I want to tell people in South Carolina that in \nthe Senate we have a lot of differences and we display them a lot. I \nwish you could have heard what was said to me and Senator Scott. \nEverybody in this body has come up to us in one way or another and said \nthe most kind things. In the Senate we have our problems, but we are \nstill a family. Thank you all, from all over this country, for the \nkindness you have shown during these difficult times.\n  Very quickly, I don't know how you can sit with somebody for an hour \nin a church and pray with them and get up and shoot them. That is \nMideast hate. I didn't think it was something we had here, but \napparently we do.\n  I just can't imagine what it takes of an individual to be welcomed in \na church--here is what happened. He went to Charleston with a plan. The \npeople in the church had no idea who he was or what he had in mind. He \ncame into the church, and he was sitting in the pews by himself and \nthey invited him up for the Bible study and spent an hour with him.\n  And he said: They were so nice, I almost backed out.\n  That says a lot about them. It says a lot about him. But Senator \nScott mentioned something that I cannot get over. Within 48 hours of \nhaving your family member murdered, to appear in a public setting, \nlooking at the guy in the eye and to say: You ruined my life but I love \nyou and I forgive you--that is a level of love and understanding that \ncan only come from some higher authority. I don't have that within me.\n  When it comes to representing South Carolina, Senator Scott and I \nwill do our best. But on our best day, we are nowhere close to these \npeople. There is no politician in America who can represent their State \nbetter than the people of Mother Emanuel AME Church when they went to a \npublic place, looked the killer in the eye and said: I forgive you; I \nam praying for you.\n  I wish we could muster that kind of love for each other, just for a \nlittle bit. What would America be like?\n  Thank you all for your kindness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4583-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, the nuclear negotiations with Iran are now \napproaching a self-imposed deadline of June 30, just a few days from \nnow. The negotiators chose that deadline when they concluded the \ninterim accord 6 months ago and have reportedly been determined to \nstick to it to focus their efforts.\n  At the same time, it may be the case that a brief extension deadline \nrather than a rush to a conclusion that would bring us to a bad deal is \nsomething we ought to consider. Senator Corker has told Secretary Kerry \nexactly that, cautioning him that there is no need so desperate that \nrequires either accepting a bad deal or yielding to unacceptable \nIranian demands. I don't necessarily oppose a short-term extension to \nreach a better conclusion or a better deal, but I have deep concerns \nabout whether that will be the case, even if we extend for a small \namount of time.\n  I fear the Obama administration is not hearing the message that a \npotential bad deal could be in the making, and it raises great concern. \nI fear that yielding to one Iranian demand after another in order to \nsecure a deal is exactly what the Obama administration has been doing \nin its negotiations. I fear that we will return from our Independence \nDay celebrations to take up a pending Iran nuclear deal that neither \npermanently foils Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions nor makes us or the \nworld more secure. I fear this administration, so seemingly desperately \neager for a legacy, will choose to define any Iranian deal at all as a \ngreat success for diplomacy, no matter how much it concedes to Iranian \npositions.\n  In May, I and many of my colleagues worked hard to impose a \nrequirement for the administration to present any Iran deal to \nCongress. Despite strong opposition from the Obama administration, 99 \nof the 100 Senators were convinced that Congress must have the ability \nto evaluate in detail every aspect of a negotiated settlement and how \nit is to be imposed, how it is to be monitored, and verified. That is \nour core task once a deal is presented to us. It is an immensely \nimportant duty of historic dimensions.\n  I hope and pray that each of us will evaluate the proposed deal on \nits merits alone and what it would mean for our Nation's security, both \nnow and in the future when the terms have expired. Unfortunately, to \ntake up that duty and perform that task, we will have to immerse \nourselves in some of the arcane technical details that lie near the \nheart of such negotiations. I say ``near'' the heart rather than ``at'' \nthe heart because the very central issue for me--and hopefully for my \ncolleagues--is the nature of the Iranian regime, their proven, \ndemonstrated ill will revealed by decades of murderous aggression and \nlying deceit. That is the proven record of our negotiating partner, and \nall their claimed commitments will have to be evaluated in that light.\n  However, evaluating the technical details will present its own \nchallenges and we need to prepare ourselves for those challenges. We \nneed to take stock now of some of those details as they appear at the \nmoment any deal is finalized. To do that, we will have to look through \na fog of claims and counterclaims to see the outlines of something that \nis still evolving, even as it remains in the shadows. But with just \nthose partial images, I have some deep concerns.\n  First, it now appears from public comments that our negotiators--and \nespecially Secretary Kerry himself--are no longer insisting that Iran \ncome clean on its past nuclear weapons development activities. This has \nlong been a central demand by our side, as often confirmed by our \nnegotiators themselves. To cave on this demand would be a fatal flaw \nand should all by itself lead to rejection of the deal.\n  Let me state that again. To cave on this demand that Iran come clean \non its past nuclear weapons development activities all by itself should \nlead to rejection of the deal, if we do not achieve that goal.\n  The International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, has been pressing for \ninformation from Iran about the past nuclear weapons programs for \nyears. Recently, the IAEA Director General explained the importance of \nthe issue this way:\n\n       What we don't know [is] whether they have undeclared \n     activities or something else. We don't know what they did in \n     the past. So, we know a part of their activities, but we \n     cannot tell we know all of their activities. And that is why \n     we cannot say that all the activities in Iran is in peaceful \n     purposes . . . the Agency is not in a position to provide \n     credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear \n     material and activities in Iran, and therefore to conclude \n     that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities.\n\n  The Obama administration has long agreed with the IAEA that Iran \nneeds to come clean on its past activities to create a baseline for \nunderstanding future activities under any agreement--an absolutely \nessential standard that has to be met.\n  The U.S. head negotiator, Wendy Sherman--who, incidentally, \nnegotiated the utterly failed deal with North Korea as well--told a \nSenate committee in 2013 that ``Iran must agree to address past and \npresent practices, which is the IAEA terminology for possible military \ndimensions . . . we intend to support the IAEA in its efforts to deal \nwith possible military dimensions.'' Later, she told the SFRC that ``in \nthe Joint Plan of Action we have required that Iran come clean.''\n\n  These are the statements of our negotiators. These are the \ncommitments they made to the Senate and to the American people that \nthese were the standards that could not be breached and that if it was \nnot a part of the arrangement, then we would not accept this deal.\n  So we are quoting here from the record of what policy and what \nconditions the United States has laid out before the Iranians that, if \nnot achieved, are a nonstarter of a deal.\n  Secretary Kerry has repeatedly said that the possible military \ndimensions of the Iranian nuclear program ``will have to be addressed'' \nand ``that Iranians will have to do it.''\n  ``It will be done,'' he said.\n  However, I was shocked to read last week that Secretary Kerry told \nthis to the Department of State press corps:\n\n       We are not fixated on Iran specifically accounting for what \n     they did at one point in time or another. We know what they \n     did. We have no doubt. We have absolute knowledge with \n     respect to the certain military activities they were engaged \n     in. What we are concerned about is going forward.\n\n  First of all, this is completely misleading. It is a complete 180-\ndegree turn from what had been committed to earlier. As a member of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, I can state emphatically that we do not \nhave absolute knowledge of anything. That is not how intelligence \nworks.\n\n[[Page S4586]]\n\n  Secretary Kerry's statement suggests that he may be misusing one of \nour most useful tools of statecraft--perhaps a more concerning issue \nthan the statement itself.\n  If we did have absolute knowledge of what the Iranians had done and \nhave done to this date, we would not have spent the past years joining \nwith the IAEA and the responsible international community to demand \nthat Iran come clean. For the life of me, I cannot understand what the \nSecretary is thinking about when making such a claim. It is in total \ncontradiction of a key facet--maybe the key facet of this deal.\n  Now, suddenly we are backing away, saying ``We know everything'' when \nwe have for years been pursuing with the IAEA to get the knowledge of \nwhat we do know and the IAEA basically saying to us: No, we don't know \neverything. There is a lot we do not know.\n  In any case, I regard this new position as a blatant reversal of a \nkey part of our negotiating objectives and a capitulation to the \nIranians--a capitulation that reveals, perhaps, how desperate the \nadministration is to secure a deal--any deal.\n  The next point of concern is the type and pace of sanctions relief we \nseem to be dangling as an incentive for the Iranians to accept any \ndeal. This issue is very complex technically, legally, and \nlegislatively. One key point is that throughout these negotiations, the \nadministration has consistently argued that any deal would lead only to \nsanctions relief regarding nuclear issues. But the fact sheet that the \nWhite House put out following the interim deal framework stated that \nU.S. sanctions on Iran for terrorism, human rights abuses, and \nballistic missiles will remain in place under the deal.\n  Let me say that again. The administration put out this fact sheet \nfollowing the interim deal stating that U.S. sanctions on Iran for \nterrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missiles will remain in \nplace under the deal.\n  Now it seems this limitation was not good enough for the Iranians, \nand we have caved again.\n  Yesterday, the so-called Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, included \nthis matter in his expanded list of redlines. He said that all \neconomic, financial, and banking sanctions implemented either by the \nUnited Nations Security Council, the United States Congress, or the \nadministration must be lifted immediately when the deal is signed.\n  According to media reports, which have not been refuted by the \nadministration since they began appearing last month, the Supreme \nLeader has won again.\n  The emerging deal may roll back sanctions that had been imposed for \nthese other nonnuclear reasons. According to these reports, based on \nleaks from the negotiating teams, 23 out of the 24 currently sanctioned \nIranian banks will be delisted as sanctions targets, including the \nCentral Bank of Iran. This is the Revolutionary Guard Corps-dominated \ninstitution that was sanctioned because of its role in money \nlaundering, financing terrorism, ballistic weapons research, and \ncampaign claims of bolstering the Assad regime in Syria. Removing \nsanctions applied to these banks will give Iran hundreds of billions of \ndollars that could be used for their terrorism activities in regional \nproxy wars.\n  These reports, if true, constitute yet another reversal of clearly \nstated policy and yet another capitulation to the Iranians.\n  No. 3, it appears that negotiators may be aiming at an arrangement to \nset aside the dispute about open, free access to Iranian facilities. We \nhave long maintained that any agreement would have to give the IAEA \nsuch access--stated over and over to us through our briefings, by the \nSecretary, and by others negotiating this. What this means is open, \nfree access anytime, anywhere. It appears this is not now the case. We \nhave long maintained that the IAEA have access anytime, anyplace, as \ntheir spokesmen have often emphasized. President Obama himself \nreassured the region's nervous Arab leaders on this very point in an \neffort to gain their acceptance of the deal.\n  In the meantime, once again Ayatollah Khamenei, the Supreme Leader, \nhas stated emphatically that no such access would be granted, and other \nIranian authorities repeated this redline that the Iranians have drawn \nin the deal and that we are capitulating to, one after another. Their \nParliament even recently passed a law to this effect. It looked like an \nunbridgeable gap. Khamenei repeated this firm position again just \nyesterday.\n\n  Some argue that Khamenei's declarations are part of the negotiating \nstrategy. Well, if so, it seems to have worked. Anyplace access for \nintrusive inspection has been taken out. We have dropped ``anytime, \nanyplace.''\n  The buzzword phrase that now is being giving to us is ``managed \naccess.'' When I first heard that, I said, what in the world does that \nmean, ``managed access''? With this concept, it appears there would now \nbe a mechanism that would evaluate requests for access to determine if \nthere is a genuine need. Instead of anytime, anyplace, anywhere, for \nany reason, in order to verify that the Iranians are not cheating, that \nhas turned into now a request for a search or for access at their time \nand their decision as to what the place will be or what the place will \nnot be. This makes a mockery of the state of the original required \ndemand for access at anytime, anyplace. ``Access where needed, when \nneeded'' seems to be the new mantra--where needed, when needed, giving \nthem plenty of time to make a decision as to yea or nay or to remove \nfrom those sites damning evidence of their pursuit of nuclear \ncapabilities.\n  Because this issue of access is crucial to the issue of credibility, \nverification, and compliance, it arguably is the most important \nrequirement of all for an acceptable deal. Those advocating for the \nemerging deal are actually boasting that this artful dodging is a \nnegotiating victory.\n  Is there anything more we need to say about the weak and compromising \nnegotiating strategy of those who are currently at the table \nrepresenting the United States? I have just named and spelled out three \nmajor concerns regarding these negotiations, but there are many other \naspects of the apparently emerging deal that separately and together \nshow a pattern--a very disturbing pattern of constant retreat and \ncapitulation by this administration in the negotiations with the \nIranians. I won't go into the details of each of these, but let me just \nrun off several other issues of major concern.\n  One, the clearly inadequate timeframe for any agreement, the sunset \nclause--it is no longer a part of the negotiations; two, outrageously \ngenerous details of sanctions relief, both scale and timing; the almost \nlaughable, specious claims of sanctions snapback provisions--whatever \nthat means--once the sanctions regime has been dismantled; the number \nof and types of enrichment equipment to be retained by the Iranians; \nthe types of enrichment activities that will be permitted in the \nthousands of modern centrifuges in the most fortified, bunkered \nfacilities; fatal limitations on our ability to monitor and verify \ncompliance; and the Joint Plan of Action provisions that Iran has \nalready blatantly violated without any White House comment.\n  My colleagues, once a deal is announced, it will be critical that we \nexercise the wisdom and courage to evaluate it honestly. My doubts \nabout our ability to do so are aggravated by the public relations \ncampaign we can foresee. Indeed, we have seen it before when the \nClinton administration told us the nuclear deal with North Korea was \n``good for America.'' I was a Member of the Senate at that time. I \nraised a number of issues and concerns about whether this deal with \nNorth Korea was good for America. I did not vote to support that \neffort. Nevertheless, the treaty was agreed to.\n  The framework agreement with North Korea, President Clinton said in \n1994, ``is a good deal for the United States. North Korea will freeze \nand dismantle its nuclear programs.'' North Korea will freeze and \ndismantle its nuclear programs. ``South Korea and our other allies will \nbe better protected. The entire world will be safer as we slow the \nspread of nuclear weapons. . . . The United States and international \ninspectors will carefully monitor North Korea to make sure it keeps its \ncommitments. Only as it does so will North Korea fully join the \ncommunity of nations.''\n  That is what was promised in 1994. That is what was stated to \nSenators on\n\n[[Page S4587]]\n\nthis floor in 1994--that we can count on the fact that we are going to \nknow if the North Koreans cheat and we are not going to allow them to \ndo that. How significantly this resonates now, all these years later, \nas we are assured by the administration and by Secretary Kerry: Don't \nworry. Everything is covered. Inspections will take place. They won't \nbe able to cheat. We will know it if they do. The sanctions will come \nback on. We will snap back those sanctions, et cetera, et cetera.\n  Some Members took a bite of that apple and regret that. I did not. I \nam sure not going to take another bite of that apple, and no one else \nshould view this current negotiation with Iran without putting it in \nthe context of what was done before. We have been here before. We need \nto learn the lessons from that. We now know that North Korea possesses \ndozens of nuclear weapons and the ballistic missile capacity to deliver \nthose weapons. We now know they cheated blatantly and we did not know \nit. The so-called guarantee of verification was not accomplished and \nnot achieved.\n  So before making a final decision on the Iran so-called deal, we need \nto learn the lessons from the Clinton administration and the agreement \nwith North Korea. The similarities between the secret negotiations then \nand the secret ones now are remarkable.\n  In 1994, a key sticking point was complete access to nuclear sites, \nand then, too, we caved in order to get the deal.\n  In 1994, the White House and major media outlets trumpeted a deal \nthat would make the world safer--a victory for diplomacy over force and \nhostility. Those who did not see this as something that was going to be \nenforced were called warmongers.\n  Here is the choice, war or peace. Some choice. North Korea promised \nto forgo their nuclear weapons ambitions, and although I could not vote \nto support President Clinton's request, enough of the Senate did to \napprove the agreement with North Korea.\n  Now we know they have between 20 to 40 nuclear weapons, possibly \nminiaturized, ICBMs--intercontinental ballistic missiles--to put them \non and recently tested submarine launch missiles.\n  Another lesson is the time gap between the heralded diplomatic \nbreakthrough and the revelation that we had been taken to the cleaners. \nIt took years to learn what we had really done in North Korea and not \ndone in North Korea.\n  The failure of a bad deal with Iran will not be evident to most of us \nfor years perhaps--perhaps even 10, 11 or 12 years, even when President \nObama concedes that Iran's nuclear breakout time will be zero.\n  In fact, such a delay--in the unlikely event Iran actually complies \nwith a deal--is the stated objective of the P5+1 negotiators--to impose \na delay of a decade or so on Iran's nuclear weapons program. That is \nwhat they will define as success.\n  But we must remember this: Today's brutal, unhinged, nuclear-armed \nNorth Korea is actually a product of misguided and naive American \ndiplomacy, sold to the Senate as something other than what it was. We \nnow know the agreement with North Korea was not a diplomatic victory \nbut a diplomatic and policy failure, an absolute failure. My deep \nconcern is that this time many will, once again, see the emerging deal \nas a great victory for diplomacy, no matter what it contains.\n  The utterly false claim that it presents a choice between peaceful \nresolution of a dispute and war, as a consequence of not arranging and \nagreeing to a deal, will be a central part of the discourse and \nsalesmanship that will confront us as Senators. Those opposed will \npotentially be labeled as war mongers.\n  It is good of us to remember something that was said by Winston \nChurchill leading up to World War II: Peace at any price does not lead \nto peace. It only lengthens the path for war with far greater \nconsequences in terms of cost or blood.\n  So, for us, we are going to have to stand up to those who posit the \nfalse choice between peace and between war. We have a more difficult \nobligation of historic consequences, looking to the following decade. \nSuch a duty must not be guided by party. It must not be guided by \npolitics. It must not be guided by deference either to the White House, \nour own leadership or even our constituents.\n  We must look at each and every detail of any agreement presented to \nus to reach a judgment on whether this so-called deal with Iran will \nprevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons capability. Then, and only \nthen, we must decide on that basis whether to approve or reject the \ndeal that will be presented to us by the President and his Secretary of \nState. To do anything less than fulfilling this obligation and this \nduty that each one of us has, will be a failure of our duty as a U.S. \nSenator, with historic consequences if we get it wrong.\n  My hope, prayer, wish, desire, and admonition is that each one of us \nsees this as something with historic consequences that will affect not \nonly the future of our Nation and our people but will affect the future \nof the world. Therefore, we must give full attention and every ounce of \nour best wisdom and judgment in determining, not for political or party \nor any other reason--other than finding out and determining whether \nthis deal is acceptable or not acceptable and make our yes be yes and \nour no be no and well reasoned, well judged, and well decided.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this Saturday, June 27, marks Post-\nTraumatic Stress Disorder--or PTSD--Awareness Day.\n  This marks a critical opportunity to remind people about the \nprevalence of mental illnesses such as PTSD among our Active-Duty \ntroops and our veterans. By generating more awareness, we can help \nremove the stigma about PTSD and encourage people to seek treatment \nand, in turn, save lives. PTSD is a serious problem affecting too many \nof our country's bravest individuals, and we must do more to help our \nheroes.\n  According to a study by the RAND Corporation, 20 percent of Iraq and \nAfghanistan war veterans report symptoms of PTSD and, of those, only \nabout half actually seek treatment.\n  Our Nation made a promise to our men and women in uniform: When they \ncome home from war and their time in service to our country, we will be \nthere for them. We need to have the same concern for our \nservicemembers' mental health as we do for their physical health. For \nfar too long, we have been focused on the physical wounds of war, but \nas many of our veterans know too well, the mental wounds also inflict \ngreat damage.\n  I am proud to serve as a Senator from a State with a rich legacy of \nservice. I am proud to be the son of a U.S. marine. One in ten \nMontanans have proudly served in our Armed Forces, making the Treasure \nState home to more veterans per capita than almost any other State in \nour Nation. According to the VA, Montana is home to nearly 100,000 \nveterans, 75,000 of whom served our Nation during wartime.\n  As the son of a marine, I strongly believe we have a duty to ensure \nthat the promises we have made to these men and these women are kept. \nThere is no greater honor or responsibility than fighting for our \nveterans. We owe them our freedom. We owe them nothing but our best. \nAnything less is unacceptable.\n  I have had many conversations with the brave men and women who have \ngone overseas in the name of freedom, and one of the many concerns they \nhave expressed is the negative stigma surrounding post-traumatic stress \nin our military. For too long, our service men and women have attempted \nto hide mental health issues from their superiors out of fear of being \ndischarged. That is why I am committed to raising PTSD awareness to \novercome the misinformation and the stigma surrounding these mental \nhealth challenges.\n  I am proud to be working on S. 1567 with Gary Peters and Thom Tillis \nto ensure due process for veterans who suffer from mental health \nillnesses and may have been erroneously given an administrative \ndischarge rather than an honorable discharge. It helps ensure that \nActive-Duty servicemembers who\n\n[[Page S4588]]\n\nsuffer from invisible wounds, like PTSD and traumatic brain injuries, \nalso called TBIs, are not incorrectly administratively discharged, \nputting their hard-earned benefits at risk. This bill is just a small \nstep that Congress can take toward ensuring that the stigma facing PTSD \nis lifted and hopefully allowing more veterans to seek out treatment \nfor PTSD.\n  In the last few years, I am pleased to see that our country has taken \nsteps to ensure that our troops and veterans get the mental health \nservices they need upon their return home. More than ever, troops and \nveterans are seeking treatment. They are receiving timely diagnosis, \nthey are getting needed care.\n  We have a long way to go. Too many veterans are taking their own \nlines and, unfortunately, Montana consistently ranks at the top for \nsuicides in our country. One story from Montana particularly resonated \nwith me. In fact, it occurred in my hometown of Bozeman. I went from \nkindergarten through college in Bozeman. On May 29, 2013, U.S. Army PFC \nWade Christiansen took his own life. He was 23 years old. Private First \nClass Christiansen served his country as a paratrooper in the 82nd \nAirborne Division and was deployed to Afghanistan with his unit in \n2009. During an ambush, he sustained severe injuries to his face and to \nhis arms.\n  After his return to Montana, Wade struggled with both the physical \nand the mental healing process. Wade's brother Matt talked about how \nWade's mood would change when he wouldn't be able to take his \nmedication when the VA failed to get him his medications on time.\n  I wish I could stand here and tell you that Wade Christiansen's story \nis unique. Unfortunately, he is just one of the many veterans who \ncommitted suicide in my State that year. In fact, between 2004 and \n2013, there were 566 suicides by Montana veterans. In Montana and \nacross the Nation, too many of our veterans struggle with PTSD, they \nstruggle with depression. Veteran depression not only affects the \nindividual but also the loved ones closest to the veteran as well. The \nemotional toll on the family is immense. To have a loved one serve \noverseas, only to come back as a shell of what they once were is \ndifficult.\n  PTSD Awareness Day invites us to face the larger issues of veterans \nwho are suffering from post-traumatic stress. We do everything in our \npower to protect our servicemembers while they are overseas. We must do \nthe same to address their needs once they return home. That includes \nreducing the stigma attached to PTSD and doing more to help our brave \nveterans find good-paying jobs and transition back into civilian life.\n  Now is the time to act to work toward real solutions that protect our \nveterans here at home. They are an embodiment of the ideals this Nation \nholds dear, and I believe it is our job to do everything in our power \nto protect them.\n  Before I end my remarks, I want to encourage everyone, if they or a \nloved one is struggling with mental illness or PTSD, there is help \navailable.\n  You can visit www.ptsd.va.gov_www.ptsd.va.gov--where they will find \nresources that are available for our veterans.\n  Mental illness is not something anyone should have to go through \nalone. Seeking help is not a sign of weakness, but instead it is a \ntestament to individual character.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to begin by talking about two \nsubjects. The first of those is the nuclear agreement that our Nation \nand five other nations are seeking to negotiate with Iran, and the \nsecond is I wish to do something we don't do often enough and thank \nsome people, people who serve all of us, some folks in the Coast Guard.\n  But I wish to start with the agreement that we and part of the five \npermanent members of the Security Council, plus one--Germany--are \nattempting to negotiate with the country of Iran. We are closing in, I \nhope, on a historic nuclear agreement with Iran.\n  Today, the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, China, France, \nand Germany are hard at work trying to hammer out a final nuclear deal \nwith Iran that will hopefully put an end to that country's pursuit of \nnuclear weapons. We have a key role to play in the fate of this \npotential nuclear deal.\n  If the P5+1 and Iran can forge a final deal, then Congress will have \nits chance to support or reject it by voting on a resolution that would \nprohibit lifting the sanctions against Iran. So it is my great hope \nthat when Congress comes back from our Fourth of July recess--holiday \nrecess--we will be returning to the news that the negotiators have \nsucceeded in striking what they believe to be a fair deal.\n  We will then begin our job of considering whether that deal \nrepresents the best path forward for our Nation's security and the \nsecurity of other nations, including our allies.\n  Should this agreement come together, I will assess the final nuclear \ndeal on how it implements three key requirements that were articulated \nin last April's nuclear framework. Let me just take a moment and \nexplain these three requirements.\n  First, any final agreement must block all of Iran's pathways to \ndeveloping a nuclear weapon. The Iranians will have to agree to \nmeasures that prohibit them from acquiring weapons-grade plutonium, \nenriching enough uranium to build a bomb and developing a covert \nnuclear program.\n  Fortunately, as part of April's nuclear framework, the P5+1 agreed in \nprinciple to close off Iran's four pathways to a nuclear weapon, and \nhere is how.\n  Iran would no longer have a source of weapons-grade plutonium, as the \nframework requires Iran's heavy water reactor to be redesigned so that \nit no longer generates a plutonium byproduct needed for a bomb.\n  Iran would lose one path to acquiring enough enriched uranium to \nbuild a bomb by being forced to reduce its current centrifuge inventory \nof almost 20,000 down to 5,000 units. Moreover, the remaining 5,000 \ncentrifuges would be Iran's oldest and least capable variants, making \nit almost impossible for Iran to restart weapons-grade enrichment \nactivities.\n  Under the framework, Iran would lose its other path to acquiring \nenough enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon. Iran will be required to \ndramatically reduce its stockpile of enriched uranium from 10 tons to \njust 300 kilograms and will not be able to enrich above 3.7 percent.\n  Lastly, the framework eliminates the ability of Iran to covertly \ndevelop a nuclear weapon by monitoring not just the declared facilities \nbut also subjecting the country's entire nuclear supply chain to \ninspections and continuous surveillance.\n  If a final agreement makes good on these promises in a verifiable \nway--in a verifiable way--then it will earn my support.\n  Some have argued that a final agreement must require Iran to \ndismantle its entire nuclear infrastructure so that it cannot enrich \nuranium even for peaceful nuclear energy. This is an unnecessary \nrequirement on Iran in my view. If that country agrees to these four \nroadblocks to a nuclear weapon, then Iran should be able to maintain an \nenrichment program that is verifiably limited to producing only \npeaceful nuclear energy.\n  That brings me to my second requirement. In any final agreement, Iran \nmust submit to uncomfortable and intrusive inspections.\n  If weapons inspectors for the International Atomic Energy Agency \nidentify a facility they suspect of housing illicit nuclear activity, \nthen these inspectors should be granted access to these undeclared \nsites. If Iran fails to grant access to the inspectors, then Iran \nshould be in violation of the agreement, and that should trigger \nexpedited and appropriate consequences for Iran.\n  In the weeks since the announcement of the April framework agreement, \nwe have heard some contradictory claims coming from Iran's Supreme \nLeader, the Ayatollah Khamenei. He has said that Iran will not allow \ninspections of military sites.\n  Well, perhaps the Supreme Leader is only playing to a hard-line \ndomestic audience in Iran. Perhaps he is attempting to return and to \nrhetorically\n\n[[Page S4589]]\n\nwalk back on the concessions his negotiating team promised to the P5+1 \nnations or perhaps he is just not being honest.\n  Whatever the case may be, I certainly do not trust the Iranian \nSupreme Leader nor do I want my acceptance of a deal to be based solely \non his rhetoric. To borrow a phrase from President Reagan--a phrase we \nhave heard in this Chamber hundreds of times since I came here 14 years \nago--final deals should not be predicated on the mantra ``trust but \nverify.'' Rather they should embody the principle of ``distrust and \nverify.''\n  To that end, the final deal must have a system of consequences and \nincentives in place to ensure that Iran complies with its promises to \nsubmit to inspections.\n  Third, any lifting of sanctions against Iran must be conditional on \nthe Iranians meeting and implementing core requirements of the nuclear \ndeal. Iran must prove to us they are serious about following through on \ntheir commitments. If they live up to their promises, only then should \nthey be rewarded with phased sanctions relief.\n  Fortunately, the administration has made this a sticking point in the \nnegotiations. As the President said upon the announcement of the \nnuclear framework on April 2, ``[Sanctions] relief will be phased in as \nIran takes steps to adhere to the deal. If Iran violates the deal, \nsanctions can be snapped back into place.''\n  Additionally, after announcing the nuclear framework, Secretary Kerry \nmade clear that the Iranians will not get sanctions relief until they \nhave implemented their obligation to the satisfaction of the \ninternational inspectors and the United States. These are the words of \nSecretary Kerry:\n\n       Iran has a responsibility to get the breakout time to the \n     one year . . . . When that is done and certified by the IAEA \n     that [Iran] has lived up to that nuclear responsibility, and \n     we make that judgment with them, at that point we would begin \n     the phasing of sanctions relief.\n\n  Now, Secretary Kerry and President Obama are right to insist on this \npoint. They are right to insist on this point. I imagine this is one of \nthe details still being worked out in talks. But if Iran is serious \nabout abandoning its nuclear weapons ambitions--I hope they are--they \nmust agree to take action before being rewarded with sanctions relief.\n  For 2\\1/2\\ years--2\\1/2\\ years--our negotiating team has been working \ntirelessly to strike a deal with Iran that strengthens our Nation's \nsecurity, our allies' security, and the security of the broader Middle \nEast. Whatever the outcome next week, we owe these negotiators a debt \nof gratitude for their service and their dedication.\n  At the end of the day, however, I feel confident that we will reach a \ndeal that blocks Iran's pathways to a bomb, subjects Iran to intrusive \ninspections, and only provides sanctions relief after Iran takes \naction.\n  If the final deal includes these three key provisions, then it will \ncertainly have my support. Moreover, I think if each Senator and \nRepresentative evaluates this deal on its merits, forgets about the \nrhetoric, forgets about the preconceived notions and considers the \nalternatives, then this deal will enjoy broad support in this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I want to set these remarks aside now.

This is like a day-night \ndoubleheader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). The Senator has used his 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CARPER.

Mr. President, over the past few months I have been \ncoming to the floor to recognize the work of a few of the outstanding \nemployees of the Department of Homeland Security.\n  There are over 200,000 men and women who work at the Department's 22 \ncomponents. They secure our borders and secure our skies. They respond \nto natural disasters. They protect us in cyber space. Few other Federal \nagencies touch the lives of Americans on a daily basis more than the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  Although the jobs they do every day may be diverse, all DHS employees \ngo to work with one critical mission, and that is to ensure our country \nis a safe, secure, and resilient place where the American way of life \ncan thrive.\n  Today I recognize the outstanding service of several officers from \nthe U.S. Coast Guard. As a law enforcement agency and one of our \nNation's five armed services, the Coast Guard has safeguarded our \ninterests on the high seas for over two centuries.\n  The thousands of brave men and women who honorably serve our Nation \nat the Coast Guard dedicate their lives to its important missions. \nThese missions range from maritime law enforcement and military \noperations to search and rescue and environmental protection.\n\n\n             Max Kaczmarek, Chris Leon, and Matthew Worden\n\n  Last month, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson recognized three \nindividuals from the Coast Guard for their valor: Petty Officer Max \nKaczmarek, Petty Officer Chris Leon, and Petty Officer Matthew Worden. \nIn pictures right here next to me are Petty Officer Matt Worden, Petty \nOfficer Max Kaczmarek, and Petty Officer Chris Leon.\n  These three brave individuals have each demonstrated outstanding \ncourage in the face of perilous circumstances, acting selflessly and \nwithout hesitation to render lifesaving aid to their fellow Americans. \nSimply put, they were, in the words of the Coast Guard motto, ``Semper \nParatus''--``Always Ready.''\n  I want to extend my congratulations to these three officers, Petty \nOfficers Kaczmarek, Leon, and Worden, and to all of the recipients of \nthis year's DHS Valor awards. These devoted public servants are an \ninspiration for me, and I think for all of us, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to learn more about their heroic stories.\n\n\n                           Joscelyn Greenwell\n\n  For the 42,000 Active-Duty Coast Guard men and women, their mission \nmay take them to ports and waterways across our country and around the \nglobe. For Petty Officer Joscelyn Greenwell, her service with the Coast \nGuard has taken her from California to Hawaii to my home State of \nDelaware.\n  Originally from Cape Canaveral, FL, Petty Officer Greenwell, pictured \nhere to my left, has served our country for over 7 years at three \ndifferent Coast Guard units and stations. She first spent 3 years on \nthe high endurance cutter Hamilton and home ported in San Diego, CA.\n  While aboard the Coast Guard cutter Hamilton, Petty Officer Greenwell \nwas one of our many brave servicemembers assigned to provide disaster \nrelief following the catastrophic 2010 Haiti earthquake, which we all \nremember. In Haiti, Petty Officer Greenwell and her fellow crew members \ntransported clean drinking water and other resources to the island to \nsave lives. She received a Unit Commendation award for her outstanding \nefforts in that mission.\n  After her time in San Diego, Petty Officer Greenwell spent 2 years \naboard the patrol boat Galveston Island, home ported in Honolulu, HI.\n  Today Petty Officer Greenwell calls Lewes, DE, her home and now \nserves at the U.S. Coast Guard Station Indian River Inlet in Rehoboth \nBeach, DE. With summer in full swing, Delawareans and people from \nacross the country--actually, from around the world--are flocking to \nour Nation's pristine five-star beaches. Thankfully, day and night, \nPetty Officer Greenwell and her crew stand diligent watch over parts of \nDelaware Bay, Rehoboth Bay, Indian River Bay, and the Atlantic Ocean. \nWe Delawareans can rest assured that Petty Officer Greenwell and her \nunit stand ready to answer our call, if ever we need their assistance.\n  According to her superiors, Petty Officer Greenwell takes ownership \nof her responsibilities and is committed to the safety of the public. \nHer colleagues say that she always goes above and beyond what is \nexpected of her.\n  For example, in addition to her usual responsibilities, Petty Officer\n\n[[Page S4590]]\n\nGreenwell received her certification as a boat operator, or coxswain, \nin just 1 year--a process that normally takes about a year and a half. \nHer colleagues say that she demonstrated an outstanding level of skill \nand professionalism throughout the rigorous certification process.\n  She has also served as a mentor to junior personnel and assisted \nmultiple shipmates in receiving their qualifications as watch standers, \nboat crew members, boarding team members, and as coxswains. Petty \nOfficer Greenwell's commitment to her team and the public she serves \nevery day exemplifies--truly exemplifies--the Coast Guard's core values \nof honor, respect, and devotion to duty.\n  Petty Officer Greenwell, I just want you to know tonight that your \nservice to our Nation has taken you around the world, and I know you \nwill continue to go far--both literally and figuratively--in all your \nendeavors. Every day, you help to ensure the safety of your fellow \nAmericans and the security of our Nation. From the bottom of my heart, \nI thank you for your tireless dedication, your invaluable service to \nthe State and the Nation that we call home, and as we say in the Navy, \n``Bravo Zulu.''\n  Finally, to the thousands of brave men and women across the \nDepartment of Homeland Security who dedicate their lives to serving and \nprotecting America and Americans, please know that what you do every \nday is important. I hope it fills your work with meaning and your life \nwith happiness. On behalf of the people we all serve together, thank \nyou for your service.\n\n  Sometimes we ask people--whether the Coast Guard or Department of \nHomeland Security, any part of the Federal Government--what they would \nlike. Sometimes people say they would like more money, they would like \nmore of this, or they would like more of that. What more than half the \npeople say, though, is, I would just like to be thanked.\n  So to all the people I mentioned tonight and those with whom they \nserve at the Department of Homeland Security, thank you, and God bless \nyou.\n  I especially thank my colleague from Ohio for his generosity and \nkindness tonight.\n  To the leader, good work. ``Bravo Zulu'' on the good work done here \nthis week.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4590-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRADE PREFERENCES EXTENSION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to commend my colleagues on \npassage of the Trade Preferences Extension Act of 2015. This \nlegislation provides timely extension of the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act, or AGOA, Program, and preferential treatment for \nproducts from Haiti. And, this legislation finally reauthorizes the \nGeneralized System of Preferences, or GSP, Program which has languished \nsince July of 2013. I am very pleased we have been successful in this \neffort.\n  Trade preference programs are vitally important to the economies of \nthe beneficiary countries, supporting economic and social development. \nAnd, these programs support production here in the U.S. as many of the \ngoods eligible under preference programs are raw materials and inputs \nthat fuel American manufacturing. These programs build a trading \nrelationship that is the first stepping stone towards developing a \nfull, bilateral trading relationship that will further grow and support \nthe U.S. economy. Particularly for some of our trading partners \nbenefiting under the AGOA Program, we look forward to our trading \nrelationship developing to the next phase, full bilateral trade \nagreements, during this authorization of the program.\n  But none of this would have been possible without the dedicated work \nof many people. I would like to recognize the staff of the Senate \nFinance Committee. I would like to recognize Senator Wyden and his \nstaff, especially Joshua Sheinkman, Jayme White, Elissa Alben, Greta \nPeisch, and Anderson Heiman. Our work was supported by the outstanding \nefforts of the International Trade Commission and the Office of the \nUnited States Trade Representative. I would like to particularly thank \nFlorie Liser, Constance Hamilton, Behnaz Kibria, Bill Jackson, and Ben \nKostrzewa from the Office of the USTR.\n  I would like to especially thank my staff for all their dedicated \nwork on this legislation. Our international trade staff has worked \ntirelessly on this legislation and I thank them for their efforts: \nEverett Eissenstat, Shane Warren, and Rebecca Eubank. We have had the \nexcellent support of detailees from the U.S. Patent and Trademark \nOffice, Kevin Rosenbaum, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Andrew \nRollo, as well as Sahra Park Su and Kenneth Schmidt. I would like to \nthank my senior staff: Chris Campbell, Mark Prater, Jay Khosla, Jeff \nWrase, and Bryan Hickman.\n  We can all be proud of the broad support this bill has received in \nboth Houses of Congress. This legislation demonstrates that trade is a \nbipartisan issue. I look forward to President Obama signing this \nlegislation into law as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4590-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4590-S4591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING RAMSEY LEWIS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to congratulate a \nnative son of Chicago who has earned worldwide acclaim as a jazz \npianist and who will soon achieve a lifelong dream of conducting and \nsoloing with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.\n  Ramsey Lewis is a true American original--a virtuoso pianist and \nmusical innovator who helped pioneer the sound many refer to as \n``smooth jazz.'' Fifty-one years ago he and his band, the Ramsey Lewis \nTrio, recorded a song that became an instant sensation and which \nremains a definitive classic of the cool jazz genre. It's called ``The \nIn Crowd.'' You know the refrain: ``I'm in with the in crowd. I go \nwhere the in crowd goes.''\n  That song was recorded live at Bohemian Caverns in Washington, DC, \nwith almost no rehearsal. It sounds like a fable but it is true. That \nafternoon Ramsey and his bandmates--drummer Isaac ``Redd'' Holt and \nbassist Eldee Young--were sitting in a Washington, DC, coffee shop, \ndebating what they could add to their set that night to make the \nrecording stand out. Their waitress, a woman by the name of Nettie \nGray, asked what was wrong. They explained their predicament.\n  Miss Nettie Gray walked over to the jukebox, dropped a coin in the \nslot and said: ``Listen to this.'' It was ``The In Crowd,'' sung by \nDobie Gray--a popular hit at the time. The trio quickly worked out a \njazz arrangement and used the song to end their set that evening. The \ncrowd loved it. Audiences everywhere loved it. ``The In Crowd'' became \nthe first of seven gold records by the Ramsey Lewis Trio.\n  What makes that story even more amazing is that ``The In Crowd'' was \njust one of four albums the Ramsey Lewis Trio recorded that year, 1964. \nTalk about prolific.\n  All told, this jazz legend has recorded 80 albums in an illustrious \ncareer that has spanned more than half a century. He has earned 3 \nGrammy Awards, 7 gold records, and hosted a nationally syndicated radio \nshow and a 13-episode ``Legends of Jazz'' TV series on PBS.\n  In addition, he has served as artistic director of Jazz at Ravinia \nsince 1992. He also helped organize Ravinia's Jazz Mentor Program. He \nserves on the board of trustees for the Merit School of Music in \nChicago and The Chicago High School for the Arts. And a decade ago he \ncreated the Ramsey Lewis Foundation to help connect at-risk children to \nthe world of music.\n  Many artists might decide that such a resume was long and impressive \nenough--but not Ramsey Lewis. At the age of 80, Ramsey Lewis is \npreparing to fulfill the dream of a lifetime. On August 8, he will \nserve as conductor and soloist with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at \nthe Ravinia Festival in Highland Park, IL, just outside of Chicago.\n  Ravinia is the oldest music festival in North America. Over the years \nit has hosted such musical giants as Louis Armstrong, Pablo Casals, \nAaron Copland, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, George Gershwin, \nLuciano Pavarotti, and Yoyo Ma. It is also the summer home of the \nChicago Symphony Orchestra.\n  Ramsey Lewis' debut as conductor and soloist with the CSO is a \ntestament to his musical genius and dexterity. It is also a testament \nto his ability to see beyond narrow expectations about what is possible \nfor musicians of color.\n\n[[Page S4591]]\n\n  Ramsey Lewis has been playing the piano since he was 4 years old. He \nknew at a young age that he wanted to play classical piano. But a music \nteacher told him when he was still a boy to give up that dream because \nthe world of classical music was not open to musicians with skin the \ncolor of Ramsey's.\n  Fortunately for all of us, Ramsey Lewis had the good sense to know \nthat was nonsense. He has played and recorded countless forms of \nmusic--and helped to invent new forms. In doing so, he has helped to \ncreate a world where every child is freer to pursue his or her own \ndreams.\n  Mr. Lewis' August 8 performance with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra \nat Ravinia is a continuation of what the Chicago Tribune has called a \n``Ramsey Renaissance'' as a composer. His collaborator in this new \nchapter of his career is Ravinia president and CEO Welz Kauffman, who \ncommissioned Mr. Lewis to write a piano concerto for his CSO debut. In \nrecent years, Mr. Kauffman has commissioned Mr. Lewis to write other \npieces, including a jazz ballet for the Joffrey Ballet Company, and \n``Proclamation of Hope,'' a celebration of Abraham Lincoln on the \nbicentennial of his birth. Both works made their world premieres at \nRavinia.\n  In 2002 Ramsey Lewis was chosen to carry the Olympic torch as it \npassed through Chicago on its run to Salt Lake City. With his debut \nwith the CSO at Ravinia, Ramsey Lewis will light up the night sky again \nwith his own special brilliance. What a joyous celebration it will be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4591-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4591-S4592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this month, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee approved the PATENT Act with a strong bipartisan vote. As the \nSenate continues to consider this important, balanced legislation aimed \nat curbing abusive patent litigation practices, it is critical that the \ncourt of appeals that considers patent claims be at full strength. \nLegislation alone cannot solve the problems facing Main Street \nbusinesses from abuses of the patent system; we also need dedicated \njudges, such as Kara Farnandez Stoll, on the bench to faithfully apply \nthe law.\n  Ms. Farnandez Stoll was first nominated to serve on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Federal circuit more than 7 months ago. Her hearing was \nheld more than 3 months ago and 2 months ago she was unanimously \nreported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The American Bar \nAssociation's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously \nrated her ``well qualified'' to serve on the Federal circuit--its \nhighest possible rating. The Hispanic National Bar Association, the \nFederal Circuit Bar Association, and the American Intellectual Property \nLaw Association strongly support her confirmation. Once confirmed, Ms. \nFarnandez Stoll will be the first woman of color to serve on the \nFederal circuit. Yet her nomination has been languishing on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar.\n  Nearly 6 months into this new Congress, the Republican leadership has \nscheduled votes to confirm only 4 district court judges. We have not \nconfirmed a single judge this work period. Not one. This is simply \nunacceptable. In addition to Ms. Farnandez Stoll, there are 11 other \nconsensus judicial nominations pending on the Senate Executive \nCalendar.\n  The other nominees pending on the calendar include five U.S. Court of \nFederal Claims, CFC, nominees. We are well past the 1 year anniversary \nof when each were first nominated and are closing in on the anniversary \nof all five having had hearings before they were first reported \nunanimously out of committee. The five CFC nominees were again reported \nout of committee unanimously at the beginning of this year. We have \nheard no opposition to any of these nominees, yet they have been in \nlimbo for months and months because the Republican leader has refused \nto schedule a vote. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims is where our \ncitizens go to seek redress against the Federal Government for monetary \nclaims. The cases this court hears include claims of unlawful takings \nof private land by the U.S. Government without proper compensation \nunder the fifth Amendment, claims of veterans seeking disability \nbenefits for combat-related injuries, and vaccine compensation claims.\n  We are debating trade policy in the Senate, yet the nomination to \nfill one of four current vacancies on the U.S. Court of International \nTrade--CIT--has sat idle on the Senate Executive Calendar for months. \nLike the CFC nominees, the CIT nominee had a hearing last year, was \nfavorably reported out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously by voice \nvote last Congress, and again earlier this year.\n  Also pending on the calendar are nominees to fill vacancies on the \nWestern District of Missouri, the Western District of New York, and \nthree nominees to fill judicial emergency vacancies--two on the Eastern \nDistrict of New York and one on the Eastern District of California, all \nbut one of whom were first nominated last year.\n  There is nothing keeping the Senate from confirming all 12 nominees--\nnothing, except for the mindset of delay for delay's sake, which is \nunfortunately the hallmark of the majority's leadership on judicial \nnominations.\n  The Senate has a duty to consider judicial vacancies no matter which \nparty holds the majority. In the 17 months I chaired the Senate \nJudiciary Committee during President Bush's first 2 years in office, \nthe Senate confirmed 100 Federal circuit and district court judges. I \nalso served as chairman during the last 2 years of the Bush \nadministration and we confirmed another 68 district and circuit court \njudges.\n  In contrast to the 4 district judges we have confirmed this year, \nwhen the Democrats were in an equivalent position in the 7th year of \nthe Bush administration, we had confirmed 18 judges--including 15 \ndistrict and 3 circuit court judges--by June 24, 2007.\n  That's 18 judges under a Democratic majority compared to 4 under the \nRepublican majority. That is nearly five times as many judges confirmed \nunder a Democratic majority with a President of the opposite party than \ntoday's Senate Republican majority.\n  Nevertheless, the Republican majority continues to make excuses for \ntheir continued obstruction and delay on confirming President Obama's \njudicial nominees. Their excuse is that the Democratic majority was \nable to confirm those 18 judges by this date in 2007 only because those \nnominees were held over from the previous year. What the Republicans \nfail to note is that 6 of the 18 judges confirmed by June 24, 2007 \nfirst had their hearing in 2007, were reported out of committee without \nneedless delay, and were confirmed promptly.\n  We began this Congress with 38 district and circuit court vacancies, \nincluding 12 vacancies deemed ``judicial emergencies'' by the \nnonpartisan Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. While 38 is the \nlowest number of vacancies during the entire Obama administration, it \nis still higher than the low of 28 district and circuit court vacancies \nduring the Bush administration, which was achieved due to Democratic \ncooperation.\n  There are now 55 district and circuit court vacancies, including 27 \nthat have been deemed ``judicial emergency'' vacancies. Of the 55 \nvacancies, 41 are in States with at least one Republican home State \nSenator. Of great concern to the timely administration of justice are \nfour circuit court vacancies that are ``judicial emergencies''--two in \nTexas, one in Alabama, and one in Kentucky--that have each been vacant \nand without nominees for well over a year, including one Texas circuit \ncourt vacancy that has been vacant for nearly 3 years. These 3 States \nalone also account for 12 district court vacancies without a currently \npending nominee, half of which are ``judicial emergency'' vacancies.\n  While I know that the senior Senator from Texas, who is also the \nassistant republican leader, likes to say that it is the President who \n``has to nominate the judges,'' we are all well aware of the central \nrole home State Senators have in making recommendations to the \nPresident to fill vacancies in our States. I urge all Senators to work \nmeaningfully with President Obama to get these vacancies filled.\n  As we head into July 4 recess, the Senate Republican leadership \nshould be allowing us to clear the calendar of the 12 noncontroversial \nconsensus judicial nominees to let them get to work for the American \npeople.\n  I would remind the current majority leader of his floor remarks from \nJune\n\n[[Page S4592]]\n\n2008, the last year of the Bush administration when Democrats held the \nmajority in the Senate:\n\n       On the issue of judicial confirmations, my good friend the \n     majority leader and I discussed this matter publicly at the \n     beginning of this Congress, and we agreed that President \n     Bush, in the last 2 years of his term, should be treated as \n     well as President Reagan, Bush 41, and President Clinton were \n     treated in the last 2 years of their tenures in office \n     because there was one common thread, and that was that the \n     Senate was controlled by the opposition party.\n\n  I hope he stays true to the words he spoke when the shoe was on the \nother foot. I urge the majority leader to immediately schedule a vote \nfor Kara Farnandez Stoll and the CFC and CIT nominees so they can get \nto work serving the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4592-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGETARY REVISIONS\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

Shulkin to be the next Under Secretary for Health for \nthe U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  I was pleased that Dr. Shulkin's nomination was confirmed by the \nSenate last night. The Veterans Health Administration, which he will \noversee, has not had a permanent leader for more than 1 year. In my \nview, it is important to have permanent leadership in place to address \na number of ongoing issues at the Veterans Health Administration, \nincluding properly implementing the Veterans Access, Choice, and \nAccountability Act of 2014, to give veterans the option of accessing \ncare in their communities and ensure managers are held accountable for \nany lapses in customer service; improving care and support for victims \nof military sexual trauma; helping to eradicate homelessness among \nveterans; ensuring that veterans have access to timely and adequate \nmental health care; reducing the systemic problems with over-\nprescription of opioids; and providing appropriate gender-specific \nservices for the growing population of women veterans.\n  Dr. Shulkin has roughly 20 years of experience serving in leadership \nroles at hospitals and health care systems. I hope he can use that \nexperience to provide the stability and leadership needed to start \novercoming the serious challenges that the Veterans Health \nAdministration continues to face. Providing a permanent leader is a \nsignificant step in ensuring that the Veterans Health Administration is \nproviding our Nation's veterans with the level of care and service they \nhave earned and they deserve.\n  I thank my colleagues for their assistance in filling this important \nrole at VA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4592-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4592-S4593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SHULKIN AND COUNCIL CONFIRMATIONS\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, last night, the Senate confirmed David \nShulkin to be the Under Secretary for Health and LaVerne Council to be \nthe Assistant Secretary for Information and Technology at the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, VA.\n  Let me begin by thanking Chairman Isakson for making the confirmation \nof Dr. Shulkin and Ms. Council a priority for this Congress.\n  Dr. Shulkin comes to the Veterans Health Administration, VHA, with \nsignificant experience managing complex health care organizations. \nPrior to being confirmed as Undersecretary of Health Dr. Shulkin was \nthe president of Morristown Medical Center where he oversaw a 658-bed \nfacility that has received countless awards for its excellence in care. \nDuring his confirmation hearing before the committee, Dr. Shulkin \nstated, ``We all agree that the status quo is simply not acceptable. I \nwant to assure you that, if confirmed, it would be my sole mission each \nand every day to transform the VA health system into one that provides \nour veterans with the highest level of quality care.'' Given the \nchallenges that face VA, I look forward to working with Dr. Shulkin to \nensure the status quo does not persist. I am committed to ensuring VA \nprovides high-quality care options to veterans.\n  Ms. Council has significant private sector experience in managing \nglobal information and technology programs, including service as the \nfirst global chief information officer at Johnson & Johnson and leading \nthe consolidation of 250 operating companies across 57 countries in the \nworld. I trust that her experience will allow her to navigate ongoing \nissues around health data interoperability between VA and DOD, and I \nlook forward to collaborating with her to make this a practical reality \nfor VA and DOD clinicians and veteran patients. At a time when data \nsecurity is being tested by dramatic increases in malware and intrusion \nattempts, it is more critical than ever to have a permanent leader in \nplace to remediate known security deficiencies and ensure that health \nand personal data remains secure in VA systems. I am committed to doing \nright by veterans on this critical issue.\n  VA continues to lurch from crisis to crisis, facing health care \nfunding shortfalls, construction cost overruns, growing patient wait \ntimes, insufficient collaboration between VA and DOD, and a backlog of \ndisability compensation claims and appeals. In the face of these \ncrises, these nominees will assume two of the toughest jobs in \ngovernment given all of the attention VA has received of late. VA's \nculture has been described as corrosive and nonresponsive, and there \ncontinues to be a need for a significant change in the culture at VA. I \nexpect both Dr. Shulkin and Ms. Council to use their expertise and \nexperience to make these changes and improve VA services for veterans.\n  Finally, I would like to highlight one additional area of concern. \nThere are far too many key leadership positions at VA that remain \nunfilled. There are\n\n[[Page S4593]]\n\nstill five positions requiring Senate confirmation that are occupied by \nofficials serving in an interim or acting capacity. A permanent, \nSenate-confirmed leadership team is vital to make the significant and \nnecessary changes to the culture of an organization of the size and \nscope of VA. The bottom line is VA needs permanent, Senate-confirmed \nleadership in place in order to meet the significant challenges that \ncontinue to face the Department. The Senate needs the names of \nqualified nominees to fill VA's many vacancies.\n  As the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I \ncongratulate Mr. Shulkin and Ms. Council, and thank them for their \nwillingness to serve the veterans of this great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4593-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             40TH ANNIVERSARY OF INDEPENDENCE IN CABO VERDE\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the 40th anniversary of Cabo Verde's \nindependence, on July 5th, comes just one day after our country's own \nIndependence Day. As we near Cabo Verde's 40th anniversary, this small \ncountry of 500,000 merits our recognition for its longstanding ties to \nthe United States and for serving as a beacon for democracy in Africa.\n  While the existence of Cabo Verde's islands was first acknowledged by \nthe Romans, it was not until 1456 that the uninhabited islands were \nrediscovered and settled by Portuguese explorers. Over the next several \nhundred years, as a colony of the Portuguese Empire, Cabo Verde was a \nlucrative trading post between Europe, Africa, and the Americas. \nTowards the end of the 18th century, many Cabo Verdeans came to New \nEngland, particularly Rhode Island and Massachusetts, where some found \nsuccess working in the whaling industry. This immigration strengthened \nthe ties between the United States and Cabo Verde and, in 1818, Cabo \nVerde became the site of the first U.S. consulate in sub-Saharan \nAfrica. As a result of the 1974 Carnation Revolution in Portugal, and \nafter centuries of colonial rule, Cabo Verde was able to formally gain \nindependence on July 5, 1975, and soon established diplomatic ties with \nthe United States.\n  Since that time, Cabo Verde has worked for a democratic government. \nIt has made great strides in this regard and, today, Cabo Verde is a \nleader in good governance, receiving top marks from the Freedom House \nfor political rights and civil liberties. Cabo Verde has also made \nsignificant economic and social progress in the past several years. \nAdditionally, given Cabo Verde's strong ties to the United States and \nour shared commitment to democracy and economic freedom, Cabo Verde was \nawarded and successfully undertook a Millennium Challenge Corporation, \nMCC, compact for private sector, agricultural, and transportation \nreforms, and is currently implementing a second MCC compact in the \nareas of water, sanitation, and land management. Moving forward, Cabo \nVerde can build on these successes to continue to grow its economy as \nwell as strengthen ties to the United States and other allies.\n  Rhode Island is fortunate to have one of the two largest Cabo \nVerdean-American populations in the country, and continues to be \nenriched by the heritage and contributions of Cabo Verde. I am very \npleased that earlier this month, T.F. Green Airport in Rhode Island \nbegan welcoming direct flights from Cabo Verde, which will lead to \ngreater exchange and new opportunities between Rhode Island and Cabo \nVerde.\n  As we near July 5th, I send my best wishes to all those of Cabo \nVerdean descent in Rhode Island and throughout the country on the 40th \nanniversary of Cabo Verde's independence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4593-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4593-S4594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            COMBATTING ANTI-SEMITISM, RACISM AND INTOLERANCE\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as our Nation continues to mourn the \ntragic loss of life at the Mother Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston, I \nwish to discuss international efforts that can assist in addressing the \nprejudice and discrimination that fuels violence and acts of extremism \nin our country and abroad.\n  Following the horrific attacks in Paris and Copenhagen earlier this \nyear, the president of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, Ilkka Kanerva, \nappointed me to serve as the assembly's first special representative on \nanti-Semitism, racism, and intolerance. As a Member of Congress, the \nU.S. Helsinki Commission, and the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, I have \nlong fought to counter prejudice and discrimination and to advance more \neffective measures against hate crimes. I was therefore extremely \nhonored that President Kanerva entrusted me with this responsibility.\n  Given the breadth of my mandate, I am focusing my work this year on \nthree areas: first, the urgent issue of anti-Semitism and community \nsecurity; second, discrimination against Muslims and anti-Muslim \nbacklash; finally, in light of events in our own country and the \nsalience of these struggles for minorities in Europe, discriminatory \npolicing.\n  As my first initiative, I visited the sites of the Paris and \nCopenhagen tragedies in April, where I met with people directly \naffected by the violence as well as government officials and civil \nsociety representatives. In my consultations with Jewish, Muslim, \nAfrican-descent, and other community leaders, we discussed Jewish \ncommunity security and civil society coalition efforts to combat all \nforms of prejudice and discrimination. The horrific attacks in those \ntwo capitals--simultaneously targeting Jewish communities and \nexpressions of free speech--underscored the urgent need to address \nsecurity threats to Jewish individuals and communities. The \npervasiveness of anti-Semitism is one of the main reasons I last year \ncalled on the OSCE to hold a High Level Conference to mark the 10th \nanniversary of the seminal OSCE Berlin Conference on Anti-Semitism and \nadopt a ministerial decision calling on all 57 participating states of \nthe OSCE to implement commitments to combat anti-Semitism. In this \nvein, I recently led efforts to provide funding for U.S. and European \ncivil society to work with youth to combat anti-Semitism and other \nforms of intolerance.\n  Of course, we must be vigilant to ensure that such efforts do not \ndegenerate into anti-Muslim backlash. Measures that are framed in ways \nthat fuel anti-Muslim prejudice will ultimately be counterproductive. \nMoreover, we need diverse coalitions working together to address the \nthreats we face today. This month, fringe extremist parties from seven \ndifferent countries formed a block in the EU Parliament. They are now \neligible to receive EU money to disseminate toxic views that combine \nanti-Semitism with anti-Muslim bigotry.\n  I have also introduced legislation to end racial profiling in the \nUnited States. The End Racial Profiling Act, S. 1056, prohibits racial \nprofiling by law enforcement, mandates law enforcement bias training, \nrequires data collection on all police stops, and creates procedures \nfor receiving, investigating, and resolving profiling complaints. \nTragic events in Baltimore and New York, North Charleston and Ferguson, \nand elsewhere around the country have shown us that Federal legislation \nfinally ending racial profiling is essential.\n  It is also essential that we restore confidence between communities \nand the police, and the criminal justice system at large. To that end, \nI have also introduced the ``Baltimore Act,'' S. 1610 named after my \nhome city, to provide strategies and resources to strengthen police-\ncommunity relations and restore justice.\n  Discriminatory policing is undoubtedly a challenge that many \ngovernments face. In some European countries, minorities are 10 times \nmore likely to be stopped by the police than members of the majority. \nIn France--the country with some of Europe's largest Muslim and Black \npopulations--police officers were recently acquitted in connection with \nthe death of two teenagers. That incident 10 years ago sparked riots \nacross France; the acquittal this year has prompted protests and \ncomparisons with Ferguson. In Germany, a human rights group is \npetitioning the government to end profiling after a Black student was \narrested solely because his skin color led them to presume he was in \nthe country illegally. In Slovakia, 10 police officers were acquitted \nin February of forcing Romani boys to strip and fight each other, even \nthough this notorious incident was captured on cell phone\n\n[[Page S4594]]\n\nvideo. As we know from our own experience, racial bigotry, if \nunaddressed, only metastasizes.\n  The United States and our European partners have a lot to learn from \none another. We have learned--and continue to learn--from the civil \nrights struggle and, as a country founded and built by people seeking \nfreedom and opportunity, about immigration and integration. Many \nEuropean countries are working hard to address discrimination and \nadvance civil rights through the creation of national human rights \ninstitutions and targeted strategies. Additionally, there are many \nlessons learned from hate-based violence reduction and gun laws.\n  The United States and Europe have worked on both sides of the \nAtlantic to address issues of prejudice and discrimination and foster \ndiversity, but on a largely ad hoc basis. I recently introduced \nprovisions in the Senate for a Joint Action Plan between the United \nStates and European Union to formalize and coordinate such \nconsultations and ensure that the necessary experts and stakeholders \nfrom the public and private sectors are involved. It would also improve \ntransparency and access to information generated by these exchanges. I \nhave also urged the OSCE chair-in-office to convene a high-level \nconference on racism and xenophobia to elevate understanding of these \nissues and advance additional concrete steps by the OSCE participating \nstates. The recent events in Charleston, Paris, and Copenhagen \nunderscore the urgent need for shared efforts to combat hate and foster \ninclusion on both sides of the Atlantic.\n  In 1991, just days after the failed Moscow coup, the United States \nmet in Russia with other OSCE participating states. Our countries \nagreed that ``issues relating to human rights, fundamental freedoms, \ndemocracy and the rule of law are of international concern, as respect \nfor these rights and freedoms constitutes one of the foundations of the \ninternational order.'' Such matters are ``of direct and legitimate \nconcern to all participating States and do not belong exclusively to \nthe internal affairs of the state concerned.'' That is as true today as \nit was 20 some years ago. It is in that spirit that I will continue to \nwork with other parliamentarians to combat anti-Semitism, racism, and \nother forms of intolerance--in the United States and elsewhere in the \nOSCE region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4594-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING MARGUERITE McKAY\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a great Rhode \nIslander, Marguerite K. McKay, who passed away last month at the age of \n96.\n  Marguerite Katherine McCrudden was born in Providence on September \n15, 1918, and grew up in the Smith Hill neighborhood of the city. One \nof six children, she attended St. Patrick's High School in Providence \nand graduated from Bryant College in 1938.\n  Marguerite spent much of her professional life dedicated to the city \nof Providence. She began her career in the Building Inspector's Office, \nand later moved to the Providence School Department, where she worked \nuntil she retired.\n  Marguerite married Franklin Richard McKay in 1950, and together they \nhad one child, Bernard. Franklin served as a city councilman and city \nsolicitor in Attleboro, MA, and both he and Marguerite were active in \nthe Attleboro community and their church parish, St. John the \nEvangelist.\n  After Franklin's passing in 1968, Marguerite spent her time living in \nBarrington, RI, and on Prudence Island in Narragansett Bay. She enjoyed \ncooking, gardening, swimming, and following politics. In her \nretirement, she traveled extensively and remained active in her church, \nSt. Luke's in Barrington. In 2005, she moved to Reston, VA to be closer \nto her family.\n  Marguerite passed away in Reston in May. Her funeral was held on June \n20 at her childhood church, St. Patrick's, in the Smith Hill \nneighborhood of Providence. She was predeceased by her beloved grandson \nBrendan, who passed away last year.\n  I would like to offer my heartfelt condolences to Marguerite's son \nBernard and his wife Mary; her grandchildren Patrick, Conor, and \nRosemary; her three great-grandchildren; and her two surviving \nsiblings, Cornelius Bernard McCrudden and Mary McCrudden Broome. \nMarguerite led a life of service to her community, and our State is \nbetter for it. I know her example of good will and selflessness will \ncontinue to sustain and inspire her family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4594-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ALZHEIMER'S & BRAIN AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President. I wish to commemorate Alzheimer's & Brain \nAwareness month. The impact of Alzheimer's is felt in families and \ncommunities across Virginia and the Nation, and this month provides an \nopportunity to stand with those suffering from Alzheimer's and other \nbrain diseases to raise awareness. I am also proud to cosponsor S. 857, \nthe Health Outcomes, Planning, and Education, HOPE, for Alzheimer's Act \ntoday.\n  The challenges Alzheimer's poses for families are real. Financially \nand emotionally, Alzheimer's disease has a devastating impact as \npatients need to navigate medical information, access community \nservices and prepare for living with this disease. In Virginia there \nare over 130,000 people living with Alzheimer's and that number is \nexpected to grow to as many as 190,000 by 2025. Alzheimer's does not \nonly impact the individual patient, but also changes the lives of \nfamily caregivers. In 2014, an estimated 452,000 family caregivers \nprovided 514 million hours of care for individuals with Alzheimer's \ndisease and dementia in Virginia.\n  The cost is also significant for the Federal Government. Nearly one \nin every five Medicare dollars is spent on someone with Alzheimer's or \ndementia, and by 2050, it will be nearly $1 of every $3. In the years \nbetween 2015 and 2050, caring for people with Alzheimer's will cost our \ncountry $20.8 trillion. Research funding is critical, and action is \nneeded to provide to support for newly diagnosed patients and families.\n  The HOPE for Alzheimer's Act would ensure patients and their families \nhave access to a care planning session with their doctor to help them \nunderstand the diagnosis, treatment options, and what medical and \ncommunity services are available. Studies have shown that providing \npatients and families with a full range of information and support \nresults in better outcomes for those living with Alzheimer's, including \nhigher quality of care, increased use of needed community services, \nreduced patient behavioral and psychiatric symptoms, and reduced \ncaregiver stress and depression. According to the Alzheimer's \nAssociation, only 45 percent of people with Alzheimer's disease or \ntheir caregivers report being told of their diagnosis.\n  This legislation provides for Medicare coverage for comprehensive \nAlzheimer's disease care planning services. While Medicare covers \nAlzheimer's disease diagnostic services, it currently does not provide \ncoverage for comprehensive care planning following a diagnosis. These \ncritical services will allow patients and families to understand the \ndiagnosis, receive information about medical and non-medical options \nfor ongoing treatment, services and supports and how to access care.\n  As a member of the Committee on Aging, I am committed to working with \nmy colleagues to raise awareness about this devastating disease, and \nthank the Alzheimer's Association and other advocates for their strong \nvoices during June and throughout the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4594-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4594-S4595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   TRIBUTE TO WALLACE ``WALLY'' RENEY\n\n Ms. AYOTTE.

I am proud to recognize \nhis illustrious professional career and continued service to many \ncommunities across the Granite State and our country.\n  Originally from Bellows Falls, VT, Wally has been a resident of \nSurry, NH for the past five decades. During his 50-year career as a \ncommunity banker, Wally has helped thousands of Granite Staters become \nhomeowners, serviced their financial needs, and helped strengthen and \ndevelop the Monadnock Region. Before becoming a business leader in the \ncommunity, Wally spent 8 years in the U.S. Marine Corps. Serving\n\n[[Page S4595]]\n\noverseas in Japan for 2 of those years as a court stenographer, he took \nthe time to learn the language, culture, and customs--demonstrating an \nappreciation for serving people and a knack for communication that \nwould lend itself to Wally's own work and character years later.\n  Wally tells everyone he meets that he has what money cannot buy. He \nis revered as one of the most generous and selfless individuals who has \ndevoted his life to giving back, not just to the community, but to \nothers who gave him the opportunity to be successful in life.

Mr. President, I wish to honor Ralph Shower of St. \nLouis, MO, on his upcoming 100th birthday on July 6, 2015. As a \ndedicated family man, heroic World War II veteran, and successful \nbusiness professional, he has made his family, community, and the \nentire State of Missouri proud to call him one of our own.\n  Born and raised in St. Louis, Mr. Shower attended Soldan High School, \nwhere he participated in varsity track and field. His dad ran a hotel \nand restaurant supply business, and in his younger years, he worked \nwith his father at the family business.\n  As mentioned before, Mr. Shower honorably served in the U.S. Army's \n517 Signal Company, 17th Airborne Division, during World War II. While \nserving, he suffered from serious injuries in a paratrooper glider \naccident from which he fully recovered, and he has continued to live a \nfull and healthy life. To this day, he has remained actively involved \nin his community through the local veterans service organizations.\n  After leaving the Army, Mr. Shower began a career in public relations \nmanagement, serving various charity organizations, including the \nLeukemia Guild of Missouri and the City of Hope Hospital in Durate, CA.\n  Even with his military and professional successes, Shower has always \nprioritized his family above all else. He and Ethel, his late wife of \n70 years, had three children. Michael Shower, his son, held an esteemed \nposition as the executive secretary and counselor to the executive \ndirector of UNICEF up until his passing in 1994. Mr. Shower has two \nbeloved daughters, Suzanne Shower and Michelle Proctor, along with two \ngranddaughters and five great-granddaughters.\n  Forty-seven of Mr. Shower's relatives will be traveling to the St. \nLouis area to celebrate his long and accomplished life. It sounds like \nit will be a truly special celebration.\n  Ralph Shower has touched the lives of so many people over the past \ncentury, and his service to his country and community deserves our \nrecognition and appreciation. I congratulate Ralph Shower for his \nservice to his family, community, and this great country. Happy \nBirthday!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4595-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO DR. WILLIAM E. ``BRIT'' KIRWAN\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as you know, when Senators converse \nin the cloakroom between votes, we often claim bragging rights--who \nrepresents the State with the best crab cake, which State has the best \nhiking trails, and which baseball team will win the American League \nEast division for example. Everyone likes to chime in and claim his or \nher State as the best in some regard. But if anyone mentions leaders in \nhigher education, the conversation just stops. Every Senator knows what \nthe senior Senator from Maryland and I are going to say--Dr. William E. \n``Brit'' Kirwan. That ends the competition right there. Today I wish to \nhonor this man who can rightfully be called one of the Nation's most \nrespected leaders in higher education.\n  After 51 years in the field of education--spending 25 years as a \nfaculty member and administrator at the University of Maryland, College \nPark, president of both the University of Maryland, College Park and \nThe Ohio State University, and now as the chancellor of the University \nSystem of Maryland for the past 12 years--Dr. Kirwan will be retiring \non June 30, 2015.\n  Under Dr. Kirwan's extraordinary leadership, the University System of \nMaryland has thrived. Our State's universities are among the best in \nthe Nation, with cutting-edge research programs which support the work \nof private businesses and Federal agencies located nearby, \ninternationally renowned academic programs, and diverse student bodies. \nDr. Kirwan also paved the way for innovative solutions to cut the \nuniversity system's costs while improving quality, expanding \neducational access for minorities, and initiating other successful \nstrategies, such as the University System of Maryland's ``Closing the \nAchievement Gap'' program.\n  Outside of Maryland, Dr. Kirwan's expertise has been sought by \nPresidents of both parties and the U.S. Congress to offer his input on \nnational higher education efforts. Even after he announced his \nretirement, Dr. Kirwan cochaired the Task Force on Federal Regulation \nof Higher Education, and currently serves as the cochair of the Knight \nCommission on Intercollegiate Athletics; chair of the College Board's \nCommission on Access, Admissions, and Success in Education; a member of \nthe Business Higher Education Forum and as chair of the National \nResearch Council Board of Higher Education and the Workforce.\n  His work is not without recognition by the citizens of our State. \nAmong his many accolades but not an exhaustive list after his numerous \nyears of service, Dr. Kirwan is the recipient of the TIAA-CREF Theodore \nM. Hesburgh Award for Leadership, the Carnegie Corporation Leadership \nAward, the 16th recipient of the Maryland House of Delegates Speaker's \nMedallion in recognition of his contributions to the State of Maryland, \nthe Maryland Senate First Citizen Award in recognition of his ongoing \ncommitment and service to our State, the Lifetime Achievement Award in \nEducation from the Tech Council of Maryland, the Champion of Children \nAward from the Maryland State Department of Education, the Regional \nVisionary Award of the Greater Baltimore Committee, and the Public \nService Award from the Maryland Chamber of Commerce.\n  As impressive as Dr. Kirwan's resume may be, it does not define who \nhe is as an individual. Dr. Kirwan is a man of integrity and loyalty \nwho maintains a passion for ensuring access to a quality education for \nall. He has been visionary in all things academic and believer in the \nwell-being of young men and women. I would also like to thank Dr. \nKirwan's family for the support they have given to him throughout his \nacademic career and for allowing him to so greatly share his talents \nwith the people of Maryland.\n  Dr. Kirwan's efforts have left the University System of Maryland and \nthe State of Maryland both stronger academically and better prepared to \neducate students for the challenges of tomorrow. He has made social \njustice a genuine priority, which has elevated the university system \neven further. Through his vision and actions to establish the then \nCenter for Academic Innovation at the University of Maryland, College \nPark, and the legacy of the newly commissioned William E. Kirwan Center \nfor Academic Innovation will advance the priorities of Dr. Kirwan to \naddress barriers to a college education for decades to come.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dr. Kirwan on \nhis well-deserved retirement and thanking Dr. Kirwan for his service \nand commitment to higher education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4595-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4595-S4596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL ROOFING WEEK\n\n Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the \nNational Roofing Contractors Association, NRCA, headquartered in \nRosemont, IL,\n\n[[Page S4596]]\n\nand support its efforts to designate the week of July 5-11, 2015 as \nNational Roofing Week.\n  As the first line of defense against natural elements, such as rain, \nsnow or wind, the roof is one of the most critical features of any home \nor business. Yet, despite its importance, it is often taken for granted \nuntil it falls into disrepair. National Roofing Week is a valuable \nreminder of the significance that quality roofing has on our \ncommunities and honors the thousands of contractors in the roofing \nindustry across the United States.\n  NRCA's 3,800 members, located across all 50 States, play a \nsignificant role in the installation and maintenance of roofing \nsystems. With a vast network of roofing contractors and industry-\nrelated members, NRCA handles a majority of new construction and \nreplacement roof systems on commercial and residential structures in \nAmerica. However, the organization's activities extend beyond its \nconstruction duties.\n  National Roofing Week provides an opportunity to recognize the \nthousands of NRCA members and their commitment to supporting their \nlocal communities. As part of its outreach efforts last year, NRCA \nmembers worked together to raise funds and repair the roof for a local \nnonprofit organization that provides health services and housing \noptions for mistreated and abused children in Chicago. I commend the \nNRCA and the vital role the organization and its members play in every \ncommunity and I ask my colleagues to join me in acknowledging their \ncontributions during National Roofing Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4596-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REMEMBERING TROOPER JAMES A. MOEN AND RECOGNIZING MEGAN PETERS\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on Thursday, the Alaska State \nTroopers will pause to recognize the 14th anniversary of the loss of \nTrooper James A. Moen. Trooper Moen, assigned to fish and wildlife \nprotection duties, was killed in an aircraft accident while on law \nenforcement patrol near Lake Iliamna, AK. Trooper Moen was piloting the \nsingle-engine Piper Cub float plane when it crashed for unknown \nreasons. His remains were recovered by troopers who hiked in to the \nscene. Trooper Moen had served with the Alaska State Troopers--fish and \nwildlife protection for over 18 years and had over 4,000 hours of \nflight time as both a military and civilian pilot. He was survived by \nhis wife and four children.\n  One of Trooper Moen's children is Megan Peters, a spokesperson for \nthe Alaska State Troopers. Megan's name is perhaps better known among \nAlaskans than her father's was. But one thing that Alaskans may not \nknow is that Megan plays a leading role in organizing the Alaska police \nmemorial ceremony each May. While all Alaska's law enforcement officers \nwho gave their lives in the line of duty are recognized in this \nceremony, the emphasis is on honoring those who passed in the preceding \nyear.\n  There is a certain irony to Megan's involvement in all this. During \nPolice Week, Megan devotes her energy to comforting the families of \nother fallen officers. But who is there to recognize and comfort Megan, \nherself a survivor of a law enforcement tragedy? That irony was not \nlost on Mallory Peebles, a reporter from KTUU Television in Anchorage. \nDuring the 2013 ceremony, Mallory devoted a segment of Channel 2 News \nto telling Megan's story--then and now.\n  So this year, through this message in the Congressional Record, it is \nmy intention to honor both father and daughter. The legacy of Trooper \nJames A. Moen very much lives on in the work of his daughter Megan. I \ndidn't know Trooper Moen, but I have to believe that he would be very \nproud of Megan's work.\n  My staff and I rely on Megan throughout the year for information on \npublic safety issues in Alaska. She is the go-to person and gets us the \nanswers we need on short deadline. We appreciate her knowledge and \ndiligence, but rarely do we think to take a moment to say thank you.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mallory Peebles report on the work of \nMegan Peters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Channel 2 News, May 20, 2013]\n\n    Lost in the Line of Duty: A State Trooper's Story 12 Years Later\n\n         (By Mallory Peebles and Photojournalist Shawn Wilson)\n\n       Anchorage, AK.--When a service member or civilian in \n     uniform makes the ultimate sacrifice, they are officially \n     considered lost in the line of duty. Channel Two is looking \n     back at three Alaskans and their families who have paid the \n     ultimate price. On May 10, The State of Alaska recognized \n     Peace Officers Memorial Day. It's a somber yet iconic event \n     to mark and mourn Alaska's law enforcement officers who have \n     lost their lives in the line of duty. This year the annual \n     event was organized by State Trooper spokeswoman Megan \n     Peters. For Peters it's more than just a work assignment, \n     it's personal. ``My dad was a fish cop, fish and wildlife. So \n     he was a brown shirt,'' Peters said. Peters said growing up \n     she always knew her father did important work with the Alaska \n     Troopers--sometimes even dangerous work--but as a child she \n     didn't focus on the dangers of the job. ``He would go out on \n     the boat all the time. He loved flying,'' Peters said. \n     ``People say yeah, it's something that you know could happen \n     but I was a little kid, and my dad was a trooper the whole \n     time, so why would something happen?'' When Peters was just \n     18-years-old something did happen. Her father was flying on a \n     routine sport fishing patrol near Iliamna when his plane \n     crashed. It was May 25, 2001. Megan was studying abroad in \n     Finland when her mother called with the news. ``I was just \n     walking down the street, and I'll never forget the first \n     thing she said was `I'm so sorry Megan,' '' Peters said. ``I \n     don't remember anything after that phone call. I don't \n     remember packing. I didn't have to change my plane tickets \n     because I was already leaving. I just came home, and it was a \n     different life.'' It was a life without a father who had \n     meant the world to her. ``When he wasn't working he was \n     always taking us out. We had a boat and we had our own plane \n     in high school,'' Peters said. ``My dad loved Alaska and \n     that's why he came up here. He came up with the intent on \n     wanting to be a State Trooper.'' James Arthur Moen was a \n     productive Alaska State Trooper. For 18 years he served The \n     State of Alaska. A member of the Special Emergency Response \n     Team, SERT and dive unit, Moen assisted in numerous rescues \n     and recovery missions. Today, he is still remembered for his \n     contributions across the state. A trooper boat is named after \n     Moen and still operates out of Petersburg. While serving \n     Alaskans, Moen also served as a strong role model for his \n     daughter. She decided to follow in her father's footsteps and \n     is now working with the State Troopers. Peters joined the \n     Troopers in 2007 where she is tasked with writing a press \n     release each time a plane crashes in Alaska and troopers \n     respond. Just like her father's hat that sits on her desk in \n     the office, each press release serves as a constant and often \n     painful reminder of the high cost of duty. ``I might not \n     understand what it is that the troopers are doing every \n     single day and what they're facing but I grew up around it \n     enough to know what their jobs do entail,'' said Peters, \n     ``and to know what it's like to be in that environment.'' \n     Alaska Peace Officers Memorial Day serves as a stark reminder \n     of the life and death situations law enforcement officers \n     face every day while on duty. The harsh realities that come \n     along with the responsibilities of duty in Alaska can mean \n     it's possible they may not come home. Moen's name was added \n     to this memorial more than a decade ago and joins many like \n     it. This year 40-year-old State Trooper Tage Toll of \n     Talkeetna had his name added. He died only two months ago \n     when Helo-One crashed while executing the rescue of a \n     stranded snowmachiner. Village Public Safety Officer Thomas \n     Madole also had his named added to the memorial this year. He \n     was shot and killed while responding to a 911 call in \n     Manokotak. All the names added serve as a reminder of the \n     lives sacrificed for a job, country and state they loved. \n     ``My dad was a trooper and a pilot and he loved both, and you \n     could see it every day when he came home,'' Peters said. ``He \n     was happy, he loved his life.''\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Very touching story. This year, once again, we reflect \non the service of Trooper James A. Moen to our State. At the same time \nwe recognize the continuing contributions of his daughter, Megan, \nwithout whom we would not know as much about the triumphs, the risks \nand the sacrifices made by the troopers who keep Alaskans safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4596-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4596-S4597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING CONVERSATIONS\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, small businesses have the unique \nability to recognize emerging service gaps in their local economies. \nOften, these small businesses fill these unique service gaps in \ntargeted, innovative ways. One such entity is this week's Small \nBusiness of the Week, Conversations of New Orleans, LA.\n  In 2010, Megan Hargroder noticed a lack in social media and online \nengagement consulting for startups, small businesses, and nonprofits in \nthe greater New Orleans area. Eager to fill the\n\n[[Page S4597]]\n\nniche, Hargroder founded the media consulting company Conversations. \nThrough Conversations, Hargroder's team provides targeted, easy-to-\nimplement strategies for entities to connect with clients and future \nclients across a variety of online media platforms. Conversations has \nbeen an integral component in the online presence of hundreds of local \norganizations, businesses, and campaigns, such as the Junior League of \nNew Orleans, the League of Women Voters, Tobacco Free Living, and \nformer New Orleans Saints safety Steve Gleason. Additionally, the \nConversations team maintains an online journal and steady calendar of \nspeaking engagements in their quest to continually educate and engage \nfolks in social media outreach techniques.\n  Like many startups, Hargroder initially struggled with transforming \nher innovative ideas into a profitable, effective business. She turned \nto the Greater New Orleans Region's Louisiana Small Business \nDevelopment Center, LSBDC, which helped her navigate the nuances of \nstarting and maintaining a healthy, thriving business. In the years \nsince, Conversations' five-person team of bright and driven innovators \nin the realm of media consulting has transformed online media \nengagement in the State--creating economic opportunities for scores of \nbusinesses in Louisiana and beyond.\n  Congratulations again to Conversations for being selected as Small \nBusiness of the Week. Thank you for your commitment to help local small \nbusinesses connect with clients and customers and foster economic \ngrowth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4597-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO HERBERT COLLINS\n\n   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to one of \nmy constituents. Mr. Herbert Collins, a native member of the Caroline \nCounty community, has dedicated his life to the protection and \npreservation of the unique history of the region and of the \nCommonwealth of Virginia.\n  Mr. Collins is a historian who served as a curator for the \nSmithsonian Institution here in Washington, DC. During his time at the \nmuseum, he was the executive director of the National Museum of \nAmerican History. He also helped found the National Postal Museum, \nestablished a security system for the National Philatelic Museum, and \nwas integral to the establishment of the National Museum of the \nAmerican Indian.\n  Mr. Collins has committed his life to serving the United States, both \nas a member of the U.S. Army in his youth and in his service as a \nhistorian. This is exemplified in the transformation of his historic \nhome into a personal museum, furnished with dozens of historic \nartifacts and antiques open to the public. Mr. Collins has also \ndeveloped relationships with Presidents dating back to President Harry \nTruman. He contributed his military uniform, complete with his laundry \nmark, for the funeral service of President Dwight Eisenhower, who had \nrequested to be buried in full military dress, and toured the country \nraising funds for a museum honoring President John F. Kennedy after the \nPresident was assassinated. Mr. Collins has undoubtedly left his mark \non the Commonwealth, and I am honored to celebrate his achievements. I \nknow that many throughout Virginia will join me in congratulating him \non his service to the Nation and this great State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4597-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4597-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4597-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:33 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 615) to amend \nthe Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Under Secretary for \nManagement of the Department of Homeland Security to take \nadministrative action to achieve and maintain interoperable \ncommunications capabilities among the components of the Department of \nHomeland Security, and for other purposes.\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \nbills, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 805.

A bill to amend the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to revise the \ncriteria for determining which States and political subdivisions are \nsubject to section 4 of the Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this year marks the 50th anniversaries of \nthe March from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the landmark \nVoting Rights Act. Passage of the Voting Rights Act was the result of \nthe blood, sweat, and tears of so many brave Americans who marched for \njustice--and the decades-long work of countless other men and women \ncommitted to seeing our country live up to its promise of equality and \njustice for all. Their actions transformed our Nation. On this 50th \nanniversary year, we pay special tribute to their legacy, but there is \nstill work to be done. Each generation must contribute to the fight for \nequality. Each of us must answer the call to move this Nation toward a \nmore perfect union.\n  In the coming weeks there will be continued celebrations of the \npassage of the original Voting Rights Act. Unfortunately, two years \nago, the Supreme Court voted to dismantle a core piece of that vital \nlegislation. In Shelby County v. Holder, five Republican-appointed \njustices on the Supreme Court drove a stake through the heart of the \nVoting Rights Act. Under Section 5 of the Act, the Federal government \nhas the authority to examine and prevent racially discriminatory voting \nchanges from being enacted before those changes disenfranchise voters \nin covered jurisdictions. By striking down the coverage formula that \ndetermined which States and jurisdictions were subject to Federal \nreview, the Court effectively gutted Section 5. And in holding that the \nformula was based on outdated information, the Roberts Court \ndisregarded thousands of pages of testimony and evidence from nearly 20 \ncongressional hearings held when the law was reauthorized in 2006.\n  Within weeks of the Supreme Court's devastating ruling, Republican \ngovernors and State legislatures exploited the Shelby County decision. \nSeveral States with a documented history of racial discrimination in \nvoting implemented sweeping laws that disproportionately suppressed the \nvoting rights of minorities, the elderly, and young people.\n  For example, Texas immediately implemented the most restrictive photo \nidentification law in the country. Although, a Federal judge found the \nlaw to be an ``unconstitutional poll tax'' that could disenfranchise up \nto 600,000 voters and disproportionately impact African Americans and \nLatinos, the law was allowed to disenfranchise voters this past \nelection.\n  In North Carolina, the Republican legislature and Republican governor \npassed a far-reaching bill that restricted its citizens' right to vote. \nThe bill cut early voting down from 17 days to 10 days, eliminated \nteenagers' ability to preregister before their 18th birthday, and \neliminated same day voter registration. It also enacted a strict photo \nidentification requirement, which is currently being challenged in \ncourt.\n  These are just a few of the numerous discriminatory voting \nrestrictions that have been enacted since Shelby County was decided. We \ncannot sit by as the fundamental right to vote is systematically \nundermined. We must not retreat from our commitment to civil rights and \nthe great accomplishments we celebrate this year. As my friend \nCongressman John Lewis has stated, voting ``is the most powerful, \nnonviolent tool we have to create a more perfect union.''\n  Similarly, in 1962, Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered a speech at \nthe Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston--the scene of the horrific \ntragedy last week--where he noted that voting rights was the key to \nachieving the American dream for all. Their statements are as true \ntoday as they were fifty years ago, and that is why we\n\n[[Page S4605]]\n\nmust do all we can to protect that right for all Americans.\n  I challenge anyone to claim that racial discrimination no longer \nexists. Even Chief Justice Roberts acknowledged in the Shelby County \ndecision that ``voting discrimination still exists; no one doubts \nthat.'' The Court further said that Congress may respond with \nlegislation based on current conditions. The bill we introduce today, \nthe Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2015, is that response. It \nreflects the very real, current conditions that Americans face when \ntrying to participate in our democracy.\n  We have heard from Americans across the country whose voting rights \nhave been diminished and suppressed since the Shelby County decision. \nWe have also heard from numerous voting rights experts and civil rights \nleaders who have called for strong legislation that would fully restore \nthe protections gutted by the Court's decision. The legislation we are \nintroducing today responds to those calls from the grassroots and the \ncommunity leaders on the ground who are today's foot soldiers for \njustice. This bill also represents the hard work and commitment of \ncivil rights organizations like the Leadership Conference on Civil and \nHuman Rights, the NAACP, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, \nthe Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the Brennan Center \nfor Justice, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, \nthe National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials \nEducational Fund, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, the American Civil \nLiberties Union, the Native American Rights Fund, the Alaska Federation \nof Natives, the National Congress of American Indians, LatinoJustice, \nthe Advancement Project, and many others. I thank all of these \norganizations and the tireless individuals who have helped us shape \nthis legislation.\n  This bill is a voting rights bill for all Americans. It is a bill for \nthe next generation, and helps protect the legacy of the previous \ngeneration who fought so hard five decades ago for these voting rights \nprotections.\n  Under this bill, all States and local jurisdictions are eligible for \nSection 5 protections under a new coverage formula, which is based on a \nfinding of repeated voting rights violations in the preceding 25 years. \nSignificantly, the 25-year period ``rolls'' or continuously moves to \nkeep up with ``current conditions,'' as the Supreme Court stated must \nbe a basis for any new coverage provision. States that have repeated \nand persistent violations will be covered for a period of 10 years, but \nif a State establishes a clean record moving forward, it emerges from \npreclearance coverage. In addition, the existing bailout provision \nwould still be available so that States or local jurisdictions that \nestablish a clean record can also emerge from coverage.\n  The bill also establishes a nationwide, targeted preclearance process \nfor a limited set of voting changes that have historically been found \nto discriminate against minority voters. For example, a racially \ndiverse county that seeks to change a single-member district seat into \nan at-large seat will require preclearance because that kind of change \nhas historically been used to marginalize minority voters. Racial \ngerrymandering, annexations that dilute minority voting strength, \nstrict photo identification requirements, reduction of multilingual \nvoting materials, and the elimination of polling locations in \njurisdictions that are racially, ethnically, or linguistically diverse, \nwill also receive greater scrutiny under this bill.\n  Our bill would also improve the Voting Rights Act to allow Federal \ncourts to bail-in specific jurisdictions where the effect of a \nparticular voting change is to deny citizens their right to vote. Under \nthis provision, a Federal court could subject to preclearance any State \nor local jurisdiction that the court determines violated the Voting \nRights Act or any other Federal law that prohibits discrimination in \nvoting on the basis of race, color, or membership in a language \nminority group.\n  The bill we introduce today will also ensure that voters are made \naware of changes in laws affecting their right to vote. Justice \nBrandeis once observed that sunlight is the best disinfectant and I \nbelieve that applies here as well. Transparency is a strong deterrent \nto voting discrimination. Under our bill, the public must be notified \nof late-breaking changes to standards and voting procedures in Federal \nelections. Information on polling place resource allocation for Federal \nelections must also be made public, including information about \naccessibility for persons with disabilities. Finally, information on \nchanges to electoral districts must be made available to the general \npublic. This includes demographic information, to prevent racial \ngerrymandering, impermissible redistricting, and infringement on \nminority voters at the Federal, State and local levels.\n  The bill makes other commonsense improvements, such as amending \ncurrent law to allow the Attorney General to request Federal observers \nin those jurisdictions where racial discrimination in voting remains a \nserious threat. It revises the preliminary injunction standard for \nvoting rights actions to recognize the principle that oftentimes, \nobtaining relief after the election has already concluded is too late \nto vindicate the individuals' voting rights. Thus, such temporary \nrelief may be obtained where the complainant raises a ``serious \nquestion'' that--on balance--the hardship the voting change imposes on \nthe complainant outweighs the hardship imposed upon the state or \njurisdiction.\n  In addition, this bill addresses the unique challenges that Native \nAmerican and Alaska Native voting populations encounter by: allowing \nfor more accessible polling locations and voter registration agencies; \npermitting absentee voting where polling locations are too remote; and \nensuring ballots are translated into all written Native languages where \ncurrent law already requires bilingual voting materials.\n  We are introducing this bill today because the persistent and \nevolving forms of voting discrimination require a strong response. I am \nproud to be joined by so many lawmakers from both sides of the Capitol \nand all parts of the country. I am joined by Senator Durbin, who worked \nwith me in 2006 to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act. We are also \njoined by Senator Coons, Leader Reid, all Democratic Senators on the \nJudiciary Committee, and many others. In addition, the House of \nRepresentatives is today introducing a companion bill, led by my friend \nJohn Lewis and leaders of the House Tri-Caucus--Representative Terri \nSewell of the Congressional Black Caucus, Representative Linda Sanchez \nof the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and Representative Judy Chu of \nthe Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.\n  I hope that Senate Republicans will join us soon as well. The Voting \nRights Act has always been bipartisan. In 2006, when we last \nreauthorized the Voting Rights Act, I worked closely with the \nRepublican chairmen of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees--\nformer Senator Arlen Specter and Representative Jim Sensenbrenner. Past \nreauthorizations have been signed into law by Republican presidents. \nYet over the past year, I have not found a Republican in the Senate \nwilling to join me in proposing a meaningful reinstatement of voter \nprotections.\n  In marking the 50th anniversary of the march in Selma this past \nMarch, President Obama issued a call to action on the Voting Rights \nAct. He observed that: ``One hundred members of Congress have come here \ntoday to honor people who were willing to die for the right to protect \nit. If we want to honor this day, let that hundred go back to \nWashington and gather four hundred more, and together, pledge to make \nit their mission to restore that law this year. That is how we honor \nthose on this bridge.''\n  I agree with the President. The best way we can honor those \nindividuals and the countless others who gave so much to make this a \nmore perfect union is not with platitudes or long overdue symbolic \ngestures. No, we must act--just as they did. We must continue to \nagitate, to organize, to educate, and to build momentum so that this \nlegislation becomes law. This bill, just as the Voting Rights Act \nbefore it, is necessary if we believe in a democracy that reflects our \nideals of equality and justice. This legislation will protect the \nconstitutional rights of all Americans and advance the principles of \nthose who marched a generation ago.\n  Much attention is focused on the Supreme Court this week as it is \npoised to\n\n[[Page S4606]]\n\nhand down decisions that will affect millions of Americans. The \ndecisions of those nine women and men will impact the security of our \nhealth care, the sanctity of our marriages and the quality of the air \nwe breathe. What the Supreme Court does matters. Its decisions affect \nus all. Nowhere in recent years has that been more clear than in its \nShelby County decision. That destructive ruling made the fundamental \nright to vote vulnerable. It is long past time for Congress to respond \nwith meaningful action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4606-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4606-S4607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 211--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING \n                               SREBRENICA\n\n  Mr. CARDIN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 211\n\n       Whereas July 2015 will mark 20 years since the genocide at \n     Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n       Whereas, beginning in April 1992, aggression and ethnic \n     cleansing perpetrated by Bosnian Serb forces resulted in a \n     massive influx of Bosniaks seeking protection in Srebrenica \n     and its environs, which the United Nations Security Council \n     designated a ``safe area'' within the Srebrenica enclave in \n     Resolution 819 on April 16, 1993, under the protection of the \n     United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR);\n       Whereas the UNPROFOR presence in Srebrenica consisted of a \n     Dutch peacekeeping battalion, with representatives of the \n     United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the \n     International Committee of the Red Cross, and the \n     humanitarian medical aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres \n     (Doctors Without Borders) helping to provide humanitarian \n     relief to the displaced population living in conditions of \n     massive overcrowding, destitution, and disease;\n       Whereas, early in 1995, an intensified blockade of the \n     enclave by Bosnian Serb forces deprived the entire population \n     of humanitarian aid and outside communication and contact, \n     and effectively reduced the ability of the Dutch peacekeeping \n     battalion to deter aggression or otherwise respond \n     effectively to a deteriorating situation;\n       Whereas, beginning on July 6, 1995, Bosnian Serb forces \n     attacked UNPROFOR outposts, seized control of the isolated \n     enclave, held captured Dutch soldiers hostage and, after \n     skirmishes with local defenders, took control of the town of \n     Srebrenica on July 11, 1995;\n       Whereas an estimated one-third of the population of \n     Srebrenica at the time, including a relatively small number \n     of soldiers, attempted to pass through the lines of Bosnian \n     Serb forces to the relative safety of Bosnian-government \n     controlled territory, but many were killed by patrols and \n     ambushes;\n       Whereas the remaining population sought protection with the \n     Dutch peacekeeping battalion at its headquarters in the \n     village of Potocari north of Srebrenica, but many of these \n     individuals were with seeming randomness seized by Bosnian \n     Serb forces to be beaten, raped, or executed;\n       Whereas Bosnian Serb forces deported women, children, and \n     the elderly in buses, but held over 8,000 primarily Bosniak \n     men and boys at collection points and sites in northeastern \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina under their control, and then \n     summarily executed these captives and buried them in mass \n     graves;\n       Whereas Bosnian Serb forces, hoping to conceal evidence of \n     the massacre at Srebrenica, subsequently moved corpses from \n     initial mass grave sites to many secondary sites scattered \n     throughout parts of eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina under \n     their control;\n       Whereas the International Commission for Missing Persons \n     (ICMP) deserves recognition for its assistance to the \n     relevant institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina in accounting \n     for close to 90 percent of those individuals reported missing \n     from Srebrenica, despite active attempts to conceal evidence \n     of the massacre, through the careful excavation of mass \n     graves sites and subsequent DNA analysis which confirmed the \n     true extent of the massacre;\n       Whereas the massacre at Srebrenica was among the worst of \n     many atrocities to occur in the conflict in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina from April 1992 to November 1995, during which \n     the policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing pursued by \n     Bosnian Serb forces with the direct support of the Serbian \n     regime of Slobodan Milosevic and its followers ultimately led \n     to the displacement of more than 2,000,000 people, more than \n     100,000 killed, tens of thousands raped or otherwise tortured \n     and abused, including at concentration camps in the Prijedor \n     area, with the innocent civilians of Sarajevo and other urban \n     centers repeatedly subjected to traumatic shelling and sniper \n     attacks;\n       Whereas, in addition to being the primary victims at \n     Srebrenica, individuals with Bosniak heritage comprise the \n     vast majority of the victims during the conflict in Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina as a whole, especially among the civilian \n     population;\n       Whereas Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide defines genocide as ``any \n     of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in \n     whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious \n     group, as such: (a) killing members of the group; (b) causing \n     serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) \n     deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life \n     calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole \n     or in part; (d) imposing measures intended to prevent births \n     within the group; and (e) forcibly transferring children of \n     the group to another group'';\n       Whereas, on May 25, 1993, the United Nations Security \n     Council adopted Resolution 827 establishing the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), based in \n     The Hague, the Netherlands, and charging the ICTY with \n     responsibility for investigating and prosecuting individuals \n     suspected of committing war crimes, genocide, crimes against \n     humanity and grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions on \n     the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991;\n       Whereas the ICTY, along with courts in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina as well as in Serbia, has indicted and in most \n     cases convicted approximately three dozen individuals at \n     various levels of responsibility for grave breaches of the \n     1949 Geneva Conventions, violations of the laws or customs of \n     war, crimes against humanity, genocide, and complicity in \n     genocide associated with the massacre at Srebrenica, most \n     notably Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, whose trials are \n     ongoing;\n       Whereas both the ICTY and the International Court of \n     Justice (ICJ) have ruled that the actions of Bosnian Serb \n     forces in Srebrenica in July 1995 constitute genocide;\n       Whereas House Resolution 199 (109th Congress), passed on \n     June 27, 2005, expressed the sense of the House of \n     Representatives that the aggression and ethnic cleansing \n     committed by Serb forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina meets the \n     terms defining genocide according to the 1949 Genocide \n     Convention;\n       Whereas the United Nations has largely acknowledged its \n     failure to fulfill its responsibility to take actions and \n     make decisions that could have deterred the assault on \n     Srebrenica and prevented the subsequent genocide from \n     occurring;\n       Whereas some prominent Serbian and Bosnian Serb officials, \n     among others, have denied or at least refused to acknowledge \n     that the massacre at Srebrenica constituted a genocide, or \n     have sought otherwise to trivialize the extent and importance \n     of the massacre; and\n       Whereas the international community, including the United \n     States, has continued to provide personnel and resources, \n     including through direct military intervention, to prevent \n     further aggression and ethnic cleansing, to negotiate the \n     General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina (initialed in Dayton, Ohio, on November 21, 1995, \n     and signed in Paris on December 14, 1995), and to help ensure \n     its fullest implementation, including cooperation with the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia as \n     well as reconciliation among all of Bosnia and Herzegovina's \n     citizens: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) affirms that the policies of aggression and ethnic \n     cleansing as implemented by Serb forces in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995 meet the terms defining the \n     crime of genocide in Article 2 of the Convention on the \n     Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide;\n       (2) condemns statements that deny or question that the \n     massacre at Srebrenica constituted a genocide;\n       (3) urges the Atrocities Prevention Board, a United States \n     interagency committee established by the President in 2012, \n     to study the lessons of Srebrenica and issue informed \n     guidance on how to prevent similar incidents from recurring \n     in the future, paying particular regard to troubled \n     countries, including Syria, the Central African Republic and \n     Burundi;\n       (4) encourages the United States to maintain and reaffirm \n     its policy of supporting the independence and territorial \n     integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, peace and stability in \n     southeastern Europe as a whole, and the right of all people \n     living in the region, regardless of national, racial, ethnic \n     or religious background, to return to their homes and enjoy \n     the benefits of democratic institutions, the rule of law, and \n     economic opportunity, as well as to know the fate of missing \n     relatives and friends;\n       (5) recognizes the achievement of the International \n     Commission for Missing Persons (ICMP) in accounting for those \n     missing in conflicts or natural disasters around the world \n     and believes that the ICMP deserves justified recognition for \n     its assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina and its relevant \n     institutions in accounting for approximately 90 percent of \n     those reported missing after the Srebrenica massacre and 70 \n     percent of those reported missing during the whole of the \n     conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n       (6) welcomes the arrest and transfer to the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) of all \n     persons indicted for war crimes, crimes against humanity, \n     genocide and grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, \n     particularly those of Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, \n     which has helped strengthen peace and encouraged \n     reconciliation between the countries of the region and their \n     citizens;\n\n[[Page S4607]]\n\n       (7) asserts that it is in the national interest of the \n     United States that those individuals who are responsible for \n     these crimes and breaches should continue to be held \n     accountable for their actions, and that the work of the ICTY \n     therefore warrants continued support until all trials and \n     appeals have been completed; and\n       (8) honors the thousands of innocent people killed or \n     executed at Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina in July \n     1995, along with all individuals who were victimized during \n     the conflict and genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 \n     to 1995, as well as foreign nationals, including United \n     States citizens, and those individuals in Serbia, Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina, and other countries of the region who risked and \n     in some cases lost their lives during their brave defense of \n     human rights and fundamental freedoms, and advocacy of \n     respect for ethnic identity without discrimination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4607-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 212--CONDEMNING THE ATTACK ON EMANUEL AFRICAN \n     METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH IN CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA, AND \n  EXPRESSING ENCOURAGEMENT AND PRAYERS FOR ALL AFFECTED BY THIS EVIL \n                                ASSAULT\n\n  Mr. SCOTT (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Alexander, Ms. Ayotte, Ms. \nBaldwin, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Blunt, Mr. \nBooker, Mr. Boozman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown, Mr. Burr, Ms. Cantwell, \nMrs. Capito, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Carper, Mr. Casey, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. Coats, \nMr. Cochran, Ms. Collins, Mr. Coons, Mr. Corker, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. \nCotton, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Daines, Mr. Donnelly, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \nEnzi, Mrs. Ernst, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. Flake, Mr. Franken, \nMr. Gardner, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Heinrich, \nMs. Heitkamp, Mr. Heller, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \nIsakson, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kaine, Mr. King, Mr. Kirk, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. \nLankford, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lee, Mr. Manchin, Mr. Markey, Mr. McCain, Mrs. \nMcCaskill, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \nMoran, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Murphy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Paul, \nMr. Perdue, Mr. Peters, Mr. Portman, Mr. Reed of Rhode Island, Mr. Reid \nof Nevada, Mr. Risch, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rounds, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Sanders, \nMr. Sasse, Mr. Schatz, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Sessions, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. \nShelby, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Tester, Mr. Thune, Mr. Tillis, \nMr. Toomey, Mr. Udall, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Warner, Ms. Warren, Mr. \nWhitehouse, Mr. Wicker, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following \nresolution;

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about what just \nhappened on the floor, which was passing in the Senate the trade \npromotion authority for the President of the United States and for our \ngood country to be able to get out there and expand markets for our \nexporters and for our farmers, our workers, and our service providers.\n  This is a significant change because for the last 8 years the United \nStates of America has not been engaged in opening up these markets. \nWhile other countries have completed these trade agreements, we have \nnot been able to. So this gives us as a country the ability to be able \nto open up markets. That is a good thing, and it is significant and \nwill have an impact on our economy that is positive because exports \nmean not only more jobs but better jobs. So we will see more jobs that \nare, on average, 15 to 18 percent higher pay and have better benefits, \nand we will be able to compete more globally. This is important to get \nAmerica off the sidelines.\n  There is also a benefit of getting us back involved in trade because \nit enables America to be able to set some of the rules of trade rather \nthan other countries. And while we have not had this ability to be able \nto open up new markets, what has happened? Other countries have been \ncompleting agreements, shutting us out--our farmers, our workers, our \nservice providers--but they also have been setting the rules of\n\n[[Page S4609]]\n\ntrade. We want to be able to set them because we are a country that \nbelieves we ought to have a rules-based system, that it ought to be \nfair, that there ought to be the rule of law, and that the standards we \nhave--which are high standards in terms of getting tariffs down but \nalso not being able to unfairly send imports to another country--that \nthose are upheld. So this is a positive step.\n  What I am also really happy about is that after we passed the trade \npromotion authority for the first time in 8 years, sending it for \nsignature to the President, which he has indicated he will sign, we \nthen passed legislation with regard to trade adjustment assistance, \nwhich is extending benefits to people who are displaced. So if someone \nin any particular trade agreement loses a job or a company gets hurt, \nthey have the ability to get the worker retraining they need, get the \nhelp they need to be able to get the skills they need to find a job and \nto get themselves back on their feet. So trade adjustment assistance is \nimportant.\n  But within trade adjustment assistance there is something even more \ninteresting. We included an amendment which Senator Brown--my colleague \nfrom Ohio--and I had promoted previously. This is to help all of our \nworkers all around America because it enables us to have the ability to \ngo after countries that send their products to us unfairly, meaning \nthat they subsidize them, which is not fair under the rules of trade, \nor that they dump them, meaning they sell them at below their cost, \nwhich is also unfair.\n  So this is a very important amendment. We call it the leveling the \nplaying field amendment because as we are expanding exports--which we, \nof course, should do because that creates more good jobs in my home \nState of Ohio and around the country--we should also be sure that we \nare more aggressively enforcing the trade laws that are in place, the \ninternational rules and our domestic rules. This amendment that just \npassed the Senate tonight enables us to do that.\n  I am excited about it because it gives us the chance to be able to \ncompete. It gives the steelworker in Ohio who is playing by the rules \nand doing all the right things--being more efficient, being more \nproductive--and companies that are using technology to our advantage \nthe chance to be productive, not to be undercut when other countries \ndump their products--say, their steel products, their tubes, and other \nproducts, structural steel--into the United States of America because \nthey want to get market share. We are going to be able to stop that \nwith this amendment because it enables us to be able to not just file \nlawsuits against these countries but actually get them resolved more \nquickly.\n  Right now, my concern is that too often with these trade laws, by the \ntime you bring a case and are successful at it, you have lost so many \njobs that, in effect, although you get a remedy that is winning a trade \ncase and getting higher tariffs on that product, it is too late. This \nis a really important amendment, the leveling the playing field \namendment.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for supporting it. I know there were \nsome concerns and questions about it. We spent the last couple of \nmonths talking about it. Tonight it actually passed. I am told that \nlegislation is now going to go to the House and that it will be passed \nin the House. I am told that Speaker Pelosi has said today that she is \ngoing to support that legislation. This is the trade adjustment \nassistance legislation with the leveling the playing field amendment as \na part of it.\n  Finally, as part of the TAA, there is another really important \nmeasure that I appreciate my colleagues supporting. It is one that I \noffered in committee, and I have offered it over the years in \ncommittee. It is to help workers who were left behind. Back when it was \nnecessary for the U.S. Government to intervene and help our auto \ncompanies, there were some people who weren't helped.\n  This provides a health care tax credit to those individuals who \nthrough no fault of their own lost health care and lost pensions. This \nis when their plans went into the PBGC. This includes Delphi workers in \nmy home State of Ohio. There are several thousand of them. It includes \nsome United Steelworkers. It includes some other employees who were \nleft behind when other workers were given their pensions and given \ntheir health care.\n  Every year we have fought for this. We have now been able to put in \nplace an extension of the health care tax credit they desperately need. \nFor most of these people, it is to provide them the ability between the \nage they are now--say, in their late 50s--and when they get on \nMedicare. It is a critical time for them to be able to have this bridge \nand to be able to provide health care for themselves and for their \nfamilies.\n  The health care tax credit is part of this broader TAA, or trade \nadjustment assistance, legislation that was passed here on the floor of \nthe Senate this afternoon. I thank my colleagues for working with me on \nthis over the past several years but also over the past several weeks \nwith regard to this specific provision. Again, that will go to the \nHouse now, and we are told that will pass the House as it is. In other \nwords, the House will take up this exact bill and pass it and send it \nto President for signature.\n  This is also a really important opportunity for us to reach out to \npeople who are hurting today through no fault of their own and to \nprovide them the health care tax credit they deserve.\n  In the legislation that we passed this afternoon, we also did \nsomething else really important that we have never done before, and \nthat is to help protect Israel from discrimination. We included \nlanguage in the trade bill itself that Senator Cardin and I had \nchampioned in the committee. It is the part of the bill that says that \ncountries that engage in boycotts or sanctions or divestment of Israel \nin a trade agreement with the United States of America would not be \nable to get the benefits of trade with us.\n  We think this is incredibly important leverage to help protect Israel \nfrom what, unfortunately, is happening around the world too often now, \nwhich is a double standard--telling the State of Israel that somehow it \nis going to be treated differently than other countries are treated.\n  I think it is part of a larger effort to try to delegitimize the \nState of Israel, and it is one where the United States ought to stand \nup. Why is this being done in the context of trade? Because it works. \nIt is an area where we do have leverage.\n  When I was U.S. Trade Representative, I had the honor to be able to \nnegotiate agreements with various countries. One was Oman, one was \nBahrain, and one was Saudi Arabia. In all three cases, we were able to \nmake great progress in the case of boycotts of Israel by telling those \ncountries: If you want to do business with the United States and have a \nfree-trade agreement with us, then you have to treat all countries \nfairly. You have to follow the MFN, or most favored nation status, \nwhich means you treat countries fairly and you don't discriminate \nagainst countries.\n  Initially, they would say: No, gosh, politically that is too hard for \nus. But after discussions and after the United States stood tall with \nIsrael, we were able to succeed in all three cases: Bahrain and Oman \nwith trade agreements and Saudi Arabia with regard to their accession \nagreement to the World Trade Organization. I know it works. I have seen \nit.\n  Again, that is in the legislation that was passed today here on the \nfloor of this Senate. I am proud of us because we are actually doing \nsome of this work on a bipartisan basis to help our country, to help \nour workers, to help our service providers, our farmers but also to \nensure that these rules of trade are fair globally.\n  Finally, I will say that we are not done. There is another bill that \nwe were told would be part of this whole package. It is currently being \nnegotiated in conference after this afternoon because we named \nconferees between the House and Senate. It is the Customs bill.\n  In that legislation, there are additional provisions that I think are \nvery important that we passed, including one called the ENFORCE Act. \nThis is to avoid the situation where a country is told: You are dumping \nproducts in the United States or you are subsidizing your product in \nthe United States, and you can't do that anymore. Instead, they figure \nout a way to divert their product to another country and\n\n[[Page S4610]]\n\nstill send it to the United States using the same unfair trade \npractices.\n  We need to be sure that we are putting in place provisions that allow \nus to stop that diversion as well. That is what the ENFORCE Act does. \nThat is in the Customs bill, as one example. There are other important \nprovisions in the Customs bill, as well.\n  I would urge my colleagues to work with us to get that conference \ndone as quickly as possible because the House and Senate versions are a \nlittle bit different and to be sure that we can come up with a way to \nresolve those differences and bring that back to the floor as part of \nthis package.\n  The final one in that package is something that is very important to \nmanufacturers in my State. This is to enable us to bring products in \nfrom overseas that were not made anywhere in America under what is \ncalled miscellaneous tariff bill. This is something that we have not \nhad the opportunity to do in several years because there are concerns \nabout earmarks. I agree with those concerns. We should not have \nearmarks, whether it is in trade or whether it is in appropriations or \nelsewhere.\n  We have resolved that issue by not having it be earmarked under the \ndefinition we have in the House and Senate but rather have it go \nthrough the International Trade Commission and have them be the ones \nthat determine whether a particular product fits within a miscellaneous \ntariff bill or not.\n  This will help in terms of adding employment in America, reducing the \ncost to consumers, making our economy more productive and more \nefficient, and adding economic growth. It is another example that when \nonce we complete this package, it includes expanding exports, which was \nvery important. We had to do that today because America has been \nsitting on the sidelines for too long. We were losing market share for \nour farmers, our workers, our service providers. We needed to get back \nin the game and send more products stamped ``Made in America'' around \nthe world. That creates jobs here. That is good.\n  Second, we need to be sure that we have a level playing field, that \nwe work on this issue of currency manipulation, which has some \nunprecedented language, and also on these other issues we talked about \ntoday with the level the playing field amendment to ensure that \nproducts are not being sold unfairly and that we do provide workers \nwith trade adjustment assistance.\n  Then finally, we move forward with this final bill called the Customs \nbill to ensure that we include all these provisions which are so \nimportant as a package and to make sure that yes, we are expanding \nexports at the same time and we are letting people know that they are \ngoing to get a fair shake. When they work hard and play by the rules \nhere in America, our workers are going to be told: You are in the \nglobal marketplace; we are going to watch your back. That is important. \nIt is important to me. It is important to my State. It is important to \nthe people who send us here, who expect us to set the conditions in \nplace for more exports but also to ensure that is more fairly done.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for the work that has been done today, \nand I also urge my colleagues to move quickly, passing trade adjustment \nassistance in the House and then passing the conference report on the \nCustoms bill so we can keep this package together and actually give our \neconomy a shot in the arm and give American workers the chance to \ncompete.\n  If they are given that chance, we have the best work force in the \nworld. We will be able not just to compete but to win the global \ncompetition.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. President, I have been asked to do the closing script, and then \nthe Senator from Massachusetts will be recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4610-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JUNE 25, 2015\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

Mr. President, June is Alzheimer's & Brain Awareness \nMonth--an opportunity to join the global conversation about this equal \nopportunity killer, Alzheimer's.\n  Everyone with a brain is at risk to develop Alzheimer's. Worldwide \nright now there are 47 million people living with Alzheimer's and with \nother dementias. Without a change, these numbers are expected to grow \nto 76 million people globally with Alzheimer's by the year 2030.\n  In 1998, my mother passed away from Alzheimer's. That is the year \nthat I created the bipartisan Congressional Alzheimer's Task Force. The \nreason I did it was that it is very hard--as people who have an \nAlzheimer's patient in their family know--to deal with this disease \nwhile my mother had it. But for me, it became something very important, \nsomething that I felt that Congress had a responsibility to deal with. \nFor 13 years, my mother just stayed in our living room, being cared for \nby my father. My mother was quite fortunate because my father had been \na milkman. The right arm of a milkman carrying milk bottles for decades \nis the strongest right arm you can have. My father could care for my \nmother. My father could keep my mother in our home. But not every \nfamily has a strong right arm of a milkman.\n  Keeping an Alzheimer's patient at home is a difficult task. We have \nto accept the fact that statistically, we now have more than 5 million \nAmericans with Alzheimer's. Let me say that again: 5 million Americans, \nas we gather here on the Senate floor, have Alzheimer's in our country, \nbut that is before all the baby boomers have retired. By the time all \nof the baby boomers in America have retired, 15 million of them are \ngoing to have Alzheimer's. Like my family, someone else in each one of \nthose families is going to have Alzheimer's as well because they will \nbe the family caregiver. That will be about 30 million people by the \ntime all the baby boomers have retired whose principal reality in life \nwill be this one disease.\n  How big is this disease as a drain on our country? This year we are \ngoing to spend in Medicare and Medicaid dollars $153 billion on \nAlzheimer's patients.\n  I will say that again. This year in America, with 5 million people \nwith the disease, we are going to spend $153 billion. How big is that \nnumber? While we are debating the Defense bill for our country--how big \nis the Defense bill to protect our entire country here and overseas? It \nis $560 billion. One disease, Alzheimer's, is going to cost us $153 \nbillion. By the time all 15 million baby boomers have the disease, the \namount of Federal money in Medicare and Medicaid that we will be \nspending will be equal to the entire defense budget of our country. \nThat is obviously not sustainable.\n  We have to find a cure for Alzheimer's not just for our country but \nfor every other country in the world. We have to be the leader. Our \ncaregivers are the heroes today, but even heroes need help. As the true \nneurological wasting effects take hold of the next generation of \nAlzheimer's patients, the costs to our society will mount unless we \nmake the smart investments to treat and defeat this disease. We have an \nopportunity here in the Senate to provide the leadership.\n\n[[Page S4611]]\n\n  For every $27,000 in 2015 that we are going to spend from the U.S. \nSenate on Alzheimer's out of the Medicare and Medicaid budget, the \nNational Institutes of Health invests $100 in trying to find a cure. \nThat is right. You heard me correctly. For every $27,000 of Federal \nmoney this year on an Alzheimer's patient, we are spending $100 to try \nto find a cure.\n  The NIH budget has to increase, and it has to increase dramatically \nbecause in the long run we cannot balance the Federal budget if in 30 \nyears one disease is going to consume as much Federal money as the \nentire defense budget in our country.\n  Every 67 seconds, someone new in this country develops Alzheimer's. \nIn my State of Massachusetts, 12 percent of all seniors have \nAlzheimer's.\n  We need a breakthrough in research. Research is medicine's field of \ndreams from which we harness the findings that give hope to families so \nthat one day children will have to look to the history books to find \nthat there ever was such a disease as Alzheimer's.\n  Right now is not the time to cut funding at the National Institutes \nof Health. They are not only the National Institutes of Health, they \nare also the national institutes of hope, and we must give that hope to \nAmerican families that we can find a cure. We cannot cut that budget. \nWe cannot allow sequestration to come in and slash the NIH budget once \nagain. In 2015, NIH has buying power that is 20 percent lower than it \nwas 10 years ago. This is at a point where it should be ramped up 20 \npercent higher, not lower.\n  This is a debate which we should be having. The terrorist call that \npeople fear is that some doctor will call their house to them that yet \nanother member of their family has Alzheimer's or some other tragic \ndisease.\n  We need to increase the NIH budget. We need to give that hope to \nAmerican families. And that is why Senator Crapo and I worked to pass \nthe Alzheimer's Accountability Act into law. It requires the Director \nof NIH to submit an annual budget directly to Congress outlining what \nresources are needed to meet the goal of preventing and treating \nAlzheimer's disease by 2025. That is why my colleagues, Senator \nStabenow, Senator Collins, Senator Capito, and I introduced the Hope \nfor Alzheimer's Act, which will allow Medicare beneficiaries to receive \ncomprehensive care-planning services when they are diagnosed with \nAlzheimer's. That is also why Senator Wyden and I included the \nIndependence at Home Program as part of the Affordable Care Act. This \nprogram allows chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries, such as those \nwith Alzheimer's, to receive primary care services in the comfort of \ntheir home. Independence at Home allows teams of doctors and nurses to \ncontinue to care for severely ill Medicare patients in their home by \nbringing the house calls of the yesteryear physicians into the 21st \ncentury.\n  Just last week, some game-changing data was released on the success \nof the first year of this program. We learned that when implemented \nproperly, the Independence at Home Program has the potential to save \n$21 billion of Medicare money over the next decade, and at the same \ntime it also improves the quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries. \nThis is a win-win situation. It is possible to design Medicare so that \nit works smarter, saves money, and improves the lives of beneficiaries.\n  Patients want to be cared for in their living rooms, not in the \nemergency room. That is what my father, John Markey the milkman, was \nable to provide for my mother with Alzheimer's. That is what the \nIndependence at Home Program does. It is a program where nurse \npractitioners, physicians, and nursing homes are able to say: We are \ngoing to help to keep your loved one at home. We will give you the help \nthat makes that possible.\n  Independence at Home is steering our health care system toward a \nfocus of quality and not simply the quantity of care.\n  As we build a future free of Alzheimer's disease, Congress and the \nAmerican people need a blueprint on how to be more effective at \nprioritizing Federal resources to reach our goal. When America makes a \nplan, America can do great things. We need an action plan to cure \nAlzheimer's and to care for those who suffer from it.\n  In the 1960s, President Kennedy called for a mission to the Moon, and \nwe accomplished great things to make that happen. In the 21st century, \nit is not a mission to the Moon, it is a mission to the mind which is \nour challenge, and we must make the same kind of investment in research \nthat was made in the 1960s.\n  We did not allow the Soviet Union to dominate. We cannot allow this \ndisease to devastate 15 million lives with Alzheimer's in this baby \nboom generation. The legacy we should be leaving is that we found the \ncure. It was first identified more than 100 years ago. We now have to \nmake sure that our legacy in the 21st century is that we have been able \nto build the momentum to fund the research that ensures families in our \ncountry have hope.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week I returned from 3 days in \nPoland and Latvia. I participated in the global security forum in \nWroclaw, Poland, where I met with key foreign leaders from Eastern \nEurope in particular. I also visited U.S. and allied forces \nparticipating in military exercises in Latvia.\n  For the first time since the end of the Cold War, the West is \nconfronted by an armed aggressor directly challenging the principle of \na Europe whole, free, and at peace. European officials I spoke with see \nRussian President Vladimir Putin as opportunistic, determined to expand \nRussia's sphere of influence, and ready to exploit any vulnerabilities \nin nearby European countries.\n  Our friends on the frontlines in Central and Eastern Europe want more \nthan words of solidarity from the European Union, NATO, and the United \nStates; they want a more robust response and concrete actions to \ncounter the Russian threat and deter further Russian aggression.\n  The crucible for this effort must come in Ukraine. With the \nEuromaidan Revolution of 2013 and the subsequent election of President \nPetro Poroshenko, the Ukrainian people have made it clear that their \nfuture is with the West, with democracy, with responsive and \ntransparent governance. President Putin responded by invading eastern \nUkraine, annexing Crimea, and destabilizing the entire Ukrainian State.\n  Ukraine today is a symbol of democratic Europe's resistance to \nRussian domination in the same way that Berlin was in 1948. The \nUkrainian army has performed commendably under incredibly challenging \ncircumstances, but it is no match for Russia's military.\n  However, as we witnessed throughout the Communist era in Eastern \nEurope, military power is not the only kind of power, nor does it \nnecessarily always prevail. There is also the moral power of those who \ndare to resist, people like Andrei Sakhorov, Vaclav Havel, and Lech \nWalesa. As dissidents, they didn't command armies; instead, they \ncommanded immense moral authority. They stood for freedom, and \nultimately they triumphed.\n  Last Friday, at that forum in Wroclaw, I had the privilege of \npresenting Freedom Awards to Ukrainians who embodied their nation's \ncourageous resistance and indomitable spirit. One of the awardees was \nNadiya Savchenko. She has been well known in Ukraine for many years as \none of the first women to serve as a pilot in the Ukrainian Air Force. \nIn 2014, she joined a volunteer battalion to fight separatist forces in \nthe country's east.\n  Nadiya Savchenko was not present to receive her Freedom Award because \ntragically, outrageously, this hero of the fight for Ukrainian \nindependence is imprisoned in a Russian jail. At every turn, Nadiya \nSavchenko has been courageous and unbowed--the embodiment of Ukraine's \ndefiance of Russian aggression.\n  Captured while fighting in the east, she was handcuffed to a metal \npipe, surrounded by armed men, and interrogated. When asked who was \nfighting the pro-Russian separatists, she answered, ``All of Ukraine.''\n  Held as a prisoner in Russia, she went on an 83-day hunger strike. \nAppearing\n\n[[Page S4612]]\n\nin a cage inside a courtroom, she refused to speak Russian, wore a T-\nshirt that displayed the Ukrainian trident, and held up a sign that \nread ``I was born Ukrainian, and I die Ukrainian.''\n  President Poroshenko awarded her the title ``Hero of Ukraine,'' and \nher fellow citizens elected her to Parliament. But, truly, she is a \nhero to all of us who seek to restore a Europe that is whole and free.\n  I presented the second Freedom Award to the Donetsk National \nUniversity. Last year, pro-Russian separatists seized the city of \nDonetsk and declared a Soviet-style people's republic. Armed rebels \ntook over the Donetsk's national university, the region's most \nprestigious college. They ousted the school's Ukrainian rector, ordered \nthe Russification of the curriculum, and destroyed any semblance of \nacademic freedom. Rather than submit, the rector and core faculty \nmembers left Donetsk and they transplanted the school roughly 500 miles \nto the west. Donetsk National University became Ukraine's first \nuniversity in exile. It has been a struggle to survive, but this \nuniversity has become a proud symbol of both academic freedom and \nUkrainian independence.\n  The attack on Ukraine has not only galvanized Europe, it also focused \nthe attention of Congress on European affairs like no other event \nperhaps since the end of the Cold War, certainly like no other event \nsince I have been in the Senate.\n  On a bipartisan basis, Members of Congress admire and support \nUkraine's stand for universal values and independence, and Congress has \nresponded. In December, we passed the Ukraine Freedom Support Act \nauthorizing the President to provide defensive military assistance to \nUkraine and to tighten economic sanctions against Russia.\n  Through the European Reassurance Initiative, the administration has \npledged $1 billion to bolster U.S. military deployments, to increase \nour training exercises, and to step up our partnerships with allies, \nincluding the Baltic States, Poland, Ukraine, Moldavia, and Georgia as \nthey strengthen their own defenses. I was pleased to learn last week \nthat the administration is planning to preposition tanks and other \nheavy weaponry in the Baltic States and in Eastern Europe to support \ntraining with regional allies and to show resolve in the face of \nRussian threats.\n  These are all important steps forward, but they are not sufficient. \nWithin the Transatlantic Alliance and NATO, the United States remains \nthe indispensable Nation. If there is going to be a renaissance of the \nalliance in the face of the Russian threat, then the United States must \nlead it with our European allies.\n  The United States must mobilize the alliance, our European partners, \nand international financial institutions, such as the IMF, to provide \ngenerous economic support to Ukraine because no amount of security \nassistance can offset an economic collapse in Kyiv.\n  We also must recognize that the challenge for Mr. Putin is not only \ngeopolitical; it is ideological. He has mobilized a vast propaganda \ncampaign against what he calls ``decadent'' Western values and Western-\nstyle democracy. The United States, along with our allies, must go on \nthe offensive to champion our values and our democracy. Just as we did \nduring the Cold War, we must develop a 21st-century United States \nInformation Agency and a Radio Free Europe-style campaign to counter \nRussia in the information space, including in the competition of ideas \nand values.\n  While American leadership is essential, our European allies must also \nstep up. NATO leaders made important spending pledges at the Wales \nSummit last September. Now we all need to make good on those \ncommitments, including increasing defense budgets to respond to Russian \nthreats.\n  As we confront a newly aggressive Russia, we should also take heart \nfrom the Transatlantic Alliance's remarkable track record of \nachievement, thanks in large part to American leadership. Over the last \nseven decades, we have risen to every major challenge--rebuilding \nEurope after World War II; maintaining a united front during the Cold \nWar; liberating the captive nations of Eastern Europe and integrating \nthem into a Europe whole and free; and today, standing united against \nthe challenges of terrorism, Russian aggression, and a nuclear Iran.\n  The Russian threat to Eastern and Central Europe is very real. \nPresident Putin is an autocrat whose popularity is based largely on his \ndetermination to reassert Russia's domination over its neighbors. But \nwe have the means to counter this threat.\n  To support Ukraine and other frontline states, we need vigorous U.S. \nleadership of the Transatlantic Alliance, we need a robust mobilization \nof the alliance's military and financial resources, and we need to \nengage Vladimir Putin aggressively in the competition of ideas and \nideals.\n  Our friends in Ukraine are already in this fight. Our allies \nelsewhere in Central and Eastern Europe fear that they could be next. \nFor the West to rise to this new challenge, the United States once \nagain must be the indispensable Nation, and I know that here in the \nSenate we support that effort.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/24/senate-section/article/S4612-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:50 A.M.
