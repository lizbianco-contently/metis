Res. 23 is a joint resolution providing for congressional \ndisapproval under chapter 8 of title 5 of the United States Code of a \nrule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) relating to \n``Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New, \nModified, and Reconstructed Stationary Sources: Electric Utility \nGenerating Units.''

(The \nPocket Veto Case, 279 U.S. 655 (1929)).\n  Climate change poses a profound threat to our future and future \ngenerations. Atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, a primary greenhouse \ngas, are higher than they have been in at least 800,000 years. In 2009, \nEPA determined that greenhouse gas pollution endangers Americans' \nhealth and welfare by causing long-lasting changes in the climate that \ncan have, and are already having, a range of negative effects on human \nhealth, the climate, and the environment. We are already seeing the \nimpacts of climate change, and established science confirms that we \nwill experience stronger storms, deeper droughts, longer wildfire \nseasons, and other intensified impacts as the planet warms. The \nPentagon has determined that climate change poses immediate risks to \nour national security.\n  Power plants are the largest source of greenhouse gas pollution in \nour country. Although we have limits on other dangerous pollutants from \npower plants, the carbon pollution standards and the Clean Power Plan \nensure that we will finally have national standards to reduce the \namount of carbon pollution that our power plants can emit.\n  The carbon pollution standards will ensure that, when we make major \ninvestments in power generation infrastructure, we also deploy \navailable technologies to make that infrastructure as low-emitting as \npossible. By blocking these standards from taking effect, S.J. Res. 23 \nwould delay our transition to cleaner electricity generating \ntechnologies by enabling continued build-out of outdated, high-\npolluting infrastructure. Because it would overturn carbon pollution \nstandards that are critical to protecting against climate change and \nensuring the health and well-being of our Nation, I cannot support the \nresolution.\n  To leave no doubt that the resolution is being vetoed, in addition to \nwithholding my signature, I am returning S.J.

It is projected to reduce carbon \npollution from power plants by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. It \nbuilds on progress States and the power sector are already making to \nmove toward cleaner energy production, and gives States the time and \nflexibility they need to develop tailored, cost-effective plans to \nreduce their emissions. By nullifying the Clean Power Plan, S.J. Res. \n24 not only threatens ongoing progress toward cleaner energy, but would \nalso eliminate public health and other benefits of up to $54 billion \nper year by 2030, including thousands fewer premature deaths from air \npollution and thousands fewer childhood asthma attacks each year.\n  The Clean Power Plan is essential in addressing the largest source of \ngreenhouse gas pollution in our country.

Mr. President, I wish to welcome colleagues back to a \nnew year in a new Senate that is back to work for the American people. \nIt is clear we had a successful 2015. Committees began functioning \nagain. Senators began having more of a say again. We got important \nthings accomplished for the American people. We are looking to build \nupon this progress in 2016. There is, of course, much to be done, but I \nam optimistic about what can be achieved with a bipartisan dedication \nto moving back to regular order, not just this year but in the years to \ncome.\n  The scale of what any Congress will be able to accomplish in a given \nyear often depends upon the willingness of the President to cooperate \nand engage in good faith. When President Obama comes to address \nCongress tomorrow, he will have an important opportunity to demonstrate \nthat to the American people. The question is, Will he rise to the \nmoment? Based on what the White House has been saying in the media, it \nis unlikely we will hear a unifying message for our country tomorrow. \nThat is unfortunate. I think the American people can expect to hear a \npositive message from Governor Haley. Many are looking forward to \nhearing what she has to say. I will have much more to say on all of \nthat tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/senate-section/article/S4-5", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING DALE BUMPERS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

BLACK\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the Chaplain is in the building, I \nwish to say a brief word. I have the good fortune--and have for many \nyears--to come to the floor every day and listen to a prayer offered in \nsincerity by our Chaplain. The people who watch us on TV think that all \nhe does is walk in here every day and give a little prayer. The fact \nis, I received information on the things he did this past year.\n  He represented the Senate in 27 out-of-town speaking engagements. \nThose speaking engagements are tremendous. He has been in Nevada on a \nnumber of occasions. He is a tremendous presenter of what he does and \nwhat is good for the country. He delivered the invocation and/or \nbenediction to 17 different ceremonies. He spoke at 10 different Senate \nfunctions. He visited with 20 different school groups who came to visit \nthe Capitol. He delivered the invocation at 12 local events. He spoke \nat 26 local events. He hosted 11 guest Chaplains. He hosted three \nJewish programs. He administered premarital and marriage-enrichment \ncounseling. He mentored 20 Senate staffers in a recurring, 10-week \nspiritual mentoring program. He facilitated the Wednesday morning \nweekly Prayer Breakfast. He hosted two men's Prayer Breakfasts for \nSenate staff featuring Os Guinness and Michael Franzese as guest \nspeakers. He hosted a special program at Easter, our 20th\n\n[[Page S5]]\n\nannual Thanksgiving service, and a holiday open house for the Senate \ncommunity.\n  He prayed on the Senate floor for the convening of most Senate \nsessions. He taught 44 Bible studies for approximately 150 Senate \nstaff. He taught 44 Bible studies for approximately 15 staff in the \nPostal Square Building. He taught 40 Bible studies for the Senators in \nSenator Inhofe's Capitol office. He taught 44 Bible studies for 15 \nchiefs of staff. He engaged in hospital visitations on frequent \noccasions and gave weekly updates about the sick and injured at the \nSenate Prayer Breakfast. He delivered the eulogy for former Senator \nEdward Brook at the National Cathedral. He spoke at memorial services \nand funerals for various Senate staff members. He ministered to Senate \noffice staff members during times of grief. He spoke to Senate staff \nduring staff meetings.\n  That is not all. In relation to his activities and duties, he hosted \na ladies' small group Bible study every Monday, consisting of Senate \nstaff. He had a small group of men consisting of Capitol police \nofficers and other Senate staff for Bible study every Wednesday.\n  Mr. President, everyone should know that he does more than give this \nprayer opening the Senate every day. In fact, if that was all he did, \nit would be well worth the functions of the Senate Chaplain, but he \ndoes much more. I congratulate him and express the appreciation of the \nentire Senate for the good work and good representations this fine man \ndoes representing our country. Remember, he is a retired admiral of the \nU.S. Navy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/senate-section/article/S5-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING DALE BUMPERS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on another subject, I had the good fortune \nyesterday to attend the funeral of Dale Bumpers in Little Rock, AR. The \nceremony lasted almost 2 hours. It was a stunningly spiritual, \nhumorous, and historical occasion.\n  Dale Bumpers performed at that desk back there by the exit of this \ndoor. He had an extra long extension cord, and he traipsed around back \nthere, walking back and forth, speaking only as he could do. It is what \nwe do here in the Senate. Based on seniority, everyone moves forward. \nHe served here for a quarter of a century, but he never wanted to leave \nthat space back there because that was his place to inform the public \nabout how he felt about different issues.\n  Coming from the Presiding Officer's State, he was a man who didn't \nfit the mold necessarily of what a lot of people expected of a Senator, \nbut he was a giant killer politically. He defeated Orval Faubus after \nhe had been in a governorship in the State of Arkansas for many years--\na famous man; he beat him. Four years later, he beat William Fulbright, \na longtime Member of the U.S. Senate and one of the most prominent, \nfamous Senators in the history of the country. Then he started 24 years \nof service here in the Senate.\n  I have great admiration for Dale Bumpers. The speeches and eulogies \ngiven yesterday were remarkable. His son Brent spoke for a short period \nof time. Former Senator David Pryor spoke for quite a while and talked \nabout things they did together, the work they did on behalf of \nArkansas.\n  At the Pryor Center, they are doing a recorded history of how people \nfeel about Senator Bumpers. I had the ability to give my view. I said \nthat I did not know of a Senate delegation with more power than Bumpers \nand Pryor had for the State of Arkansas during my more than three \ndecades of service here in the Capitol. I have never seen two people \nwho had as much power and prestige for a State as Bumpers and Pryor \nhad.\n  I am very fortunate that Landra and I were able to attend that \nfuneral and listen to the eulogies given by Pryor and then, of course, \nby President Bill Clinton. It is too bad that the entire service \ncouldn't have been recorded because it was hilarious. He was an \nextremely funny man and a man who taught me a lot about the Senate. I \nhave missed him for a long time, and I will always remember him for a \nnumber of reasons, not the least of which was his ability to speak.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/senate-section/article/S5-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5-S6]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE PRESIDENT'S LEADERSHIP\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in less than 300 days, the American people \nwill head to the polls to elect the President of the United States. An \nelection year places the state of our Union under intense scrutiny. At \nthis time it is important to remember just how far we have come through \nthe leadership of President Barack Obama.\n\n  I can remember the first time I heard Barack Obama's name. I was in \nthe House gym, where I worked out for many years. Former Members have a \nlittle room in the back. Abner Mikva--long-time Congressman from \nIllinois, top lawyer for President Clinton, appellate court judge, and \nhas had quite a remarkable career himself--was there. While we were \ngetting dressed, he said to me: We have a Senate race in Illinois. And \nI asked: Well, whom are you supporting? He said: Barack Obama. I \nthought he was trying to be funny. Barack Obama? Come on. That is \nbasically what I said to him, but I was wrong and he was right. This \nman with the unusual name was elected President of the United States.\n  It is important to remember just how far we have come through his \nleadership. After 8 years of disaster under President Bush, the \nAmerican people embraced President Obama's message of hope and change. \nOn January 20, 2009, Barack Obama became the first African-American \nPresident in the history of our country. Instead of working with the \nPresident to repair our economy, strengthen the middle class, and help \nworking families, Republicans have chosen a path, for 7 years, of \nrelentless obstruction.\n  In fact, during the President's first term, the Republican leader \npublicly said: ``The single most important thing we want to achieve is \nfor President Obama to be a one-term President.'' As we look back over \n7 years of the Obama Presidency, one thing is clear: Republicans have \nfailed in their radical crusade against him. President Obama inherited \nthe worst recession since the Great Depression. He acted immediately to \naddress the economic crisis and begin rebuilding our economy. Because \nof President Obama, our economy has fought back from the brink of \ndestruction, which is what it really was.\n  Last month, record car sales were announced for the year 2015. How \ndid it come about? Because President Obama went against the Republicans \nevery step of the way by saving Chrysler and GM and giving Ford a great \nboost. The most significant car and truck sales in the history of our \ncountry occurred last year. Millions of Americans now have health care. \nThe President made sure he fulfilled his promise of getting Osama bin \nLaden, and he did. He was killed. The President has taken bold action \nto address our broken immigration system, doubled our country's \nproduction of renewable energy, and expanded access to higher education \nfor millions of Americans.\n  I have a lot of affection and admiration for President Obama and most \neveryone knows that. I have had the good fortune of working with him \nfor the past 9 years in the Senate and as President. His rescuing the \nNation from crisis, his bold legislative achievement, and his refusal \nto back down in the face of Republican obstruction have made him one of \nthe best Presidents of all time.\n  No State was hit harder by the recession and foreclosure crisis than \nNevada. President Obama provided the resources necessary to stabilize \nthe shattered housing markets, keep responsible borrowers in their \nhomes, and reduce foreclosures. Through the efforts he made, the \nPresident and his administration were able to provide about $200 \nmillion to Nevada's hardest hit homes, and there were lots of them. It \ndidn't take care of all the problems, but it certainly helped a great \ndeal. These were programs that provided unemployed and underemployed \nhomeowners financial assistance.\n  Nevada's unemployment rate reached almost 14 percent. Across the \ncountry, the rate of unemployment was about 10 percent. Today we have \nseen over 70 consecutive months of job growth, and our economy has \nadded more than 14 million private sector jobs during the Obama years. \nKeep in mind what was happening during the last months of the Bush \nadministration. During the first 2 months after the President was \nelected but not sworn into office, 800,000 jobs were lost 2 months in a \nrow. It is hard to comprehend that, but that is what happened.\n\n[[Page S6]]\n\n  Now we have seen the evidence of our Nation's job market continuing \nto bounce back. Last week alone almost 300,000 jobs were announced in \nthe preceding month of December. A recent report shows that businesses \nhave added 5.6 million jobs in the last 2 years alone, the most since \nthe end of the Clinton administration. This certainly wouldn't have \nbeen possible without President Obama's leadership.\n  Nevada's unemployment rate, which I have already mentioned, was the \nworst in the Nation. We had an ongoing struggle with the State of Rhode \nIsland for years as to which had the worst unemployment--Rhode Island \nor Nevada. Neither State wanted to win, but we both won on many \noccasions as to which had the highest unemployment rate. Thanks to \nPresident Obama's leadership, we are finally coming back in a very \nstrong way.\n  In December, the President signed a tax bill that includes one of the \nbiggest anti-poverty tools in a generation. It will help lift 16 \nmillion modest- and low-income working families out of poverty, \nincluding 8 million children. Renewable energy is taking off like never \nbefore as a result of that legislation. President Obama and Senate \nDemocrats have brought our economy back from the brink of destruction. \nI have already talked about the auto industry. We took on Wall Street \nto ensure that the greed and corruption which produced the great \nrecession would never happen again. Republicans said no at every turn, \nbut we succeeded in spite of their obstruction.\n  Health care. Before President Obama took office, tens of millions of \nAmericans were denied health insurance. Thanks to the hard work of \nPresident Obama and the Democrats in Congress, the Affordable Care Act \nhas banned insurance company discrimination, requiring coverage without \nregard to preexisting conditions or health status. That is just a \nlittle bit of what has been done. Since the law took effect, 17 million \nuninsured Americans have now gained insurance coverage. The success of \nObamaCare is undeniable and made health care available to millions, \nslowed the rate of health care cost growth, and it did not cause any of \nthe horrible problems that were talked about, prophesied, and that were \nsuggested would happen by Republicans. In effect, what they said was \nall wrong.\n  Immigration. Immigration was a problem before President Obama took \noffice, but he tried to do something about it, and of course \nRepublicans blocked that also. At the State of the Union Address 2 \nyears ago, he said: I worked with you. I have tried, I have pleaded, \nand I am tired of doing this. I will have to do things on my own now \nbecause you will not do it legislatively. And he has done that.\n  We failed to pass the DREAM Act in 2010. President Obama acted to \nprotect DREAMers, by announcing DACA, deferred action for childhood \narrivals. To date, almost 700,000 young individuals have been protected \nfrom deportation. Since then, Democrats led the charge for \ncomprehensive immigration reform to fix our Nation's broken immigration \nsystem.\n  The Senate passed bipartisan immigration reform in 2013, which was \nimportant, but we now have people, such as the junior Senator from \nFlorida, for example, who helped pass that legislation, but once he \nstarted running for national office decided that everything he did in \nbringing that bill to the Senate floor was wrong, and he has taken a \n360-degree turn and said: I did all of that, but I guess I was wrong. \nWe haven't been able to get it out of the House, and now we have people \nsuch as the junior Senator from Florida who is denigrating his own \nbill.\n  President Obama acted within his legal Executive authority to unite \nAmerican families and strengthen our immigration system, including \nprotecting some adults with children in the United States from \ndeportation. It is a longer story than that, but that is the short \nstory.\n  Energy and the environment. Climate change is one of the greatest, if \nnot the greatest threat, the world has ever known. Because of President \nObama's leadership, the world is on track to keep temperatures from \nrising and avoid the most catastrophic impact of climate change. By \nnegotiating the historic Paris climate agreement, the President has \ncrafted a version of clean energy and climate change for our country by \nestablishing carbon emission standards on vehicles that help consumers \nsave money on fuel for the first time by limiting carbon pollution from \npowerplants.\n  He established or expanded 19 national monuments. Why? Because \nRepublicans--bills we passed matter-of-factually here--always refused \nto allow us to have votes on them. So he moved forward, as he said he \nwould do, with an Executive action for 19 national monuments. In \nNevada, it includes the 750,000 acres of the Basin and Range National \nMonument, which is something that is great and all Americans can share. \nThe President believes these lands belong to all Americans and that our \nchildren and grandchildren should be able to enjoy the beauty and \nbounty of our country.\n  Education. When President Obama took office, our Nation's education \nsystem was in desperate need of reform. No Child Left Behind crippled \nschools around the country and graduation rates were at historic lows. \nOne of the most important actions President Obama took through the \nrecovery act was nearly $100 billion in aid for K-12 and higher \neducation.\n  Today students across the country have made tremendous progress. More \nstudents have graduated than ever before, particularly low-income and \nminority students. President Obama also took historic steps to address \nextreme levels of student debt in this country. By working with \nDemocrats, President Obama created new programs to help college \ngraduates manage their student debt by capping their loan payments by \n10 percent of their income. We wanted to do more, but obstruction \nraised its ugly head and Republicans refused to allow us to do even \nmore.\n  Guns. Mass murders have taken place all over, and Nevada is no \nexception. It has happened there also. From the time he was elected \nPresident, Republicans have tried every means possible by working arm \nin arm and hand in hand with the NRA to stop everything the President \nhas tried to accomplish. Even though more than 80 percent of the \nAmerican people said there should be background checks for people who \nare crazy and criminals, it is not good enough for Republicans. They \nhave still stopped us.\n  The President tried to work with Republicans and they have refused. \nThis has brought about his new efforts to use Executive action. Last \nweek he did just that. He addressed the epidemic of gun violence in \nthis country through legal Executive action. Republicans have blocked \nthis action, even in the wake of cold-blooded mass murders in schools, \nhouses of worship, movie theaters, and many other places.\n  Tomorrow the President will deliver his final State of the Union \nAddress to the American people. I look forward to hearing ways in which \nhe plans to continue and push our Nation forward during his last year \nin office. We will do everything in our power, as Democrats, to build \non the strong legacy President Obama has established. We will continue \nto fight to strengthen the middle class and working families by \naddressing the mountain of student debt that saddles Americans' higher \neducation. We will continue fighting to increase the minimum wage. We \nwill not rest until wages of women match the wages of their male \ncounterparts, and we will continue to keep Wall Street accountable by \nprioritizing Main Street and protecting the good work the Dodd-Frank \nlegislation did.\n  As we begin this legislative session, I hope we will find in our \nRepublicans a willing partner to protect and strengthen our Nation. I \nhope it is not wishful thinking, but it probably is. We stand ready to \nwork with our Republican colleagues to do what is right for the \nAmerican people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/senate-section/article/S6-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6-S7]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FEDERAL RESERVE TRANSPARENCY BILL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for years I have supported a responsible \naudit of the Federal Reserve System. The American people deserve an \naudit of one of the most vital parts of our government. In the wake of \nthe financial crisis that crippled our Nation's economy, I came to more \nfully understand how important it is that any audit respects the \nindependence of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve is crucial to \nour economy recovering after the disastrous debacle on Wall Street.\n\n[[Page S7]]\n\nThere were emergency provisions to address the catastrophes that only \nthe Federal Reserve could respond to. They did it faster than the \nCongress could do it. Had the Federal Reserve not stepped in, the \nconsequences of the great recession would have been tremendously worse. \nIt would have been worse than the Great Depression. This Federal \nReserve could act quickly to safeguard the national economy because of \nits independence, and it did just that.\n  One of the lessons we learned from the great recession is that the \nFederal Reserve should not be hamstrung. It is a cornerstone of our \nglobal economy. We must maintain a Federal Reserve that is transparent, \nbut we must also respect the independence of the Federal Reserve in \norder to maintain the well-being of the global economy, and that is why \nwe included an amendment to responsibly audit the Federal Reserve while \nrespecting its independence. The amendment passed unanimously. The bill \nwhich the Senate will vote on tomorrow, sponsored by the junior Senator \nfrom Kentucky, will critically undermine this delicate balance.\n  Wall Street reform ensured that the Government Accountability Office \ncould audit the Federal Reserve, and in accordance with the law, the \nGovernment Accountability Office has carried out those audits. In the \nyear after the passage of Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve was audited \n29 times. Since that time, the Federal Reserve has been audited 102 \ntimes.\n  My colleagues don't have to take my word for it. The 102 audits of \nthe Federal Reserve are available to everyone. All they have to do is \nlook at the Federal Reserve Website. Proponents of this bill know that. \nTheir calls for audits have been answered.\n  So let's be clear. This bill is not about auditing the Federal \nReserve. It is not about transparency or keeping the books for the Fed. \nThe oversight already exists. This bill is about giving tea party \nRepublicans and their billionaire donors the ability to control the \neconomy of the United States. It is an attack on policies that are \ndesigned to stabilize the U.S. economy and help the middle class bounce \nback.\n  Political parties should not and cannot run monetary policy at the \nFederal Reserve. That would be disastrous. I am disappointed the Senate \nwill waste its time on another misguided partisan attack such as this \none. The bill is an attack on the Federal Reserve mandate to create \nfull employment. These attacks are partisan in nature, and it is \nunconscionable to think that the Republican leader will begin this year \nattacking policies that benefit the middle class.\n  Some Republicans agree. Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee and a member of the Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs Committee, said this of the audit the Fed bill:\n\n       It's obvious to me that the Audit the Fed effort is to not \n     address auditing the Fed because the Fed is audited. . . . to \n     me it's an attempt to allow Congress to be able to put \n     pressure on Fed members relative to monetary policy. And I \n     would just advocate that that would not be a particularly \n     good idea and it would cause us to put off tough decisions \n     for the future, like we currently are doing with budgetary \n     matters.\n\n  I agree with Senator Corker. Injecting politics into the Federal \nReserve is a bad idea.\n  This bill is a sham. We should dispense with it quickly, and we \nshould do it--if there is any word quicker than quick, let's do it that \nway. I will vote against the bill, and I encourage my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  Will the Chair announce the business of the day?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/senate-section/article/S7-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tomorrow evening President Obama will come \nbefore Congress to deliver his annual State of the Union Address.\n  America has changed a great deal since President Obama delivered his \nfirst State of the Union Address 7 years ago. We remember he inherited \nan economy in free fall. There was a real danger that the United States \nwould face another Great Depression. Instead, we slid into a great \nrecession. The President--President Obama--did all he could to bring \nour economy back to life. Recent economic indicators show that his \nstrategy moved us in the right direction. More Americans are working. \nWe are seeing prosperity and opportunity return. There are still \nchallenges ahead. We still face income inequality, and there are many \nthings we must do to make this a fairer nation when it comes to our \neconomy, but we avoided a Great Depression because Americans are \nresilient and because our government, under the leadership of President \nObama, had the courage to take bold action to help put Americans back \nto work and to invest in America's future when the private sector would \nnot or could not.\n  Our Union--and our future--is undoubtedly stronger today than when \nthe President first took office, and I look forward to tomorrow evening \nwhen we hear this President's hopes and plans for his final year in \nservice to our Nation.\n  This afternoon I wish to take a few minutes to talk about another \nPresident and an earlier State of the Union Address. It was 75 years \nago, on January 6, 1941, when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt \ntraveled from the White House to Capitol Hill to deliver his annual \nmessage to the Nation. FDR had been reelected weeks earlier to an \nunprecedented third term as President. Despite historic reforms in \nprogress, America was still battling the Great Depression he had \ninherited.\n  Pearl Harbor was 11 months in the future. Understandably, many \nAmericans wanted to believe that the war that was consuming Europe and \nbeginning in the Pacific could remain their problem over there, but \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt sensed that would not be the case. He could \nsee America would inevitably be drawn into this conflict.\n  In addressing Congress, FDR proposed to make America the ``arsenal of \ndemocracy.'' He also urged Congress to create a new ``lend lease'' \nprogram, enabling our historic ally, Great Britain, and their allies to \nwithstand the assault of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial \nJapan.\n  He did something else. FDR knew that in order for the Nation to face \nWorld War II, America needed to know not just what they would be \nfighting against but what they would be fighting for. So in some of the \ndarkest days of World War II, with Adolf Hitler vowing to impose a new \norder on Europe at gunpoint, Franklin Roosevelt spoke of a moral order \nfounded on four essential human freedoms that would be the right of \nevery person everywhere. Those four freedoms he spoke of were the \nfreedom of speech, the freedom of worship, the freedom from want, and \nthe freedom from fear.\n  Norman Rockwell was an amazing American. He was a great illustrator. \nIt is interesting that he did so many cover drawings for great \nmagazines of his time, such as the Saturday Evening Post. When he heard \nFDR's ``Four Freedoms'' speech given to Congress, it inspired him to \ncreate images. Those images emerged after the original speech was \ngiven, and many people credit those images created by Norman Rockwell \nwith allowing Americans to visualize what each of the four freedoms \nmeant in very human terms.\n  I brought copies of them to the floor because they so graphically \nillustrate the message which FDR delivered in his ``Four Freedoms'' \nspeech.\n  The freedom of speech. This Norman Rockwell illustration shows a \nworking man standing and speaking his mind in a townhall meeting.\n  Freedom of worship. This photo shows a group of people from different \nbackgrounds, each praying to God--the God of his or her understanding.\n  Freedom from want. This classic illustration shows a family gathered \nfor a Thanksgiving feast.\n\n[[Page S8]]\n\n  The last of the four freedoms is the freedom from fear. This \nillustration shows a mother and father looking at their sleeping \nchildren tucked safely into bed.\n  In the coming struggle, President Roosevelt said, America would \ndefend itself not just with arms but also with ``the stamina and \ncourage which comes from unshakeable belief in the manner of life that \nwe are defending.'' That is exactly what they did.\n  During World War II, 16 million Americans--one out of every eight--\nput on a uniform and fought for the promise of the four freedoms. Tens \nof millions more Americans back home joined the fight by planting \nvictory gardens, recycling everything from bacon grease to tin cans, \nserving as ``soil soldiers'' in the Civilian Conservation Corps, and \nworking in war munitions factories as Rosie the Riveters.\n  After the war, the ``greatest generation,'' as Tom Brokaw \ncharacterized them, may have given up their uniforms, but they \ncontinued their fight for FDR's four freedoms. From the earliest days \nof the Roosevelt administration, Franklin and Eleanor had worked to \nrewrite the rules of America's economy to give average workers and \nfamilies a fighting chance against powerful corporations and entrenched \nwealthy special interests. They strengthened labor unions to improve \nworkers' pay, working conditions, safety in the workplace, health care, \nretirement--things we take for granted today.\n  After the war, the same Americans who had endured the hardships of \nthe Depression and who had saved the world from tyranny went to work \nand laid the foundation for the creation of the largest middle class \nand the strongest economy in the history of the world. They built new \nschools, new homes, new towns, an interstate highway system. At the \nsame time, more Americans began to challenge longstanding injustices \nbased on race, creed, gender, and other distinctions.\n  As the historian and author Harvey Kaye writes, under the leadership \nof Franklin Delano Roosevelt, America greatly ``expanded the `we' in \n`we the people.' ''\n  Under the leadership of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, Americans \nsaved our Nation's economy from ruin, saved the world from tyranny, and \nthey did all this while making America freer, more equal, and more \ndemocratic than it had ever been.\n  The promise of the four freedoms would inspire not only Americans, \nbut it inspired the world. The four freedoms became part of the \npreamble to the United Nations ``Universal Declaration of Human \nRights.'' That declaration, drafted by a committee chaired by the great \nstateswoman Eleanor Roosevelt, represents the first time in history \nthat nations around the world agreed to a list of human rights to be \nuniversally protected.\n  My wife Loretta and I are honored to include among our friends Anna \nEleanor Roosevelt, FDR and Eleanor's granddaughter. She lives in Maine \nnow, but she spent most of her life living in my home State of \nIllinois. Similar to her grandparents, Anna Eleanor Roosevelt is full \nof optimism, energy, and a fierce love for this Nation. She has done so \nmuch to advance her grandparents' efforts to make America freer and \nfairer. I want to say to my friend Anna, America remembers and honors \nyour grandparents' legacy. We are a better Nation because of what their \nleadership and sacrifice meant to us.\n  As we celebrate the 75th anniversary of FDR's ``Four Freedoms'' \nspeech, it is clear that we still have a lot of work to do to make the \npromise of the four freedoms real. Income inequality in America is \ngreater today than at any time since just before the Great Depression. \nThere are many reasons for America's growing economic inequality, \nincluding globalization and technology, but the biggest reason is \nnearly 40 years of deliberate political decisions to undo the progress \nof FDR's New Deal and concentrate more and more income and wealth in \nthe hands of the few. FDR was right when he said that ``economic laws \nare not made by nature [but] by human beings.''\n  I hope this year we can work together to pass laws that will increase \neconomic opportunity for all Americans, rebuild America's middle class, \nand free more Americans from the fear of want.\n  FDR said that we Americans believe in the four freedoms not just for \nourselves but for our families, for those who vote as we do or look \nlike we do, who live in our neighborhoods and attend our same houses of \nworship, but we believe in the four freedoms for everyone everywhere.\n  An America that believes in freedom of worship doesn't allow one \nreligious group to deny basic rights to others. Think about our \nConstitution, which each of us in the Senate is sworn to uphold and \ndefend. There are only three references in that great document to the \nissue of religion. The first is in the Bill of Rights to guarantee to \neach of us the right to believe as we wish or not to believe; second, \nthat our government will never establish a religion; and, third, that \nthere will never be a test for qualification for public office \ninvolving one's religious beliefs.\n  Making a religious test for public office or even a religious test \nfor immigration is inconsistent with those basic values--inconsistent \nwith those four freedoms. Yet even in this Presidential campaign today, \nwe hear candidates making that proposal.\n  Freedom of speech means allowing others to speak, too, not shouting \ndown those who think differently than we do. Democracy works better \nwith dialogue, not monologues.\n  Years ago when Loretta and I had our first baby, we faced some \nterrific medical challenges. Sadly, we had no health insurance. Let me \nstate that as a new father, I was never more frightened in my life. \nThanks to the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, 17 million Americans and \nmany millions of American parents are now free from that fear, and they \nknow that if this act is eliminated, as has been proposed by some \npoliticians, there is no alternative, there is no protection, and they \nwill face the kind of fear no family should ever face.\n  This year, instead of voting over and over to kill the Affordable \nCare Act, I am calling the other party to work to strengthen the law. \nThis law isn't perfect, but together we can make the Affordable Care \nAct work better for all American families.\n  Freedom fear also means that Americans shouldn't have to worry about \ngetting shot when they are playing in a park, sitting in a movie \ntheater, or attending a Bible study class. Even in an election year, we \nought to be able to find commonsense ways to protect Americans from the \nfear and reality of gun violence. We ought to be able to find a way to \nkeep guns out of the wrong hands without undermining basic Second \nAmendment rights. We owe it to America's families to try.\n  Seventy-five years ago President Roosevelt saw that America would \nsoon be drawn into war. While he didn't live long enough to see \nAmerica's ultimate victory in World War II, his promise of the four \nfreedoms helped achieve that victory.\n  As we know, the war ended officially with Japan's unconditional \nsurrender aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay. A member of Japan's \ndelegation who attended the surrender went to the ceremony fully \nexpecting to hear how the allies intended to take their vengeance on \nthe defeated Japanese people. Instead, he heard General MacArthur speak \nabout the future of freedom for Japan. Years later, he wrote that it \nwas at that ceremony that he understood that ``we weren't beaten on the \nbattlefield by the dint of superior arms; we were defeated in the \nspiritual conquest by virtue of a nobler idea.'' That idea--the \ninherent human dignity of every person--is the belief at the heart of \nthe four freedoms. Those freedoms remain as powerful a weapon for peace \nand progress today as they were 75 years ago. I hope we will remember \nthat this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/senate-section/article/S8-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8-S10]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the issue of gun \nviolence and to commend the President for announcing last week a set of \ncommonsense steps to make our country safer.\n  The need for action to reduce gun violence in America is urgent. \nAbout 32,000 Americans are killed by guns each year. Every day on \naverage 297 men, women, and children are shot, 89 of them fatally. Last \nyear, by one count, there were at least 372 mass shooting incidents \nwhere 4 or more people were shot--more than one a day in America. In \nthe city of Chicago\n\n[[Page S9]]\n\nalone last year, 2,939 people were injured by gunfire, and at least 88 \npeople have been shot so far this year, 2016. The 468 homicides in \nChicago last year sadly led the Nation--a number larger than the number \nof fatalities in the cities of New York or Los Angeles, which are much \nlarger cities. There is an epidemic of gun violence in America.\n  Can you imagine if 32,000 Americans were dying each year from Ebola \nor from tainted drugs or at the hands of terrorists? Lawmakers would \npull out all the stops to bring down those deaths. Compare the death \ntoll from gun violence to the death toll from terrorism in the United \nStates. According to the New America Foundation, since 9/11 a total of \n93 people have been killed by terrorist incidents in America--48 have \nbeen killed by rightwing extremists and 45 have been killed by Islamic \nterrorists. Americans are rightly concerned about the threat of ISIS \nterrorism, but we cannot ignore the threat posed by gun violence to the \ncitizens of our Nation.\n  Sadly, for years Members of Congress have just shrugged their \nshoulders as each day we hear another heartbreaking story of the \nvictims of gun violence. It is baffling to me that Congress refuses to \ndo anything about gun violence, especially since the American people \noverwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis agree on commonsense steps that we \nshould take.\n  For example, about 90 percent of Americans agree that a background \ncheck should be conducted before a gun is sold. Background checks \nthrough what is known as the FBI NICS system help ensure that the buyer \nis not a convicted felon, a domestic abuser, or a person with a history \nof serious mental instability or who is otherwise prohibited from \nbuying a gun.\n  Background checks work. Over 2 million gun sales have been denied to \nprohibited purchasers over the years. You think to yourself, why would \na convicted felon be so stupid as to go in and try to buy a gun when he \nfaces a background check? He does it anyway. They do it over and over, \nand 2 million times we have denied them weapons because they were \nprohibited by law because of their records.\n  There are still loopholes that would allow many sales to take place \nwithout this basic background check, especially at gun shows and over \nthe Internet. Think about how people made Christmas and holiday \npurchases this year. Many of us went to the Internet. That is exactly \nwhere people are going to buy firearms without background checks. When \nyou have loopholes like these, it is easy to understand how dangerous \npeople can get their hands on guns.\n  Look at the way these loopholes have affected the city of Chicago. \nThere is a flood of illegal guns coming into Chicago from Indiana, \nespecially from Lake County, IN, which is right across the border from \nmy State. Last Friday, the Chicago Tribune newspaper quoted Sheriff \nJohn Buncich of Lake County, IN, saying:\n\n       Individuals are skirting federal law, especially at these \n     gun shows, whether they want to admit it or not. There's a \n     lot of illegal gun sales.\n\n  The Tribune article went on to say:\n\n       Buncich stressed he supports Second Amendment rights and \n     doesn't want to take guns from people. He noted, however, \n     that hundreds of guns from Lake County show up in Chicago \n     crimes every year. ``We need to do something to stem the \n     violence,'' Buncich said. ``It's not going to hurt the law-\n     abiding citizen.''\n\n  Last year I met with the head of the Chicago Field Division of the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Federal agency \ncharged with enforcing our gun laws. He told me that in the highest \ncrime neighborhoods of Chicago, when they confiscated the crime guns \nafter the act, they found that as much as 40 percent of those crime \nguns were coming in from Indiana.\n  Here is an example of how it happens. In 2014 a man named David \nLewisbey of South Holland, IL, was sentenced for illegally trafficking \nhundreds of guns from Indiana to Chicago. The U.S. attorney's office \nsaid that over a 4-year period, Lewisbey ``routinely traveled to \nvarious gun shows in Indiana and purchased duffle bags full of guns \nthat he brought back to Chicago.'' Lewisbey used a forged signature to \nprocure an Indiana driver's license, and that was all he needed to fill \nup the trunk of his car with ammunition and guns and to drive that \nSkyway over into the State of Illinois and to sell those guns in \nChicago to kill innocent people.\n  During just one 48-hour period in 2012, Lewisbey bought 43 guns in \nIndiana and delivered them to a convicted felon on Chicago's South \nSide. Does anyone believe he had a Second Amendment right to buy 43 \nguns with an illegal ID and sell them to a convicted felon in Chicago? \nI hope not.\n  If everyone who sells guns for profit at Indiana gun shows had \nconducted background checks, it is highly unlikely that a trafficker \nlike this would be able to get away with this for years. The system \nwould have caught him. But because of the loopholes in the system, the \nweaknesses in the law, this individual was able to avoid detection and \nliterally supply hundreds of crime guns in Chicago. Of course we know \nwhat happened to those guns--they turned into tragedy and havoc in the \nneighborhoods around that great city.\n  I listened so many times when critics said: Well, look at Chicago, \nwhich has the toughest gun laws in the Nation, and look at all that gun \nviolence.\n  Here it is: in some parts of Chicago up to 40 percent of those crime \nguns are coming across the border with no background checks and sold in \nalleyways and dark corridors of our city. That isn't because of weak or \nineffective Illinois and Chicago laws; it is because of our inability \nto make the Federal law stronger.\n  Let's be clear. Background checks are not a heavy burden for law-\nabiding gun owners. At most, they would cause a short delay in buying a \ngun. But when we have gaping holes in the background check system, we \nare basically handing guns to criminals on a silver platter.\n  Sadly, this Congress has so far failed to even address this problem. \nWe weren't able to overcome a Republican filibuster of the Manchin-\nToomey legislation in 2013. We tried again last month and fell short \nagain.\n  The President decided to do what he can within his lawful authority \nto close gaps in the system. Last week the President put forth guidance \nthat makes clear that you can be engaged in the business of selling \nfirearms even if you aren't a storefront operation. For too long people \nwho sell guns for profit at gun shows or online have been able to avoid \nthe requirement to conduct background checks. They were claiming they \nwere just selling guns as a hobby. This man bought 43 guns at a gun \nshow as a hobby and sold them to convicted felons in Chicago. The \nPresident's guidance makes clear that if you are repetitively buying or \nselling guns for profit, you need to get a gun dealer license and do \nbackground checks or you are breaking the law.\n  Of course, the President's actions won't close the gun show and \nInternet loopholes altogether. That would take an act of Congress. But \nthe President has made a move in the right direction, and it will help.\n  The President took other important steps last week--clearly within \nhis constitutional authority--that will help save lives. He is working \nto make the background check system faster by adding more FBI examiners \nand improving the system's technology. A faster system could have \nstopped the Charleston church shooter who killed nine worshippers last \nyear in a horrific terrorist attack. This person was able to buy a gun \nunder another loophole in the law because the background check hadn't \nbeen finished in 3 days. The default position, if you haven't cleared a \nbackground check, is that the gun is sold to you. That meant that this \nman picked up the gun when the background check wasn't completed and \nwent out and caused this mayhem and took so many innocent lives.\n  The President is also strengthening the reporting requirements so law \nenforcement will know when guns are lost or stolen during shipment.\n  The administration is redoubling its efforts to improve mental health \nservices and to make sure the background check system has complete \nrecords on those found to be mentally unstable.\n  Finally, the President has sponsored research on gun safety \ntechnology. This is critical. Right now we have security features on \nour phones, computers, and cars to prevent thieves and unauthorized \npeople from using them. Similar technology is available today so that \nan unauthorized user will not\n\n[[Page S10]]\n\nbe able to fire a gun. That means a person can't steal a gun and resell \nit and a kid can't play with a gun and hurt himself or someone else.\n  For reasons that cannot be explained, the gun lobby opposes gun \nsafety technology, even calling for a boycott of any company that uses \nit. Now this administration is going to use its research dollars and \npurchasing power to promote safer gun technology. This could be a game \nchanger when it comes to preventing gun accidents and deterring illegal \ntrafficking.\n  I commend the President for the reasonable, commonsense steps he has \ntaken to combat the epidemic of gun violence. The steps he announced \nwill not prevent all gun deaths--no single measure can--but they will \nhelp.\n  I hope my colleagues in Congress will not take a step backward and \ntry to undermine these basic, commonsense reforms with riders or \nappropriations restrictions. I am going to fight hard against the gun \nlobby if they try. I hope Congress will instead move forward, finish \nthe job on background checks, and do all we can to reduce the high toll \nof gun violence in our communities.\n  Over the weekend, I was visiting with friends and former colleague \nMark Pryor of Arkansas. I went down to Stuttgart, AR. Anyone who is a \nduck hunter in the Midwest or in America knows the name of that town. \nStuttgart, AR, is probably the capital of duck hunting in the Midwest \nor in the United States. The local radio station there is KWAK, giving \nan idea of their commitment to duck season 60 days of the year when \nStuttgart comes to life with hunters from all over the United States \nand all over the world.\n  Saturday afternoon I went to the largest sporting goods store, Mac's, \nand watched hundreds of men and some women in camouflage clothes \ngetting ready to go out for the duck hunt. For them, it is not only a \nrite of passage, it is a way of life. They love it. You see the \ncamouflage on everything in sight.\n  Of course, when you go into Mac's, there are plenty of firearms for \nsale and other equipment that is needed so that you can hunt \neffectively and safely. You go in the store, and if you want to be a \nduck hunter in Arkansas, you first have to buy a license, which I did. \nThen you go through the ritual of making sure you have all the right \nequipment and getting ready to go out to hunt for ducks.\n  There is not a single thing proposed by President Obama that will in \nany way slow down or stop those men and women who want to legally use \ntheir firearms for that sport--nothing. What the President is trying to \ndo is to stop convicted felons and people who are so mentally unstable \nthat they shouldn't be able to buy a firearm from having that \nopportunity.\n  It turns out an overwhelming majority of firearm owners agree with \nthe President. You would never know it, would you, as you hear every \nsingle Republican Presidential candidate condemn President Obama's \nactions.\n  What a chasm there is in the culture between the people who are \nfirearm owners and who enjoy that opportunity and responsibility and \nthose who are on the political scene and ignore the fact that to \npreserve that right we should pass commonsense changes in the law to \nmake them even more effective and make certain that people who misuse \nfirearms do not have that opportunity.\n  I hope to work with my colleagues in the Senate and both political \nparties to achieve the goal of protecting the rights of those who use \nfirearms legally, safely, and responsibly within the confines of the \nlaw and to stop the illicit trafficking of guns that are taking over \n30,000 lives each and every year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst).

Madam President, after months of delay, last fall we \nfinally were able to see the text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, \ntext that corporate lobbyists had access to long before the American \npeople and Members of Congress and their staffs did. After examining \nthe provisions in this deal, it is clear that far too many of these \nprovisions sell out American workers and American jobs.\n  In the months leading up to the release of this deal, I warned that \ntoo often our trade agreements as far back as NAFTA and the Permanent \nNormal Trade Relations with China--not a trade agreement per se, but it \nhad the same effect in many ways--the Central American Free Trade \nAgreement, the South Korea Free Trade Agreement--these trade agreements \namounted to corporate handouts and worker sellouts. I warned our \nnegotiators that they needed to do more to ensure that the deal created \na truly level playing field for American workers and American \nbusinesses. Unfortunately, that is not what happened, particularly when \nit comes to standing up for the American auto industry.\n  We hear often about the supposed opportunities that trade agreements \nwill create: opportunities for more jobs, opportunities for small \nbusiness, opportunities for more exports, and for economic growth. But \nwhen I look at the Trans-Pacific Partnership, I don't see these \nactual--let's call them offensive opportunities--and by ``offensive \nopportunities'' I mean opportunities for American products to break \ninto new markets. This is not just playing defense, but playing offense \nso that we can export into these new markets.\n  Cheerleaders for this agreement--whether it is the Wall Street \nJournal editorial page, most Republicans in the Senate, or whether it \nis Republican leadership in the House, whether it is corporate CEOs or \nwhether it is the White House--say that new markets will be opened for \nAmerican cars, but we have heard these empty promises before.\n  Under TPP, many of these new markets will not be opened day one--as \nin the case of Malaysia and Vietnam. They won't be open in day two or \nyear one or year two. It will be more than a decade until American \nautomakers have full access to these closed markets.\n  The TPP will do nothing to level the playing field with our top \ncompetitor, Japan, or to change Japan's distinction as the most closed \nauto market in the world. We know it has been that in the past. We know \nit is that today. There is nothing in here that would change or open \nJapan's market, to sell into the Japanese auto market.\n  Carmakers in Ohio and carmakers across the country will compete with \nhuge numbers of Japanese imports. We don't have it today, and under TPP \nwe won't have the same opportunity to export to Japan. That is because \nfor decades Japan has used barriers other than tariffs to keep their \nmarkets closed. Tariffs are one way. They charge huge tariffs, causing \nthe price of the product that you import--let's say into Japan--to be \ntoo high for the Japanese to afford, but that is not what Japan does. \nTheir tariffs are already at zero, so an agreement on tariffs will do \nnothing to create a level playing field. Japan keeps our products out \nin much more creative ways than tariffs.\n  We have seen this in the wake of the Korean Free Trade Agreement. \nEven after our trading partners promised to remove these barriers to \nallow American cars into their market, they often don't. Opening up \nJapan's market didn't work in the 1980s, it didn't work in the 1990s, \nand it didn't seem that it will be any different under the Trans-\nPacific Partnership.\n  If there aren't new offensives--offensives in the sense of selling \ninto those countries--then I would expect our negotiations at least \nmake sure this trade agreement protected American carmakers and workers \nfrom a flood of cheap foreign competition. I would hope they made sure \nthe benefits of the agreement would only go toward its members who have \nbeen part of the negotiating process and made concessions, but it is \nnot. It is not just the TPP countries.\n  That is now how I read the text, particularly when it comes to \nsomething called the rules of origin for autos. These rules of origin \nprovide provisions to determine how much of a car is made in the TPP \nregion, and TPP rules are weaker than NAFTA's. That means how much of \nthe car is actually made in the TPP countries, how much of the car must \nbe made in the TPP countries to count as a TPP product.\n  That means 62.5 percent of a vehicle must be made in the NAFTA region \nin order for it to qualify for the benefits of the NAFTA agreement. But \nonly 45\n\n[[Page S11]]\n\npercent--much less than NAFTA and in some cases even less than that--of \na car has to be made in the TPP region to qualify for the benefits of \nthe agreement. Think about that. Under TPP, less than half a car has to \nbe made in TPP countries, which include Canada, Mexico, and the United \nStates, to receive the benefits of TPP.\n  So what does that mean? That means more than half of the components \nin the car--more than half of the car--can be made in China. So China \ncan backdoor much of its supply chain into the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership. Then these cars, mostly made in China, will get the \nbenefits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, even though they aren't in \nthe Trans-Pacific Partnership. As more countries join TPP, that 45-\npercent rule will become an even weaker standard, and fewer and fewer \nof our cars will come from the U.S. auto supply chain.\n  I never thought I would be able to say this, but this agreement makes \nNAFTA--an agreement I fought hard to defeat 20 years ago--look good. \nTPP's auto rules were written for Japanese automakers to the benefit of \nChina and at the expense of American auto jobs.\n  TPP will jeopardize the livelihoods of thousands of Americans, \nincluding up to 600,000 Ohioans, whose jobs depend on the U.S. auto \nsupply chain. These aren't just statistics. We are talking about real \nworkers in real plants in real companies in real communities, in Ohio \nand across the country, with bills to pay and families to feed.\n  They fought hard to bring the American auto industry back to life. \nTheir hard work made the auto rescue a success. Last year, 2015, was a \nrecord year for automakers. We can't pull the rug out from under them \nnow with a trade deal that sells out American auto jobs.\n  Think of what we have done. In 2010, only--maybe fewer than this--10 \nmillion vehicles were made in the United States. Today that number is \nclose to 17 million. Chrysler posted 7 percent gains in sales last \nyear. GM and Ford were not far behind with 5 percent. I am proud to say \nthe best-selling American vehicle for 34 years running, the Ford-150, \nruns on engines produced in Lima, OH. Five years ago the American \nPresident, President Obama, did the right thing when he personally \ncommitted to saving the American auto industry.\n  If you ask people in Ohio, in Toledo, in Avon Lake, in Cleveland, in \nWarren, in Lordstown, they know how important the auto rescue was. We \nwere losing hundreds of thousands of jobs a month at the beginning of \nPresident Obama's term. Since the auto rescue, the next year--we have \nseen job growth in this country for 70 months in a row, 70 consecutive \nmonths of job growth starting with the auto rescue.\n  Now I hope the President will do the right thing again and go back to \nthe drawing board on the aspects of this trade deal that we know will \ncost American auto jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this past Saturday, January 9, was Law \nEnforcement Appreciation Day, a day set aside to honor the men and \nwomen who work in law enforcement, keeping our communities safe and \nenforcing the rule of law, which underpins any free and just society. \nRecently we have heard a great deal about controversies and scrutiny \nsurrounding law enforcement in many parts of our country. It is easy to \nbe distracted by these stories, but it is important to remember that \nmany are inaccurate, and even the true ones are the exception, not the \nrule.\n  The rule is officers such as Little Rock Police Officer Shawn Bakr. \nOn Saturday, Officer Bakr spent his Law Enforcement Appreciation Day \nand his night off working as a security guard at a local restaurant. \nDuring his shift, three armed men entered a restaurant and pointed a \ngun at an employee in an attempted robbery. Officer Bakr's law \nenforcement instincts kicked in, and he reacted with calm dispatch. He \nconfronted the suspects, who subsequently shot him in the shoulder, yet \nhe bravely managed to return fire and injure one of the robbers. The \nother two suspects fled but have since been apprehended after a \nstandoff with Little Rock police earlier today.\n  The rule is also county sheriffs such as Johnson County Reserve \nDeputy Sonny Smith, who died in the line of duty last year after he was \nshot while responding to a burglary. Deputy Smith confronted danger \nhead-on to protect his fellow Arkansans, and he gave the full measure \nof devotion to duty that only those called to serve in the front lines \ncan fully understand.\n  The rule is also the large group of Deputy Smith's law enforcement \ncolleagues who stood to the right of the stage, just hours after his \ndeath--a place typically reserved for parents--and saluted during his \nson's high school graduation ceremony so he would feel the support and \nlove of the law enforcement community to which his dad belonged.\n  As a soldier in Iraq and Afghanistan, my soldiers and I knew what it \nmeant to face our enemy head-on, but at the end of our tours, we went \nhome. Many of us worked in much less dangerous jobs at military bases \naround the country until our next tour or we left the service.\n  For law enforcement officers, there is no end to the tour. They take \nrisks every single day, often for the lengths of their careers. Officer \nBakr's and Deputy Smith's actions are heroic by any definition, but to \nthem and to countless other law enforcement officers across the \ncountry, that is simply part of the job description. Each day that they \ngo to work, our law enforcement personnel around the country put \nthemselves in harm's way to keep us and our communities safe.\n  So to all of our law enforcement officers, the men and women who \nserve with the selfless dedication of Shawn Bakr and Sonny Smith, thank \nyou for your service and for your sacrifice. May God bless you and your \nfamilies and keep you safe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am here today with my colleague \nSenator Cotton to honor Dale Bumpers, a longtime advocate of Arkansas, \nwho passed away on January 1 at the age of 90 after a long life of \ndedicated public service.\n  He was a soldier and a statesman who came from the small town of \nCharleston, AR. He did things not because of political pressure but \nbecause he believed they were the right things to do. He had a good \nfoundation to understand the needs of Arkansans. He was a businessman, \ntaking over operations at his father's former hardware, furniture, and \nappliance store, and he was a rancher and an attorney in Charleston, \nserving, as his memoirs indicate, as ``the best lawyer in a one-lawyer \ntown.''\n  Following the Supreme Court's decision in the 1954 case Brown v. \nBoard of Education, which outlawed segregation in schools, he advised \ncompliance with the ruling, making it the first school district in the \nSouth to fully integrate.\n  He ran against incumbent Governor Winthrop Rockefeller to become the \n38th Governor of the State of Arkansas. Four years later, he defeated \nlongtime Senator William Fulbright in a primary before winning a seat \nin the Senate, a position he held for 24 years. He served as the \nchairman of the committee on small business from 1987 to 1994 and has a \nlong list of accomplishments.\n  While he ended his Senate service more than a decade before I started \nserving in this Chamber, my colleagues who served alongside him \nregularly recall their memories of Senator Bumpers, a legendary orator \nwho had a true gift for public speaking and who would tell stories in a \nway only a Southern gentleman with a keen sense of humor from smalltown \nArkansas could. He was passionate about his convictions and spoke from \nhis heart about matters that he believed in. In tributes to him on the \nfloor during the last days of the 105th Congress, his colleagues \ndescribed him as one of the most respected Members of this body. He was \na champion of the environment, a supporter of the National Institutes \nof Health, funding the fight against HIV and AIDS, and a constant \nproponent\n\n[[Page S12]]\n\nfor Arkansans. You could tell by all of the things that bear his name--\nthe White River National Wildlife Refuge, the Dale Bumpers National \nRice Research Center. His impact on Arkansas agriculture was recognized \nby the University of Arkansas board of trustees, who renamed the \ncollege of agriculture the ``Dale Bumpers College of Agriculture, Food \nand Life Sciences.'' These are just a few of the many things in \nArkansas that reflect his dedication and commitment to our State.\n  Senator Bumpers leaves behind a legacy of public service, civic \nresponsibility, and accomplishments that has undoubtedly made Arkansas \na better place to live.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, today I am proud to join my fellow \nSenator from Arkansas, John Boozman, in recognizing Senator Dale \nBumpers' service, as well as our majority leader and other Senators who \nare reminiscing about Senator Bumpers, who passed away earlier this \nmonth. Arkansas lost one of its most distinguished public servants when \nformer Senator and Governor Dale Bumpers died at the age of 90. As both \na Governor and Senator, Dale Bumpers' tireless dedication to our State \nbegan before I was born and spanned many decades.\n  As someone who grew up with Dale Bumpers already in the Senate and \nwho was unable to ever vote for him, I asked my mom Avis about her \nmemories of Senator Bumpers. Like so many, she was quick to remember \nthe oratory skills for which he was so famous--not only in Arkansas but \nalso in Washington and in the Senate, which has had its share of famous \norators over its history. But she also had fond memories of him on a \npersonal scale as well from the Mount Nebo Chicken Fry, an annual event \njust outside my hometown of Dardanelle. In the early 1970s, as a young \nGovernor, Senator Bumpers--then Governor Bumpers--always made it to our \nchicken fry. And if it weren't for a few obvious clues--such as a State \ntrooper or local photographers taking pictures--you wouldn't have even \nknown he was the top executive of our State, so humble and friendly was \nhe to all the fairgoers. He spent time with each person there and made \neveryone feel like they had his full attention--the full attention of \nour Governor.\n  It is an honor to stand here today in the same institution from which \nhe did so much great work for the State of Arkansas. Senator Bumpers \nwas an Arkansas institution himself, and his legacy has outlived his \ntenure in office. We are grateful for his service and commitment to \nArkansas. My thoughts and prayers are with the Bumpers family and with \nall Arkansans, whom he so faithfully served.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, western North Dakota is getting a lot of \nattention these days because of its vibrant energy economy. But people \nalso need to know about the spectacular landscape and natural beauty \nthat thrives side by side with energy development in my home State. So \nI want to speak today for a few minutes about a remarkable asset in my \nhome State of North Dakota that was highlighted this past weekend in \nthe New York Times.\n  The Times ranked Theodore Roosevelt National Park in western North \nDakota as fifth on its list of 52 worldwide destinations to visit in \n2016. Only Mexico City, Bordeaux in France, the Mediterranean island of \nMalta, and the Caribbean city of Coral Bay St. John in the U.S. Virgin \nIslands ranked ahead of Theodore Roosevelt National Park.\n  Tim Neville for the New York Times wrote of the park:\n\n       Few presidents have done as much for conservation as Teddy \n     Roosevelt. Fly into Dickinson in western North Dakota to \n     visit the park named after him, where rolling grasslands \n     dotted with bison collapse into the spectacular red, white \n     and gold badlands of tumbling mud coulees.\n\n  The more than 70,000-square-acre park consists of three parts: The \nsouth unit, which is the largest of the two units, the north unit, and \nthe site of Roosevelt's Elkhorn Ranch, which lies between the north and \nsouth units. The Little Missouri River meanders through all three \nsections of the park.\n  Roosevelt captured a colorful picture of life on the Elkhorn Ranch in \nhis 1885 book called ``Hunting Trips of a Ranchman.''\n\n       My home ranch-house stands on the river brink. From the \n     low, longer veranda, shaded by leafy cotton-woods, one looks \n     across sand bars and shallows to a strip of meadowland, \n     behind which rises a line of sheer cliffs and grassy \n     plateaus. This veranda is a pleasant place in the summer \n     evenings when a cool breeze stirs along the river and blows \n     in the faces of the tired men, who loll back in their \n     rocking-chairs (what true American does not enjoy a rocking-\n     chair?), book in hand--though they do not often read the \n     books, but rock gently to and fro, gazing sleepily out at the \n     weird-looking buttes opposite, until their sharp outlines \n     grow indistinct and purple in the after-glow of the sunset.\n\n  Theodore Roosevelt National Park has preserved what Roosevelt saw \nmore than a century ago. For that reason, it gets half a million \nvisitors a year, but more should come to see it, and I believe more \nwill as a result of the New York Times list. Speaking of New York, the \nTimes was the right venue to highlight Teddy Roosevelt's National Park \nbecause Teddy Roosevelt was a native son of New York, born in the heart \nof Manhattan at the dawn of the age of concrete canyons and bustling \ngrowth.\n  More than 135 years ago, he fled the hectic pace of New York for the \nsolitude of North Dakota's western Badlands on a hunting trip. During \nthat trip--his first to what was then called the Dakota Territory--he \nwas so taken with the land that he bought a ranch before he left for \nhome.\n  Within a year, back at home in New York, however, tragedy struck in a \ncruel way. Both Roosevelt's wife and his mother died in the same House \non the same day. He was crushed, but being a man of action, he sought \nto redirect his grief by throwing himself into a new adventure--cattle \nranching in North Dakota. He went west and built the Elkhorn Ranch on a \nplot of land that is now part of the Theodore Roosevelt National Park.\n  Roosevelt long acknowledged his debt to North Dakota. He said: ``I \nhave always said I would not have been President had it not been for my \nexperience in North Dakota. . . . It was here that the romance of my \nlife began.''\n  That romance is still alive and well in western North Dakota. I \ninvite travelers from around the world to visit us and see what the New \nYork Times described as a ``century of protecting America's \nmagnificence.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/senate-section/article/S12-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12-S13]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CONGRATULATING THE NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIVERSITY BISON FOOTBALL TEAM\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN.

I \ndon't know if the Presiding Officer is--I am sure she is a fan of the \nUniversity of Iowa and Iowa State and Northern Iowa. They are all great \nsports programs. I don't know which one is her favorite and may not \nwant to say, but we played Iowa State a few years ago. We play Northern \nIowa every year. We have a great rivalry with Northern Iowa. Northern \nIowa has a wonderful program--football and basketball. We enjoy playing \nthem every year. This year it looks like they have a very good \nbasketball team and are to be commended on beating North Carolina, the \nTar Heels. We will certainly\n\n[[Page S13]]\n\nwant to mention that to our colleagues. I am sure the Presiding Officer \nprobably already has. North Dakota State plays Iowa every year and \nplayed Iowa State a few years back and we are very much looking forward \nto playing the University of Iowa.\n  I wish to take a minute to speak about a resolution I will submit. I \nam going to talk about it now. The resolution is on behalf of the North \nDakota State University Bison, which won a historic fifth consecutive \nNCAA Division I FCS national football championship on Saturday. Led by \ncoach Chris Klieman, quarterback Carson Wentz, and a solid defensive \neffort, the Bison clinched the title 37 to 10 over a very talented team \nfrom Jacksonville State. The Gamecocks were truly great opponents. They \nplayed a fine game, and we congratulate them on a tremendous season as \nwell.\n  With Saturday's win, the Bison became the first football team in the \nmodern era of college football to win five consecutive championships--\nfive titles in a row. The championships aren't won in a single game but \nas a result of years of hard work. The Bison overcame injury and \nadversity to make it back to the title game, and we are tremendously \nproud of our team, our players, the program, and all of their \naccomplishments.\n  It was a thrill for my wife Mikey and me to join Bison Nation down in \nFrisco. The game was in Frisco, TX--a wonderful venue for the game. \nHaving a dedicated fan base helped make their stadium feel a lot like \none of our home games at the FARGODOME. It is an amazing experience.\n  The game started with a flyover of a B-52 bomber from the Minot North \nDakota Air Force Base. In addition to the thousands of dedicated NDSU \nfans, Thundar, the Bison mascot, and Corso, an actual bison--an \nunofficial mascot of the team--made the 1,000-mile trek down to Texas. \nThe Bison had a loyal crew cheering them on, and it helped make this \n``drive for five'' season very memorable.\n  Five championships in a row is unprecedented. I want to congratulate \nthe entire Bison community--NDSU's leaders, the coaches, the staff, and \nthese tremendous student athletes, as well as Bison Nation, a wonderful \nloyal following wherever the Bison team goes.\n  In recognition, I will submit the following resolution in their \nhonor:\n\n       Whereas the North Dakota State University (referred to in \n     this preamble as ``NDSU'') Bison won the 2015 National \n     Collegiate Athletic Association (referred to in this preamble \n     as the ``NCAA'') Division I Football Championship Subdivision \n     title game in Frisco, Texas, on January 9, 2016, in a \n     decisive victory over the Jacksonville State Gamecocks by a \n     score of 37 to 10;\n       Whereas NDSU has won 13 NCAA football championships;\n       Whereas NDSU has now won five consecutive NCAA Football \n     Championships since 2011, an extraordinary and record-setting \n     achievement in modern collegiate football history;\n       Whereas the NDSU Bison have displayed tremendous resilience \n     and skill over the past 5 seasons, with 71 wins to only 5 \n     losses, including a streak of 33 consecutive winning games;\n       Whereas thousands of Bison fans attended the championship \n     game, reflecting the tremendous spirit and dedication of \n     Bison Nation that has helped propel the success of the team; \n     and\n       Whereas the 2015 NCAA Division I Football Championship \n     Subdivision title was a victory not only for the NDSU \n     football team, but also for the entire State of North Dakota:\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the North Dakota State University Bison \n     football team as the 2015 champion of the National Collegiate \n     Athletic Association Division I Football Championship \n     Subdivision;\n       (2) commends the North Dakota State University players, \n     coaches, and staff for their hard work and dedication on a \n     historic season and for fostering a continuing tradition of \n     athletic and academic excellence; and\n       (3) recognizes the students, alumni, and the loyal fans who \n     supported the Bison in their quest to capture a fifth \n     consecutive Division I national championship trophy for North \n     Dakota State University.\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/senate-section/article/S13-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13-S14]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I understand that later today the House \nof Representatives will vote to pass a reform of the Freedom of \nInformation Act, which is often referred to by its acronym, FOIA. I \nwish to say a few words about that legislation.\n  I applaud the effort of the House. I have long believed that it is \nreally important to make sure that the people who actually pay the \nbills and whom we serve know what government is doing on their behalf. \nThus the name of the legislation signed by President Johnson many years \nago is the Freedom of Information Act. Too often here in Washington, \nDC, the people in charge of the information seem to view it as \nproprietary, as if it were theirs. In a political culture where \ninformation is power, they don't want to share that information with \nthe people who actually own it and are the ones who hold the elected \nofficials accountable. An open government is really one of the first \nprerequisites to a free society, and that is because an open and \naccessible government is absolutely necessary for Americans to hold \ntheir elected officials accountable.\n  Our Founding Fathers, of course, recognized that a truly democratic \nsystem depends on an informed citizenry, but Americans cannot do that \nwithout the information and transparency that these laws provide.\n  Former Justice William Brandeis famously said that ``sunlight is the \nbest disinfectant.'' I must say, as a person who is conservative, that \nI believe that rather than passing a bunch of new laws, one of the \nthings we can do to change the behavior here in Washington is to shine \na light on the actions of elected officials and the government. When \nelected officials know that the public is informed and watching, it \nchanges the way people behave, and it usually changes it for the \nbetter. Congress has passed numerous pieces of legislation that promote \nthis accountability and transparency of government since President \nJohnson signed the Freedom of Information Act into law so that good \nleadership and good governance can flourish.\n  During my time in the Senate and previously when I was the attorney \ngeneral of Texas, I made government transparency a priority. I pressed \nfor more openness in the Federal Government through commonsense \nlegislation. During the process, I found a partner in those efforts in \nthe Senate. He is somebody who is my ideological opposite, and that is \nSenator Pat Leahy of Vermont.\n  Senator Leahy and I both embrace the fact that most of the time \nelected officials and government officials want to trumpet their \nsuccesses and they want to hide their failures. But the American people \ndeserve to know the good, the bad, and the ugly, and to apply the \ncorrectives that are within their power, either in changing those \nofficials or holding those officials accountable.\n  So the legislation that is going to pass the House later today is \nsimilar to what we have already passed here in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee by voice vote in February. It requires Federal agencies to \noperate under a presumption of openness when considering the release of \ngovernment information under the Freedom of Information Act. Texas law, \nfor example, presumes that public information held by government is \npresumptively open. If there is some reason why it should not be \ndisclosed--let's say classified materials or whatever--then it is \nincumbent upon the agency to raise those concerns and then to have \nthose concerns decided in the process of administering those laws. But \nthe idea is also to reduce the overuse of exemptions to withhold \ninformation from the public. I hope this Chamber will soon join our \ncolleagues in the House to consider this important legislation.\n  There may be some things we need to do to fine-tune it. I certainly \nunderstand that on national security, for example, or things involving \nproprietary information--trademark protections and property \nprotections--there may be some areas where we have to make some slight \nchanges. But, essentially, this presumption of openness is important to \nthe functioning of our democratic form of government, and I look \nforward to our passing the law that\n\n[[Page S14]]\n\nwill be passed by the House Chamber later today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/senate-section/article/S14-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14-S15]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     GUN CONTROL AND MENTAL ILLNESS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the main reason I come to the floor \ntoday is to talk about the President's most recent Executive action, \nthis time implementing gun control measures that won't actually solve \nany of the problems they purport to fix and that purposely go around \nCongress and ignore the will of the American people. To my mind, this \nis one of the most aggravating things about Washington, DC, and about \nhow business is done here. People make symbolic acts claiming that we \nhave to ``do something'' but don't actually focus on a solution that \nactually helps make the problem better.\n  None of the President's proposals actually would reduce any of the \nhorrific incidents of gun violence we have seen, and that is a shame \nbecause there are bipartisan proposals that have been made that \nactually would help. But it is only when the President works with the \nCongress, as the Constitution requires, before a bill can become law. \nIn his eagerness to go it alone, of course, the President has forsaken \nthe constitutional process and bypassed the electorate in trying to \nmake new policy.\n  He presumably is doing this as a hallmark of his tenure, and it will \nsomehow be a legacy of his time as President. But the fact of the \nmatter is Executive action signed by this President will not survive \nhis own Presidency unless it is actually made into law, and then, of \ncourse, it would require another act of Congress to overcome it. That \nis something this President doesn't seem to recognize. When he gets \nfrustrated with the pace at which Congress takes up legislation--for \nexample, the immigration issue--he decides to unilaterally issue an \nExecutive action--which does what? Well, he offers Executive actions as \na solution to a problem. But, in fact, what it does is it buys a \nlawsuit and it gets caught up in litigation, which is going to take \nyears to resolve and ultimately doesn't provide any relief to the very \npeople the President claims to want to help.\n  So as a result of the President's impatience and his eagerness to go \nit alone, he is actually forsaking the constitutional process that \nbuilds consensus and actually creates durable policies that will \nsurvive this President's own administration.\n  This isn't just an isolated event, as I mentioned a moment ago. \nAccording to one media report, the Obama administration aims to push \nalmost 4,000 new regulations during his last year as President. But \nwith his announcement last week, President Obama made clear he has \nlittle interest in working with Congress. That is actually his job--to \nwork with Congress, to work with us to try to find consensus and to \nbuild durable solutions to the problems that confront our Nation. It \nalso demonstrates his lack of regard for fundamental constitutional \nrights as spelled out in the Constitution itself. Of course, I am \ntalking about the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  I found his rhetoric particularly perplexing. First, he blamed the \nCongress for inaction. He said: ``Congress still needs to act.'' Well, \nactually, if what he was doing was going to solve the problem, why \nwould Congress still need to act? So to me it is an admission that he \nknows that this is mere symbolism and it doesn't actually solve the \nproblem that he says exists.\n  So he said Congress still needs to act on gun control measures, and \nhe claimed that this legislative body--the Congress--is simply not \nbeing responsive to the will of the American people. He even said that \nhe feels compelled to act without consulting Congress because America \ndoesn't ``have a Congress that is in line with the majority of \nAmericans.''\n  In other words, the President said the people of this country are \ndemanding more symbolic gun control laws, not less.\n  But that is not what the polling shows, the best indicator of what \npeople are actually thinking--other than what the Presiding Officer \nhears from her constituents in Iowa and I hear from my constituents in \nTexas. Those are the best ways to know what people are thinking. In a \npoll done by the Wall Street Journal and NBC News this fall, more than \nhalf of the respondents said that the President's party's position on \ngun control was ``outside the mainstream.'' Only 38 percent said that \nit was ``within the mainstream.''\n  It is also critical to point out that, as many media reports have \nindicated, the President's measures would not have stopped any of the \nmass violence incidents that have tragically struck American \ncommunities over the last few years.\n  So my response to the President is this: If he is actually serious \nabout trying to solve problems rather than just issue symbolic \nproclamations, he needs to roll up his sleeves and he needs to work \nwith us to move legislation forward that focuses on the commonsense \nthread found in many of these mass incidents, and that has to do with \nthe mental health issue. This is the 800-pound gorilla in the room that \nthe President doesn't want to talk about.\n  The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Grassley, has \nmade it quite clear that this is the one issue where we could actually \nfind consensus and help provide assistance to families and communities \nto help people from becoming a danger to themselves as well as the \ncommunities in which they live.\n  We know from the facts of the cases that many times the mental health \nof the shooter has played a role in many of these tragedies, and it \nmust be addressed. Many Americans, of course, agree. I think, for \nexample, of Adam Lanza, who was the shooter at Sandy Hook in \nConnecticut. He was so mentally ill that he was a recluse in his own \nhome, and the only thing his mother found she could engage him in was \ngoing out to a shooting range. Yet he basically stole his mother's own \nweapons, killed her, and then tragically went to Sandy Hook Elementary \nSchool and killed a number of innocent children. If he and she had been \nable to get some additional help--gotten him to a doctor and gotten him \non medications that could have helped him from this increasing mental \nillness--then perhaps things would have turned out differently. That is \nspeculation on all our parts, but perhaps treating the mental illness \nwill actually reduce the likelihood that people will succumb to an \nimpulse to do harm to themselves and to their communities.\n  According to a poll released just last week, more than 70 percent of \nAmericans said they believe that better access to mental health \ntreatment and screening would reduce these incidents of violence. I am \npart of that 70 percent. I firmly believe that time and again we are \nconfronted with mental illness crises that go untreated and turn into \ntragic headlines. We can't responsibly stand by any longer and watch \nthis pattern repeat itself. That is why last year I introduced a piece \nof legislation that was my effort to try to begin this conversation and \nthis discussion here in the Senate.\n  There are other ideas. The chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee, Senator Alexander, and the ranking member, \nSenator Murray, are working on some mental health reform legislation. \nCongressman Tim Murphy in the House has worked on a comprehensive bill, \nand in the Senate Dr. Bill Cassidy is working on that legislation. My \nlegislation, hopefully, will help contribute to the conversation and \nhelp us build that consensus that is so important.\n  The legislation I have introduced would improve treatment and \npreventive screenings and crisis response for individuals with mental \nillness. It would also strengthen the existing background check system, \nsomething the President says he wants to do. However, the fact of the \nmatter is that many States, such as the State of Virginia in the case \nof the Virginia Tech shooter just a short time ago, don't even upload \nexisting mental health adjudications into the background check system, \nwhich would have precluded the purchase of a firearm by somebody with \nthat sort of record. So the National Instant Criminal Background Check \nSystem isn't even a comprehensive system when it comes to identifying \npeople who under current law should not be able to purchase a firearm.\n  This legislation I have offered is a step forward that will help \nthose with mental illness get the support they need while also \nequipping our Nation's\n\n[[Page S15]]\n\nlaw enforcement officers to help keep our communities safe. It has been \nendorsed by a diverse group of organizations, including the National \nAlliance on Mental Illness, the National Association of Police \nOrganizations, and the National Association of Social Workers.\n  I think the thing that has perhaps offended some of our Democratic \ncolleagues is that we have actually been able to build a consensus, \nwhere none other has existed on this topic, by getting organizations \nsuch as the ones I mentioned, along with the National Rifle \nAssociation, to endorse the legislation I have introduced.\n  The fact of the matter is this legislation was aided by solutions \nborrowed from what is happening in Texas and particularly Bexar County \nand San Antonio, where I once served as a district judge.\n  I firmly believe that the best way we can legislate here is to learn \nwhat works at the local and State level and then to scale them up here \nat the national level, rather than to do what the President seems to \nprefer, which is a national experiment and a one-size-fits-all approach \nin a country that is simply too diverse on issues that are so complex \nthat we can't really solve them with the wave of a magic wand or on a \nnational basis. So let's look at what works locally and in our States \nand then bring those experiences here and scale them up for the benefit \nof the rest of the country.\n  The fact of the matter is that Bexar County's and San Antonio's \nmental health program is now touted as the national standard for how to \nthink strategically about those suffering from mental illness in the \ncriminal justice system. Sheriff Pamerleau of Bexar County told me that \na substantial portion of the jail population in San Antonio is people \nsuffering from mental illness. Many times they go untreated and, thus, \nthey try to self-medicate with drugs or alcohol, just making their \ncondition that much worse. But the underlying cause of their problem is \nnever being treated, which is the underlying mental illness.\n  I have heard the same story in Houston and Austin and other places. I \nhave asked our law enforcement professionals--we simply are seeing more \nand more people with mental illnesses showing up in emergency rooms or \nliving homeless on the street or ending up in our jails without their \nproblems adequately being addressed. My legislation does try to take a \ncrack at that. It may not be perfect. I know other people will have \nother ideas, but at least it is a constructive suggestion and will \nhopefully begin a conversation that we need to have and the President \nsays he wants to have but so far has neglected to engage in.\n  Congress has a role to play because we represent the American people \nand we represent the States where we are elected to serve. It is our \nresponsibility to try to bring about successful reforms that we have \nseen work at the local and State levels. I am hopeful the Senate \nJudiciary Committee will hold a hearing soon. I understand we may well \nbegin by the end of this month, and it is not a minute too soon.\n  We need a President who is willing to get to work and do his job and \nnot just to make speeches or issue Executive orders and say: Well, \nlook, I have done my part, and the rest is up to everybody else. We \nneed a President who is willing to work with us and alongside of us to \ntackle these important issues and hopefully help protect the \nindividuals who are suffering from mental illness, to give families \nmore choices when dealing with a mentally ill loved one, and also \nhopefully to avoid these incidents of mass violence. What we don't need \nis purporting to govern by Executive edict, which is what the President \nseems to like and prefer.\n  I hope the President understands that Members on both sides of the \naisle in both Chambers are ready, willing, and able in good faith to \nwork to reform our mental health system and in doing so help prevent \nsome of the tragedies that are occurring in our communities. What we \ndon't need to do is to restrict the constitutional rights of law-\nabiding citizens, which will in no way make our communities safer but \nwill infringe upon those constitutional rights in the Bill of Rights of \nthe U.S. Constitution.\n  Many of the bills proposed, including mine, go much further than what \nthe President announced last week in dealing with mental illness. There \nis a lot of work that needs to be done, and we need a President who \nwill work with us. If he is willing to abandon this go-it-alone \nattitude and commit to working with the elected representatives of the \nAmerican people, I think we have the opportunity to accomplish a lot \nfor our country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, 8 months ago, as I delivered my maiden \nspeech in the Senate, I discussed how honored I am to have succeeded \nSenator Carl Levin, a mentor to me and a man who defined what it meant \nto be a Senator from Michigan--a feeling that has only deepened during \nthe past year that I have served in this body.\n  During his 36 years of service, Senator Levin personally met tens of \nthousands of Michiganders. He remains beloved by many, including those \nwho might never have had the opportunity to shake his hand or sit down \nnext to him. This is due in no small part to his tireless commitment \nand accessibility in responding to questions and comments from his \nconstituents, whether those issues arose in person, over the phone, in \na letter, or--during the latter half of Senator Levin's tenure--email. \nMichiganders reaching out to his office knew that they would be heard \nand that they could expect a thoughtful, honest response about their \nSenator's positions.\n  These responses--hundreds of thousands a year and millions over the \ncourse of Senator Levin's career--were made possible by his \ncorrespondence manager, Rick Carter. Rick worked for Senator Levin for \nalmost two decades, and I have had the privilege to have him on my team \nsince early last year.\n  While I have known him for only a year, this has been more than \nenough time to learn that Rick is a model public servant and a role \nmodel for generations of congressional staffers. Rick is humble, \nthoughtful, and fiercely committed to working behind the scenes to help \nother staff succeed and to grow. He has been instrumental in \nestablishing my Senate office, and I will be eternally grateful for \nthis honorary Michigander's efforts.\n  Rick grew up in DC. Perhaps his future career was foreshadowed by \ngrowing up in the Michigan Park neighborhood. He was a standout student \nat DeMatha Catholic High School and earned a scholarship at George \nWashington University, where he studied sociology.\n  During his time at GW, he interned for Congressman John Conyers, a \nlegend of the civil rights movement, current Dean of the House of \nRepresentatives, and a man I am honored to call my friend and a \nMichigan colleague.\n  Graduating from GW in 1995, Rick began what would be a 19-year career \nwith Senator Levin. He worked his way up from the front office and \nmastered a number of different positions before deciding that managing \nthe correspondence team best allowed him to balance engaging on matters \nof policy, serving the people of Michigan, and mentoring junior \nstaffers.\n  While Rick has many skills and qualities you might expect from a \nseasoned staffer, including being an excellent writer, editor, and \nconsummate professional, it is his extraordinary commitment to \ndeveloping young minds that I wish to focus on for a moment.\n  Rick has helped dozens and perhaps hundreds of young graduates, \nformer interns, and junior staffers find jobs in public service. Along \nwith refining writing skills and polishing resumes, Rick has taught a \ngeneration of staffers things they did not learn in college: how to be \na professional, how to show up on time, and how to simultaneously \nfunction independently as well as part of a team. His former interns \nare legislative directors, chiefs of staff, and chief counsels. The \nlist of favors he is owed is extensive, but he never asks for anything \nin return.\n\n[[Page S16]]\n\n  He might ask you to run with him, though. As a charity marathon \ncoach, he has helped raise money to fight AIDS. As a year-round \npositive influence--and not just during a New Year's resolution \nseason--he is always looking for current and past colleagues to run \nwith him. I will not even begin to speculate on the cumulative pounds \nlost due to his inspiration.\n  Rick has been a surrogate big brother and father figure for so many \nstaffers. It is especially meaningful that Rick has started his own \nfamily with his wife Nakia. Their son Mason and new baby Ryan are lucky \nto have such a loving, dedicated dad. I wish their entire family the \nbest as Rick starts his own small business to pursue real estate \ndevelopment in the DC area.\n  It is said that the only constant in life is change. While Rick \nCarter has been a constant in the Michigan delegation for more than two \ndecades and I will miss having him in my office, I deeply appreciate \nhis two decades of service and respect his desire to take on new \nchallenges. Rick Carter will always be a part of both Team Levin and \nTeam Peters.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

Madam President, I rise today to call on the Senate \nand all of my colleagues to allow us to move forward on the nomination \nof Sam Heins of Minnesota to be the U.S. Ambassador to Norway. The U.S. \nAmbassador for Sweden has also been held up. Coming from the State of \nIowa, which I believe is over 10 percent Scandinavian--over 300,000 \npeople--I think the Presiding Officer understands the importance of our \ncountry actually having Ambassadors to these incredibly important \nallies and nations.\n  It has now been 836 days since there was last a confirmed Ambassador \nto Norway, one of our most important European allies. Part of this \nsituation was caused by a different nominee who has some issues with \nthe committee and with other Senators. That person has now been \nreplaced, and it has been 166 days since a new nominee went through the \nForeign Relations Committee. Mr. Heins was approved by a voice vote, \nwithout any controversy, as was the Ambassador to Sweden. I thank \nSenators Corker and Cardin and Senators McConnell and Reid for their \nhelp in trying to get this through.\n  Unfortunately, these nominations are now being held up by Senator \nCruz. Based on my discussions with him, it is not because of the \nqualifications of these nominees; it is related to, I suppose, other \nissues. Yet, I note for those Scandinavians out there, Senator Cruz has \nallowed votes on Ambassadors to other countries. We have Ambassadors in \nFrance, in England, in nearly every European nation, but not these two \nScandinavian countries.\n  Perhaps people don't understand the importance of these nations \nbecause they just think these people wear sweaters all the time. I \ndon't know what they think of Norway and Sweden, but, in fact, Senator \nCruz should understand that they are two of our best allies. Norway is \none of our country's strongest and most dependable allies. I will speak \nmore about Sweden at another time.\n  I plan to take to the floor repeatedly in the next month to talk \nabout the importance of these allies and to ask Senator Cruz what he \ndoes not understand, that these are important allies.\n  Norway was a founding member of the NATO Alliance, and its military \nhas participated in operations with the United States in the Balkans \nand Afghanistan. Norwegians work alongside Americans in standing up to \nRussia's provocations in Ukraine, in countering ISIS and the spread of \nviolent extremism, and in strengthening regional cooperation in the \nArctic. Norway has been especially strong on the issue of the Ukraine \nand on the issue with Russia. I know the Presiding Officer, with her \nbackground in the military, understands how important that is, and \ncertainly my colleagues across the aisle understand how important it is \nto have allies that will stand up to Russia.\n  In addition, Norway is an important economic partner. In a letter \nsent this July by the American Chamber of Commerce in Norway, Norway \n``represented the 5th fastest growing source of foreign direct \ninvestment in the United States between 2009-2013 and is the 12th \nlargest source of foreign direct investment in the United States \noverall.'' Right now, the United States of America for over 700 days \nhas said to one of the top investors in our country, one of our best \nallies in security, ``Sorry. You don't rate getting an ambassador.''\n  There are also over 300 American companies with a presence in Norway, \nincluding 3M of Minnesota, Eli Lilly, General Electric, IBM, \nMcDonald's, and so many others.\n  In October Norway reiterated its commitment to Lockheed Martin with \nthe purchase of an additional 22 F-35s. These Lockheed Martin warplanes \nwill be built at a facility in Fort Worth, TX. I have called this to \nSenator Cruz's attention. In fact, this is an enormous purchase, the \nbiggest purchase made in the history of the country of Norway.\n  These companies, however, are hindered without a strong ambassador to \nhelp facilitate and strengthen economic ties between our two countries.\n  Norway is also playing an important role in addressing the Syrian \nrefugee crisis. Norway has a proud history of providing support to \nthose fleeing conflict. It expects to take in as many as 25,000 \nrefugees this year and has already provided millions of dollars to \nGreece to help that country respond to the influx of refugees seeking a \nway to enter Europe. Norway is basically on the frontline of the \nrefugee crisis.\n  All of us on both sides of the aisle have talked about the importance \nof a strong Europe during this very difficult time. Yet, right now we \nhave no Ambassadors in two of the countries on the frontline involved \nin these refugee crises, and those are Sweden and Norway.\n  Norway deserves a U.S. Ambassador who understands the country and is \ndeeply committed to the relationship. I believe Mr. Heins is the right \nperson for the job. No one has seriously questioned his qualifications \nfor the job.\n  As a Senator from the State that is home to more people--more than \n800,000--of Norwegian heritage than anywhere except Norway itself, I \nthink it is only fitting that the nominee to be the U.S. Ambassador to \nNorway hail from Minnesota.\n  Of course, there is much more to Sam Heins than his Minnesota \nheritage. In addition to being an accomplished lawyer, he has \ndemonstrated his devotion to and leadership in the cause of advancing \nhuman rights. He founded, organized, and served as the first board \nchair for the Minnesota Advocates for Human Rights, which monitors and \nresponds to human rights abuses throughout the world. He also cofounded \nthe Center for Victims of Torture, which provides services, research, \nand advocacy for victims of torture around the world, and continues to \nserve as a board member. This record of accomplishment is particularly \nappropriate for someone nominated to be our Ambassador to Norway. \nNorway has long been an international leader on human rights issues. \nMr. Heins' extensive work on human rights and with nongovernmental \norganizations that support human rights will be extremely helpful in \nsustaining and building on the strong U.S.-Norweigian partnership in \nthis area.\n  Last year, as we know, Congress was able to find common ground on so \nmany issues. We passed a budget bill, we passed a transportation bill, \na historic amount of funding, an increase in funding. We got the bill \ndone on sex trafficking that Senator Cornyn and I worked on so hard. I \ncan go through a list of the work we did together across the aisle.\n  When it comes to foreign relations, our country has always believed \nthat a united front is most important on the world stage. We have a \nunited front when it comes to the countries of Norway and Sweden. We \nunderstand they are our true allies. We have a united front on these \ntwo Ambassador nominees. They were noncontroversial. They went through \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. Senator Corker and Senator Cardin have \nworked together to make sure they get to the floor, but\n\n[[Page S17]]\n\nright now Senator Cruz is holding up these nominees for reasons that \nare completely outside of the qualifications of the nominees. I can say \nthis is not the way we should be conducting world business.\n  I am focusing today on Norway. I will focus on Sweden in the future \nas I continue to give these speeches. I don't think we can take these \ncountries lightly just because it is cold there and darker in the \nwinter. These are incredibly important allies and trading partners. \nThey deserve to be treated like other European nations. They deserve to \nhave an ambassador from the United States of America.\n  It is time to end this delay and do the work the Senate is supposed \nto do. Let's move ahead and work to confirm these qualified nominees to \nrepresent us abroad. One is a country in Europe that just bought 22 \nfighter planes from Lockheed Martin. If they had bought 22 fighter \nplanes from the Presiding Officer's State, I believe the Presiding \nOfficer would have looked at the fact that if it is a noncontroversial \nnominee to a country that invests in the United States of America, that \nis an ambassador we need to get confirmed, and we would get this done.\n  I ask my colleagues to work with Senator Cruz. The hope is that given \nthat we have seen no other opposition of any significance to these two \nnominees, we will be able to get this done. He has said to me \npersonally that this is not about the qualifications of the nominees, \nit is simply other issues that I hope he can resolve within the \nRepublican caucus and with us so we can move forward and so they are \nnot held up any longer. Norway and Sweden deserve Ambassadors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/senate-section/article/S17-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17-S21]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Boozman). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Luis \nFelipe Restrepo, of Pennsylvania, to be United States Circuit Judge for \nthe Third Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the upcoming \nconfirmation vote of Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo to serve on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\n  I wish to thank Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy for moving \nJudge Restrepo's nomination through their committee.\n  I also thank Leader McConnell for scheduling this confirmation vote, \nwhich will take place in short order.\n  I also wish to thank my colleague Senator Casey. Senator Casey and I \nhave been working very closely for 5 years now, since I joined the \nSenate, working to fill the vacancies that occur on the Federal bench \nacross the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that we represent. With Judge \nRestrepo's confirmation tonight, which I am hopeful and confident will \noccur, Senator Casey and I will have been able to play a role in \nfilling 16 vacancies on the Federal bench, including 14 district court \nvacancies that have occurred since the time I arrived in Senate and two \nThird Circuit court vacancies. There are only two States in the Union \nthat have had more vacancies filled in the last 5 years, and those two \nStates are California and New York. They are very large States, of \ncourse, and have a large number of vacancies.\n  Again, I thank Senator Casey for the very constructive working \nrelationship we have developed to make sure that the people of \nPennsylvania are able to access justice in a sensible and efficient \nfashion. Because we have worked closely together, not only have we \nfilled these vacancies, but we have filled courthouses--Federal \ncourthouses meant to house Federal judges--that have been vacant for \nyears. As a result, Reading, PA, now has a Federal judge serving in \nthat courthouse. People in the surrounding area of Williamsport, PA, \nhad to drive great distances to get to a Federal court, and now there \nis a judge serving in Williamsport. Easton, PA--likewise, the people in \nNorth Hampton County who had to drive all the way to Philadelphia to \nhave a case dealt with can now do that in Easton. I think, and I hope, \nwe are close to filling an empty courthouse in Erie, PA. Erie is kind \nof by itself out there in the northwest corner of our great State, and \nthere ought to be Federal judge in the Erie courthouse. We are well in \nthe process of making sure that there will be, and I am sure it will \ncome to a close soon.\n  Back to Judge Restrepo. The fact is Judge Restrepo is very well \nqualified to serve on the Third Circuit. He has served as a Federal \ndistrict court judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania since \nJune of 2013. I was very pleased, along with Senator Casey, to have \nrecommended Judge Restrepo to the White House for that post and to have \nsupported his confirmation to the district court.\n  In 2013, Judge Restrepo was confirmed unanimously on the Senate \nfloor. I would love to see that occur again this evening with respect \nto his confirmation to the circuit court. Prior to his appointment as a \ndistrict court judge, Judge Restrepo served for 7 years as a Federal \nmagistrate judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and for 13 \nyears prior to that, Judge Restrepo was a partner in the law firm of \nKrasner and Restrepo, handling criminal defense cases. Before that, he \nworked at the public defenders' office at the Federal and State levels.\n  In many ways, Judge Restrepo's life story is a classic American dream \nstory. He was born in Medellin, Colombia, and became a U.S. citizen in \n1993. He has devoted a great deal of his time and energy and \nconsiderable intellect to serving his community. He served on the board \nof the Make-a-Wish Foundation for Philadelphia and Susquehanna Valley. \nThis is a foundation that grants wishes to children who have life-\nthreatening illnesses. Judge Restrepo also gave his time to the Russell \nByers Charter School in Philadelphia.\n  I am very confident that Judge Restrepo has the judicial experience, \nlegal acumen, intellect, integrity, and dedication to public service to \ndo the job that we expect him to do on the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals. The Senate Judiciary Committee apparently shares my \nconfidence, having passed his nomination out of committee with a voice \nvote.\n  I am pleased to speak on behalf of this highly qualified nominee, and \nI urge all of my colleagues to support his confirmation.\n\n\n                   Tribute to Officer Jesse Hartnett\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to briefly address one other item this evening \nbefore I yield the floor. I want to speak about the appalling shooting \nthat occurred in Philadelphia just last Thursday evening when a shooter \nattempted to assassinate a police officer in the name of ISIS on the \nstreets of Philadelphia. The shooter wasn't counting on the amazing \nbravery of Philadelphia Police Officer Jesse Hartnett.\n  It was late, about 11:30 at night on Thursday, and apparently a man \nwaved down Jesse Hartnett as he was driving along in his police \ncruiser. Officer Hartnett stopped the cruiser. The man walked over as \nif to ask for directions, and instead, out of the blue, he started \nfiring shots at pointblank range into the driver's side window at \nOfficer Hartnett. He kept walking up to the car. As he walked, he kept \nshooting. At one point he actually had his arm, with the gun, inside \nthe window of the car and was still shooting. In total, the shooter \nfired 13 shots.\n  Cameras that happened to be in that area captured the incident. It is \nabsolutely amazing that Officer Hartnett managed to survive. It is \namazing. But he didn't just survive. He jumped out of his patrol car. \nHe had been hit three times and was very seriously injured. His arm was \nbleeding profusely. He got out of his car and chased down the shooter. \nHe shot and wounded the would-be killer, and because of his heroic \naction while literally under fire, the shooter was apprehended.\n  This is an amazing example of true grit, and the people of \nPennsylvania couldn't be more proud of Officer Hartnett. Our prayers \nare certainly with Officer Hartnett and his family. He has a very \ndifficult recovery ahead of him. He has already had one surgery. My \nunderstanding is that he has undergone a second surgery today, or is in \nthe process of undergoing that surgery. The\n\n[[Page S18]]\n\ndoctors are trying to save his arm, which was badly injured.\n  I want to be clear about this. What happened that Thursday night was \nan act of terrorism. It was an act of terrorism inspired by violent \nIslamic extremism. The shooter reportedly declared that he had pledged \nhis allegiance to the Islamic State. He said that he was targeting \npolice officers because he believes that the police are defending and \nenforcing laws that are contrary to the Koran, and the shooter himself \nsaid that he acted in the name of Islam and the Islamic State.\n  We don't know for sure yet whether the shooter has direct personal \nties to ISIS abroad, but the FBI has reported that the shooter traveled \nto Saudi Arabia in 2011 and then went to Egypt for several months in \n2012. Regardless of what he was doing over there or what his purpose \nwas, we should make no mistake; this was an act of terrorism just as \nthe shootings at Fort Hood and San Bernardino were.\n  Let me be abundantly clear. I think everyone obviously knows that \nthis cop killer--this would-be cop killer--doesn't represent all \nMuslims. No one would suggest that, but he does represent a terrible \nstrain of violent Islamic extremism, a strain that has amassed millions \nof dollars, has followers all around the planet, and is, in fact, at \nwar with America.\n  ISIS and the violent Islamic extremists that are followers of ISIS \npose a very serious threat to America. We have seen this repeatedly \nnow, including in my home State of Pennsylvania in the City of \nPhiladelphia. We are very fortunate. We have incredibly courageous law \nenforcement officers, such as Officer Hartnett, protecting us, but we \nshouldn't in any way diminish the magnitude and gravity of this threat.\n  I commend Officer Jesse Hartnett for his bravery. To Officer Hartnett \nand his family, please know that the people of Pennsylvania are behind \nyou, thinking of you, and praying for a full and speedy recovery.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to offer some remarks about the vote \nwe are going to cast on Judge Restrepo, which Senator Toomey spoke to \nearlier, and I thank him for his work on this nomination.\n  We are finally at the point where we are voting, and we are grateful \nfor that opportunity. Senator Toomey has noted and I know others are \naware of Judge Restrepo's qualifications. I will highlight a few, some \nof it by way of reiteration.\n  I will start with the story itself. This is a great American story. \nAn individual came to this country from Colombia and, through hard work \nand the benefit of a great education, has risen to the point of being a \nmember of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania. Upon a positive confirmation vote, he will be a member of \nthe Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the second highest Federal \ncourt in the land, just below the Supreme Court.\n  Judge Restrepo is a 1986 graduate of Tulane University Law School. He \ngraduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1981 with a degree in \neconomics and international relations. As I said, he has served as a \nmember of the U.S. district court in Philadelphia, which pretty much \ncovers the eastern half of our State. We have a Middle District and a \nWestern District. He is a judge in one of the three districts. He \nstarted there in June of 2013, so his nomination to the appeals court \nwas a rapid rise in the Federal judiciary. Before being on the district \ncourt, he served as a U.S. magistrate judge from June of 2006 until his \nappointment to the U.S. district court.\n  I believe all of the other information is already in the Record, but \nI want to reiterate what I said before and what I know Senator Toomey \nhas said. This nominee is qualified by way of experience, intellect, \nand education, but maybe the most important thing is by way of \nintegrity. He is someone who has the character to serve on the \nappellate court after serving with distinction on the U.S. district \ncourt.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, today I wish to support the nomination of \nJudge Luis F. Restrepo, the President's nominee for appointment on the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\n  Filling a vacancy on the third circuit is important to New Jerseyans. \nBecause only a handful of cases each year reach the Supreme Court, \ncircuit courts often have the final word in the vast majority of \nFederal cases. That means, for most of my constituents who bring cases \nin Federal courts, the buck stops with the third circuit.\n  The third circuit currently has two judicial vacancies. The vacant \nseat that President nominated Judge Restrepo to fill has been declared \na judicial emergency. That means it has a very heavy caseload. In fact \nthe third circuit has more than 900 weighted filings per judgeship. \nFilling a vacancy on that important Federal appellate court will lower \nthe caseload burden and ensure access to justice for more Americans.\n  Judge Restrepo is a well-qualified individual. There is no question \nabout that. He has over 10 years of experience on the Federal bench. In \nfact the Senate unanimously confirmed him to serve as a Federal \ndistrict judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Prior to that, \nhe served as a Federal magistrate judge. As a member of the Federal \nbench, he has presided over 56 trials that have gone to verdict or \njudgement.\n  He has a wealth of experience in both public service and private \npractice. He was a founding member of a Philadelphia law firm, where he \npracticed both criminal defense and civil rights litigation. He served \nas an assistant Federal defender with the Community Federal Defender \nfor the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and an assistant defender for \nthe Defender Association of Philadelphia. He has relevant experience in \nboth criminal and civil law, which will serve him well as a Federal \nappellate judge.\n  Judge Restrepo has excellent legal credentials. He earned his \nundergraduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania and his law \ndegree from Tulane University Law School.\n  The work of a Federal appellate judge can often be academic as the \njob requires a judge to address legal issues of first impression. Judge \nRestrepo has more than two decades of teaching experience at both the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania Law School and Temple University James E. \nBeasley School of Law. He also taught with the National Institute for \nTrial Advocacy. In addition, he has written numerous articles appearing \nin a variety of national legal publications.\n  He has dedicated his time to public service and to bettering his \ncommunity. He is the former president of the Hispanic Bar Association \nof Pennsylvania. He served on the board of directors for the Defender \nAssociation of Philadelphia and the Make-A-Wish Foundation of \nPhiladelphia and Susquehanna Valley. As a Federal judge, he has also \nparticipated in a reentry program to assist people recently released \nfrom federal custody to reenter the community and become productive \ncitizens.\n  I believe he has a wealth of relevant experience and a strong legal \nbackground. Other Senators share my confidence in Judge Restrepo. He \nhas the bipartisan support from both Pennsylvania Senators and was \nvoted out of the Judiciary Committee by a unanimous voice vote.\n  Judge Restrepo's confirmation is also historic. He will be the first \nLatino judge from Pennsylvania to serve on the third circuit and only \nthe second Latino to sit on that court. He also has the strong \nendorsement of the Hispanic National Bar Association. According to that \ndistinguished organization, Judge Restrepo's ``integrity, knowledge of \nthe law, breadth of professional experience, and intellectual capacity \nmake him well suited to sit as a federal appellate judge.'' I could not \nagree more.\n  I urge my colleagues to confirm Judge Restrepo to the third circuit \ntoday.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \nrecognized as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that I be \nable\n\n[[Page S19]]\n\nto display on the Senate floor these two vials of liquid nicotine to \ntell what just passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Liquid Nicotine\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, in the Senate last year we passed the \nchildproofing of caps on liquid nicotine. That legislation just passed \ntoday in the House and will go to the President for signature. This is \nimportant because we found that these bottles of liquid nicotine for \nthese e-cigarettes, or electronic cigarettes, have not been \nchildproofed. Therefore, if a child gets one of these bottles and it \ndoes not have the cap that they can't get off, we now know the \nexperience from several poison centers across the country in the last \ncouple of years. If a drop of that liquid nicotine gets onto the \nchild's skin or, as infants typically do, they put things in their \nmouth and they ingest that liquid nicotine, indeed it is fatal.\n  We have had a couple of fatalities in this country. Therefore, it was \ncommon sense for us to require--and thankfully, the liquid nicotine \nindustry went along and did not object--to make these childproof. But \nthat will now be in the law. Let me point out something. This is aside \nfrom the question of whether you should be inhaling this stuff in an e-\ncigarette. I think people are finding out that this is becoming quite \ndangerous as well. But aside from that issue, this was the issue of \nprotecting children.\n  Look at this. It has pictures of fruit all over the label, and it is \ncalled ``Juicy ejuice.'' It is something that is going to attract an \ninfant's or a child's attention. It is the same thing over here. It has \npictures of all kinds of happy things. I have seen others that have \nlabels of juicy fruit. I have seen others that have multicolored labels \nthat are very attractive. Common sense tells us if you are putting a \nproduct out that can kill children--just like some of the soaps that \nare put out for washing detergent in these little plastic bags that \ndisintegrate when they get into water in your dishwasher or in your \nwashing machine, and it smells so good, and they are grape scents--a \nchild smells that and it feels so good and it is so soft. Where is it \ngoing to end up in an infant? They are going to put it in their mouth. \nWe have had some deaths there. But that is another battle for another \nday. At least we have won one little battle.\n  I am happy to report to the Senate that what we passed in the Senate \nin a bipartisan manner last year now passed the House today and will go \nto the President to be signed into law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Trans-Pacific Partnership\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I came from an informal hearing--not an \nofficial Senate hearing but a hearing downstairs called by Congressman \nLevin, who is the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. A \nnumber of other Members were there, including my colleague from Ohio, \nRepresentative Kaptur, and a number of people the Presiding Officer \nserved with in the House--Congressmen Sarbanes, Rangel, Pascrell, \nDoggett, and Schiff. We discussed the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  I spoke earlier on this today. I know Senator McConnell has said that \nhe will not bring it up this year, I think in large part because of the \nopposition from the country. Senator Lott, the Republican leader, a \ndecade or so ago said that you can't pass a trade agreement in an even-\nnumbered year. He was a strong supporter of these trade agreements. I \nbelieve he and most in his party supported NAFTA and CAFTA. He wasn't \nhere for CAFTA but he was for some of those other trade agreements. But \nhe said that because he knows that politicians want to vote for these \ntrade agreements in large part because of corporate lobbying. But the \npublic doesn't want us to vote for these trade agreements.\n  My first year in Congress, I spent much of the year working in \nopposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement. I have seen a \nnumber of these: NAFTA, PNTR with China, CAFTA, the trade agreement \nwith Korea, big promises about jobs, big claims about jobs, and \nexaggerated commitments about jobs. Every time we lose jobs from these \ntrade agreements. Our trade deficit is up to a couple billion dollars a \nday now. But if you buy a billion dollars of products from another \ncountry rather than making them yourselves here, rather than American \ncompanies making them, we know that costs us jobs. When you think it is \n$2 billion--almost $2 billion every single day, well over a billion, \nbut the numbers are not precise--in trade deficit, where we buy from \nother countries more than we export and sell to other countries, we \nknow it is costing us jobs.\n  One of the other things that came out of this discussion with a \nnumber of Ways and Means Committee members, small business, a former \ntrade negotiator, and a union representative there was how we have seen \nincreasingly companies in Little Rock, in Dayton or in Toledo shut down \nproduction here and move it overseas and then sell those products back \ninto the United States.\n  The auto industry has not done much of that. When the auto industry \nsets up in Asia and are manufacturing cars, they typically sell them in \nthat part of the world. Unfortunately, GM just announced that they are \ngoing to be making an SUV plant in China and selling those products \nback into the United States. That is a terrible trend.\n  The reason I stopped on the floor before the vote in a couple of \nminutes is to say this: The Trans-Pacific Partnership has set us up in \nway that will make that worse. Under NAFTA, Canada, the United States, \nand Mexico--I strongly oppose NAFTA. But under that trade agreement, \nproducts in automobiles--almost two-thirds of all of the components in \nan automobile--had to be made in one of these three countries in order \nto get the tariff benefits from NAFTA for those companies, those \nproducts. Now there are 12 countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership \nand fewer than half the components have to be made in one of these 12 \ncountries.\n  What does that mean? It means that more than half of an automobile \ncan come from parts made in China but sold in the United States tariff-\nfree under the Trans-Pacific Partnership. How can we possibly think \nthat makes sense as a policy? That is fundamentally why the Trans-\nPacific Partnership does not make sense for our country. It doesn't \nmake sense for small businesses in Mansfield, OH, or in Springfield, \nOH, and it doesn't make sense for the up to 600,000 workers in my \nState--some 600,000 workers who are in the auto supply chain. We know a \nlot of them will lose jobs under the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  I yield the rest of my time to Senator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nOhio.\n  We are finally going to vote on the long overdue confirmation of \nJudge Luis Felipe Restrepo to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the third circuit in Pennsylvania. He was \nnominated way over a year ago--nearly 14 months ago--with strong \nbipartisan support from home State Senators. This is a case where, \nunfortunately, the Republican leadership has subjected Judge Restrepo \nto totally unnecessary delay as part of their wholesale obstruction of \njudicial nominees. Their actions hurt not only the people of \nPennsylvania, but also Americans across the country as judicial \nvacancies have remained unfilled nationwide after Republicans took over \nthe Senate majority last year.\n  I hope that today's vote and the agreement to vote on four district \ncourt nominees this work period signals a return to the Senate \nfulfilling its constitutional duty of providing advice and consent on \nthe President's nominees. In all of 2015, Senate Republicans allowed \nvotes on only 11 judicial nominations. This matched the record for \nconfirming the fewest number of judicial nominees in more than half a \ncentury. I mention that because Democrats took the majority in the last \n2 years of President Bush's term. We confirmed 40 judges during that \nyear--\n\n[[Page S20]]\n\n40. I was chairman. I remember that very well. I didn't want to repeat \nthe things that we saw during the Clinton administration, where the \nRepublicans came in and the then-Republican chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee killed over 60 nominees of the Clinton \nadministration by not allowing them to have a vote in committee. I \nsaid: Let's move faster. I moved 40 through. Did the Republicans do the \nsame? No, they allowed 11.\n  Republicans also left town at the end of last year with 19 judicial \nnominees still pending on the floor, including Judge Restrepo. Each of \nthe nominees has the support of their home state Senators and their \nnominations were reported out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote. \nThese are the kind of noncontroversial judicial nominees that the \nSenate has traditionally confirmed at the end of a session. During the \nObama administration, however, Republicans have rejected this practice.\n  Judge Restrepo exemplifies the kind of consensus nominee that should \nhave been easily confirmed at the end of the session. He is nominated \nto fill an emergency vacancy on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, \nwhich has two vacant judgeships in Pennsylvania. He has the strong \nbipartisan support of his home state Senators, Senator Casey and \nSenator Toomey. In fact, Senator Toomey has said he personally \nrecommended Judge Restrepo to the President for the nomination. In \n2013, this body confirmed Judge Restrepo's nomination to the Federal \ndistrict court by voice vote. I have heard no objection from any \nSenator to Judge Restrepo's nomination. I cannot believe this man who \nwill be the first Hispanic judge from Pennsylvania for the third \ncircuit was humiliated by having to wait 14 months. This highly \nqualified Hispanic judge was told to go to the back of the line and \nwait 14 months. It is wrong. It is absolutely wrong.\n  I will vote to confirm Judge Restrepo. Since 2013, he has served as a \njudge on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of \nPennsylvania. For the seven years prior, he served as a Federal \nmagistrate judge on the same court. Before joining the bench, Judge \nRestrepo was in private practice as a named partner at Krasner & \nRestrepo. He began his legal career serving as a public defender as an \nAssistant Defender for the Defender Association of Philadelphia before \nbecoming an Assistant Federal Defender for the Federal Community \nDefender Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. He was voted \nout of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote on July 9, 2015. \nHis nomination has the full support of the Hispanic National Bar \nAssociation. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \ncopy of the Hispanic National Bar Association's letter in support of \nJudge Restrepo at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Republicans' obstruction of highly qualified judicial nominees with \nstrong support, like Judge Restrepo, has resulted in a sharp rise in \njudicial vacancies. When Senate Republicans took over the majority in \nJanuary of last year, there were 43 judicial vacancies. After a year of \nRepublicans neglecting judicial confirmations, vacancies have \ndramatically increased to 72--an increase of more than 60 percent. \nFurthermore, the number of judicial vacancies deemed to be \n``emergencies'' by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts because \ncaseloads in those courts are unmanageably high has nearly tripled \nunder Republican Senate leadership--from 12 when Republicans took over \nlast year to 33 today. In his annual year-end report, even Chief \nJustice Roberts drew our attention to the ``crushing dockets'' and \nheavy caseloads that strain the Federal judiciary and prevent Americans \nfrom obtaining timely justice in our courts.\n  The high number of vacancies is entirely of the Senate Republican \nleadership's making, and Senate action is required to resolve it. The \nfirst step is to confirm the rest of the 18 judicial nominees pending \nright now on the floor. Under a bipartisan agreement reached at the end \nof last year, the Majority Leader will schedule confirmation votes on \nfour district court nominees between now and the President's Day \nrecess. After we vote on those nominees, we will still have nominees \nfrom Tennessee, Maryland, New Jersey, Nebraska, New York, and \nCalifornia pending on the floor, nearly all of whom would fill \nemergency vacancies. Votes on these nominees must be scheduled without \nfurther delay.\n  Let's start facing up to fact that we have enormous problems with \njudiciary emergencies in States where both Republicans and Democrats \nhave supported the nominees. Let them come forward. Let them be voted \non. Let's stop making the Federal courts a political pawn. It is bad \nenough with all the political shenanigans going on in this country \nanyway in an election year. Don't do them with the Federal court \nsystem. We have the best, the most honest, the least partisan Federal \ncourt system anywhere in the world. But don't say: Oh, you are a highly \nqualified Hispanic nominee, but you just wait there for 14 months, be \nhumiliated, and then we will finally allow a vote. I don't care whether \nsomeone is Hispanic or non-Hispanic; we have so many men and women who \nare highly qualified.\n\n  In addition to the nominees pending on the floor, there are also four \nPennsylvania district court nominees that the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee is poised to report out this month. I sincerely hope the \njunior Senator from Pennsylvania can convince the Republican Majority \nLeader not to submit these additional Pennsylvania nominees to the \nextensive confirmation delay that Judge Restrepo endured. The people of \nPennsylvania have waited long enough. I also understand that the White \nHouse has been working for months with Senator Toomey and Senator Casey \non the second Pennsylvania vacancy on the third circuit. I look forward \nto the Judiciary Committee considering that nomination soon.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 31, 2015.\n     Re Hispanic National Bar Association Endorsement of \n         Nomination of The Honorable Luis Felipe Restrepo to the \n         United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\n\n     Hon. Chuck Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy: On behalf \n     of the Hispanic National Bar Association (``HNBA''), we write \n     to recommend the confirmation of the Honorable Luis Felipe \n     Restrepo to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third \n     Circuit. As explained below, we believe that Judge Restrepo \n     has all the requisite qualifications to serve in this role \n     and will serve the Court and the parties that come before it \n     with distinction and integrity.\n       The HNBA is a non-profit, non-partisan national membership \n     association that represents the interests of Hispanic \n     attorneys, judges, law professors, law students, and legal \n     professionals in the United States and Puerto Rico. One of \n     the HNBA's many institutional objectives is to advocate and \n     work to ensure that the federal and state courts in our \n     nation are diverse and reflect the citizenry that come before \n     our courts daily.\n       Judge Restrepo sought the HNBA's endorsement shortly after \n     President Obama nominated him to the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Third Circuit. The HNBA conducted a thorough \n     due diligence process that included interviews of personal \n     and professional references (including judges and attorneys), \n     a review of his scholarly writings and legal opinions, and a \n     thorough Internet search. We also have considered his \n     background and qualifications in the context of the \n     requirements of the position for which he was nominated, as \n     well as the requirements of the HNBA's Policies and \n     Procedures Governing Judicial Endorsements. After a careful \n     review, it is clear that Judge Restrepo possesses the \n     professional expertise, experience, personal integrity and \n     judicial temperament to distinguish himself as a federal \n     appellate judge. Accordingly, we urge you to confirm his \n     nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Third Circuit.\n       Prior to being sworn in as a District Judge for the Eastern \n     District of Pennsylvania in 2013 and his appointment as a \n     Magistrate Judge in 2006, Judge Restrepo was a highly-\n     regarded Philadelphia attorney and founding member of the \n     firm of Krasner & Restrepo, concentrating on criminal defense \n     and civil rights litigation. Before forming his law firm, he \n     served as an assistant federal defender with the Community \n     Federal Defender for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, \n     and an assistant defender for the Defender Association of \n     Philadelphia. He is an adjunct professor at Temple University \n     James E. Beasley School of Law, was an adjunct professor at \n     the University of Pennsylvania Law School from 1997-2009 \n     where he was appointed the Irving R. Segal Lecturer in \n     advocacy, and has taught with the National Institute for \n     Trial Advocacy in regional and national programs since 1991. \n     He\n\n[[Page S21]]\n\n     has been a lecturer at seminars sponsored by a number of \n     agencies and organizations and has written numerous articles \n     appearing in a variety of national publications. Throughout \n     his career, Judge Restrepo has stood out as an exceptional \n     role model for community involvement and civic participation. \n     He has devoted his time and expertise to a variety of boards \n     and commissions as well as the Eastern District prisoner \n     reentry program.\n       The HNBA's due diligence process has confirmed that Judge \n     Restrepo's integrity, knowledge of the law, breadth of \n     professional experience, and intellectual capacity make him \n     well suited to sit as a federal appellate judge. Accordingly, \n     it is with great pride that we have the privilege of \n     endorsing the Honorable Luis Felipe Restrepo and recommend \n     his confirmation to serve as a Judge on the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

Mares directly at \n     (720) 314-1295 or by e-mail at president@hnba.com, if we can \n     be of any further assistance.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Cynthia D.

Happy new year. Nothing says ``Happy new year'' like \nthe ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, so I will kick off 2016 with my year-\nopener ``Time to Wake Up'' speech recapping some of last year's climate \nchange milestones.\n  They say you only get one chance to make a first impression, and the \nfirst impression Senate Republicans chose to make in 2015 was to use \ntheir first 3 weeks of floor time--3 full weeks of precious floor \ntime--to help a foreign oil company's tar sands pipeline. Even though \nit meant the government condemning American farms, even though the \nPresident was sure to veto it, that was their opener.\n  By the end of the year, things had changed. The Republican leader was \nburying the votes against the Clean Power Plan deep in the news of the \nterrible Paris massacres and collapsing votes together to minimize \nfloor time on this issue. The Republican majority opened 2015 with a \nbig oil bang but crept out of the year with a whimper.\n  Things indeed changed in 2015. Of course, the scientific evidence \ncontinued to show that fossil fuel pollution was damaging our \nenvironment and our oceans and our economy. And 2015 was record-setting \nhot. This chart from November shows that 2015 is on track to being the \nhottest year globally since we began keeping records in 1880. We can \nsee that the 2015 running monthly global temperature average is above \nthe 6 next warmest years on record in every month for which data is \navailable.\n  The Director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies estimates \nthe probability of 2015 being the hottest on record at better than 99 \npercent. He has labeled 2015 a ``scorcher.'' But that won't be official \nuntil later this month. It is no fluke.\n  The World Meteorological Organization reports the recent 5-year \nperiod--2011 to 2015--as the warmest 5-year period on record, and 2015 \nwas the first year where monthly global average carbon dioxide \nconcentrations exceeded 400 parts per million, and it did so for more \nthan 3 months. Bear in mind that for as long as human beings have been \non this planet Earth, we have existed safely in a range of 170 to 300 \nparts per million. We are outside of that by almost the entire range, \nand we know this from ice cores which contain tiny bubbles of ancient \natmospheres. I saw those ice cores last October at Ohio State \nUniversity. World-renowned atmospheric scientists, the husband-and-wife \nteam Dr. Ellen Mosley Thompson and Dr. Lonnie Thompson, worked for \nyears to retrieve cores from around the world and to test the ancient \nair captured inside. The lesson of these cores is that humans have \nfundamentally altered the chemistry of the Earth's air and that our \ngreenhouse gas emissions are rapidly altering our climate. Scientists \nnow say that we have so altered the Earth as to consider ourselves in a \nnew geologic epoch, the Anthropocene.\n  In 2015, the oceans kept shouting at us to wake up. Throughout 2015, \nevidence continued to document our oceans warming, rising, and \nacidifying. And 2015 brought the first nationwide study assessing the \nvulnerability of America's $1 billion shellfish industry to ocean \nacidification, documenting the risk to 15 coastal States, such as \nLouisiana, Texas, Maine, and Rhode Island.\n  The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in October \nreported on climate change's threats to fish integral to human diets, \npredicting a dramatic collapse in the world's largest ecosystem, our \noceans. The great corrupt denial machine the fossil fuel industry \nsupports never talks about oceans. The machine doesn't care about \nevidence; it is just an obstacle to their fossil fuel PR campaign. They \njust want to create phony doubt. But since there is not much room for \ndoubt\n\n[[Page S22]]\n\nin measurements of warming, rising, and acidifying seas, they won't go \nthere. Nevertheless, 2015 was another bad year for oceans.\n  Mr. President, 2015 was also the year journalists, academics, and \ninvestigators took a hard look at that big, phony climate denial \napparatus. The year 2015 brought reports that Exxon knew climate change \nwas real but funded the climate denial apparatus anyway, reports of how \nfossil fuel money influenced the front groups' language, and reports \nabout hidden money and networks of influence and fossil fuel money \ncontrolling politics. Report after report showed fossil fuel money \npouring into dozens of front groups, creating phony doubt and \ncontroversy, then propagated through media outlets also in the tank to \nthe fossil fuel industry, such as FOX News and the Wall Street Journal \neditorial page.\n  If you doubt that climate change is real, you have been had. It is \nreally that simple. It is a racket. And 2015 was the year when many \nvoices began asking for a racketeering investigation into a fraud of \nhistoric proportions.\n  Mr. President, 2015 was a year of growing public recognition across \nAmerica of the need to act. A 2015 Stanford poll found that 83 percent \nof Americans, including 6 in 10 Republicans, want action to reduce \ncarbon emissions. For the first time, a majority of self-identified \nRepublicans now believe there is solid evidence of global warming. And \nif you take out the loopy Tea Party cohort, among sensible Republicans, \nthe number goes even higher. Among young Republican voters--Republican \nvoters under age 35--most said they would describe a climate denier as \n``ignorant,'' ``out of touch,'' or ``crazy.''\n  In 2015, the EPA launched the Clean Power Plan, our Nation's most \nambitious effort yet. It is the first-ever plan to reduce carbon \npollution from the largest source of U.S. carbon emissions: \npowerplants. The Clean Power Plan is projected to both cut carbon \nemissions and save Americans money on their annual energy bills.\n  In 2015, the Obama administration at last rejected the Keystone XL \nPipeline--a great victory for the environmental movement after the \n400,000-person climate march in New York City. In 2015, Pope Francis--\nthe world leader of the Catholic Church--added his holy voice to the \ncall.\n  ``Humanity,'' Pope Francis said, ``is called . . . to combat this \nwarming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it.'' \nSpecifically, the Pope said, ``[T]echnology based on the use of highly \npolluting fossil fuels, needs to be progressively replaced without \ndelay.''\n  Pope Francis's encyclical said something to Congress:\n\n       To take up these responsibilities, and the costs they \n     entail, politicians will inevitably clash with the mindset of \n     short-term gain and results which dominates present-day \n     economics and politics. But if they are courageous, they will \n     attest to their God-given dignity and leave behind a \n     testimony of selfless responsibility.\n\n  And 2015 showed some signs of political courage, dignity, and \nresponsibility. Republican Congressman Bob Inglis took a beating at the \nhands of the fossil fuel industry, but he did not give up the fight. \nOur colleague Lindsey Graham ran for the Republican nomination on a \nsensible climate change platform. He and other Senate colleagues have \nstarted a little Senate Republican study group. Twelve House \nRepublicans, led by Congressman Chris Gibson of New York, broke with \ntheir party's Orthodoxy and sponsored a resolution committing to \naddress climate change by promoting ingenuity, innovation, and \nexceptionalism. It is not much yet, but it is a start. It is a turn.\n  Perhaps the biggest milestone of 2015 was the Paris agreement reached \nin December, with 190 countries agreeing to a global deal to address \nclimate change. One key element was that more than 150 major U.S. \ncompanies signed on to the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, \ncalling for strong outcomes in the Paris climate negotiations. These \ncompanies' operations together span all 50 States, they employ nearly \n11 million people, they represent more than $4.2 trillion in annual \nrevenue, and they have a combined market capitalization of over $7 \ntrillion. These are blue-chip American icons such as AT of Texas, \nCoca-Cola and UPS of Georgia, Procter & Gamble of Ohio, and Walmart of \nArkansas. How long can Republicans ignore them?\n  You know the phrase about lipstick on a pig? Well, 2015 brought so \nmuch change that even the big fossil fuel pigs felt they had to try on \na little lipstick. Typical of them, it was bogus--just enough happy \ntalk about climate change and carbon fees to get the CEOs through a \nDavos cocktail party without being shunned, while here in Congress, \ntheir whole brutal political apparatus, up to and including the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce--which these days should probably be called the \nU.S. Chamber of Carbon--kept relentlessly hammering against any \nprospect of meaningful climate legislation. Real or not, it is \nnoteworthy that the big oil tycoons at least felt the need for some \nlipstick.\n  Speaking of piggy, 2015 was also the year the International Monetary \nFund calculated the effective public subsidy of the fossil fuel \nindustry at $700 billion per year just in the United States alone. \nRemember when the costs of carbon pollution are not factored into the \nprice, those costs become a public subsidy--a market failure. This \nsubsidy climbs into the trillions of dollars worldwide. If that is not \npiggy, nothing is.\n  My biggest prayer for 2016 is the American business coalition from \nParis helping Republican colleagues acknowledge publicly what many have \nconcluded privately; that it is time for Congress to address climate \nchange. If Republicans can get some relief from the brutal political \npressure of the fossil fuel industry, there are conservative-friendly \nsolutions at hand. Every Republican who has thought this problem \nthrough to a solution comes to the same place, every one. Former \nTreasury Secretary and Secretary of State George Shultz, President \nReagan's economic adviser Art Laffer, President George W. Bush's \nTreasury Secretary Hank Paulson, and his Council of Economic Advisers \nChair Greg Mankiw, former Congressman Bob Inglis, and many others, all \nadvocated last year that a carbon fee is the efficient way to correct \nthe market failure that lets the fossil fuel industry pollute for free. \nFour former Republican EPA Administrators, Bill Ruckelshaus, Christine \nTodd Whitman, Lee Thomas, and Bill Reilly, wrote: ``A market-based \napproach, like a carbon tax, would be the best path to reducing \ngreenhouse-gas emissions.''\n  Even a columnist at the Wall Street Journal, whose editorial page is \nnotoriously fossil fuel friendly, wrote: ``There's no dispute among \neconomists on the most cost-effective way to [reduce emissions]: a \ncarbon tax.''\n  Well, we have one. In 2015, the conservative American Enterprise \nInstitute hosted the announcement of my legislation with Senator \nSchatz, creating a revenue-neutral carbon fee, with none--zero--of the \nrevenues kept by the Federal Government but instead being used to \nprovide massive corporate tax reductions and personal tax rebates. We \nhave gone to exactly where Republicans are pointing. So please, \ncolleagues, take yes for an answer. Join us, and let's get to work.\n  Mr. President, 2015 was a year the tide turned in Congress, from that \nopening Keystone Pipeline political fanfare to the buried, quiet, end-\nof-the-year votes on the President's Clean Power Plan, with three \nRepublicans even voting to support President Obama on those votes. It \nwas a turning year and a new year now begins. We still need to wake up. \nWe still need to get to work. We still have a duty before us, and it is \na duty we should not shirk. I pray that 2016 will be the year, and I \npromise to do everything in my power to make it the year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/senate-section/article/S22-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S22-S25]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

This \ninformation is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to \nsection 302 of the CBA. Over the fiscal year 2016-2025 period, which is \nthe entire period covered by S. Con. Res. 11, Senate authorizing \ncommittees have spent $148 billion more than the budget resolution \ncalls for.\n  Table 2 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This \ninformation is used to determine points of order related to the \nspending caps found in section 312 and section 314 of the CBA. On \nDecember 18, 2015, the President signed H.R. 2029, the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act, 2016, P.L. 114-113, into law. This bill provided \nregular appropriations equal to the levels set in the Bipartisan Budget \nAct of 2015, P.L. 114-74, specifically $548.1 billion in budget \nauthority for defense accounts, revised security category, and $518.5 \nbillion in budget authority for nondefense accounts, revised \nnonsecurity category.\n  Table 3 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations is below or exceeds its allocation for overseas \ncontingency operations/global war on terrorism, OCO/GWOT, spending. \nThis separate allocation for OCO/GWOT was established in section 3102 \nof S. Con. Res. 11 and is enforced using section 302 of the CBA. The \nconsolidated appropriations bill included $73.7 billion in budget \nauthority and $32.1 billion in outlays for OCO/GWOT in fiscal year \n2016. This level is equal to the revised OCO/GWOT levels that I filed \nin the Record on December 18, 2015.\n  The budget resolution established two new points of order limiting \nthe use of changes in mandatory programs in appropriations bills, \nCHIMPS. Tables 4 and 5 show compliance with fiscal year 2016 limits for \noverall CHIMPS and the crime victims fund CHIMP, respectively. This \ninformation is used for determining points of order under section 3103 \nand section 3104, respectively. Enacted CHIMPS are under both the \nbroader CHIMPS limit, $1.3 billion less, and the crime victims fund \nlimit, $1.8 billion less.\n  In addition to the tables provided by the Senate Budget Committee \nRepublican staff, I am submitting additional tables from CBO that I \nwill use for enforcement of budget levels agreed to by the Congress.\n  For fiscal year 2016, CBO estimates that current law levels are \n$138.9 billion and $103.6 billion above the budget resolution levels \nfor budget authority and outlays, respectively. Revenues are $155.2 \nbillion below the level assumed in the budget resolution. Finally, \nSocial Security outlays are at the levels assumed in the budget \nresolution for fiscal year 2016, while Social Security revenues are $23 \nmillion below assumed levels for the budget year.\n  CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate's \npay-as-you-go rule. The Senate's pay-as-you-go scorecard currently \nshows deficit reduction of $20.5 billion over the fiscal year 2015-2020 \nperiod and $95.6 billion over the fiscal year 2015-2025 period. Over \nthe initial 6-year period, Congress has enacted legislation that would \nincrease revenues by $17 billion and decrease outlays by $3.5 billion. \nOver the 11-year period, Congress has enacted legislation that would \nincrease revenues by $36.7 billion and decrease outlays by $58.9 \nbillion. The Senate's pay-as-you-go rule is enforced by section 201 of \nS. Con. Res. 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution.\n  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n TABLE 1.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE\n                   (+) OR BELOW (-)

This report is submitted \n     under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the \n     Congressional Budget Act, as amended.\n       The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues \n     are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of \n     S.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the efforts of \nRADM Joan Hunter during her tenure as the Assistant Joint Surgeon at \nthe National Guard Bureau, Joint Surgeon General's Office, \nPsychological Health, NGB, JSG-PH.\n  In this capacity, RADM Hunter has served as principal staff and \nadviser to the Chief of the National Guard Bureau. As a member of the \nJoint Surgeon's Office, RADM Hunter partnered with the J1, Manpower and \nPersonnel Directorate, and the J32, the Counterdrug Division, to direct \nservices to address the psychological health needs of Guard members and \ntheir families. Her most significant contribution was building the \nNational Guard's psychological health program, which meant placing a \ndirector of psychological health in every State, wing, and territory \nbased on the Department\n\n[[Page S26]]\n\nof Defense's Mental Health Task Force Report recommendations. As a \ncommissioned officer in the U.S. Public Health Service, RADM Hunter is \na shining example of how the whole government can come together to \naddress mental health issues in our military.\n  I have had the honor and pleasure of working closely with RADM Hunter \nduring her time at NGB, and I am grateful for her leadership, energy, \nand innovation. Mental health is a critical readiness issue for all our \nservicemembers, and the Department of Defense has made important \nprogress in improving the mental health and resilience of our force. \nUnfortunately, in the past, the unique needs and challenges faced by \nour Guard members and Reservists were often neglected by programs \ndesigned to serve the Active component. Under RADM Hunter's direction, \nthat is changing. She has made a real, tangible impact on the lives of \nGuard members, and in doing so, she has done a tremendous service to \nour Nation and our communities.\n  RADM Hunter is a champion in the fight to combat military suicide, \nimprove mental health and resiliency among our servicemembers, and \nfield the strongest fighting force the world has ever known. She has \nbeen an especially valued partner in this undertaking, and while she \nwill be sorely missed at NGB, I know she will continue to do great \nthings for our country. I wish RADM Hunter the best of luck in her new \nassignment and thank her for her dedicated service to our men and women \nin the National Guard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/senate-section/article/S26-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S26]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING THE 100TH PENNSYLVANIA FARM SHOW\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 100th \nPennsylvania Farm Show, which is being held this week in Harrisburg, \nPA.\n  Established in 1917, the Pennsylvania Farm Show is held every January \nand showcases the Commonwealth's vibrant farming traditions and finest \nfoods. With 24 acres of exhibition space, it is the Nation's largest \nindoor agricultural event. This year's show will display more than \n13,000 exhibits and is anticipated to draw half a million visitors from \nacross the Nation.\n  The farm show always provides free admission and allows everyone the \nchance to learn more about Pennsylvania agriculture. It hosts a wide \nvariety of events and displays including livestock exhibits, art \ndisplays, and educational workshops.\n  In addition to its hands-on exhibits, the farm show allows visitors \nto sample products that are grown and produced in Pennsylvania. Farmers \ndisplay their fruits and vegetables while vendors sell local favorites, \nincluding pretzels, apple butter, and shoofly pie. As the occupant of \nthe Senate candy desk, I would be remiss not to recognize the small, \nfamily-owned candy companies that also sell their products at the farm \nshow.\n  With a nod toward education, the Pennsylvania Farm Show sponsors the \nscholarship foundation for students pursuing their post-secondary \neducation in the agriculture field. Since its creation, the foundation \nhas donated over $1 million in scholarships to youth involved in 4-H, \nFuture Farmers of America, and other agriculture organizations. It is \nencouraging to see such a strong commitment to agriculture's continued \nsuccess in Pennsylvania for the foreseeable future.\n  This weekend, my family and I will attend the 2016 Pennsylvania Farm \nShow. Farming is a vital component to Pennsylvania's economy, and I am \nproud of our State's dairy, livestock, and agriculture products. I look \nforward to the farm show every year, and I encourage all Pennsylvanians \nto attend this event to experience firsthand our State's rich \nagriculture history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/senate-section/article/S26-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S26]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              RECOGNIZING THE 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF LEE, NH\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Lee, NH, a \ntown in Strafford County that is celebrating the 250th anniversary of \nits founding. I am proud to join citizens across New Hampshire in \nrecognizing this special milestone.\n  Lee was originally settled in 1657 and was officially incorporated in \n1766 by colonial Governor Benning Wentworth. In the century leading up \nto its incorporation, Lee was part of Durham and the Oyster River \nPlantation. Lee was also one of the last towns to be incorporated by \nGovernor Wentworth.\n  Wadleigh Falls, located in Lee, is a historic landmark and one of the \noldest areas in New Hampshire to be inhabited by humans. Abenaki and \nPenacook tribes would come to the falls for hunting, fishing, and \nfarming as far back as 8,000 years ago. Upon settlement, the Europeans \nwould follow in the Native Americans' footsteps and use the falls to \ntheir economic advantage. The settlers started using this site in 1657, \nand the first mill was built in 1665. Mills in Lee processed timber, \ngrain, leather, wooden buckets, and herbal medicines. Generous clay \ndeposits and the town's lumber mill system allowed Lee to become a \nvalued location for industry in the early history of the United States. \nThe town's agricultural tradition has also been very important to Lee \nand its many farms that are still operating today.\n  In addition to its agricultural advantages, Lee is also known for its \nunique landscape features including scenic plains, meadows, winding \nstreams, brooks, and Wheelwright Pond, named after Reverend John \nWheelwright.\n  Today Lee's students and families enjoy an exceptional education \nsystem, thanks in large part to a tradition of learning and knowledge \nthat has long been ingrained in the community. The Oyster River \nCooperative School District is consistently regarded as one of the top \nschool districts in the State of New Hampshire.\n  The town's population has grown from 1,029 residents in 1790 to over \n4,300 in 2013. The people of Lee have a strong commitment to the spirit \nof community and volunteerism as evidenced by the hard work and \ndedication of residents involved with the planning of many events to \ncelebrate the town's 250th anniversary.\n  Lee and its residents have greatly contributed to the life and growth \nof New Hampshire. I ask my colleagues to join me in extending \ncongratulations to the people of Lee as they celebrate the town's 250th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/senate-section/article/S26-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S26-S27]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING MIKE SULLIVAN\n\n Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nwish to honor my friend, former Wyoming Governor Mike Sullivan, who is \nbeing recognized as the 2016 National Western Stock Show's Citizen of \nthe West. It is fitting that Mike was chosen for this special award. He \njoins a long line of honorees known for their values, ingenuity, and \nhard work. Mike, a cowboy in every sense of the word, carries these \ntraits and many more in his heart and soul.\n  Mike grew up in the prairie lands of Douglas, WY. His formative years \nwere spent riding horses, shooting coffee cans, and enjoying the vast \nopportunities for recreation around the area. This appreciation led to \na lifelong love of the State and her people.\n  He was enamored with one Wyoming native in particular. Mike met Jane \nMetzler, who was born in Riverton and raised in Powell, during their \nstudies at the University of Wyoming. Both of them were involved in \nsocial clubs and organizations. They even served together in the \nAssociated Students of the University of Wyoming Student Senate. In \n1961, the sweethearts were married. As they put down roots in Casper, \nthey never lost sight of the important values that guide the people of \nour great State.\n  Wyoming is the first State to adopt an official code of ethics, which \nwe proudly call our Cowboy Ethics. This list of 10 principles serves as \na guide for the modern cowboy and represents the distinct values that \nthe American West is famous for.\n  One of the tenets, ``Take pride in your work,'' brings to mind Mike \nand his incredible work ethic. With a petroleum engineering degree and \na law degree, both earned at the University of Wyoming, Mike set his \nsights on practicing law. Well-loved and respected by many in the \nState, he ran--and was elected--to be Wyoming's 29th Governor in 1986. \nDuring his two terms, he governed the way he practiced law, with common \nsense and general decency.\n  His leadership was crucial as at that time the State was experiencing \none of\n\n[[Page S27]]\n\nits most economically trying periods. Falling oil and gas prices \nprovided an opportunity for him to reach across the aisle and work with \nDemocrats and Republicans alike to develop solutions to benefit the \nState and her residents. He is well known for his bipartisanship, which \nhas brought lasting change and has resulted in a better quality of life \nfor everyone living in the West.\n  His political career did not end after serving as Governor. In 1999, \nPresident Bill Clinton appointed him to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to \nIreland. He graciously accepted the position, and he and Jane moved to \nDublin. His service as Ambassador surpassed all expectations of \nsuccess. Mike was instrumental in the implementation of the Good Friday \nAgreement in the United Kingdom. With his special brand of warmth, \nhumility, and integrity, Mike dutifully served both the United States \nand the world in this important role.\n  Another of the principles listed in the Cowboy Ethics code is ``Ride \nfor the brand.'' Upon meeting him, it is immediately apparent that Mike \nlives and breathes the spirit of the West. He has an intimate knowledge \nof the issues facing western States today, including the challenges of \nbalancing energy development with natural resource preservation.\n  He is a natural leader, and his passion for the State has served him \nwell in many other important roles. During his tenure as Governor, he \nwas the chairman of the Western Governors' Association, as well as the \nInterstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, which focuses on the \nresponsible, environmentally sound development of America's oil and gas \nresources. He has won numerous awards in honor of his service and \ncommitment to giving back, including a Distinguished Service Medal from \nthe Wyoming National Guard, an award of merit from the Wyoming Heritage \nSociety, and the President's Award from the Wyoming State Bar. Despite \nthese grand honors, Mike remains humble, choosing to spend time with \nhis wife and family while enhancing his community and State. He \ncertainly does ride for the brand.\n  Mike's accomplishments are numerous, and for every one of them, his \nbeloved wife, Jane Metzler Sullivan, has been by his side. As a third \ngeneration Wyoming native, Jane possesses an incredible value system \nreflective of the State's moral compass. Every bit a presence as her \nhusband, Jane prides herself on making contributions to her community \nand State. She once said, ``Communities give us the opportunity to make \nour lives meaningful.'' The couple has been married for 54 years. \nToday, they enjoy the company of their three children and their \nspouses: Michelle Sullivan and Bryan Kuehl, Patrick and Ming Sullivan, \nand Theresa and JR Twiford. They adore their seven grandchildren: \nPatrick, Maggie, Caitie, Caitlyn, Michael, Jack, and Julia. I am \nconfident that both Mike and Jane delight in sharing the best parts of \ntheir souls with their loving family.\n  Mike has been gifted with bright ideas and a subtle sense of humor. \nHe is jovial and kind and remains deeply active in the community of \nCasper. Folks who know him love him. He is a seasoned diplomat, a \ngenerous patron, and a passionate advocate for Wyoming. He champions \nWyoming's cowboy spirit, and his mission to preserve and share the \nlegacy of the American West with others is truly outstanding.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in celebrating this incredible man \nas he is named the 2016 Citizen of the West. We simply could not ask \nfor a better leader, role model, or friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/senate-section/article/S27-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S27]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING OZELL SUTTON\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the life \nand legacy of civil rights activist Ozell Sutton. A native of Gould, \nAR, Sutton paved the way for desegregation in the Natural State and \nthroughout the South alongside Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and other \ncivil rights leaders.\n  After graduating from Dubar High School in Little Rock, Sutton \nstudied at Philander Smith College where he earned a degree in \npolitical science.\n  He broke barriers as the Arkansas Democrat's first Black journalist. \nIn 2012, he shared the story of his hiring, saying that he didn't know \nanything about journalism but was hired because the Democrat ``wanted \nto reach the black community.''\n  He worked at the newspaper for 7 years where he made a difference in \nhow the newspaper covered the African-American community. He challenged \nthe status quo, inspiring change in the news stories to refer to Black \nmen and women as ``Mr.'' and ``Mrs.,'' just as it did with the White \npopulation.\n  Sutton was an activist serving as a decoy at Central High School in \n1957 when the Little Rock Nine integrated the school. He recalled being \nbeaten after the mob figured out he was a decoy.\n  He led integration efforts in Arkansas while serving as assistant \ndirector of the Arkansas Council on Human Relations from 1961 to 1966 \nand joined civil rights leaders to pave the way for equality across the \ncountry. He joined the historic march on Washington and marched for \nvoting rights in Selma.\n  Following the death of Dr. King, he served Governor Winthrop \nRockefeller as the director of the Governor's Council on Human \nResources from 1968-1970 and continued his public service with the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice Community Relations Services. In 1972 he was \nappointed the director in the southeast region. He held that position \nuntil his retirement in 2003.\n  As a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, Sutton served as regional vice \npresident of the southwest region and southern region before going on \nto serve as the 26th general president.\n  In 2012, Sutton was presented a Congressional Gold Medal as one of \nthe first African Americans to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  Ozell Sutton dedicated his life to bettering the lives of future \ngenerations. He was a true American hero whose leadership helped fight \ndesegregation and lay the foundation for equality. My thoughts and \nprayers go out to his family during this difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/senate-section/article/S27-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S27-S28]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONOR FLIGHT NORTHERN COLORADO\n\n Mr. GARDNER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the \n     veterans of Honor Flight Northern Colorado and the \n     organization's 15th trip to Washington, DC. This group \n     includes veterans from various wars and generations, but all \n     are linked by their service to our country.\n       Ten years ago, the Honor Flight was created to fly veterans \n     that had served in World War II to Washington, DC so they \n     could visit the World War II memorial. Now, the Honor Flight \n     welcomes veterans from across the country to fly to \n     Washington, DC, free of charge, to visit the memorials of the \n     wars these heroic veterans fought. Currently, there are more \n     than 21.8 million veterans living in the United States, and \n     this growing population is continuously deserving of \n     recognition.

(The \nPocket Veto Case, 279 U.S. 655 (1929)).\n  Climate change poses a profound threat to our future and future \ngenerations. Atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, a primary greenhouse \ngas, are higher than they have been in at least 800,000 years. In 2009, \nEPA determined that greenhouse gas pollution endangers Americans' \nhealth and welfare by causing long-lasting changes in the climate that \ncan have, and are already having, a range of negative effects on human \nhealth, the climate, and the environment. We are already seeing the \nimpacts of climate change, and established science confirms that we \nwill experience stronger storms, deeper droughts, longer wildfire \nseasons, and other intensified impacts as the planet warms. The \nPentagon has determined that climate change poses immediate risks to \nour national security.\n  Power plants are the largest source of greenhouse gas pollution in \nour country. Although we have limits on other dangerous pollutants from \npower plants, the carbon pollution standards and the Clean Power Plan \nensure that we will finally have national standards to reduce the \namount of carbon pollution that our power plants can emit.\n  The carbon pollution standards will ensure that, when we make major \ninvestments in power generation infrastructure, we also deploy \navailable technologies to make that infrastructure as low-emitting as \npossible. By blocking these standards from taking effect, S.J. Res. 23 \nwould delay our transition to cleaner electricity generating \ntechnologies by enabling continued build-out of outdated, high-\npolluting infrastructure. Because it would overturn carbon pollution \nstandards that are critical to protecting against climate change and \nensuring the health and well-being of our Nation, I cannot support the \nresolution.\n  To leave no doubt that the resolution is being vetoed, in addition to \nwithholding my signature, I am returning S.J.

The \nPentagon has determined that climate change poses immediate risks to \nour national security.\n  The Clean Power Plan is a tremendously important step in the fight \nagainst global climate change. It is projected to reduce carbon \npollution from power plants by 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. It \nbuilds on progress States and the power sector are already making to \nmove toward cleaner\n\n[[Page S29]]\n\nenergy production, and gives States the time and flexibility they need \nto develop tailored, cost-effective plans to reduce their emissions. By \nnullifying the Clean Power Plan, S.J. Res. 24 not only threatens \nongoing progress toward cleaner energy, but would also eliminate public \nhealth and other benefits of up to $54 billion per year by 2030, \nincluding thousands fewer premature deaths from air pollution and \nthousands fewer childhood asthma attacks each year.\n  The Clean Power Plan is essential in addressing the largest source of \ngreenhouse gas pollution in our country.
