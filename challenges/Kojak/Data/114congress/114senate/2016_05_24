Mr. President, this administration has been on a long \nregulatory march for years now, and too often its regulations end up \nhurting the very Americans they purport to help.\n  Although issued in the name of greater equality, it is actually the \nwell-off and well-connected who are best positioned to deal with these \nnew regulatory schemes. Meanwhile, purported beneficiaries--like \nworking and middle-class Americans--too often end up with higher costs \nand less access to things they actually need. We have seen it happen \nwith ObamaCare. We have seen it happen to families and businesses that \ncan't get a loan due to Dodd-Frank.\n  In the case of the so-called fiduciary rule, we are talking about a \nset of regulations that will reduce access to investment advice for \nthose struggling to save for retirement. I have sincere concerns about \nwhat this could mean, not only for the ability of investment advisers \nto provide quality financial advice but also for the ability of \nconsumers to seek affordable retirement options.\n  Today the Senate will have a chance to stand up for smaller savers \nand middle-class families by voting for a disapproval measure before \nus--a disapproval measure to overturn a set of regulations many believe \nwill make it harder for these families to save for retirement. Some \nhave estimated that investment fees could more than double under this \nregulation. What this means is that many consumers could risk losing \naccess to quality, low-cost retirement advice, and many financial \nadvisers may not be able to offer sound financial products that provide \npeace of mind to their clients.\n  But don't take my word for it; many Kentuckians have voiced their \nconcerns as well. I have received thousands of pieces of correspondence \nfrom constituents who fear the potential effects of this regulation. I \nreceived one letter from Prospect, from someone with a small, \nindependent insurance marketing company. Obviously, given the historic \nregulatory burden this rule places on the financial services and \ninsurance industries, particularly on small businesses, he is concerned \nabout the impact of this rule on his small firm, but he also worries \nabout the impact this rule will have on the families he is helping to \nprepare for retirement. This is what he wrote:\n\n       This rule makes it virtually impossible for . . . \n     independent life insurance agents to provide valuable \n     guidance to middle-class America, and will cause irreparable \n     harm to the citizens the rule was designed to protect.\n\n  The regulation could potentially discourage investment advisers from \ntaking on clients with smaller accounts. These smaller accounts \nrepresent everyday Americans who are trying to plan for their future \nand who now could have less access to sound investment advice. The \nnotices are coming from small savers, who are likely to hear something \nlike ``Sorry, but due to new regulations, we will no longer be able to \nservice your account.'' And again, if you make a lot of money, you are \nlikely to do just fine and still have plenty of access to retirement \nadvice, but it is the little guy who is likely to be harmed. That is \nwhy, from the moment these regulations were proposed, there were so \nmany bipartisan concerns raised about it.\n  When this regulation goes into effect, too many Americans may be in \ndanger of not receiving the financial advice they need for their \nretirement. One report projects the regulation could result in up to \n$80 billion worth of lost savings every single year.\n  Local chambers of commerce, small businesses, associations, and \norganizations joined in a letter voicing their concerns that ``this \nrule disproportionately disadvantages small businesses and those \nbusinesses with assets of less than $50 million, and stifles retirement \nsavings for millions of employees by placing additional burdens on \nAmerica's leading job creators, small businesses, which will likely \nsubstantially reduce retirement savings for many Americans.''\n  The administration has heard these protests over this regulation, but \nthese\n\n[[Page S3064]]\n\nofficials don't seem to care about the harm it will cause. According to \na report released by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs chairman, the administration has ``disregarded . . . concerns \nand declined to implement recommendations'' from career nonpartisan \nstaff and government officials. Not for the first time, this \nadministration is rolling roughshod right over the concerns of too many \nAmericans, including the people it should be working to protect, such \nas working families and low-income seniors.\n  That is why I am proud to support this disapproval resolution to \nblock enforcement of this rule. For several years now, letter after \nletter from Republicans and Democrats went to the administration and \nthe Department of Labor, urging them to rethink this rule. \nUnfortunately, you can sign on to all the letters in the world opposing \na rule, but it all means nothing if you are not there to oppose a rule \nwhen it counts--when it comes time to vote. That time is now.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to consider the \nconsequences of this rule on middle-class families and our economy and \njoin me in standing up for the middle class by voting for the \nresolution of disapproval.\n  Mr. President, I particularly want to commend the senior Senator from \nGeorgia for taking the lead on the effort to overturn this unfortunate \nrule. He has been the leader on a variety of different issues that are \nextremely important to his State and to our country, and I commend him \nfor his work on this matter we will be voting on later today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/senate-section/article/S3063-5"}, {"day": "24", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is a new tack here. The Republican \nleader appears to say--doesn't appear to say; it is what he said--that \na rule would require investment advisers to act in the best interests \nof their investors. Is there something wrong with that? I don't see it. \nImagine, Republicans want investment advisers to act in someone else's \ninterests--namely, their own.\n  The reason this came to be is that investment advisers are more \ninterested in how much they can make rather than the people who are \ntrying to acquire some assets in their retirement age. This is widely \naccepted as being important. The only people who oppose it are the \ninvestment advisers who are putting money in their own pockets instead \nof those of the people they represent. They have a fiduciary rule which \nis unwritten--of course, now it will be written--that you should take \nyour clients' interests first, and that is the way doctors have to \noperate, as well as lawyers and accountants. There is no reason that \ninvestment advisers shouldn't also be in a position where they are more \nconcerned about their client rather than themselves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/senate-section/article/S3064-2"}, {"day": "24", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3064-S3065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         NOMINATION OF MERRICK GARLAND AND THE SENATE SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, tomorrow is the 100th day that there has \nbeen a vacancy in the Supreme Court. To his credit, President Obama \ndidn't rush into nominating someone; he took his time and interviewed \nscores of candidates recommended to him by his staff and Senators and \nmany people around the country. So 30 days after the vacancy appeared, \nPresident Obama came forward with Merrick Garland.\n  If ever there were a consensus nominee, Merrick Garland is that. The \nhead of the Judiciary Committee at the time, the senior Senator from \nUtah, said: He is a consensus nomination. Why doesn't the President do \nthat?\n  When the President does, he is suddenly not interested--``he,'' \nmeaning the senior Senator from Utah.\n  For 70 days Senate Republicans have refused to do anything to move \nalong Merrick Garland's nomination. They will not look at Garland's \nquestionnaire or study his record. They will not give him a hearing, \nand they are certainly not going to give him a vote. They are \nabsolutely committed to blocking a vote on this good man. So that is 10 \nfull weeks of Republicans running away from their constitutional duty \nto provide their advice and consent to President Obama's Supreme Court \nnomination.\n  Given Senate Republicans' light work schedule, perhaps it is no \nsurprise that they have not found time to schedule a hearing and a vote \non Merrick Garland. They are never here. News outlets are already \nreporting how little time the Republican Senate will spend in session \nthis year. As one publication, Politico, said a few days ago, ``The \nchamber is on pace to work the fewest days in 60 years.''\n  This is what the Senate calendar looks like for 2016, this schedule \nreleased by the Republican leader. This is it. If you are wondering \nabout these blocked-out days, that is when we are not in session. That \ndoesn't include the rest of the time around here--or, I should say, \nbarely around here. Mondays--the few Mondays that we are in--basically, \nnothing happens on Mondays. We get here and vote at 5:30. Fridays, we \ndon't work. As you can see, once in a while they schedule a Friday, but \nwe don't work on Fridays. We are so desperate to get out of here on \nThursdays that votes are now scheduled at a quarter to 2--not until 2. \nWe all have caucuses, but we can't wait to jump-start it and get out of \nhere at a quarter until 2.\n  As I indicated, we see the blacked-out days. These are recess days, \ndays when the full Senate will not be in session and, of course, not \nworking, not voting. To say we have had a lot of recesses lately is \nkind of an understatement.\n  For example, the Republican Senate has worked just 27 days since \nMerrick Garland was nominated. He was nominated March 16. Remember, on \nMondays we don't do much around here. Thursday afternoons, we don't. So \nwe work Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and half a day on Thursday. That is quite \na schedule. Had the Senate worked on any of these blacked-out days, we \ncould have had a hearing for Merrick Garland, and we could have \nscheduled a vote. We also could have worked on any number of important \nissues Republicans have been ignoring.\n  What about this Zika virus that is such a concern to health officials \naround the world? In March, we worked a little bit but not much. But at \nleast in those days, perhaps we could have done something to fund Zika \nbut, no, still playing around with that over here. A big cheer went up \nwhen a bill was passed, an appropriations bill, and it had in it a \nprovision for Zika. One problem: That legislation will not be approved \nuntil the fall or even the winter. Mosquitoes are now breeding. It is \ngetting warmer. It is going to be 90 degrees in Washington, DC, on \nFriday. But no one on the Republican side seems to be too worried about \nthat.\n\n  We could look again at March. We can pick any month you want, but \nlet's try March. What about Flint, MI? Because of some manipulation by \nthe Governor of the State and others, the people of Flint, MI, suddenly \nwere asked to drink water from a new source. They did not know that \nwater was tainted with heavy volumes of lead. What a shame.\n  I will never forget what I watched on ``PBS NewsHour.'' A mother was \nthere crying, saying: I wanted to have my two children healthy, so they \ncould not drink any soda pop ever. I helped poison my children because \nthey drank the water of Flint, MI.\n  We could have done something about that in March, April. Look at the \nmonths. But we have done nothing. Not a single penny has gone to Flint, \nMI. They are using bottled water.\n  The opioid epidemic--there was a big cheer here: We did something on \nopioids. The problem is that there is no money. As we speak here today, \nin the hour we will take up here on the floor this morning before we \nget to the business of the day, in America about 20 people will die \nfrom opioid overdoses. We should be doing something about that, but we \nare not.\n  The American people have been saying that the Republicans should \nsimply do their jobs, but, as we have seen from the schedule, it is \ndifficult to do your job when you don't bother to show up to work. The \ntheme for this year's Republican Senate should be ``The Republican \nSenate was not in session.'' That quote is from me. Remember, this is\n\n[[Page S3065]]\n\nthe lightest Senate work calendar in some six decades. The Republican \nleader has the Senate on pace for almost no work and for the most days \noff in 60 years.\n  Look at the summer vacation. I think we should be able to get in a \nfew days of leisure during the summer vacation. What do you think? Look \nat it--7 weeks, including the first week in September. Seven \nconsecutive weeks off--the longest summer recess in many decades. The \npopulation of the country has increased in 60 years but not the Senate \nschedule. The problems of the country have increased in 60 years but \nnot the Senate schedule. The Republican leader didn't have to set such \na light schedule. There is no archaic Senate rule that requires the \nworld's greatest deliberative body to go dark for an entire summer. \nThis was his choice.\n  Do we need all this time off in July for the conventions? I don't \nthink so. We have so many Republicans who are saying they are not even \ngoing to the convention. They are embarrassed to be there with Trump, I \nguess. If they are not going to Cleveland, stay here and work.\n  The Senate Republicans have already wasted the last 70 days doing \nnothing on Merrick Garland's nomination. These days are lost. We can't \ngo back to them. But what about the rest of the year? We have all this \ntime to give Judge Garland a hearing and a vote, but we can't consider \nthe nomination if we are not here. The Senate should stay in session \nuntil our work is completed.\n  The President said we shouldn't go home on Thursday. We shouldn't go \nhome until we fund Zika. That is a menace the American people are \nfacing, especially American women. We shouldn't leave town unless we \nfully fund the President's request of $1.9 billion. We should not take \nthis summer off while a vacancy remains on the Supreme Court. The \nRepublican leader should not have this body scheduled to work less than \nany Senate in the last 60 years while so many issues that are important \nto the American people go unresolved.\n  Mr. President, will the Chair announce what the Senate is going to do \nthe rest of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/senate-section/article/S3064-3"}, {"day": "24", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Pursuant to the provisions of the \nCongressional Review Act, 5 USC 801, and following, there will be up to \n10 hours of debate, equally divided between those favoring and opposing \nthe resolution.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, H.J. Res. 88 is exactly the same as the \nresolution of disapproval I introduced in the Senate, but it has \nalready passed the House. So today if we could take a vote and pass it, \nwe could send it to the President, hopefully, for his signature or at \nleast for him to express himself one way or another.\n  There are nine letters in the word ``fiduciary.'' There are 672 pages \nof definitions describing that one 9-letter word. This is a solution in \nsearch of a problem. It is bad for America, bad for our savers, and \nmakes ``too big to fail'' even bigger in America today.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \n461 people of the United States of America who are opposed to this \nbill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                     May 23, 2016.\n       To the Members of the United States Senate: The undersigned \n     associations, chambers of commerce, organizations, and small \n     businesses are writing to express our deep concerns regarding \n     the U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) final rule on the \n     Definition of a Fiduciary. This rule disproportionately \n     disadvantages small businesses and those businesses with \n     assets of less than $50 million, and stifle retirement \n     savings for millions of employees by placing additional \n     burdens on America's leading job creators, small businesses. \n     This will substantially reduce retirement savings for many \n     Americans, and therefore we urge you to support S.J. Res. 33.\n       On April 6, 2016, the DOL issued a final rulemaking that \n     expands what is considered fiduciary investment advice under \n     the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), \n     negatively impacting small business retirement plans and \n     savers with less than $50 million in assets. Through SEP IRAs \n     and SIMPLE IRAs, small business owners and their employees \n     have accumulated approximately $472 billion of retirement \n     savings covering more than 9 million U.S. households. The DOL \n     final rule threatens the continued success of these plans and \n     the ability of small businesses to provide retirement \n     security at a time when millions of Americans have reached or \n     are approaching retirement age. Ultimately, it may even \n     encourage additional saving losses for those who will not be \n     able to access meaningful investment assistance.\n       First, the final rule makes it harder to provide retirement \n     plans to small businesses or any business that has less than \n     $50 million in assets (small plans). The broadened definition \n     of investment advice includes routine communications where no \n     intention to provide individualized fiduciary advice has been \n     expected, such as ``sales'' communications and certain \n     educational materials. However, despite this broad \n     definition, the proposal carves out large plan advisors from \n     this definition. If a fiduciary has $50 million or more in \n     assets, the advisor to that large plan is exempt from being a \n     fiduciary, while an advisor to a fiduciary with less than $50 \n     million in assets, which primarily constitutes small \n     businesses, is not.\n       Because an advisor to plans with less than $50 million are \n     not carved out of the rule, the advisor who is trying to \n     market retirement savings option to a small plan is \n     considered to be providing investment advice and must \n     determine how to comply with the rule. Due to these \n     additional burdens advisors to small plans are likely to \n     incur additional costs, which will be passed on to the plan. \n     Further, some advisors to small plans may be incentivized to \n     no longer offer their services to small plans if they \n     determine that the small-scale of such plans means the \n     expense and risk of changing business models and fee \n     structures is not justified.\n       Second, advisors to small plans must either change their \n     fee arrangement or qualify for a special rule called an \n     ``exemption'' in order to provide services on the same terms \n     as before. The new exemption called the ``Best Interest \n     Contract'' incorporates many new challenging conditions and \n     requirements that would substantially increase costs for \n     advisors that may ultimately get passed down to small plans \n     or small business employees.\n       Finally, the final rule limits investment education to IRA \n     owners, including small business employees participating in a \n     SEP IRA or SIMPLE IRA plan. While advisors are permitted to \n     provide model asset allocations appropriate for IRA owners, \n     they are not permitted to help identify specific funds or \n     investment options that correlate to the model asset \n     allocations. This restriction will make it more challenging \n     for small business employees, and may ultimately deter them \n     from saving for retirement altogether.\n       More complex regulations mean more hurdles and compliance \n     costs and a greater likelihood of litigation. Main Street \n     advisors will have to review how they do business and likely \n     will decrease services, increase costs, or both. Under the \n     final rule, small business SEP IRA and SIMPLE IRA arrangement \n     will become more expensive to serve, meaning that small \n     businesses will ultimately lose access to their advisors and \n     disproportionately bear the costs of excessive regulation. \n     Consequently the DOL's fiduciary rule ultimately harms the \n     very small businesses and workers they are intended to \n     protect. We strongly urge the Senate to take action to help \n     preserve retirement savings for Americans.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I want to read one paragraph from the letter because it \nsays better than anything I could say what is wrong with the fiduciary \nrule that is proposed by the Department of Labor.\n\n       First, the final rule makes it harder to provide retirement \n     plans to small businesses or\n\n[[Page S3066]]\n\n     any business that has less than $50 million in assets. . . . \n     The broadened definition of investment advice includes \n     routine communications where no intention to provide \n     individualized fiduciary advice has been expected.\n\n  It exempts anybody with over $50 million in assets from being applied \nto the rule and includes everybody with under $50 million.\n  The President of the United States has said, as have so many of us on \nthe floor of the Senate, that it is time for us to end too big to fail. \nSince what happened in 2008 to our people and our economy, we know that \nbusinesses get so large, they get unwieldy, and that they get so \nstrong, sometimes the little guy can get crushed. But here is a rule \nthat is proposed to help the little guy, and what does it do? Under the \nlaw, it exempts the big guys if they have $50 million or more in \nassets, but if they have $50 million or less in assets, it imposes 672 \npages of new definitions of fiduciary rules.\n  Again, it is a solution in search of a problem that does not exist.\n  It also has a broad number of restrictions on IRA investment advice \nthat investment adviser can give to an IRA saver. We know there are a \nlot of people around this town, in Washington, who want to end the IRAs \nand put government savings accounts in charge of everybody. This may be \na part of that motivation to drive a fiduciary rule that creates more \ngovernment savings accounts, more government savings programs, and \nfewer decisions the individual can make. The rule singles out the IRA \nfor these new regulations that did not previously apply to them, and \nthat is another reason this is a problem. In fact, to tell you the \nhonest truth, what this bill does is it promotes less advice or no \nadvice at all to a small saver and free exemption under the law to a \nbig company managing their savings.\n  We need to get the American people saving money. We need to get them \nplanning for their future. Let's think about this for a second. We have \na safety net today in America. We have a safety net of housing. We have \na safety net of food stamps. We have rent subsidies. We have SSI \ndisability. We have all kinds of welfare and benefits for people who \nhave fallen through the cracks. Every person who falls through the \ncracks deserves the help of this country, but every person who can save \nfor their future and avoid becoming dependent on the government is \nmoney in the bank for us, and it is money in the bank and freedom for \nthem.\n  To put more restrictions on a small saver, more restrictions on those \nwho provide business to small savers--all we are doing is causing more \npeople to go on the safety net of American Government benefits and less \npeople to provide for themselves.\n  If ever there were one reason and one reason alone that we should \ndisapprove this resolution, it is this: Secretary Perez proposed this \nin 2010 and dropped it because there was so much opposition.\n  They came back with this new proposal in 2016, and they propounded \nthe rule, and the rule is now before us in this 672 pages. But the \nSenate can take the initiative today to join the House in rescinding \nthis rule and recalling this rule and not letting it go into effect.\n  A vote to recall this rule and rescind this rule is a vote for small \nbusiness, a vote for freedom, a vote for equity, and a vote for the \nAmerican people. A vote to reinstate or keep this rule instated is a \nvote against the small guy and for the big corporate financial \ninterests in Washington and New York City. I don't think we want to do \nthat. I think we want Americans saving for themselves--free Americans \ngiving good advice to citizens who invest and seeing to it that every \nAmerican citizen is planning for their future.\n  Today I join the 461 folks who signed this letter to the Senate. I \njoin my 41 colleagues in the Senate who joined me in sponsoring the \nSenate resolution. I join the majority in the House of Representatives \nwho say this rule goes too far. And I plea with each and every Member \nof the Senate, when they vote today, to vote to rescind the fiduciary \nrule propounded by the Department of Labor. Let's send it to the \nPresident, and let's send him a message. If he wants to end too big to \nfail, then let's start passing laws that cause too big to fail not to \nget bigger and instead empower small business, the American people, and \nthe small saver.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes in favor of the resolution of \ndisapproval.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, after a lifetime of hard work, all \nseniors should have the chance to live out their golden years on firm \nfinancial footing and with peace of mind. A secure retirement is also \nimportant to strengthening our Nation's middle class and ensuring that \nour country works for all Americans and not just the wealthiest few, \nbut for too long the deck has been stacked against people trying to \nsave up for their retirement. That is especially true for far too many \npeople seeking retirement advice. Until now, financial advisers and \nbrokers were under no legal obligation to work in their client's best \ninterest, and without this requirement, some financial advisers have \nlined their own pockets by steering clients toward complicated \ninvestments. Some have recommended that retirees make transactions that \ncome with hidden fees and some advisers get a commission when they sell \na financial product, even if it doesn't make sense for the client.\n  We finally have a new protection that would right that wrong. It is \ncalled the fiduciary rule, and it is pretty simple. It says: If you are \ngoing to give people advice on their retirement accounts, you should \nput the client's best interest in front of your own. Unfortunately, we \nare here because Republicans want to block that new rule from helping \nfamilies, and that is just wrong. It is not fair to people all over the \ncountry who are trying to put money away for retirement.\n  Let's understand this new important protection and how it will help \nfamilies. Many Americans are not financially prepared for retirement. \nMiddle-class wages have been stagnant for decades, and it is getting \nharder and harder for people to make ends meet let alone save for their \nretirement. In fact, more than half of Americans have less than $10,000 \nin savings. Households with people between the ages of 55 and 64 only \nhave a little more than $14,000 in their retirement savings account, \nand that is the group of people closest to retirement.\n  Today families need every dollar they save for retirement to count. \nWhen people seek out retirement investment advice, many financial \nadvisers do the right thing and put their clients first. They hold \nthemselves to a higher standard than what the new law currently \nrequires, but some others do not.\n  Take the man who worked for 50 years as an electrical engineer for a \nutility company. His daughter shared his story anonymously, but I think \nit is an important illustration for anyone who wants to save for their \nretirement. The man built a retirement nest egg in stocks and savings. \nWhen he was 80 years old, he sought out advice from a financial \nadviser--someone he thought he could trust. That financial adviser \nrecommended he switch his savings to more complicated investment \nproducts. Those products came with a commission, so the adviser was \npaid with each and every transaction. Those transactions ultimately \nwhittled down the retiree's savings by more than two-thirds--two-thirds \nof his retirement savings. A few years of bad, biased advice from a \nfinancial adviser decimated 50 years of savings.\n  The new fiduciary rule from the Department of Labor would close the \nloopholes that allow brokers and financial advisers to give their \nclients biased advice. Advisers will now make a legally binding \ncommitment to the families they work with. Families today have enough \nto worry about. Questioning the advice they get on their retirement \naccounts should not have to be one of them.\n  Unfortunately, instead of standing up for retirement savers across \nthe country, my Republican colleagues are dead set on saving the status \nquo. Republicans want to roll back this new protection that would help \nretirees keep more of their retirement savings, and they want to make \nsure the Department of Labor can never again create a\n\n[[Page S3067]]\n\nprotection to prevent financial advisers from bilking savers out of \ntheir hard-earned money. We know what the Republicans will say to \ndefend this outrageous position, so let me go ahead and address those \nissues point by point. Contrary to what my Republican colleagues will \nargue, this is a workable solution. The Department of Labor went to \ngreat lengths to create a deliberate process and took the feedback from \nconsumer groups and the financial industry itself to make it easier for \nthem to implement this new rule. Many firms and advisers are already, \nby the way, putting families first, so we know working in the client's \nbest interest can work. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, the Department of Labor absolutely has the authority to create \nthis important protection for families. In 1974, Congress passed the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act, and that law gives the \nDepartment of Labor clear authority to define a fiduciary as it relates \nto retirement savings.\n  Finally, this rule will help savers regardless of how big their \nretirement savings account is. Some of my Republican colleagues are \narguing that financial firms will cut off advice for low- and middle-\nincome savers, but I want to remind my friends across the aisle that \nmany firms have already figured out how to help these so-called small \nsavers, and these firms are doing it while also adhering to the \nfiduciary standard. Republicans say their opposition to the rule is all \nabout helping small savers, but I guarantee these savings are not small \nto these families who rely on that money in their retirement. In fact, \nthey have the most to lose through financial advisers' hidden fees and \ncomplicated financial products with lower returns.\n  It is time we protect these so-called small savers from conflicted, \nbiased advice. Over the years, millions of families have worked hard. \nThey put their money away for retirement and have invested their \nsavings to grow their retirement nest eggs. In short, they have tried \nto do everything right. Unfortunately, some financial advisers have not \nalways done the right thing because they haven't had to, and that needs \nto change, but the resolution the Republicans are offering today would \nbe a major step backward.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this resolution. Instead of attacking \na family's best chance of getting guaranteed, unbiased retirement \nadvice, I hope my Republican colleagues will work with Democrats to \nensure that more seniors can have a secure retirement, expand their \neconomic security, and help our economy grow from the middle out, not \nfrom the top down.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                    Adam Walsh Reauthorization Bill\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak in favor \nof the Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act, which I am pleased to say passed \nthe Senate yesterday. I thank my colleagues Senator Grassley and \nSenator Schumer for their work on this issue.\n  I was proud to be a cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation which \nreauthorizes key provisions of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and \nSafety Act. This bill was named for Adam Walsh, who was abducted from a \nSears department store and murdered when he was just 6 years old. We \nneed to work harder to prevent horrific crimes like this from happening \nagain.\n  In this regard, Federal support is vital to State and local law \nenforcement efforts to make sure sex offenders can be tracked and \nmonitored. This legislation creates a safer environment for our \nchildren by providing needed resources for those on the frontlines. In \nparticular, this legislation assists State and local law enforcement in \nimproving sex offender registries and information sharing and aids them \nin locating and apprehending sex offenders. It also authorizes \nresources for the U.S. Marshals to aid State and local law enforcement.\n  We know sex offenders are not afraid to move across State lines, and \nthat is why it is critical to provide the resources needed to fight to \nkeep our children safe from criminal predators and other influences \nthat are dangerous to their safety and well-being.\n  As a former prosecutor, I know the importance of sex offender \nregistries in equipping our law enforcement officers with every tool \navailable to prevent sex crimes.\n  When I was county attorney for Minnesota's most populous county, I \nsaw firsthand the pain and heartbreak caused by sexual abuse to \nsurvivors and their families. During that time, I made aggressive \nprosecution of those who victimize children a top priority.\n  I wish I could say the tragedy that befell Adam Walsh was an \nisolated, one-time incident, but it is still happening across the \ncountry. Just earlier this month in St. Paul, MN, a 7-year-old girl was \nabducted within 1 minute of being out of her father's sight. That girl \nwas luckier than some. Police found her and arrested her alleged \nabductor within hours of her abduction, but still the scars of the \ntraumatic event will haunt her for the rest of her life.\n  I am hopeful we can come together to prevent these horrible crimes \nand ensure that the Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act becomes law. Now \nthat the Senate passed this commonsense legislation on a bipartisan \nbasis, the House should do the same.\n\n\n                           Export-Import Bank\n\n  Mr. President, I now rise to speak on another topic; that is, my \nstrong support for the Ex-Im Bank--the Export-Import Bank. With the \nleadership of many in this Chamber, including Senators Cantwell, \nHeitkamp, Brown, Graham, and many others on both sides of the aisle, we \nhave worked very hard and were able to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank late \nlast year.\n  Currently, only two of the five Ex-Im Board seats are filled, and \nthat is not functional. As a result, the Ex-Im Board cannot approve \nloan guarantees and other financing tools for medium- and long-term \ntransactions valued in excess of $10 million, and the Board cannot put \nthe reforms in place that were an important part of the reauthorization \nbill. Some of my colleagues who actually voted for this bill--and some \nwho didn't--said it should be reformed and that there should be \nchanges. We put those reforms in place and had it reauthorized. It was \nthe will of the Senate, Congress, and President to get it reauthorized, \nand it was reauthorized, but it still cannot function for any new \ntransactions of any significant size nor can any of the reforms be put \nin place. Why? Because of the dysfunctional situation of only having \ntwo of the five Board seats filled.\n  In January, Mark McWatters was nominated to serve on the Ex-Im Board. \nHe is qualified, and by confirming Mr. McWatters, we can give the Ex-Im \nBank the quorum it needs to support American businesses that want to \nsell products overseas.\n  The Export-Import Bank Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2015, which \nwas included in the Fixing America's Surface Transportation bill, or \nthe FAST Act, included several changes to the existing structure of the \nEx-Im Bank, including risk management policies, fraud controls, and \nethics reforms, as well as promoting exports for small businesses.\n  Under these reforms, small business financing would be increased, \nelectronic document systems would be modernized, the Bank's fraud \ncontrols would be reviewed, and the risk to taxpayers would be reduced. \nBut without a quorum and Board approval, without having this additional \nperson confirmed--the Republican nominee--the Ex-Im Bank is not able to \nadopt the accountability measures or update the loan limits so that \nAmerican businesses have access to the financing they need to compete \nglobally.\n  The governance measures in the Ex-Im Bank reauthorization strengthen \nthe oversight of the Bank's operations and procedures. They would \nestablish the Office of Ethics, headed by a chief ethics officer who \nreports directly to the Ex-Im Bank Board. They would also create a \nchief risk officer and a risk management committee which are designed \nto oversee the Bank's operations, conduct stress tests of the Bank's \nportfolio, monitor exposure levels and review Ex-Im Bank's default rate \nreports. These were all issues that were raised by those who wanted \neither to get rid of the Bank or greatly change the Bank--right? So we \nput a number of these reforms in place.\n  Why didn't we adopt these reforms? Because my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle are not allowing a Republican nominee to get on this \nBoard.\n\n[[Page S3068]]\n\nThat is the definition of dysfunction. These reforms will help the Bank \nfunction better and protect taxpayer resources, which is what my \ncolleagues are wanting to do to protect taxpayer resources, but yet we \ncannot put the reforms in place.\n  The Ex-Im reauthorization also modified certain loan terms and \nincreased the threshold for midterm and long-term financing and for \nsmall business working capital loans and guarantees. The increased \nfinancing amounts will help U.S. businesses access international \nmarkets.\n  When our companies are competing against overseas companies for \ncontracts, they need the Ex-Im Bank. In 2015, the Ex-Im Bank provided \nsupport for $17 billion in U.S. exports--not million, but $17 billion \nin U.S. exports. That is a lot of jobs. That means $17 billion of \nproducts from our country, made in the United States and made by \nAmerican workers.\n  It sounds like a lot. The cap that we have in place now is $135 \nbillion for total outstanding financing. But a recent article in the \nFinancial Times shows that the China Development Bank and the Export-\nImport Bank of China combined had an estimated $684 billion in total \ndevelopment financing. We are out there at $17 billion with a cap of \n$135 billion.\n  We need to make Ex-Im fully functioning so that it can approve all \ndeals just like its counterpart in China, just like our counterparts in \nother developed nations. We also want to put these important reforms in \nplace that many of our friends on the other side of the aisle want to \nsee in place. If we don't, countries like China are going to eat our \nlunch.\n  It is not just China. There are 85 credit export agencies in over 60 \nother countries, including all major exporting countries. Our companies \nare competing against foreign businesses that are backed by their own \ncountries' credit export programs and often receive other government \nsubsidies. Why would we want to make it harder for our own companies--\nAmerican companies--to create jobs right here at home? That is what we \nare doing.\n  We, the Congress, and certainly the President realized that we needed \nto reauthorize the Bank. But now we are not able to function and to put \non simply one more Board member, and we don't have a quorum to make \ndecisions. That Board member is a Republican nominee. If we want a \nlevel playing field for our businesses, we need to have our Export-\nImport Bank open and running.\n  This is about jobs. In 2015, the Ex-Im Bank provided $17 billion in \nfinancing that supported 109,000 U.S. jobs. This is despite the fact \nthat the charter lapsed between July and December of last year, meaning \nthat they literally could only do their work for half the year.\n  We need to make sure that the Ex-Im Bank is able to make small \nbusinesses and American businesses grow and reach markets all over the \nworld.\n  The Ex-Im Bank offers loans, loan guarantees, and export credit \ninsurance. Increased accountability and oversight are needed to make \nsure these programs are strong.\n  Since we reauthorized the Ex-Im Bank, 649 transactions worth $1.8 \nbillion have been approved, supporting hundreds of U.S. small \nbusinesses. These small business owners, such as the many I have met \nwith in Minnesota, told me that the Ex-Im Bank is essential for their \nability to access new and emerging markets all over the world.\n  Balzer is an example of an agricultural equipment manufacturer with \n75 employees and based in Mountain Lake, MN, a town of 2,000 people. \nThey now export 15 percent of the total sales with the help of the Ex-\nIm Bank. Over the past 5 years Ex-Im financing has supported $1.7 \nmillion in exports. But guess what. What if Balzer got bigger and \nbecame a medium-size company wanting to do something over $10 million. \nWhat if they wanted to do something new and get a new bigger loan, but \nthey can't get it approved because we only have two of the five members \non the Ex-Im Bank Board. So we cannot get the new financing approved. \nDo we think they are doing that in China? Do we think they are doing \nthat in any other developed nation where they say: Well, we are just \ngoing to have two of the five people on this Board to do some of the \nwork with some of the smaller companies, which are important, but we \nare not going to be able to do anything when they are competing for a \nmajor contract. That is what we are doing right now.\n  Take Ralco, a small animal feed manufacturer in Marshall, a town of \n13,500. Ralco is a third-generation family business that just \ncelebrated its 45th anniversary. Ralco exports to over 20 countries. \nOver the last 5 years, Ex-Im has provided financing that supports \nnearly $11.7 million in exports for Ralco. If that was just in one \ncontract that was over $10 million in new financing, they wouldn't be \nable to get it approved because of the fact that the Banking Committee \nand this Congress has decided to stall out and approve the Ex-Im Bank \nbut cut off its ability for any major new financing. That is what is \nhappening right now.\n  How about Superior Industries in Morris, MN? Superior manufactures \nbulk-material processing and handling systems. There are 5,000 people \nin this town, and 500 people in Morris work at that company. That is 10 \npercent of the population. Ex-Im has provided financing that supports \nnearly $3.1 million in exports for Superior over the last 5 years.\n  The list goes on. These are not large corporations. These are family \nbusinesses and smaller companies that are essential to the economic \nwell-being of the towns and counties. The Ex-Im Bank helps these small \nbusinesses from all over my State compete and export globally. These \nare success stories, and we need more of them.\n  These are the stories we are hearing from every State. These are the \nstories we want to hear--not the stories that we are now hearing about \ncompanies that are closing down operations or that are laying off \nemployees because they are not able to access the new financing they \nneed to make major deals. They are going to foreign companies whose \ncountries have the foresight and have their act together in their \ngovernments or in their congresses so they don't leave three of five \npositions open on their financing authority boards.\n  Ex-Im has many transactions waiting for Board approval. There are \nabout $10 billion of deals waiting in this pipeline. So when my \ncolleagues talk about creating jobs, there are $10 billion in private \ndeals in the pipeline simply waiting to have one Board member confirmed \nso that we can get this done.\n  The Ex-Im Bank reauthorization passed with broad bipartisan support. \nWe need to confirm J. Mark McWatters and put in place these important \nreforms to start approving transactions so our businesses can export to \nthe world.\n  Usually, people sometimes stall on a confirmation because someone is \nviewed as too extreme or there is some problem with their record. This \nis a Republican nominee to fill a Republican slot on the Board. We need \nto get this done. Our workers, our businesses, and our country are \ncounting on us to get this done.\n  I ask my colleagues to urge the Banking Committee to get this nominee \nthrough or somehow through some other procedural genius way bring this \nto the floor so that we can get this done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Congressional Review Act resolution \nof disapproval is about protecting the right of ordinary Americans to \nretire. That is what this is about.\n  We are trying to stop the Labor Department's so-called fiduciary \nrule, which will restrict access to basic retirement planning advice \nfor all but the wealthiest Americans and will force ordinary Americans \nto go it alone and to try to make the best guess they can about how to \nmanage their money for retirement. Here is how. The administration's \nnew rule updates the rules and requirements for retirement advisers, \nnow requiring them to act as ``fiduciaries.'' That, like many of the \nadministration's rules, sounds good and sounds helpful, but in practice \nit is going to cause great harm.\n  The administration has created new legal liability, and that \nliability is so risky that advisers will only take on that liability \nand risk if they are advising individuals with big assets, so that the \npotential return outweighs the risk. In other words, good retirement \nadvice will be available only to the rich under this rule.\n\n[[Page S3069]]\n\n  We know this because a similar rule was implemented in the United \nKingdom in 2013. The result was that people with smaller savings \naccounts lost access to retirement advice. Many firms quit providing \nface-to-face advice for small accounts. A quarter of all small firms \nwere forced to close shop altogether. The United Kingdom's four largest \nbanks have all raised the minimum levels of assets for clients to \nreceive advice--$80,000 at one bank, $160,000 at another, $355,000 at a \nthird, and $800,000 at a fourth--due to the new rules. So to access \nretirement accounts at the United Kingdom's biggest banks, you have to \nhave at least $80,000 in your account.\n  So what would that look like here in the United States? Well, 77 \npercent of 401(k) balances in the United States are below $80,000, the \nlowest threshold, and 99.2 percent of the 401(k) balances in the United \nStates are below the $800,000 threshold. So if the banks of the United \nStates respond like the United Kingdom's banks did to this rule, we \nmight find that less than 1 percent of Americans will be rich enough to \nreceive retirement advice at one of our Nation's largest banks.\n  We should call this ``Only the Rich Retire'' rule.\n  Americans with smaller retirement savings or Americans who are just \ngetting started saving for retirement are at the greatest risk for \nlosing access to affordable retirement advice. Unless you have at least \n$80,000, you may not be able to get advice. Your small amount may not \nbe worth the liability to the adviser. This will force middle- and low-\nincome Americans to invest on their own without advice. This means they \nmay not save at all or may make poor decisions at critical times like \nmarket downturns. Younger Americans, minorities, and women are the most \nlikely to be hurt. Ninety-five percent of Americans between the ages of \n25 and 34 with 401(k) plans have balances under $80,000. Seventy-five \npercent of Black households and 80 percent of Latino households age 25 \nto 64 have less than $10,000 in retirement savings, compared with 50 \npercent of White households. The median IRA balance is $25,969 for \nAmerican women compared to $81,700 for men. Even left-leaning \neconomists estimate that this rule would cost middle-class Americans as \nmuch as $80 billion in lost savings.\n  The late Chet Atkins, the prominent guitarist from Nashville, said: \n``In life you have to be mighty careful where you aim because you are \nlikely to get there.'' Well, retirement is all about planning. If you \ndon't know how to plan, it is going to be pretty hard to retire. In \nChet Atkins' terms, if you are not able to make a plan, it is hard to \nretire.\n  Retirement planning is complicated. Our tax system is a mess. Most \nworking Americans don't have time to learn about all the financial \nvehicles available for them to save and to understand exactly what \nsteps they must take to have enough money to enjoy life when they end \ntheir careers. This rule comes at a time when many Americans are \nbeginning to save money again after surviving the worst recession since \nthe Great Depression and the slowest recovery since the Great \nDepression. This rule is allegedly to protect individuals from \nmisleading investment advice, but in practice the new rule will make \nretirement planning unaffordable for lower to middle-income Americans \nwhose accounts are not valuable enough for advisers to take on the new \nlegal liability created by this rule.\n  One of the most radical and out-of-touch aspects of the Obama \nadministration's agenda has been its labor policies. Take the overtime \nrule. At colleges, this rule could force students to pay more tuition. \nOne Tennessee college estimates $850 more per student. The President is \nrunning around talking about keeping college costs down. Why is it that \nthis administration is coming out with a rule that would raise tuition \n$850 per student?\n  At workplaces, this overtime rule could result in workers having \ntheir hours and benefits cut, fewer opportunities for advancement, less \nflexibility, and less control over their work arrangements.\n  Then there is the joint employer decision. Through this National \nLabor Relations Board decision, the administration is trying to steal \nthe American dream from owners of the Nation's 780,000 franchise \nbusinesses and from millions of contractors by destroying the franchise \nmodel that has helped so many Americans go from cashier to business \nowner.\n  Then there is ObamaCare. The health care law defines full-time work \nas only 30 hours. That really sounds more like France than the United \nStates. It has forced employers to cut their workers' hours or reduce \nhiring altogether in order to escape ObamaCare's mandate and its \nunaffordable penalties.\n  Then there are micro-unions. This National Labor Relations Board \ndecision will allow collective bargaining units made up of subsets of \nemployees within the same company. It will divide workplaces. It will \nmake it harder and more expensive for employers to manage their \nworkplace and do business.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce noted recently:\n\n       ``The overtime regulation joins the recently finalized \n     fiduciary rule which will reduce the ability of small \n     business to provide retirement benefits; the EEOC's proposed \n     revised EEO-1 form that will explode the burden on employers \n     for reporting compensation by micro-demographics; OSHA's \n     just-released injury reporting regulation that will result in \n     sensitive employer data being posted on the Internet for use \n     by unions and trial lawyers; and the Department of Labor's \n     recently issued `persuader' regulation that is intended to \n     chill the ability of employers to retain competent labor \n     counsel during union organizing campaigns.''\n\n  This retirement rule is only the most recent in a series of actions \nthat make it much harder for employers to add jobs and much harder for \nworkers to climb the economic ladder of opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Mosaic Life Care Investigation\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to address an important \ninvestigation that has produced significant results for low-income \npeople and that the Republican majority in the Senate helped bring \nabout.\n  In late December 2014, news reports indicated that a nonprofit \nhospital chain in Missouri and Kansas, Mosaic Life Care, had been \naggressively suing low-income patients. These news reports further \nindicated that many of these patients qualified for financial \nassistance and were wrongly placed in collection.\n  Let me be clear. Nonprofit hospitals should not be in the business of \naggressively suing their patients. As recipients of a tax-exempt \nstatus, these hospitals have a heightened duty to assist patients in \nqualifying for financial assistance. That means these hospitals must \nimplement a financial-assistance policy where low-income persons \nreceive free- or reduced-cost care. Further, these types of hospitals \nmust assist low-income persons in ensuring that the proper paperwork \nfor government assistance or private insurance is properly filed. In \nessence, because of the favorable tax treatment these hospitals \nreceive, they have a duty to help our Nation's most vulnerable.\n  For these reasons, I began my investigation into Mosaic to determine \nwhat, if anything, went wrong. On January 16 of last year, I sent a \nletter to Mosaic to begin my inquiry. Over the past year, my staff has \nmet with Mosaic representatives, exchanged numerous emails, and had \nmany phone calls to get a better idea of the process at issue. It \nbecame clear that Mosaic was lacking the right number of personnel to \nmanage financial assistance intake.\n  Common sense tells me that when anyone visits a hospital, it is often \na scary event under any condition. When we go to hospitals, it is \ngenerally because something has gone wrong. In that moment of need, we \nput our lives in the hands of professionals to help us get healthy. In \nthose moments of pain and fear, we put our trust in medical \nprofessionals to give us the right care. In other words, we place our \ntrust in the hospital to have hired the right\n\n[[Page S3070]]\n\npeople. And, as normally happens, after treatment is provided, here \ncomes the bill.\n  Again, common sense tells me nothing in life is free. Someone, not \nalways the patient, will always have to pay the bill. It is common \nsense; there is no free lunch. But when it involves low-income persons \nand a nonprofit charity hospital has provided the treatment, that \nhospital should provide some type of financial assistance or help to \nget financial assistance if it is available. That obligation exists \nsimply because of the tax-exempt status.\n  If you want that status of tax exemption, you are supposed to help \nthose who are less fortunate. So when that bill comes, the hospital \nmust ensure that it has people in place to assist the patient in filing \nfor financial assistance if it is available. If the patient doesn't \nhave any coverage, but his or her income is so low that they qualify \nfor free- or reduced-cost care, the hospital should ensure that \npatients know help is available.\n  It is common sense. Employees should explain the process and \npatients' rights. Tax-exempt hospitals cannot be in business to profit \nfrom poor people who may not know what form to file. That is not what \nCongress intended to happen when we created the tax exemption.\n  During the course of my investigation into Mosaic, I made clear that \nthey must have adequate personnel. In response to my overtures, Mosaic \nhas hired seven resource advocates to assist with Medicaid, \nsupplemental assistance, and Social Security disability applications. \nTwo additional financial counselors were reassigned to focus solely on \nassisting patients navigate the financial assistance process. \nImportantly, Mosaic will hire an additional financial counselor \ndedicated to its outpatient clinic. Finally, five patient financial \nservice representatives have been assigned with the duty of ensuring \nthe timely processing of financial assistance applications.\n  These are very important as well as productive steps to take. It just \nmakes sense for a charitable health care institution to help its low-\nincome patients rather than sending debt collectors after them and \nsuing them. It is common sense. You cannot get blood out of a turnip.\n  Further, during the course of my investigation, I made clear that \ncharging interest on accounts prior to final judgment would further \nburden the poor. Nonprofits need to take steps to reduce debt burdens, \nnot increase that debt.\n  In response, Mosaic will no longer charge interest on accounts until \na final court judgment. Further, to provide even more opportunity for \npatients to receive financial assistance, Mosaic has extended its four-\nstatement bill cycle to six. That will allow more opportunities for \npatients to receive notice of their ability to receive financial \nassistance. These steps will help patients in the long run.\n  Again, common sense tells me it is important, and it is important to \nnote that there is a certain amount of self-responsibility to be \naccepted when someone incurs a bill for services rendered. But that \ndoesn't mean hospitals shouldn't lend a helping hand. Just look at any \nMedicare and/or health insurance bill that you get. You know then how \nintimidating that document can be.\n  The changes I just mentioned are not the end of this, however. I wish \nto note a much more profound result. I repeatedly urged Mosaic to look \nat low-income patients already in the collection system or the court \nsystem. Over the course of several months, I urged them to consider \nforgiving their debt when it was obvious that people didn't have the \nincome to pay.\n  In response, Mosaic instituted a 3-month debt-forgiveness period \nrunning from October 1, 2015, to December 31, 2015. Importantly, during \nthis forgiveness period, Mosaic lowered the threshold by which a \npatient could qualify for financial assistance. When a patient was \nalready in collection or already subject to a court judgment, they \ncould apply for debt forgiveness.\n  Mosaic recently informed me of the results of their change of policy. \nThe debt forgiveness program resulted in 5,542 financial assistance \napplications, of which 5,070 were approved. A total of $16.9 million in \ndebt, interest, and legal fees were forgiven. Over 5,000 people no \nlonger have to worry about their debt burden; 5,000 people are free \nfrom the vice grip of almost $17 million.\n  Medical debt is vicious. It is a mental and emotional drain that can \nbring the strongest among us to our knees. For some patients, they will \nnever be able to pay off their debt.\n  Mosaic eventually did the right thing. It deserves credit for that. \nConsidering where I started in this investigation, it probably shocks \nMosaic that I would compliment them. But I speak from the heart that \nwhen they make these changes, they ought to be complimented.\n  Now, thousands of people have a new lease on life, thanks to Mosaic's \nmeeting nonprofit tax-exempt responsibilities. That is where we are \ncoming from. If it hadn't been for the tax exemption and accepting the \nresponsibilities of tax exemption, there would be no way we could \ncomplain about Mosaic.\n  I wish to point out a lesson to all 535 Members of Congress. That is \nwhy oversight is so important. That is why I take my responsibilities \nas chairman of the Judiciary Committee so seriously. Results matter.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time spent in quorum \ncalls be charged equally to both sides during debate in relation to \nH.J. Res. 88.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nsupporting the conflict-of-interest rule that was recently finalized by \nthe Department of Labor. This is a fair and balanced rule that protects \nour Nation's retirees and savers. In fact, it is a rule that makes sure \nthat in the midst of a retirement crisis in this country, where people \nare having a harder and harder time making sure that after working a \nlifetime they have the money they need to retire--it is bringing common \nsense back to that process.\n  I firmly believe that the conflict-of-interest rule should not be a \npartisan issue. That is because this rule comes down to those \nfundamental ideas that really know no party bounds. Again, the idea for \nme is about honor and common sense.\n  By honor, I mean the idea that we are a country that believes every \nAmerican deserves a fair opportunity to succeed. Fairness is at the \ncore of our Nation's ideals--this idea that we are all bound to do what \nwe can to identify and change systems that stack the deck against hard-\nworking families that play by the rules.\n  This body and its history have done so much to level the playing \nfield and make sure that we have a free market and a fair market. It is \nbecause we as a nation value dignity and stand against those who seek \nto exploit or take advantage of others. In fact, we understand that we \nhave an obligation to our country men and women. We have an obligation \nto each other to ensure that there is a level playing field that no one \ncan take advantage of or exploit.\n  We participate in, abide by, and are meant to benefit from this \nsocial contract and understand that a social contract and a vibrant \neconomy are not mutually exclusive. Actually, they reinforce one \nanother.\n  These principles make America exceptional. They empower and embolden \nour free-market economy. They generate strength and security for more \nfamilies. They ensure abundance and allow us to strive for ideals of \nlife, liberty, and the ability to pursue happiness. So I believe we are \nhonor bound to uphold these principles, to ensure fairness and \nopportunity for all. We also must understand that fairness is a key \ningredient in broad-based economic growth and strength.\n\n  When I talk about common sense, I mean people have a reasonable \nexpectation, in a free market, to be treated fairly and justly, \nespecially in those areas that are most critical to their lives. It is \nrational, therefore, and just common sense, for us to insist that when \nwe are treated by a doctor, that the doctor is going to place the \ninterest of our health over their own financial interests. It is \nunderstandable that when we go to see a doctor, what is paramount is \nwhat is in our best interest. It is also understandable that we\n\n[[Page S3071]]\n\nhave that standard when it comes to the law; and, when we seek legal \ncounsel, we are right to expect our lawyers to act in our best \ninterest. That is the standard for doctors and for lawyers, for our \nhealth and well-being and for those legal decisions that will affect \nour lives profoundly.\n  When we seek advice on an issue as serious as our health, our \nlivelihoods, and our finances, we expect to be treated with the highest \nstandards of care, and those professionals--those lawyers or doctors--\nshouldn't in any way be inhibited in their ability to make a \nlivelihood. Indeed, in many cases, they should flourish.\n  While the vast majority in the financial industry are strong advisers \nwho put the interests of their clients first, the challenge we have \nright now is that unlike doctors and lawyers, those financial advisers \nare not required to put the interest of their clients at the high level \nof a fiduciary standard. As a result of not having that same high \nstandard of care as doctors and lawyers, there are some within that \nindustry who actually take advantage of families trying to plan for \ntheir retirement.\n  A large money market manager recently said: ``As active equity \nmanagers we have all been on the hook lately to justify our value \nproposition. And we should be, since the facts clearly show that as an \nindustry, we have not consistently provided the performance that \ninvestors deserve.''\n  Here are folks who have incredible financial knowledge, \nsophistication, and acumen talking to everyday Americans and putting \nforth this idea that they are going to help them retire with security, \nbut they have no obligation to do what is in their best interest, to \nuphold the highest standard of care. That is problematic, and industry \nleaders understand that. They understand we cannot allow space for \nthose who might seek to exploit families, struggling to retire, for \ntheir own financial interest.\n  It is this idea that is at the root of the conflict-of-interest \nrule--the idea that hard-working Americans saving for retirement \ndeserve to be treated with fairness, with honor, and with a mutual \nobligation Americans should have toward each other, so that if they \nseek advice from a financial adviser, they deserve to get advice that \nprioritizes their needs above all others. This is about fairness. This \nis about common sense.\n  I was proud to stand with the Secretary of Labor, Secretary Perez, \nand my colleagues Senator Warren and Senator Murray when this final \nrule was announced. I am proud that prior to that, the rule went \nthrough a very lengthy and diligent process that allowed for robust \nfeedback from all types of stakeholders. Throughout the rulemaking \nprocess, the Department of Labor demonstrated patience and \ninclusiveness of all perspectives, and, most of all, an unyielding \ncommitment to protecting our Nation's workers and retirees--protecting \nthe bedrock of our country and the very idea of the middle class; that \nif you work hard and play by the rules, you can retire with security \nand dignity.\n  The result of all the work of the Department of Labor and their \ncommitment to this ideal is a fair and balanced rule based on the ideas \nof common sense and honor. The fact is, for so many Americans, it could \nnot come at a more important time. In fact, it could not come at a more \nurgent time. We have a retirement crisis in our country. So many people \nare working harder and harder but are finding themselves with more \nmonth at the end of their money than money at the end of their month.\n  Many people are finding it harder and harder to save for retirement. \nIn fact, right now one in three aren't saving for retirement. The \nFederal Reserve found that a whopping 47 percent of Americans don't \nhave the savings to even cover a $400 emergency expense. Since the \nfinancial crisis, retirement readiness for the average American has \nactually decreased.\n  Families are seeing greater challenges now in securing their own \nfuture. They are seeing greater difficulties securing the American \ndream of being able to work hard, play by the rules, and retire with \ndignity and security. I know this personally, and my office does \nbecause we hear from constituents all the time about their real \nstories, not just of the difficulties of planning for retirement but in \ndealing with a financial industry that often takes advantage of their \nclients.\n  Last year I heard from one of my constituents in Lakewood who wrote \nto tell me about his mother. After losing her husband, she went to seek \nadvice from a financial adviser to help her sort out her finances and \nplan for her retirement. She put her trust and her livelihood in the \nhands of this adviser, but the conflicted advice she received ended up \ncosting her tens of thousands of dollars.\n  Saving for retirement is stressful. At kitchen tables in every town, \nevery city across the country, families are struggling to figure out \nhow best to save for retirement, and here was an adviser who provided \nconflicted advice, costing my resident in Lakewood tens of thousands of \ndollars because they trusted and relied on the fact that the advice the \nfinancial retirement adviser was giving them was in their best \ninterest. This is wrong, and it is unfair.\n  Especially for those Americans who don't have much to begin with, the \nway they manage their retirement savings means so much. Huge gulfs \ncontinue to persist in retirement savings between men and women, the \npoor and the wealthy, and minority families and their White peers. This \nis a problem for all Americans, from all different backgrounds. It is a \ncrisis in our country.\n\n  For so many Americans, in regard to this rule, there is so much at \nstake. Good advice from a retirement adviser can make a world of \ndifference. In fact, it can be the difference between security and \nfinancial crisis. It can be the difference between retiring with ease \nversus retiring with stress and dependence. That is why the advice of a \ntrusted retirement professional is so important.\n  There are many good actors in this space who know that increased \ntransparency, increased accountability, and the idea of profitability \ndon't need to be mutually exclusive. In fact, there are people making \nextraordinary livings in this space by doing the right thing for their \nclients. Honest, hard-working brokers know that updating the standards \nexpected of retirement advisers is common sense, fair, and it actually \nhelps America as a whole become stronger.\n  That is why industry leaders are already making changes to prepare \nfor this rule's implementation and why the CEO of a major money \nmanagement firm recently implored his industry colleagues by saying: \nLet's not lose sight of why clients engage us in the first place: to \nhelp them save the money they need to buy a house, send their kids to \ncollege, retire comfortably and meet any other long-term financial \ngoals they have.\n  This CEO is 100 percent right, and I am happy many companies are \nbeginning to ensure their retirement plans make the most of their \nemployees' savings. According to a recent Wall Street Journal report, \nthe administrative cost of retirement plans fell to their lowest level \nin a decade in 2015 and with this rule, they will continue to fall.\n  The needle is moving in the right direction. To attempt to block this \nrule now would be a step backward, and it would send a message to hard-\nworking Americans and retirees that they simply don't matter enough to \nthis body; that this body cares more about special interests than hard-\nworking families. It cares more about financial advisers on Wall Street \nand their ability to exploit middle-class Americans than it does those \nmiddle-class Americans who believe in the American dream that is being \nput at risk. To not support this rule would be to roll back what we all \nknow; that we can create a win-win and a fair economy that doesn't \nexploit people who are vulnerable but uplifts them, where both \nfinancial adviser and middle-class retirees can have success. I know \nmen and women in our country--and many who serve here--who know and \nunderstand the challenges of planning for retirement.\n  Look, on the day this rule was announced earlier this year, I \nunderstood some people would try to fight this, and I turned to the \nfolks listening and said: Look, this fight is not over. We are going to \nhave to continue. Let us as a nation fight for what is right, not for \nthe special interests of the wealthy few. Let's not allow people to \nfeast upon the retirement savings from the hard work of others, but \nlet's fight to affirm the middle-class dream in America. Let's fight to \nmake sure we are\n\n[[Page S3072]]\n\ndoing right by folks. Let's create a level playing field.\n  This is a fight for people like the constituent of mine who not only \nlost her husband but too much of her savings and now is trying to pick \nup the pieces. This fight is not over for hard-working families across \nthis country who are diligently saving for retirement and for whom \nthese hidden fees, unfortunately, threaten to undermine decades of hard \nwork. These hidden fees are insidious. These hidden fees allow some \nadvisers to exploit people for their own enrichment. These hidden fees \nare un-American.\n  We must continue to make sure those hard-working advisers who provide \nexemplary levels of service, who prioritize their clients' interests, \nare the ones being elevated in this fairer system and not being \nmaligned by those few bad actors who feast upon the savings of other \npeople.\n  This fight has to be about what it means to be an American. That is \nwhat this body did when it passed the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act 40 years ago. We believed in the idea that America is a \nplace where if you work hard and you play by the rules, you can retire \nwith dignity and don't have to worry that your doctor or your lawyer or \nyour financial adviser will exploit you and thrust you into insecurity \nor worse.\n  This is what we must do in this body now. In the spirit of past \nactions, we must put the interest of our middle-class constituents \nfirst, plain and simple. This rule is fair. This rule is balanced. This \nrule helps our free market economy. This rule ensures that the highest \nstandard will be applied to something as precious and fundamental as \nour retirement savings. It preserves honor in this business. It \npreserves honor for America. The needle has already moved forward. We \ncannot afford to go back.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n\n\n                  National Defense Authorization Bill\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we will be voting on something known \naround here as the fiduciary rule, which the Senator from New Jersey \njust spoke on, and later we will be voting on inspection of catfish.\n  Now, people might wonder, as significant as those two issues are, why \nwe are not dealing with the Defense authorization bill that Senator \nMcCain has been pressing our Democratic friends to allow us to get \nstarted with. For my money, there is simply nothing more important for \nthe Congress to do than to make sure our men and women in uniform have \nthe support and the resources and the training they need in order to \nfight our Nation's fights and win our Nation's wars. But because of the \nobjection of the Democratic leader yesterday, here we are.\n\n  I have to say to my friend, the Senator from New Jersey, talking in \nsupport of this fiduciary rule that was created by Dodd-Frank, to me, \nthis just exemplifies this paternalism which has typified this \nadministration when dealing with the economy. They don't actually \nbelieve consumers know how to make good choices for themselves, so they \nare going to force a Federal regulation and rule and a one-size-fits-\nall standard on the financial services industry.\n  I have to say that I don't think it is any coincidence that our \neconomy grew at one half of 1 percent last quarter. That is pathetic \neconomic growth, and it is simply not fast enough for our economy to \ncreate jobs in order to allow people to work full time instead of part \ntime and for those who have left the labor force to join the labor \nforce and to provide for their families and pursue their dreams. But it \nis unfortunately typical of the regulatory approach of the Obama \nadministration, which I think helps strangle the economy and economic \nrecovery.\n  Economists and many people much more knowledgeable than I have said \nthat after the 2008 fiscal crisis, we should have seen a bounce, a V-\nshaped bounce. We hit bottom; we should have bounced back up. \nUnfortunately, we have been at a very flat recovery--if you can call it \nmuch of a recovery--since 2008, primarily because people are in doubt \nwhether their plans for small business, medium-sized business, or large \nbusiness, for that matter, will be put in political peril because of \nthe uncertainty of the regulatory approach of the Obama administration. \nThat is why we need to disapprove this fiduciary rule and to get the \ngovernment out of the way, particularly when it comes to people who \nchoose their own financial advisers. It is just another example of the \nwet blanket the regulatory approach of the Obama administration has \nbeen on the economy in general--just one small example.\n  As I said at the outset, we should be talking about the national \ndefense authorization bill, which passed out of the Armed Services \nCommittee with overwhelming bipartisan support. Only three members of \nthe Armed Services Committee voted against it. But rather than be \ndebating that, here we are.\n  We should be talking about and voting on the Defense authorization \nbill because of obviously how important it is to our country's safety \nand security. As I mentioned, it provides our military the funding and \nauthorities they need in order to protect and defend us, and it ensures \nthat our warfighters are equipped for success on the battlefield.\n  The President's senior adviser, Ms. Valerie Jarrett, claimed recently \nthat President Obama had ended two wars and that this was part of his \nlegacy. I am wondering which wars she was referring to because, \nfrankly, the world is on fire. The Director of National Intelligence, \nJames Clapper, has said that never in his long career--and I think it \ngoes back 50 years or more--in the intelligence community has he seen a \nmore diverse and a more threatening environment. We know we have \nconventional threats like a newly emboldened Vladimir Putin threatening \nEurope and the NATO alliance there. Then we have terrorist groups like \nISIS, the Islamic State, which has morphed from Al Qaeda--the radical \nreligious ideology which has told them that in the name of their \nreligion, they can murder innocent men, women, and children.\n  A few weeks ago I had the chance to travel with some of my colleagues \nfrom the House side to visit some of our troops stationed in the Middle \nEast. It was obviously an honor to visit with those serving our country \nso selflessly in remote parts of the world, where they are separated \nfrom their families and putting service to country above self. We had a \nchance to visit the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet in Bahrain and the \nMultinational Force & Observers, the MFO, an international peacekeeping \ngroup at the North Camp in the Sinai Peninsula. Quite a few members of \nthe Texas National Guard served there until they ended their tour just \nrecently. In meeting with those folks on the ground and learning more \nabout the situation, one thing is clear: The Middle East continues to \nbe a region racked by instability and violence at every turn.\n  I have previously spoken about how the imprudent drawdown of U.S. \ntroops in Iraq without getting a status of forces agreement, which \nwould have allowed a larger U.S. presence there, much as we had after \nthe war in Germany, in Japan, and elsewhere, where we frankly have seen \nthriving economies and stable countries spring up after the wake of \nterrible wars--unfortunately, President Obama did not see that as a \npriority. And because of the precipitous drawdown in Iraq, a power \nvacuum was left.\n  If there is one thing we should have learned on 9/11, it is that \npower vacuums are breeding grounds for terrorists, and that is as true \ntoday as it was back then.\n  So now the Islamic State--the latest iteration of Islamic extremism--\nhas carved out a safe haven in Iraq and Syria, virtually wiping off the \nmap the border between those two countries, and it continues to grow in \nnorth Africa and the Middle East. The terrorist group's influence in \nthe region couldn't be clearer.\n  As I mentioned, on the Sinai Peninsula, I had a chance to visit with \nsome of our soldiers about the threats they face from ISIS-affiliated \ngroups every day, including the use of improvised explosive devices by \nsome of the groups who have now pledged allegiance to the Islamic \nState.\n  Back in March, it was reported that an ISIS-linked group killed more \nthan a dozen of Egypt's security forces in the Sinai, and unfortunately \nthat carnage continues.\n  There is no doubt that ISIS is continuing to work against U.S. \ninterests and against our allies, targeting not\n\n[[Page S3073]]\n\nonly Egyptian forces in this instance but, at times, U.S. forces on the \nground as well.\n  Unfortunately, ISIS has taken advantage of a power vacuum left in \nLibya after the President led a coalition to topple Libyan strongman \nMuammar Qadhafi and unfortunately created another power vacuum there \nwhich continues to this day. We would have thought we would have \nlearned something from our experience in Iraq, but apparently President \nObama did not because he had no real plan for a post-Qadhafi Libya, no \nplan and no strategy in place on how to move forward afterward. As I \nsaid, now Libya is a failed state and a breeding ground for ISIS.\n  In Tunisia, we actually had the chance to visit with the U.S. \nAmbassador to Libya. Unfortunately, as the Ambassador and his country \nteam said, we haven't actually been to Libya. They are literally an \nembassy in exile in Tunisia but doing the best they can to try to \nfigure a way forward in Libya.\n  One thing we know for sure is that Libya plays host to an increasing \nnumber of ISIS fighters. Some even estimate that the ranks of ISIS have \ndoubled in Libya in the past year alone. Left unchecked, this ISIS safe \nhaven in Libya, a country which is obviously strategically located \nacross the Mediterranean from Europe, where it is pretty easy passage \nup into the EU, movement around the EU and then in countries--38 \ncountries in total have visa waiver agreements with the United States, \nand people can travel to the United States from those countries without \na visa. But this jumping-off point in Libya to Europe and then to other \nplaces is a real threat and provides another base from which ISIS can \ncontinue to terrorize and target the United States and our friends and \npartners.\n  As I mentioned, we were able to travel to Tunisia and visit with the \nrelatively newly democratically elected President there. Tunisia touts \nitself as one of the rare success stories of the Arab spring--maybe the \nonly success story--but their hold on the country is enormously \nfragile, primarily because the terrorist threat has killed the tourist \nactivity that has been part of the economic lifeblood of that beautiful \ncountry right on the Mediterranean Sea in north Africa. Unfortunately, \nTunisia is seeing an influx of its own citizens traveling to Libya to \njoin ISIS, and today Tunisia remains one of the major sources of \nforeign fighters for this terrorist army.\n  After its campaign of rape and genocide against the Yazidis, \nChristians, and Shia Muslims, ISIS continues to expand across north \nAfrica and the Middle East, all the while working against U.S. \ninterests, not only in the region by inciting violence and terrorist \nattacks but also in Europe and in places like San Bernardino, CA.\n  Of course, our military serves in dangerous places all over the \nworld, as do other people who bravely serve in a civilian capacity with \nour intelligence community and others. Today the threats extend all the \nway from an aggressive Russia, as I mentioned earlier, to NATO's \ndoorstep, to an increasingly belligerent China in the South China Sea--\na topic the President, no doubt, is discussing during his visit in \nHanoi--and then there are the repeated unchecked provocations of North \nKorea. These are all areas marked by volatility and unpredictability.\n  Given these threats, given this danger, given this need, we would \nthink there would be bipartisan support for doing our work here and \nactually debating and voting on the Defense authorization bill.\n  The bottom line is that our military men and women must be prepared \nfor all potential contingencies, and the Defense authorization bill is \nour chance here in Congress to make sure they have the training and \nequipment to do just that.\n  It is pretty clear that the administration's disengagement around the \nworld over the last 7 years has not been working, and I have been \nsaying that for some time. But the Defense authorization bill we will \nmove to tomorrow is an opportunity for Congress to provide for our \ntroops to the greatest extent possible and ensure that they are ready \nto face all of these threats. The Defense authorization bill would \nauthorize resources to fight ISIS and to counter Russian aggression and \nshore up U.S. and NATO capabilities.\n  As we begin this debate and discussion, let's keep at the forefront \nof the conversation the men and women who are out there in harm's way \nfacing these myriad of threats, separated many times from their family \nand their community and their friends, and let's work in good faith to \nget this bipartisan bill passed as soon as we can.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, last month the Department of Labor laid \nout new safeguards that will help middle-class savers in a rule \npertaining to advice given by financial advisers. Today the Senate has \ntaken up a resolution of disapproval that will undo that progress. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose it. The Senate ought to be doing \neverything it can to help middle-class workers save for retirement. \nInstead, this resolution would go in the opposite direction.\n  Workers from Oregon and across the Nation are facing a savings \ncrisis. Fewer and fewer people have access to the type of simple, \nreliable pensions that were once commonplace. The ``Leave it to \nBeaver'' ideal of getting a family-wage job, working your way up in a \ncompany, and retiring with a pension and a gold watch is not the \nprospect in front of many American workers today.\n  For most Americans, the road to retirement now takes many more twists \nand turns. The burden of figuring out how to save, which seems to get \ntougher all the time, often falls directly on the workers themselves. \nFirst come the tough questions, and they come right up front: when to \nstart saving, how much to set aside, when to retire, and how much to \ndraw down each month. What happens if you outlive your savings? You \nhave to study the markets, stocks and bonds, mutual funds, exchange-\ntraded funds, index funds. You have to decide what kind of risks you \ncan afford to take on. It is even complicated for employers who have to \npick from a long list of different kinds of retirement plans: 401(k)s, \nSIMPLE IRAs, SEPs, employee stock ownership plans, stock bonus plans--\nto name just a few.\n  It should come as no surprise to anybody that Americans frequently \nturn to financial planners to help figure out these issues. It is my \nview that the overwhelming majority of these advisers are honest \nindividuals who act in the best interest of their clients, but without \nmodern protections in place, some bad actors, unfortunately, choose to \npush their clients toward products with higher fees and lower returns. \nIt could mean the loss of tens of thousands of dollars from a \nretirement account over a lifetime of savings.\n  To be clear, this is not some kind of esoteric issue that hardly \nanybody faces. It is a very substantial drain on middle-class savings. \nOne estimate by the Council of Economic Advisers said that conflicts of \ninterest in retirement advice cost Americans $17 billion every single \nyear. That is where the Labor Department's new rule comes in. The rules \npertaining to fiduciary investment advisers who act solely in the \ninterest of their clients date back to 1975. Obviously, in the more \nthan 40 years since then, there have been very large changes in the \nretirement world. Many more 401(k)s, fewer professionally managed \npension funds, and many more individuals and employers--especially \nsmall employers--lean on advisers for help determining how to invest \ntheir funds.\n  It seems to me the law ought to be modernized to reflect those \nchanges. The new rule seeks to lay out modern safeguards that are going \nto help protect middle-class savers and small business owners. What it \nsays is that going forward, all retirement savers will be able to get \nadvice that is in their best interest. It is a simple principle. My \nhope is, policymakers on both sides of the aisle will give it strong \nsupport.\n  It is important to recognize that the Labor Department made a number \nof changes based on legitimate concerns\n\n[[Page S3074]]\n\nthat were raised as this rule came together. For example, last summer I \nwrote a letter to Secretary Perez with a number of my colleagues from \nthe Senate Finance Committee that flagged a number of issues, asking \nthe Secretary to ensure that any final rule would work effectively. As \nI said--a group of us Democratic members on the Senate Finance \nCommittee--there were a number of issues that we thought needed a bit \nmore work.\n  I am pleased to see that the Secretary took many of our suggestions. \nFor example, our Senate Finance Committee letter highlighted the \nimportance of a smooth transition to the new rule, and the Secretary \nactually took steps that included an extended implementation period. \nInstead of finding fresh approaches to help Americans prepare for \nretirement, colleagues on the other side have brought forward a \nresolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act that \nwould, in effect, block these new protections. In the 20 years since it \nbecame law, there has only been one successful disapproval resolution \nunder the Congressional Review Act. Under no circumstances should this \nextreme tool be used to make it harder for middle-class Americans to \nget sound retirement advice.\n  We have a situation where the rules of the road date back for more \nthan 40 years. The bottom line is that we ought to come together and \nupdate those rules so we can protect our small businesses, the middle \nclass, and build a stronger ethic of saving in America. That is what \nthis is all about.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose the resolution of \ndisapproval.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         IHS Accountability Act\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, if you asked Native Americans in my home \nState of South Dakota how they felt about the Indian Health Service, \nyou would be hard pressed to find a positive review. Indian Health \nService patients in the Great Plains area, which encompasses North \nDakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Iowa, have been receiving \nsubstandard medical care for years. Too often, clean exam rooms appear \nto be a luxury for South Dakota's Native American patients. Dirty \nfacilities and dirty, unsanitized equipment are common, and patient \ncare is often slipshod at best.\n  One health service facility was in such disarray that a pregnant \nmother gave birth on a bathroom floor without a single medical \nprofessional nearby, which shockingly wasn't the first time this had \nhappened at this facility. Another patient at the same facility who had \nsuffered a severe head injury was discharged from the hospital mere \nhours after checking in, only to be called back later the same day once \nhis test results arrived. The patient's condition was so serious that \nhe was immediately flown to another facility for care.\n  A patient at Pine Ridge Hospital in Pine Ridge, SD, was discharged \nfrom the emergency department and died from cardiac arrest 2 hours \nlater. An investigation by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices found that the patient had failed to receive an adequate \nevaluation before his discharge.\n  The situation in South Dakota has gotten so bad that there is a real \nchance the Federal Government will terminate its Medicare provider \nagreements with--as of yesterday--three Indian Health Service \nfacilities in my State.\n  Yesterday, my office was notified that yet a third IHS emergency \ndepartment in the Great Plains area had been found in violation of \nMedicare's conditions of participation. In other words, these three \nemergency departments have been delivering such a poor level of care \nthat the government isn't sure it can trust them to care for Medicare \npatients. The associate regional administrator for the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services noted that the problems at this third \nhospital are ``so serious that they constitute an immediate and serious \nthreat to the health and safety of any individual who comes to your \nhospital to receive services.'' To describe the level of care at Indian \nHealth Service facilities as substandard is an understatement. The \ngovernment is failing in its treaty responsibility to our tribes.\n  I have been working on legislation to increase accountability and \nimprove patient care at the Indian Health Service. Last week, my friend \nand colleague from Wyoming, who chairs the Indian Affairs Committee \nhere in the Senate, and I introduced our bill, the IHS Accountability \nAct. Our bill takes a number of important steps to start the process of \nreforming the Indian Health Service.\n  First, we create an expedited procedure for firing senior leaders at \nthe agency who aren't doing their jobs. The Indian Health Service has \nsuffered from mismanagement problems for years. To name just one \nexample, the Indian Health Service settled an $80 million lawsuit with \nunions that came about because IHS could not manage the basic \nadministrative task of dealing with overtime pay. The money that IHS \nused to settle this lawsuit was, in part, from funds that should have \nbeen used for patients. Some $6.2 million alone came from money \noriginally destined for IHS facilities in the Great Plains area.\n  Unfortunately, the Indian Health Service frequently responded to \nmismanagement by shifting staff between positions and offices instead \nof simply firing incompetent staff. We are not going to clean up the \nagency's problems that way.\n  If a member of the Indian Health Service's leadership is standing in \nthe way of providing quality care to patients, then that person needs \nto find another line of work. The bill I drafted with my colleague from \nWyoming will help make sure that happens. Our bill also streamlines the \nhiring process at IHS and ensures that tribes will be consulted when \nthe agency is hiring for important positions. This will help IHS get \ndedicated, high-quality employees on the job faster.\n  Our bill also addresses the problem IHS has had in retaining quality \nemployees. A provision in our bill gives the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, which oversees the Indian \nHealth Service, increased flexibility to reward employees for good \nperformance and to set the kinds of salaries that will keep good \nemployees on the job longer.\n  Finally, our bill directs the Government Accountability Office to \nreview the whistleblower protections that are currently in place at IHS \nand determine whether we need to add any additional layers of \nprotection.\n  One of the obstacles to improving care for our tribes has been less-\nthan-honest reporting from the Indian Health Service. Time and again we \nfound that conditions on the ground have not matched up to information \nreported to Congress.\n\n  On December 4, 2015, for example, officials from the Indian Health \nService stated that a majority of the concerns at the floundering \nRosebud Hospital in Rosebud, SD, had been addressed or abated. Yet mere \nhours later, I was informed that the Rosebud Hospital emergency \ndepartment was functioning so poorly that emergency patients would be \ndiverted to other hospitals beginning the next day. As of today, it has \nbeen 171 days since that emergency department was placed on diverted \nstatus--171 days. Clearly, the issues at Rosebud had not been addressed \nor abated on December 4.\n  In 2014, I requested a status update on the Great Plains area from \nthe then-Acting Director of the Indian Health Service. In her response, \nshe stated: ``The Great Plains Area has shown marked improvement in all \ncategories,'' and ``significant improvements in health care delivery \nand program accountability have also been demonstrated.'' Yet we \ncontinue to receive frequent reports of abysmal patient care.\n  I am pretty sure that sending a man home with bleeding in his brain \nand having a mother give birth prematurely on a bathroom floor are not \nsigns of significant improvement. Having a realistic picture of what is \ngoing on in Indian Health Service facilities is absolutely essential if \nwe hope to start improving the standard of care that our tribes \nreceive, and that is why\n\n[[Page S3075]]\n\nwhistleblower protections are so important.\n  Our bill will help make sure that the system protects those who come \nforward to expose the problems facing patients.\n  I am proud of the bill that my colleague and I have introduced, and I \nhope the Senate will take it up in the near future. While this is an \nimportant step, it is still just the first step. I will continue to \nconsult with the nine tribes in South Dakota and with others to see \nwhat additional steps we need to take to fix the problems at the Indian \nHealth Service once and for all. Our tribes deserve better than what \nthey have been receiving, and I am not going to rest until all of our \ntribes are getting the quality care they deserve.\n\n\n                      Aviation Safety and Security\n\n  Madam President, before I conclude, I wish to take a minute to talk \nabout some aviation security issues that were brought into sharp relief \nby the recent crash of an Egyptair flight.\n  Last week, 66 people died when Egyptair flight 804 from Paris, \nFrance, to Cairo, Egypt, crashed into the Mediterranean Sea off the \nEgyptian coast. With investigators still recovering evidence, it is too \nsoon to come to any conclusions as to the cause of this tragic \naccident, but with the absence of evidence indicating an obvious \ntechnical failure, U.S. and Egyptian officials have suggested terrorism \nas a potential cause of the crash even without a credible claim of \nresponsibility from any group.\n  Given the global risk environment and previous acts of terror, \ninvestigators are focusing their attention on anyone who may have had \naccess to the Egyptair aircraft while it was sitting on the ground, \nincluding baggage handlers, caterers, cleaners, and fuel-truck workers.\n  At the Senate Commerce Committee, we have been very focused on this \ntype of aviation safety and security issue over the last year.\n  In December of 2015, the committee advanced legislation to address \ninsider threats posed by airport workers and enhanced vetting of \nairline passengers. As the Senate took up the FAA Reauthorization Act \nof 2016, we engaged in a constructive and open process to consider \namendments. Ultimately, the Senate adopted a number of aviation \nsecurity amendments, including a security amendment that I cosponsored \nwith Commerce Committee Ranking Member Nelson, Senator Ayotte, and \nSenator Cantwell that would strengthen security at international \nairports with direct flights into the United States.\n  The amendment added a security title to the FAA bill that included \nlegislation marked up in the Commerce Committee, as well as other \ninitiatives. Among other things, the amendment requires TSA to conduct \na comprehensive risk assessment of all foreign last-point-of-departure \nairports--foreign airports with direct flights to the United States. \nThe amendment also requires TSA to develop a security coordination \nenhancement plan with domestic and foreign partners, including foreign \ngovernments and airlines, and to conduct a comprehensive assessment of \nTSA's workforce abroad. It also authorizes TSA to help foreign partners \nby donating security screening equipment to foreign last-point-of-\ndeparture airports and to assist in evaluating foreign countries' air \ncargo security programs to prevent any shipment of nefarious materials \nvia air cargo. These provisions are similar to those of H.R. 4698, the \nSAFE GATES Act of 2016, and, together with the other security \nprovisions adopted, take concrete steps to confront the real terrorist \nthreat that we are facing.\n\n  I believe these provisions in the FAA reauthorization bill will help \nmake air travel from foreign countries to the United States safer and \nmore secure. The Senate passed this legislation in April, and now it is \ntime for the House of Representatives to act. The House of \nRepresentatives should take up our FAA bill without delay so that we \ncan get a final bill with timely security and safety reforms onto the \nPresident's desk before the summer State work period.\n  Every day countless terrorists are plotting their next attack against \nthe United States. There are measures we can take today that will help \nmake Americans safer at home and while traveling from destinations \nabroad. Several of those measures are included in the FAA bill that we \npassed with over 90 votes in the U.S. Senate.\n  I call again on the House of Representatives to take up this bill so \nthat we can continue our work to keep Americans safe.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/senate-section/article/S3065-3"}, {"day": "24", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in favor of the Congressional \nReview Act resolution regarding the Department of Labor's new fiduciary \nrule. This resolution, which provides Congress with an opportunity to \nexpress its disapproval with the administration's regulations, is \nimportant for a number of reasons.\n  On the substance, DOL's new rule is extremely problematic. As a \nnumber of my colleagues have already attested, the rule, on its face, \nwould unnecessarily impose a new set of regulations under the \nEmployment Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA, on a greatly \nexpanded number of people.\n  Under current law, brokers and dealers who provide services to \nretirement plans are already heavily regulated. They are not \nautomatically considered labor law fiduciaries, and, therefore, they \nare not subject to the increased liability provided under ERISA. \nInstead, these service providers are subject to regulations issued by \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission to protect investors from fraud \nand to ensure transparency.\n  Under the new DOL rule, virtually any broker who provides investment \nadvice of any kind to individuals regarding their individual retirement \naccounts, or IRAs, will be considered a pension plan fiduciary, subject \nto higher standards and greater liability.\n  As my colleagues have aptly noted, this rule will reduce the \navailability of investment advice for retirees and make the advice that \nis available more expensive, which will have a disproportionately \nnegative effect on low- and middle-income retirees. Higher costs and a \nmore burdensome system also mean more expenses for small businesses \ntrying to sponsor retirement plans for their employees.\n  A 2014 study found that, as a result of these rules, many affected \nretirees--who, once again, are predominantly middle class or lower-\nincome retirees--will see their lifetime retirement savings drop by \nbetween 20 and 40 percent, which will translate into a reduction of \nbetween $20 billion and $32 billion in systemwide retirement savings \nevery year.\n  DOL's own analysis indicates that the rule will have a compliance \ncost. That is deadweight loss to the system of between $2.4 billion and \n$5.7 billion over the first 10 years, virtually all of which will be \npassed onto American retirees. I think it should go without saying that \nif anyone has an interest in understanding the cost of the DOL's \nregulations, it is the DOL itself.\n  All of these problems--and they are real problems--with the DOL's \nfiduciary rule are within the substance of the rule itself. I wish to \ntake just a few minutes, however, to talk about the process by which \nthe rule came into existence because it is no less problematic.\n  This regulation is an attempt to rewrite ERISA-prohibited transaction \nregulations for IRAs that have been in place since 1975. However, the \nprohibited transaction rules for IRAs are codified in the Internal \nRevenue Code which, generally speaking, would give Treasury regulatory \njurisdiction over the matter.\n  That was the understanding in 1975 when the current regulations were \nfirst established. However, a 1978 Executive order transferred some of \nthe Treasury's jurisdiction over prohibited\n\n[[Page S3076]]\n\ntransaction rules--rules generally directed at preventing self-dealing \nand conflicts of interest--to the Department of Labor. In other words, \nthe rule that DOL has rewritten with this new fiduciary regulation \npredated the Department's grant of jurisdiction.\n  While this might be a little arcane and in the weeds, this \ndistinction is important, given the reported disputes between agencies \non this rule. Indeed, according to a report released by the Senate \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, career \nofficials at the SEC and Treasury have expressed concern over DOL's \ncourse of action with regard to this rule. They also offered \nsuggestions for improvements, most of which were disregarded by DOL in \nfavor of a quicker resolution to the rulemaking process. Not \nsurprisingly, this report found that political appointees at the White \nHouse played an outsized role in the rulemaking process.\n  Given these procedural concerns, not to mention the substantive \nconcerns with the rule itself, I think that at the very least we should \nrevisit whether DOL should have jurisdiction in this area in the first \nplace. Put simply: IRAs, which are at the heart of these regulations, \nare creatures of the Tax Code. They should, therefore, be governed by \nthe agencies responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Tax \nCode and not by officials outside of those agencies who, far more often \nthan not, have agendas that are geared more toward business pension \nplans and not tax-deferred savings accounts set up at the individual \nlevel.\n  Toward that end, I have drafted legislation that would restore \nTreasury's rulemaking authority in this area in order to ensure that \nthe proper expertise is brought to bear on these issues and that future \nrules governing financial advice and marketing are, at the very least, \ncrafted with the broader financial regulatory framework in mind.\n  As it is, we have a rule that appears to have been drafted by those \nwho lack expertise about the retail investment industry in order to \nachieve a goal that is, to put it kindly, at odds with the purpose of \nthat industry and the interests of the individual savers who rely on it \nin order to obtain a secure retirement.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the resolution before us as it is the \nbest near-term vehicle we have to putting the administration in check \nwith regard to this rule. For the long term, I am hoping we can have a \nreasonable discussion about DOL's role in regulating IRAs to begin \nwith. Ultimately, if that discussion takes place, I think more and more \npeople will realize that the Labor Department should not be responsible \nfor crafting what is essentially tax policy.\n  I plan to vote yes on this resolution, and I hope that all of my \ncolleagues will do the same.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, as Senator Hatch has mentioned, in April \nthe Department of Labor just issued its final conflict-of-interest, or \nfiduciary, rule, putting in place a framework of meaningful protections \nfor Americans saving for retirement. The rule helps families save for \nretirement at a time when fewer and fewer workers have traditional \npensions. Today my Republican colleagues are trying to block this rule.\n  I join Ranking Member Murray of the HELP Committee and Ranking Member \nWyden of the Finance Committee--on which the Presiding Officer and I \nboth sit--to recommend that you vote no on the joint resolution.\n  It is important to remember why this rule is necessary. Since the \nenactment of ERISA and the creation of 401(k) plans and individual \nretirement accounts in the 1970s, there has been a dramatic shift from \ntraditional pension plans run by employers--that is where when you \nretire, there is a so-called defined benefit where you can count on a \ncertain number of dollars a month for the rest of your life and perhaps \nfor your spouse--to defined contribution plans that workers are left to \nmanage themselves.\n  Maximizing retirement savings and avoiding high fees and costs are \nmore critical than ever. But most American workers need advice on how \nto prepare for retirement and navigate these plans, which can be both \ncomplicated and, maybe more importantly, risky.\n  The DOL's rule--the Labor Department's rule--makes sure brokers and \nadvisers act ``in the best interest'' of their customers and minimize \nthe potential for conflicts of interest that could eat away at a \nsaver's nest egg. This doesn't mean that diligent brokers and advisers \nhave not been helping their customers, but the rule creates structural \nprotections to make sure that is always the case.\n  It is that simple: Customers come first. There is no alternative to \nthat basic principle. Whether you are visiting your doctor or going to \na lawyer, your interests come first.\n  Following the rule proposal in 2015, the DOL reviewed hundreds of \ncomments, held days of hearings, and issued a final rule with extensive \nchanges that address a variety of concerns that many of us have heard. \nThe major changes include extending the implementation period, \nsimplifying disclosure requirements, and clarifying the difference \nbetween education and advice. The full list of changes is much longer \nand resulted in significant improvement. Most of the industry \nrecognizes that and has said so. Thankfully, banks and brokers are \nalready working on implementation. The Department of Labor is committed \nto helping companies figure out how to make the necessary changes and \nadapt to the rule.\n  Industry and some in Congress have called for the SEC to issue its \nown fiduciary rule before the Labor Department. The Wall Street reform \nbill required the SEC, the Securities and Exchange Commission, to \nconsider its own rule. I urge them to move forward as well, but there \nis no reason for the Department of Labor to wait for the sometimes-too-\nslow SEC.\n  Congress gave retirement accounts tax-favored status and significant \nprotections under ERISA. The Labor Department's rules build on the \nstatutory framework under ERISA, and now the fiduciary rule reflects \nthe reality of the modern retirement landscape. It is time to move \nforward to help protect this generation and future generations of \nAmerican savers.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the resolution so the \nimplementation of this rule can continue to move forward to protect the \ninterests of millions of hard-working Americans who are saving for \nretirement.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 5243\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, last week the CDC announced it is \nmonitoring nearly 300 pregnant women in the United States and \nterritories for possible Zika infections. That means nearly 300 \nfamilies across our country are living through a true nightmare for \nexpecting parents. They are waiting for news about whether their \nnewborn will be safe and healthy.\n  Unfortunately, with almost 1,400 cases of Zika already reported, the \nnumber of expecting moms and dads in this awful position is only \nexpected to grow. As a mother, a grandmother, and a United States \nSenator, I strongly believe it is our responsibility to act as quickly \nas possible for these families and the families who will unfortunately \nbe impacted by the Zika virus in the weeks and months ahead.\n  Just to be clear, mosquito season has already started in some parts \nof our country, and we do not have any time to waste. In fact, we \nshould have been able to act much sooner. President Obama's emergency \nfunding proposal to support the Zika response has been available for \neveryone to see since February. Similar to many of my colleagues, I was \ndisappointed the Republican leader refused to even consider it\n\n[[Page S3077]]\n\nand that instead they came up with one excuse after another to delay, \neven though public health experts and researchers have made it very \nclear this is truly an urgent public health crisis.\n  Some Republicans said Zika wasn't something they were willing to give \nthe administration a penny more for, others said they would think about \nmore money to fight Zika but only in return for partisan spending cuts, \nand others spent more time thinking about how to get political cover \nthan actually trying to address this problem, but many of us knew how \nimportant this was and we didn't give up.\n  So I am very glad that after a lot of pressure from women, families, \nGovernors, and scientists, and after a lot of pushing Republicans to \nget serious about dealing with this emergency, many of our Republican \ncolleagues in the Senate finally joined us at the table last week to \nopen a path for an important step forward.\n  I appreciate the work of Chairman Blunt, who joined me to get this \ndone, as well as all the Senators on both sides of the aisle who voted \nfor it. While Democrats didn't get the full amount we had hoped for in \nthis compromise, I am glad the Senate was able to pass a $1.1 billion \ndownpayment on the President's proposal as an emergency bill, without \noffsets.\n  Our agreement would accelerate the administration's work, and it \nwould allow money to start flowing to address this crisis even as we \ncontinue fighting for more as needed. This agreement was supported by \nevery Democrat and a little less than half of the Republicans in the \nSenate. So the Senate has a strong bipartisan first step ready to go.\n  Unfortunately, House Republicans went in a very different direction. \nThey released an underfunded, partisan, and, in my opinion, mean-\nspirited bill that would provide only $622 million--less than one-third \nof what is needed in this emergency--without any funding for preventive \nhealth care, family planning, or outreach even to those who are at risk \nof getting Zika. They are still insisting that funding for this public \nhealth emergency be fully offset, and the administration should somehow \nsiphon money away from their critical Ebola response and other \nessential activities in order to fund the Zika efforts. House \nRepublicans clearly feel this health care crisis is an appropriate \nmoment to somehow nickel-and-dime and that it is a good opportunity to \nprioritize Heritage Action over women and families, but if you are 1 of \nnearly 300 mothers the CDC is monitoring for likely Zika infection or \none of the almost 1,400 people infected so far or one of the millions \nof expecting mothers nationwide, I bet you would like to know your \ngovernment is doing everything it can now to tackle this virus. So I am \ncontinuing to call on Senate Republicans to get our bipartisan Zika \nagreement to the House as quickly as possible. Senate Republicans have \nalready said they would be willing to do this if we exchange it for \nAffordable Health Care Act cuts, and I think they should be just as \nwilling to do it for the sake of women and families who are at risk.\n  This agreement has strong bipartisan support. It can move through the \nHouse, and it can get to the President to be signed into law so our \nresearchers, our scientists, and those in the field can get to work. \nThis Republican-controlled Congress has already waited far too long to \nact on Zika. We should not wait any longer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate receives \nfrom the House H.R. 5243, that all after the enacting clause be \nstricken; that the Blunt-Murray substitute amendment to provide $1.1 \nbillion in funding to enhance the Federal response and preparedness \nwith respect to the Zika virus be agreed to; that there be up to 1 hour \nof debate, equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; \nthat upon the use or yielding back of time, the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time, and the Senate vote on passage of the bill, as \namended, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senate majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  I wish our Democratic colleagues would spend as much time working \nwith us to try to solve problems as they do engaged in political \ntheater and posturing.\n  Mrs. Murray, the Senator from Washington, has done good work working \nwith the chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee, Senator Blunt, in \ncoming up with a piece of legislation that funds the Zika response at \n$1.1 billion. That legislation has already passed the Senate. What \nremains to be done is the House and the Senate need to come together in \na conference committee--which is the typical way where differences of \napproach are reconciled--to come up with a responsible piece of \nlegislation.\n  In the meantime, I am glad the President has taken up our suggestion \ninitially that until this can happen, they reprogram money--$589 \nmillion--from the Ebola response that had not yet been expended and \ntransfer that to the Zika response. I am confident that money has not \nbeen spent yet and plenty is available to deal with it while Congress \ndoes its business in an orderly sort of way.\n  I would have to say to my friend from Washington, my State is going \nto be directly in the crosshairs because this mosquito is not native to \nWashington State but it is to the warmer parts of our country--Texas \nand Louisiana. Thank goodness no one so far has gotten the Zika virus \nfrom a mosquito. It is people who have traveled to South America, \nPuerto Rico, or elsewhere and come back to the United States, but we \nall agree on a bipartisan basis that this is a very serious matter and \nwe can't waste time. There is $589 million available to deal with it \nnow.\n  Secondly, we are working--as we typically do--with the House to try \nto reconcile our differences and to do our work in a responsible sort \nof way. In the meantime, our Democratic colleagues are blocking \nlegislation, like the Defense authorization bill. They are throwing \nobstacles in the way of our getting the Senate back to work in every \nway they possibly can, including this--which, I am sorry to say, is \njust political theater and posturing.\n  With that, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me just say this. This Zika virus is \nan emergency now, and though my constituents don't live in Texas, we \nhave people in Washington State who have traveled to infected \ncountries, gotten Zika transmitted through mosquito, have come home, \nand now they need to have tests to determine whether they have been \ninfected. Those tests will not be available until we provide this \nmoney. The Ebola response money that was just referred to needs to be \nthere because Ebola is not eradicated and can come back at any minute, \nand we are doing everything we can as a nation to protect American \ncitizens.\n  What we are trying to do is move the bipartisan bill that has been \napproved in the Senate quickly to the House. Yes, it has been attached \nto an appropriations bill, but for us to sit back and wait until a \nconference committee is appointed on that and does the long \nnegotiations over the summer into the fall is too late. We can deal \nwith this now. That is what I ask to do today, and we will continue to \npush until we can assure people in our States across the country that \nwe are doing everything we can as a nation to help protect our citizens \nfrom the Zika virus, particularly expectant mothers or possibly \nexpectant mothers and families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      USDA Catfish Inspection Rule\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to address the bait-and-\nswitch being pulled on the American people in this Congress regarding \ncatfish inspection. We have all been told by lobbyists for fish \nimporters and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam that the catfish \ninspection program is ``duplicative and trade distorting,'' but that \nsimply isn't true. This rule is not duplicative, this\n\n[[Page S3078]]\n\nrule is not distorting, and the program is working to keep food safe \nfor Americans. There is nothing duplicative about this rule. The FDA no \nlonger inspects any catfish. USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service \nis the only agency inspecting catfish. Additionally, the USDA and the \nFDA operate under a memorandum of understanding to prevent duplication. \nFor decades, USDA and FDA coordinated to prevent duplicative \ninspections with regard to seafood, beef, pork, and poultry.\n  The fact is that the FDA did not adequately inspect catfish. The FDA \ninspected less than 2 percent of catfish, and it lab tested an even \nsmaller percentage. It would not be a stretch to argue that we had very \nlittle inspection at all. In contrast, the USDA's Food Safety and \nInspection Service inspects all catfish, as they do with other farmed-\nraised meat.\n  This rule is not a WTO violation. Equivalent standards are applied to \nimported and domestic fish.\n  The USDA has been inspecting beef, pork, and poultry with this system \nfor decades. Is that too much to ask for? Why should American consumers \nbe subjected to harmful contaminants that we can prevent?\n  Contrary to what you may hear, this program is not costly. I have \nheard many different numbers thrown around, but the bottom line is that \nthe Congressional Budget Office has determined that this resolution \nwould not save the taxpayer a single penny.\n  If Congress votes to disapprove the USDA's catfish inspection rule, \nthe food safety of the American people will be significantly \nundermined. This is a health and safety issue, pure and simple. With \nonly a few weeks of inspection under its belt, the USDA has already \ndenied entry of two shipments of imported catfish because they found \ncrystal violet in one shipment and malachite green in another. Both are \ndangerous carcinogens.\n  Earlier today the American Cancer Society said they support keeping \nfarm-raised fish inspection at USDA.\n  Overturning the USDA's catfish inspection rule would set a bad \nprecedent. Congress has never used the Congressional Review Act to \noverturn a rule that Congress explicitly directed by law. Additionally, \nif the rule is overturned, the law requiring USDA catfish inspection \nwould remain in place. USDA simply would not have a rule to implement \nthe law, which would lead to significant trade disruption.\n  Catfish farming is an important industry to Arkansas. Arkansas \nproducers are proud to supply a safe product for American consumers. \nThe bottom line is that our farmers aren't afraid of competition. They \njust want the security of knowing the domestic industry and imports are \nall safe.\n  Voting to disprove this rule would put consumers at risk. I strongly \nurge my colleagues who share my concerns about the security of our food \nsystem to let this important food safety program continue to operate \nand continue to keep harmful carcinogens out of the food supply of \nAmericans.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the resolution \nof disapproval of the Department of Agriculture's catfish inspection \nprogram on several grounds. This has become a rather heated issue. I \nthink there are some issues we need to clear up, especially speaking \nfrom the privilege of being the chairman of the Senate Committee on \nAgriculture.\n  The amendment seeks to make changes to food safety inspection by \neliminating the Department of Agriculture's inspection program of \ndomestic and foreign-raised catfish. This program just started in \nMarch. Some of the comments about the expense of this program have been \nmade as if they were on an annual basis. Most of the costs that were \ncited in the General Accounting Office report did not mention the fact \nthat these were startup costs.\n  The program was created due to concerns related to food safety. The \nUSDA has a very strong record of requiring meat that is imported to the \nUnited States to be processed in foreign facilities that are \n``equivalent'' to U.S. meat processing facilities. The Department of \nAgriculture visits these facilities and conducts audits to ensure that \ntheir practices are in line with what we require in the United States. \nThis is done to ensure that food coming into the United States is safe. \nThat product is also inspected once it arrives at U.S. ports of entry.\n  Simply put, what we have here is a program that requires the same \nequivalency determination for foreign raised and processed catfish as \nwe require for beef, chicken, lamb, pork, and all the other commodities \nor all the other animal products that you could imagine.\n  Just last week I was notified by the Department of Agriculture that \ntheir inspections of Vietnamese catfish found illegal drug residues in \ntwo shipments destined for the United States. I am sure that others who \nhave spoken to this issue, especially Senator Boozman and Senator \nCochran, have repeated this. Had this program not been in place, this \nviolation would not have been caught and the product would have been \nallowed to enter into commerce.\n  I am very surprised. I know this is an easy issue to bring up with \nregard to a GAO report for 10 years that said this duplicating what the \nFood and Drug Administration does. It is, but it is no longer because \nthe Department of Agriculture is taking it over because they have a \nmuch more robust program. The Food and Drug Administration really only \ninspects 2 percent of the catfish. We are talking about a much higher \npercentage by the Department of Agriculture.\n  I hope those in the Senate who are trying to remove this important \nsafeguard just 2 months into the program being enforced and on the \ntails of it paying off and preventing adulterated catfish from entering \ncommerce--I remind my colleagues that this program was authorized in \nthe 2008 and 2014 farm bills. That was delayed for a while. Startup \ncosts started last year. Again, those costs that are mentioned in the \nGeneral Accounting Office are not pertinent to what is happening today.\n  I want to say one other thing. Farm bills are developed through 5 \nyears of thoughtful discussions and also negotiations. When a farm bill \nis passed, any producer of any product, including any animal product, \nexpects--almost as if it is a contract--to be able to depend on it. If \nyou have a burgeoning industry of domestic catfish, you want to make \ndoggone sure that it is safe and that there are no imports that \nrepresent a health hazard, and that is exactly what happened in this \nparticular instance. You do not want to open up farm bills willy-nilly \non a specific issue that may make a headline or may make a good TV \nspot--to quote the General Accountability Office--which has not taken \ninto consideration that this is just a startup kind of situation in \nterms of the money.\n  It is interesting to me that this was scored at zero. The \nCongressional Budget Office has scored it at zero. I think I understand \nall of this talk about wasting money. I don't know anybody in the \nCongress--House or Senate--who is for wasting money. One person's \nwasteful spending of money is another person's viable investment. So we \nhave to look pretty close.\n  I ask that my colleagues vote no on the resolution and to maintain \nthese important food safety protections and the carefully crafted 2014 \nfarm bill. This is not the time to open up the farm bill. We will \ncertainly begin discussions on that in the next year, and we will take \nup these matters in the following year and go over it with a fine-tooth \ncomb.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I strongly urge the Senate to reject \nthe motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 28. This resolution would overturn a \ncatfish inspection rule that is working to protect American consumers. \nCongress directed the Department of Agriculture\n\n[[Page S3079]]\n\nto write this rule in both the 2008 and 2014 farm bills. It did so \nbased on evidence that the inspection regime then in place was \ninadequate.\n  Almost all catfish consumed in the United States is raised on farms \nin controlled environments. The Department of Agriculture, or the USDA, \nis the most experienced and well-equipped agency to ensure that farm-\nraised meat products, including catfish, are as safe as possible.\n  Since assuming responsibility of catfish inspection just a few week \nago, the Department of Agriculture has intercepted and impounded two \nlarge shipments of foreign catfish contaminated with cancer-causing \nchemicals banned for use in the United States. Prior to the \nimplementation of the rule, less than 2 in 1,000 catfish products \nentering the United States was laboratory tested. If it were not for \nthe rule that S.J. Res. 28 seeks to nullify, this dangerous foreign \nfish would be in the U.S. food supply today.\n  Sponsors of this resolution have said that the catfish rule is \ncostly. This is not true. The Congressional Budget Office has said that \nthis resolution won't save a dime. Sponsors of this resolution have \nsaid that the catfish rule is duplicative. This is untrue. The Food and \nDrug Administration ceased all catfish inspections on March 1 of this \nyear. The Department of Agriculture is the only agency charged with \ninspecting catfish. Sponsors of this resolution have said that the \ncatfish rule creates an artificial trade barrier. This is untrue. The \nDepartment has stated that the rule is compliant with the World Trade \nOrganization's equivalency standard and would not violate its \nprinciples.\n  Adoption of this resolution would not change the law. It would only \ncall into question and potentially halt the ability of the U.S. \nGovernment to carry on important activities authorized by law to keep \nAmerican consumers safe.\n  It is clear that the inspection rule is working as intended to \nprotect U.S. consumers. Congress was right in twice mandating these \ninspections, and reconsidering that decision would be a poor use of the \nSenate's time.\n  I hope Senators will reject the motion to proceed to this resolution.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 5243\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I have been on this floor many times \ntalking about Zika. I think some people believe in the old adage ``out \nof sight out of mind.'' It is equally as much, if not more, of a \ncrisis--an international crisis--as was the Ebola crisis. Yet do you \nremember how everyone became so suddenly concerned about Ebola when \nthere were only a couple of cases that showed up in the United States? \nRemember how we in this body suddenly rushed in and appropriated on an \nemergency basis several multiples of billions of dollars to address the \nEbola crisis? I remember how successful that was even though Ebola is \nstill raging in parts of western Africa. We are continuing to try to \nhelp out those African nations so it will not spread across the world \nand especially to keep it from coming here to our shores.\n  The same thing is happening with the Zika virus, but people are not \nrecognizing it. That is why this Senator continues to talk about it--\nbecause we need the resources necessary to stop the spread of Zika. It \nis only a matter of time before there is a local transmission in the \ncontinental United States. What is a local transmission? Well, we know \nthey put a fancy name on it. It is called vector. What is vector? The \nvector is a strain of mosquito called the aegypti. And, by the way, it \nis math. What happens across a lot of the coastal United States and \nsouthern United States in June? It gets hot, the rains come, and what \ncomes along with that? Swarms of mosquitoes.\n\n  Since this particular strain, the aegypti, is prevalent across the \nUnited States, up the west coast, the Pacific coast, up the Atlantic \nseaboard--much further than what you consider to be southern States--lo \nand behold, this strain of mosquito carries the Zika virus, and when it \nsticks its sticker into a human being and starts drawing blood, the \nvirus is transmitted into the blood of the human being. Now you have a \nhuman carrier of the Zika virus that can be transmitted through sexual \ncontact. But, lo and behold, if the carrier is a pregnant female, then \nthat Zika virus--and the virus itself sometimes doesn't manifest itself \nin many ways; it might be like a mild form of the flu. But if it is a \npregnant female, then there are some disastrous consequences coming \nahead. Those are the horrible pictures we have seen--the microcephaly. \nThe virus gets in and attacks the fetus and does not allow the fetus to \ndevelop, particularly with regard to the structure of the head and the \nbrain, and that is what causes these terrible family tragedies.\n  Last week we voted for $1.1 billion as part of an appropriations \nbill. We turned down Senator Rubio's and my proposal of $1.9 billion.\n  By the way, did you notice a Republican and a Democrat coming \ntogether, saying: This is tough in our State. In our State there are \nwell over 120 cases. There are also multiple pregnant women in Florida \nwho are infected.\n  Nationwide there are 1,200 Americans in 48 States that we know of who \nhave been infected with the virus. We know that in Puerto Rico--the \nCenters for Disease Control tells us that 25 percent of that island's \npopulation of our fellow American citizens is going to be infected. \nThat is in Puerto Rico alone--800,000 people. As a result of that \ninfection in Puerto Rico, we saw the first case of microcephaly linked \nto the Zika virus reported in Puerto Rico. That was determined because \nof a miscarriage, and the fetus had all the markings of microcephaly. \nPrior to that, the CDC had confirmed the first Zika-related death in \nthe United States that had also occurred in Puerto Rico.\n  While we here in the Senate last week turned down $1.9 billion, which \nwas the administration's request, we appropriated $1.1 billion. But \nguess what they did down at the other end of the hallway in the U.S. \nCapitol Building. They did only $622 million. And they want this to go \nto a conference committee to be worked out over time? Folks, it is late \nMay and summer is upon us. These cases are going to become increasingly \napparent.\n  Now why don't we add Brazil into the mix? It is hot and humid. By the \nway, there is something happening in a few months in Brazil: People \nfrom all over the world are going to Brazil for the Olympics, and right \nnow Brazil has more than 100,000 cases of Zika virus this year alone.\n  This is a very dangerous emergency, and we are playing around and \ndelaying. Congress has not stepped up and is failing the American \npeople by not treating it as an emergency. It ought to be clear that it \nis up to us to protect our constituents, to stop the spread of the \nvirus, and to do everything the administration has requested, including \nreplacing the multiple hundreds of millions they raided out of the \nEbola fund to try to get a jump-start on this because the Congress was \nsitting around on its hands, not willing to give the money. They \nborrowed from the Ebola fund, and we need to replenish that fund. That \nis a part of the $1.9 billion request.\n  So, Madam President, I am going to ask unanimous consent that we \nproceed to a vote on this emergency. We ought to be trying to do the \nright thing. We ought to give the President and the public health \nexperts the resources they need, that they tell us they have to have to \nstop the spread of this virus.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \nreceives from the House H.R. 5243, that all after the enacting clause \nbe stricken; that the Nelson-Rubio substitute amendment to provide the \n$1.9 billion in funding to enhance the Federal response and \npreparedness with respect to the Zika virus be agreed to; that there be \nup to 1 hour of debate equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees; and that upon the use or yielding back of time, the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and the Senate vote on passage of the \nbill, as amended, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, reserving the right to object, this was \ndebated extensively and considerably for\n\n[[Page S3080]]\n\nmore than 1 hour, equally divided, just last week, and was resolved by \na vote in this body.\n  I don't think there is anyone in this body who isn't worried about \nthe Zika virus and who doesn't want to do everything that can be done \nin the quickest way possible. It was determined to be an emergency and \nwas put into the bill that way. There was Senator Nelson's bill for \n$1.9 billion, but it lacked specificity on how that was to be spent, so \nthe $1.1 billion was the one that got the vote.\n  I was hoping it would be the Cornyn vote that was passed because it \nwas offset with health prevention money we already have. Those funds \ncan be used for just this kind of need. I don't know why there would be \nan objection to using that for the Zika virus, but there was. Even so, \nwe resolved it. We resolved it without offsetting it, adding another \n$1.1 billion to the deficit, and were able to move that project \nforward. So in light of that, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, the Senator from Wyoming knows my \naffection for him as a friend. The Senator from Wyoming is a great \nSenator from the State of Wyoming, and Wyoming does not have the threat \nas the southern States do in the United States as the summer comes upon \nus.\n  The Senator has referred to the Cornyn amendment. The Cornyn \namendment allowed for $1.1 billion, which was voted down. It was paid \nfor by raiding the Affordable Care Act, and that is just not going to \nhappen.\n  Whenever an emergency happens, the tradition of the U.S. Congress is, \nin fact, to provide for that emergency on a basis that you don't have \nto go and rob some other piece of funding in order to pay for it. When \na hurricane hits and if it hits Florida, I certainly hope you all are \ngoing to appropriate emergency funds. If there is an earthquake or the \neruption of a volcano, fires--whatever the natural or manmade disaster \nthat occurs--that is what a government does. One of the functions of \ngovernment is to protect the health and welfare of the people, and \nsometimes that calls for the funding of an emergency.\n  We don't have a lot of children with microcephaly that have been born \nfrom pregnant women here, but that is coming. We have already seen it. \nWait until all of the Americans, including in the northern tier of \nStates and the western United States, go to Rio for the Olympics. Wait \nuntil there is a further migration out of Puerto Rico, which is causing \na brain drain because of the financial condition of that island and \nwhich we are not helping them with as we continue to dither about their \nfinancial distress. Wait until that migration of American citizens \ncomes more and more from Puerto Rico to the continental United States \nand brings with them those infected with the Zika virus. All of this is \nabout to happen, and it is about to explode. This Senator suspects that \na lot of the people who are objecting to moving on this on an emergency \nbasis are going to rue the day when they see the consequences.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I have a fondness for the Senator from \nFlorida, as well, and recognize that he is further south and that they, \nperhaps, have more mosquitoes than we do, although even Alaska would \nhave a competition with that.\n  But we did pass emergency money for this. We did declare it an \nemergency and pass $1.1 billion. That is $1,100 million to work on this \nproblem.\n  Before, we had the Ebola problem. That was the crisis of the year, \nand we allocated money to that. We allocated more money to that than it \nneeded. That is why some of that money was brought over as an emergency \ninto solving the Zika problem.\n  I have been doing some research as the Budget Chairman, and I found \nthat we have about $6 billion worth of emergencies every year. We ought \nto budget for what we know is consistent. Unfortunately, I had them \nlook it up, and I found that we actually spend $26 billion in \nemergencies every year. That ought to be a part of the budget and not \njust passed on to future generations. They are going to have their own \nemergencies that they are going to need to solve. Somehow we are going \nto have to get control of this. I am pleased we have a bipartisan \neffort going to see if there aren't some solutions that can be built \ninto the budget process. But that is not what I came over here for to \nbegin with.\n\n  Madam President, we have the right, when a government rule is \nfinalized, if we don't agree with it, we can get a petition. If we can \nget enough Senators on a petition, we can get a guaranteed 10 hours of \ndebate and an up-or-down vote on that rule. In America, we are trying \nto get people to save more for retirement, to invest more--and now this \nadministration makes it harder to do so.\n  I rise to speak in support of H.J. Res. 88, expressing congressional \ndisapproval of the rule submitted by the Department of Labor with \nrespect to investment advice. How many people do you think are going to \nbe willing to seek investment advice if they have to sign a contract \nbefore they can even see if that is the person they want to work with?\n  It is called the fiduciary and conflict of interest rule. We are all \nagainst conflict of interest. There aren't even a lot of people who \nknow how to spell ``fiduciary.'' That is to confuse people about what \nthis is about.\n  We do have a retirement coverage gap in America. There are tens of \nmillions of Americans who are not prepared for retirement. The \nregulation put forward by the Obama administration that we are debating \ntoday will limit the advice that individuals seeking access to \nretirement plans can receive. That will increase the size of this \nretirement gap.\n  This regulation will significantly impede the ability of low- and \nmiddle-income Americans to save for retirement. They will simply not \nhave anyone to answer their questions and provide advice.\n  For many years, I have heard the goal of this regulation is to force \nfinancial advisers to work in the best interest of their clients. I am \ncompletely in favor of financial advisers doing so. I have cosponsored \nlegislation requiring that practice in law. I have cosponsored it and \ntried to pass it. In fact, in my almost 20 years of working on \nretirement policy in the U.S. Senate, I have never met anyone who \ndoesn't agree that financial advisers should act in the best interests \nof their customers.\n  The problem with this rule is, it goes far beyond requiring a best \ninterest standard. It goes so far as to effectively prohibit the means \nby which low- and middle-income Americans receive retirement advice. A \nmassive regulatory regime has been created by this rule. It will \nundoubtedly raise the costs in a $24 trillion--or to put it in numbers \nthat are easier to understand, a $24 thousand billion industry. Sure, \nlarge companies and retirement savers with large assets will probably \nbe able to deal with the increased costs, but what about the small \ninvestors, the small advisers, the people interested in retirement \nsavings, the ones who have modest assets--like most of the cities and \ntowns in Wyoming. This rule will negatively impact the services and \nchoices available to investors. I can't imagine why limiting options, \nlimiting choices, and limiting services is being touted as a victory \nfor anyone.\n  My home State of Wyoming is hurting. Our energy-based economy is \ndeclining significantly, largely due to regulations added by the Obama \nadministration. Now that same administration is issuing a regulation \nthat will hurt the future savings of my constituents.\n  Wealthy Americans across America will not be affected by this rule. \nYes, wealthy Americans will not be affected. They can go about \nreceiving their retirement advice the same way they always have. \nHowever, many of my constituents will be affected by this rule. Their \nretirement savings will suffer. It is as simple as that.\n  There are approximately 28.8 million small businesses in America. \nThose businesses create two out of every three new private sector jobs \nand employ nearly half of America's workforce. I am a former small \nbusiness owner. I know well what it takes to run a small business. This \nrule will hurt retirement coverage among small businesses. It will \ncreate burdens, limits, and options for small businesses trying to \noffer retirement plans. In my experience, that will result in one of \ntwo\n\n[[Page S3081]]\n\nthings--either increased costs or no access to retirement advice.\n  The Obama administration is going to force small businesses to choose \nbetween paying increased fees, which could jeopardize the success of \nthe business and therefore the jobs of the employees, or not providing \naccess to retirement savings for their employees, which jeopardizes the \nlifelong income of those employees. It is a no-win situation for small \nemployers that are trying to take care of their employees and grow \ntheir business.\n  I always say to learn from the mistakes of others as there is not \ntime enough to make them all yourself. This regulation has been tried \nbefore. We have precedent to look to when examining the impact this \nrule will have on our economy. A very similar change was made in the \nUnited Kingdom just a few years ago, but this March the United Kingdom \nreleased a study which confirmed that there is a very disturbing \nretirement advice gap for low- and middle-income individuals, the very \nones I am talking about that will be affected here in America.\n  I have read how this administration--as well as some of my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle--has said that rule is different than that \nissued by the United Kingdom. Here is the thing: it is not all that \ndifferent. The impact will be the same, and this is what has happened: \nWealthy individuals are getting access to retirement advice while \nmiddle- and lower income individuals are not. I have not understood, \nnor will I understand, why this regulation was put forward and \nfinalized.\n  The Department of Labor itself admitted on February 29 that \nrelatively little is known about how people make planning and financial \ndecisions before and during retirement, but that didn't stop them. The \nDepartment of Labor, which is the proponent of this rule, does not know \nhow people make financial and planning decisions before and during \nretirement. Why would they go ahead with such a disastrous regulation? \nWhy should such a seemingly disastrous regulation be put forward when \nit is unknown how many people it will affect? Perhaps they should start \nby finding out how average people make investment and retirement \nsavings decisions.\n  The regulation we are debating today has been lauded as one that will \nhelp low- and middle-income individuals save for retirement. I refute \nthat claim with two main points. First, an analysis of a very similar \nchange to a retirement system has proven that the opposite has \noccurred. Second, the authors of this regulation know little or nothing \nabout how many people this will impact or even in what ways. People who \ngive investment advice give it just fine right now, but they can see \nwhat is coming. That is why they have been to my office and visited \nwith me about what they are going to have to do with the people who \ncome to them for investment advice--or the people they want to provide \nservices to.\n  There will likely be unintended consequences of this new regulation, \nand as we have seen those will likely be painful consequences. As I \nstated in the beginning of my remarks, we have a retirement coverage \ngap in America. I have been working for almost 20 years in the Senate \nto help close that gap. All this new regulation will do is limit \nretirement advice for the people who need it the most. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this resolution of disapproval.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Zika Virus\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, on Monday I hosted a roundtable \ndiscussion at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore to \nreview, with experts from my community, the strategy we need to employ \nwith regard to the Zika virus.\n  I pointed out at the beginning of that roundtable discussion that the \nWorld Health Organization has labeled the Zika virus as a public health \nurgency of international concern. The World Health Organization has \nestimated that as many as 4 million will be affected in the Americas. \nWe know the current numbers of reported cases in the United States. As \nof last week, we had over 1,300 cases in the United States and our \nterritories. Almost all of those that we have in the United States, in \nthe Continental United States, are travel related.\n  We have 17 confirmed cases in Maryland. Those cases are going to go \nup dramatically. We know that. As the summer months and the warm, wet \nweather occurs, with the mosquito population occurring, we know the \nnumber of people affected by the Zika virus is going to go up \ndramatically.\n  This is the challenge. We know it is transmitted primarily through \nmosquito bites, through mosquitoes. For example, we know that in Puerto \nRico, it is going to be very active. We also know in the United States \nthe mosquito population could very well act as a major transmitter of \nthe Zika virus, but the Zika virus is also transmitted through sexual \nintercourse. Therefore, people who have the Zika virus and who may not \nknow they have the Zika virus--because many individuals who are \ninfected don't know they have the virus--this could become a major \nproblem in the United States.\n  What is at stake? We do know the Zika virus is directly linked to the \nbirth defect microcephaly. That is a tragic circumstance affecting \nfetuses that could present a lifetime challenge for the child who is \nborn with microcephaly. We know it from the small skull. What I learned \nat this roundtable discussion is that the complications from \nmicrocephaly include lifetime disabilities. The brain is much smaller. \nIt is not capable. In many cases, it leads to blindness and death. It \nis not unusual to have not only the human cost involved in this birth \ndefect, but the actual lifetime cost is estimated as high as $10 \nmillion for each child born with microcephaly. This is a huge challenge \nto our country with the spread of the Zika virus.\n  There are also other conditions that have been associated with the \nZika virus, including Guillain-Barre syndrome. That is a nervous \ncondition, a nerve damage condition that can lead to death.\n  What is the answer? In this roundtable discussion, we had the public \nhealth officers from Baltimore City, Anne Arundel County, Howard \nCountry, and Frederick County. We had experts dealing with mosquito \ncontrol. We had experts who were dealing with the development of \nvaccines and treatments. We had a robust discussion as to what can be \ndone.\n  First and foremost, there was strong understanding that public \nawareness is going to be critically important to dealing with the Zika \nvirus. The public needs to know. If you are pregnant or intend to start \na family, you need to know the risk factors.\n  It would be nice if you could have a test done to know whether you \nhave the Zika virus, but the problem is the current state of \ndevelopment for the tests has produced two tests that the FDA has made \navailable upon an emergency basis. One looks at the person's immune \nsystem that shows certain signs that person has the Zika virus. As I \nsaid before, it is not clear whether you will have any symptoms, even \nthough you may have the virus. This one test looks at your immune \nsystem and is not 100 percent reliable by any stretch of the \nimagination, but it at least gives some indication. In many cases, you \nhave to take the test more than once.\n  There is another test that can be given that if you actually have the \nvirus in your system, it will show that, but there is a problem. The \nvirus does not stay long in your system, but you still have the impact \nof the virus. So that could come back negative, but you still have the \neffects of the Zika virus.\n\n  Also, we are not sure as to how long the Zika virus can be \ntransmitted through sexual contact. That issue is still being studied. \nSo it is very possible that a person may have been infected by the Zika \nvirus, does not realize they have been infected, and several months \nlater, through sexual intercourse, transmits the Zika virus to his or \nher partner.\n  So these are all areas we want the public to know more about, and we \nare developing more and more scientific information on tests that can \nhelp us identify those who have the Zika virus, and hopefully we will \ndevelop some\n\n[[Page S3082]]\n\nway of dealing with those who are infected.\n  Obviously, we want people who want to start a family to recognize \nthey should try to avoid areas where there is a large vulnerability to \nthe Zika virus. That will be particularly important this summer.\n  Lastly, we want to develop a vaccine. I must tell you that I was very \nencouraged by the individuals involved in actual vaccine development \nwho were at the roundtable discussion I had--I was encouraged about the \nfact that later this summer they will start clinical trials on vaccines \nthat they hope will produce a way to immunize a population from being \nsubject to the Zika virus.\n  That is very exciting, but before we get too excited, I was sobered \nby the discussion in which I was told that the first rounds of these \nvaccines are going to be rather difficult, that you may have to take it \nseveral times, that it may be of a very short duration, and that it \nwill take more time before we can develop the types of vaccines that \nare efficient and where it will be perhaps once in a lifetime that you \nwould need to take them to protect you from the Zika virus \nindefinitely.\n  And this is also the challenge: The experts who were there on Monday \nsaid this is not just a one-time-only situation; we can expect that the \nZika virus will be with us in the future.\n  So let me give you some of the takeaways from this discussion that \ntook place at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and Dr. Wen, who is the health \ncommissioner for Baltimore City, made this point when we were talking \nabout the money. I went through the $1.9 billion the administration has \nrequested. I went through the different agencies, both domestic and \ninternational, that would benefit from that $1.9 billion. I then \ncompared it to the $1.1 billion which has been acted on by the Senate \nand showed the differences.\n  For example, if my math is correct, NIH would receive $77 million \nless under the $1.1 billion than the $1.9 billion. We had people from \nNIH at that roundtable talking about the research being done right now \nto develop medicines and treatments that we hope will minimize the risk \nof a birth defect for those who have been affected. No, we don't know \nhow to cure it. We don't have a treatment that can cure the Zika virus, \nbut we are hopeful that we will be able to develop the medical \nprotocols to minimize for those who are infected the risk of having a \nchild with a birth defect or developing the neurological damage. We \ncertainly don't want to slow that down, and so what I take away from \nthat discussion is that we want to make sure they have all the tools \nthey need in order to deal with this crisis.\n  Dr. Wen pointed out that if you take a look at some of the action in \nthe House of Representatives where they are taking additional monies \naway from the funds that go to our local health departments, that is \ncounterproductive. Dr. Wen pointed out that the money she receives from \nthe public health emergency preparedness funding has been cut--cut--in \norder to pay for the Zika funds. Well, it is the emergency preparedness \nfunds that are used by our local health departments to reach out and \ndeal with the vulnerable populations, to make sure they understand the \nrisk factors and do what they can to prevent the risk factors.\n  I must also tell you that I was talking to our representative from \nMaryland at the Department of Agriculture, which does mosquito control. \nSeveral people talked to me about mosquito control. One of the things \nyou want to do is have a comprehensive plan to eradicate mosquitoes \nduring the season. That is very effective. The problem is that these \nbudgets are capped. They do not have the resources to do what they need \nto do. And they were telling me that we were better prepared a couple \nof years ago than we are today in dealing with mosquito control. So we \nneed to coordinate that effort and do a better job on mosquito control. \nWe can't take money away from these programs.\n  Mr. President, they made this point very clearly: The crisis is now. \nIt is here. It is here in America today, and it is going to get worse \nevery month. We know that. We need to act now on the funding in an \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill that can get to the \nPresident's desk today, not in an appropriations bill that has to go \nthrough the process, and that usually takes until the fall before we \ncan make those funds available.\n  I want to just go over a point that was made to me by one of the \nindividuals who was at this roundtable and who is an expert on cost \nissues. He was explaining the mathematics to me. Dr. Bruce Lee, a Johns \nHopkins University associate professor of international health, modeled \nthe cost issues. He used the most conservative estimates and said that \nour delay in dealing with the Zika virus will add an additional $2 \nbillion in cost. As I said, for every child born with a birth defect, \nwe estimate the cost to be about $10 million. If we can avoid 100 of \nthese children born with a birth defect, that is $1 billion. The first \nissue, of course, is the human cost of the Zika virus and the impact it \nhas on families and on those who are directly affected.\n  This, as Dr. Lee said, is an investment. The money we are making \navailable is an investment. What do we need to do? We need to make sure \nmoney is available for mosquito control. That is one way we can stop \nthe spread of the Zika virus. We have to make sure money is available \nfor our local health departments because they are reaching out to \npregnant women.\n  Dr. Wen made a very important point to me: In many cases, we are \ndealing with low-income families. They do not have air-conditioners. In \nsome cases, they do not even have screens. And they are going to be \nmore susceptible to the Zika virus because of mosquitoes. So they have \nto reach out and do the things local health departments can do. And the \nBaltimore City Health Department has a leader on all of this, but they \nneed their resources. So we need to make certain we fund our local \nhealth departments. We certainly can't cut the funds being made \navailable.\n  We are also proud of the work done at NIH and the Centers for Disease \nControl. We have to make sure they have the funds they need so they can \ndevelop the ways we can test to make sure we know who has the Zika \nvirus and hopefully develop protocols for people who have the virus and \ndevelop a vaccine as quickly as possible that is efficient and can be \nwidely used to prevent the Zika virus from moving forward.\n  All that is possible. I left the discussion in Baltimore with hope. \nThere is a way of dealing with it, but we have to express the urgency \nthis crisis demands. And, yes, we need to be an international leader. \nPart of this is U.S. leadership globally. This is not the last crisis \nwe are going to have. U.S. leadership helped avoid a worse \ninternational crisis than we saw with Ebola. As a result, we have now \ndeveloped health capacities in many countries around the world to deal \nwith the next pandemic. We know there will be another episode in the \nfuture. We need to prepare today for this.\n  There is no more fundamental responsibility of the government than to \nkeep our people safe. We have the opportunity to respond in the right \nway to the Zika virus, but it requires Congress to provide the tools so \nthat the experts in this area can do their work and develop the medical \nprotocols that deal with this, get the information out to the public so \nthey can protect themselves in the best way possible using pesticides, \nusing insect repellants, using common sense, and not traveling to areas \nthat are high-risk areas, particularly if they are pregnant or \nintending to start a family. They can take the right precautions, and \nwe can develop a vaccine that will protect people not only in this \ncountry but globally from this health care crisis. I am convinced we \ncan get it done. Let's start today by passing the funding necessary so \nour agencies can do the work.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Department \nof Labor's fiduciary rule.\n  Over the past year Nebraska's small business owners, retirees, \ninsurance and financial professionals, and individuals in a wide range \nof other industries have expressed their concerns regarding this \nfiduciary rule. Unfortunately, the negative feedback I hear has only \ngrown since the final version of this rule was published last month.\n\n[[Page S3083]]\n\n  This dense and complicated rule would change the definition of a \nfiduciary and what constitutes investment advice. In short, the rule \ncould make it more difficult for many individuals to open and to \nmaintain IRAs. It could also lead to fewer companies offering 401(k) \nplans for their employees.\n  If the rule is implemented, lower income savers may face a \ndisadvantage compared to wealthier consumers with higher account \nbalances. It is often convenient for regulators in Washington to claim \nthey are protecting the middle class, but that is the very segment \nwhich stands to lose the most from this new rule. Wealthier consumers \nand larger businesses often have the resources to comply with costly \nregulations, but small businesses are already struggling to stay \nafloat. This rule could further hamper their operations by pricing them \nout of the market.\n  Because of these and other concerns, I joined my colleagues to \ncosponsor the Senate version of the joint resolution of disapproval of \nthis rule. An identical resolution passed the House on April 28 by a \nwide margin, and later today the Senate will vote to pass the House \nresolution and send it to President Obama's desk.\n  Congress has already offered responsible solutions to the problems \nthis rule is trying to address. For example, I am a cosponsor of \nlegislation introduced by Senator Mark Kirk, the Strengthening Access \nto Valuable Education and Retirement Support--or SAVERS--Act, as well \nas legislation introduced by Senator Isakson, the Affordable Retirement \nAdvice Protection Act. Both of these bills would protect Americans who \nare saving for retirement without forcing them into the fixed-fee \narrangements the fiduciary rule would, in many circumstances, mandate. \nThese arrangements could create new roadblocks, making it harder--it \nwill make it harder for consumers to receive financial advice.\n  Nebraskans depend on this financial guidance to plan their futures \nand also to provide for their families. Washington bureaucrats should \nnot be dictating whom you can hire and what investments you can make. \nIt is time to draw the line and to stop this injection of government \ninto the free market.\n  I am proud to fight on behalf of Nebraskans and their families for \ntheir freedom to make the best financial decisions for their own \nfuture, and I urge my colleagues to vote with me in support of this \nresolution of disapproval.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                               Zika Virus\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, a poll last month found that 4 in 10 \nAmericans had heard little or nothing about the Zika virus, and many \nothers were unaware that it was a risk to the United States. The likely \nreason for this is that the virus isn't yet being transmitted locally \nhere in the United States.\n  But for all of us in Congress, this is not an excuse for inaction. \nOur job is to anticipate threats, not just to respond to them. We have \nall the information we need to know that the Zika virus is bad and is \npotentially about to get worse.\n  In fact, I believe it won't be long before virtually all of our \npeople have heard of this virus, are concerned about it, and want to \nknow why their leaders aren't doing more to fight it. They want to know \nwhat we are doing now. Sadly, the answer is not enough. Even though the \nproblem has been steadily getting worse, Congress has refused to treat \nit with the urgency I believe it deserves.\n  There was a time when Zika was considered a foreign virus, but that \nis no longer the case. As of today, there are now 544 cases in the \nmainland United States, with more being confirmed almost daily. All of \nthose so far are travel related, but there are also 832 cases locally \ntransmitted in American territories, mostly in Puerto Rico. If the \nproblem is there, it won't be long before it is here on the mainland.\n  Just this week, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \nDiseases, which is the government's top authority on these issues, \nwarned that mosquitoes carrying Zika will begin infecting Americans in \nthe next ``month or so.'' Once those mosquitoes are here, they are \ngoing to reproduce. As soon as we have one case of Zika transmitted \nlocally by a mosquito, there will be others that will follow shortly \nthereafter.\n  Just a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control announced that \n157 pregnant women in the United States and another 122 in U.S. \nterritories have shown signs of infection from the Zika virus. This \nshould be another wake-up call for the Congress. Knowing that there are \nat least 279 pregnant women in the United States with likely Zika virus \ninfections means we also potentially have at least 279 unborn children \nat risk of microcephaly, and we should be doing all we can to save \nthese human beings.\n  So we have a limited amount of time to brace ourselves and get a \nheadstart on confronting this threat. Keep in mind that there is not \nyet a vaccine for Zika. There is no cure for the conditions and for the \nbirth defects it causes. So for all of us as Americans but especially \nfor all of us as elected leaders, it is long past due to take this \nvirus seriously, because the virus is not just serious; this virus is \ndeadly serious, and so far the Congress is failing this test.\n  I am proud of the work done here in the Senate to pass a funding \nmeasure. It may not have been as much as we may ultimately need, but at \nleast at $1.1 billion, a significant amount of money is going to go \ntoward fighting this threat.\n  To date, in the House, the story is different. Last week, the House \npassed a $622 million package. This is about a third of what was \noriginally requested. The funds were secured by redirecting money \napproved to respond to the Ebola outbreak in 2014. I want to be wrong \nabout this, but I fear that $622 million is simply not going to be \nenough to deal with this problem if it heads in the direction that the \ndoctors and the experts are telling us it is headed.\n  So I come here on the floor of the Senate today to urge our \ncolleagues in the House and its leadership to realize that this threat \nis knocking on our door and the opportunity to get out ahead of this \nproblem is quickly slipping away. Within a month, we are likely to have \na very different situation on our hands with regards to Zika. Not only \nhave we delayed action for far too long already, but we are not \nexpecting any action this week before Congress goes into recess next \nweek. In other words, it is likely Congress will let at least--at \nleast--another 2 weeks go by on this issue without any action.\n  So I urge the American people to make next week a tough one on those \nwho are home from Congress who have refused to take meaningful action \nto confront Zika because they need to hear from you.\n  To any Members of Congress who don't receive pressure at home next \nweek, you should know that you soon enough will. While only a portion \nof our constituents are currently concerned about Zika, that will \nchange the moment the first case locally transmitted by a mosquito is \nconfirmed in the mainland United States. Then we are going to have to \nanswer to those who want to know why we didn't act, and, quite frankly, \nwe are not going to have a satisfying answer. Waiting to act until we \nhave a panic on our hands is not leadership.\n  So I encourage the House to act on the scale the American people need \nit to act, and I urge Congress to send a bill to the President as soon \nas possible regarding this matter. I hope we will properly fund this \nfight so we can win it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:45 \np.m., all time be expired on H.J. Res. 88.\n\n[[Page S3084]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. For the information of all of our colleagues, we \nexpect two votes at 4:45 this afternoon. The first vote will be on the \npassage of H.J. Res. 88, and the second vote will be on the motion to \nproceed to S.J. Res. 28.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, today Americans have enough to worry \nabout. Questioning the advice they get for their retirement savings \naccounts should not have to be one of them.\n  We finally have a new protection on the books that would help protect \nseniors' retirement savings from biased retirement advice. It is called \nthe fiduciary rule, and it is pretty simple. It says if financial \nadvisers are giving people advice on their retirement accounts, they \nshould put their clients' best interests ahead of their own. But with \nthe resolution that is before us, Republicans want to prevent that rule \nfrom ever helping people to save up for retirement. Instead, they are \ndead set on saving the status quo that has allowed financial advisers \nto line their own pockets at the expense of people trying to save for \ntheir retirement. After a lifetime of hard work, all seniors should \nhave the chance to live out their golden years on firm financial \nfooting and with peace of mind.\n  Once again, I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their vote to \nmove to this resolution. I think we can count this, frankly, as a \nvictory for the American taxpayer rather than certain special \ninterests.\n  I would like to begin by making clear in the Record the groups that \nare supporting this resolution: the National Retail Federation, the \nFood Marketing Institute, Taxpayers for Protection Alliance, National \nTaxpayers Union, Taxpayers for Common Sense, the Heritage\n\n[[Page S3085]]\n\nFoundation, FreedomWorks, Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council, \nCitizens Against Government Waste, Center for Individual Freedom, \nIndependent Women's Voice, R Street Institute, Campaign for Liberty, \nthe Retail Industry Leaders Association, the American Frozen Food \nInstitute, and the list goes on and on and on.\n  Ten times--ten times--the Government Accountability Office has said \nthe same thing over and over, and that is that this program is \nduplicative and it is unnecessary. It is unfortunate we are spending \ntens of millions of dollars every year on a program that is duplicative \nand unnecessary.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a Wall Street \nJournal editorial entitled ``Ending the Catfish Fight.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 24, 2016]\n\n                        Ending the Catfish Fight\n\n\n The Senate can roll back a protectionist barrier to freer trade with \n                                  Asia\n\n       President Obama is in Vietnam and Japan this week, where \n     he'll probably be getting an earful about America's rising \n     antitrade sentiment and the threat that poses to the Trans-\n     Pacific Partnership trade deal. So here's hoping the U.S. \n     Senate can provide at least some leadership by ending the \n     protectionist treatment of one of Vietnam's most valuable \n     exports: catfish.\n       Vietnamese exporters have competed with U.S. catfish \n     farmers from the Mississippi Delta since the 1990s. Trouble \n     began in 2002, when Mississippi Republican Thad Cochran and \n     other Southern lawmakers barred foreigners from calling their \n     product ``catfish'' because technically it's pangasius, also \n     called basa or swai, an Asian cousin with similar taste, \n     texture and whiskers.\n       This didn't stop Americans from buying the tasty, cheaper \n     imports, and neither did a round of spurious antidumping \n     tariffs imposed on the Vietnamese fish in 2003.\n       So Mr. Cochran went further, using the 2008 farm bill to \n     transfer oversight of catfish to the Department of \n     Agriculture from the Food and Drug Administration, even \n     though the meat and poultry experts at the USDA regulate no \n     other fish. This required classifying pangasius as catfish \n     after all, and claiming that there was a public-health risk \n     where none existed. The true motive was to impose high new \n     compliance costs on Vietnamese exporters, who might then be \n     priced out of the U.S. market.\n       The Government Accountability Office has slammed the new \n     inspection regime 10 times, estimating its cost at $30 \n     million to start and $14 million annually to operate, as \n     compared with $700,000 a year for the original program. \n     Repeal would ``save taxpayers millions of dollars annually \n     without affecting the safety of catfish intended for human \n     consumption,'' says the GAO. It would also let Americans keep \n     buying the fish they prefer, while eliminating the likelihood \n     that Vietnam and others will sue at the World Trade \n     Organization and retaliate against U.S. exports of beef, \n     soybeans and other products.\n       Yet multiple bipartisan efforts at repeal have failed, so \n     the wasteful program took effect in March, beginning an 18-\n     month phase-in period. Exporters in Vietnam are already \n     feeling squeezed, and our sources say that Vietnam's top \n     leader planned to raise the issue with Mr. Obama in Hanoi, \n     echoing years of complaints from lower-level officials.\n       The good news is that more than 30 Senators from both \n     parties introduced a measure Monday to repeal the program in \n     a straight up-or-down vote under the Congressional Review \n     Act. That may be easier than attaching it to larger bills, as \n     in the past, that Mr. Cochran and his allies could block. A \n     vote could come before Mr. Obama leaves Asia. Repeal would \n     boost U.S. credibility in a region that needs trade \n     leadership.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, quoting from that article:\n\n       President Obama is in Vietnam and Japan this week, where \n     he'll probably be getting an earful about America's rising \n     antitrade sentiment and the threat that poses to the Trans-\n     Pacific Partnership trade deal. So here's hoping the U.S. \n     Senate can provide at least some leadership by ending the \n     protectionist treatment of one of Vietnam's most valuable \n     exports: catfish.\n\n  This is from the Wall Street Journal. Most of us--at least on this \nside of the aisle--have a great deal of respect for the opinions that \nare on the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Vietnamese exporters have competed with U.S. catfish \n     farmers from the Mississippi delta since the 1990s. Trouble \n     began in 2002, when Mississippi Republican Thad Cochran and \n     other southern lawmakers barred foreigners from calling their \n     product ``catfish'' because technically it's pangasius, also \n     called basa or swai, an Asian cousin with similar taste, \n     texture and whiskers.

Now, sometimes we don't always agree, but this \nis why 10 times the Government Accountability Office has found this \nprogram duplicative and a waste of tax dollars. This is why the \nCitizens Against Government Waste, the Taxpayers for Common Sense, the \nNational Taxpayers Union, Heritage Foundation, FreedomWorks, and the \nCenter for Individual Freedom--literally every watchdog organization in \nthis town and in America--support this resolution.\n  The disapproval resolution is the means to stop this wasteful rule \nbecause all efforts to work within the normal procedures have been \nblocked. Whether it be the farm bill or TPA, efforts for the Senate to \ndebate this issue have been shut off. The sole time the Senate voted on \nthis program, it voted overwhelmingly to eliminate the program.\n  I think at least on this side of the aisle there is an organization \nwe are pretty respectful of, and it is the Heritage Foundation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na statement from Heritage Action for America, which weighs in \nregularly, as we know, on this issue.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From Heritage Action for America, May 24, 2016]\n\n       ``Yes'' on CRA To Block the Catfish Program (S.J. Res. 28)\n\n                            (By Dan Holler)\n\n       On Tuesday, the Senate is expected to vote on S.J. Res. 28, \n     a resolution offered by Sen. John McCain under the \n     Congressional Review Act (CRA) that would block the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) catfish inspection rule.\n       For over a century, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \n     has been responsible for inspecting and regulating the \n     nation's food supply, including both domestic and imported \n     seafood. That was, however, until the 2008 Farm Bill carved \n     out catfish to instead be regulated by the USDA. As a result, \n     facilities that process seafood will now have to comply with \n     both USDA (for catfish) and FDA (for all other seafood) \n     regulations. These overlapping, duplicative, and possibly \n     conflicting regulatory regimes will cost taxpayers an \n     unnecessary $140 million.\n       There is no policy justification for carving out catfish \n     from the broader seafood regulatory structure. To wit, the \n     Government Accountability Office (GAO), a non-partisan group \n     generally reserved and measured in its conclusions, entitled \n     its report on the program: ``Responsibility for Inspecting \n     Catfish Should Not Be Assigned to USDA.'' GAO has elsewhere \n     concluded (as part of it's ``High Risk'' of waste series) \n     that the catfish program results in duplication and wasted \n     spending while in no way enhancing food safety.\n       The duplicative regulatory requirements also have trade \n     implications, as foreign exporters selling catfish would also \n     have to abide by both the FDA and USDA's regulatory \n     structures, and specifically would require imports alone to \n     abide by a new ``equivalency'' test that would effectively \n     block out foreign catfish for years. This could harm \n     consumers by limiting competition and choice in the catfish \n     market. In\n\n[[Page S3086]]\n\n     fact, this appears to be precisely the motivation: To use a \n     non-tariff trade barrier to burden foreign competitors in an \n     attempt to help domestic providers corner the market. As the \n     New York Times reported, Vietnam has taken particular offense \n     to the new rule, and rightly so:\n       ``Vietnam, a large exporter of catfish and one of the \n     nations in the trade talks, says it is nothing more than a \n     trade barrier in disguise.\n       `And it's not even a good disguise; it's clearly a thinly \n     veiled attempt designed to keep out fish from countries like \n     Vietnam,' said Le Chi Dzung, who heads the economics section \n     at the Vietnamese Embassy in Washington.''\n       While this $140 million program may appear small relative \n     to the overall budget picture, it nevertheless looms large as \n     a poster child of government cronyism, with special interests \n     benefiting at the expense of everyone else. It is difficult \n     to state it better than former FDA seafood inspection chief, \n     Bryon Truglio, who stated:\n       ``[A] group of lobbyists and a trade association \n     representing elements of the American catfish producers . . . \n     has bullied Congress into moving catfish regulation to the \n     USDA, making it harder for their foreign competitors to enter \n     the US market. This move is a win for US catfish producers, \n     but ultimately, a loss for American taxpayers and \n     consumers.''\n       Fortunately, Congress may actually have the chance to block \n     the catfish rule this year. The Obama Administration \n     acknowledges the duplication inherent in the USDA's catfish \n     inspection program, and proposed eliminating it in a recent \n     budget. Despite having advanced the rule--apparently agreeing \n     (for once) it must abide by clear congressional statute and \n     intent--Obama Administration opposes the rule. By sending the \n     President this CRA for him to sign, Congress will allow this \n     duplicative and wasteful catfish inspection rule to be \n     blocked consistent with the rule of law.\n       Heritage Action supports S.J. Res. 28 and will include it \n     as a key vote on our legislative scorecard.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, quoting from the statement of Heritage \nAction for America, they say:\n\n       There is no policy justification for carving out catfish \n     from the broader seafood regulatory structure.\n\n  The statement goes on to say:\n\n       While this $140 million program may appear small relative \n     to the overall budget picture, it nevertheless looms large as \n     a poster child of government cronyism, with special interests \n     benefiting at the expense of everyone else.

Kelly Ayotte,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ayotte, As organizations that represent \n     millions of taxpayers across the country, we write to support \n     your efforts to repeal the United States Department of \n     Agriculture (USDA) catfish inspection program. We are pleased \n     to see you and your cosponsors, Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) \n     and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), using the Congressional Review \n     Act to repeal one of the most demonstrably wasteful and \n     duplicative programs ever enacted.\n       The unnecessary and duplicative bureaucracy created by this \n     program has now been targeted by the Government \n     Accountability Office (GAO) a record ten times: February \n     2011, March 2011, May 2012, February 2013, April 2013, April \n     2014, December 2014, February 2015, April 2015, and April \n     2016.\n       The USDA spent $19.9 million to develop and study the \n     catfish inspection program, then told GAO it would cost the \n     federal government an additional ``$14 million annually'' to \n     run the program. This after GAO found the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) currently spends ``less than $700,000 \n     annually to inspect catfish.'' If the cost of other, similar \n     regulatory programs is any guide, the USDA program will cost \n     far more than the estimated $14 million.\n       The GAO also notes that it not only wastes taxpayer dollars \n     and duplicates work already being done by the FDA, it \n     actually weakens, rather than strengthens, our food safety \n     systems:\n       ``. . . the agency's proposed catfish inspection program \n     further fragments the federal oversight system for food \n     safety without demonstrating that there is a problem with \n     catfish or a need for a new federal program.''\n       Eliminating wasteful federal spending and burdensome \n     regulation is a very difficult task, especially when \n     proceeding one program at a time. But the value to taxpayers \n     of doing so is undeniable. Thus, as you gather support for \n     S.J. Res 28, please know we strongly support this effort to \n     close the book on this now infamous and embarrassing example \n     of government waste.\n       The USDA catfish work is an embarrassing waste of tax \n     dollars and so overtly duplicative a program it belongs in \n     the annals of Washington waste history.\n           Sincerely,\n       David Williams, President, Taxpayers Protection Alliance; \n     Norm Singleton, President, Campaign for Liberty; Jeff \n     Mazzella, President, Center for Individual Freedom; Tom \n     Schatz, President, Council for Citizens Against Government \n     Waste; Sabrina Schaffer, Executive Director, Independent \n     Women's Forum; Heather R.

Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 23, 2016.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators McConnell and Reid: We understand the Senate \n     may soon consider a resolution of disapproval of the United \n     States Department of Agriculture (``USDA'') catfish \n     inspection program. We support this resolution and write to \n     explain the negative impacts this program will have if fully \n     implemented by the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service \n     (``FSIS'').\n       The USDA program was created in 2008 and shifts food safety \n     regulatory authority over certain domestic and imported \n     seafood from the Food and Drug Administration (``FDA'') to \n     FSIS. The program applies to imported pangasius, a mild white \n     fish that is today the sixth most popular seafood item in the \n     United States. FSIS issued a final rule in December 2015, and \n     a resolution of disapproval was filed in the Senate soon \n     thereafter.\n       The USDA program is of great concern to our member \n     companies. The shift of food safety oversight from FDA to \n     FSIS for this specific product establishes a nontariff trade \n     barrier against imported pangasius. Exporting countries will \n     have to obtain an ``equivalency'' determination from FSIS if \n     they wish to preserve their producers'' ability to export to \n     the United States. Because the FSIS equivalency process \n     routinely takes five years and sometimes over a decade to \n     complete, this will create for those producers an \n     insurmountable barrier to the U.S. market.\n       Thus in a single stroke more than a fifth of the ``value \n     white fish'' supply in the United States--about 250 million \n     pounds a year--\n\n[[Page S3087]]\n\n     will disappear. This reduction in supply will cause a \n     dramatic increase in prices for our companies and our \n     customers who rely on an affordable product for fish sticks \n     in the freezer aisle and popular fish and chips menu items in \n     restaurants. In addition, we are aware of persistent calls \n     for expansion of the program to even more popular tilapia and \n     shrimp. Such calls suggest that the existing USDA program is \n     just the beginning.\n       Nor is the program justified on a food safety basis. USDA \n     concedes that not a single case of Salmonella has been \n     attributed to pangasius (or, for that matter, to domestic \n     catfish) since establishment of the current FDA seafood \n     regulatory approach in 1998. The Government Accountability \n     Office has concluded that the USDA program will harm Federal \n     food safety oversight by fracturing seafood regulation \n     between two different regulatory agencies. For that and other \n     reasons, GAO on ten different occasions has identified the \n     program as a waste of tens of millions of taxpayer dollars \n     and has urged the Congress to eliminate it.\n       The United States must have a rigorous, effective food \n     safety system. That system, however, should not prevent \n     retailers and restaurants from sourcing the seafood that \n     meets the demand of middle class American families for \n     affordable, accessible protein. We urge you to support the \n     resolution of disapproval of the USDA catfish inspection \n     program, under the Congressional Review Act.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jennifer Hatcher,\n       Senior Vice President, Food Marketing Institute.\n     David French,\n       Senior Vice President, National Retail Federation.\n     Jennifer Safavian,\n       Executive Vice President, Retail Industry Leaders \n     Association.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the National Restaurant Association \nstrongly supports what we are trying to do, and the list goes on and \non.\n  I know there are my colleagues who want to speak on this issue, but \nthis is more than a vote on catfish, I would say to my colleagues. What \nthis is all about is government overriding the taxpayers of America, \nwhich is why we are seeing so many of these watchdog organizations \nsupporting what we are trying to do.\n  Some of us, including this Member, have been surprised--been \nsurprised by the American people's votes recently for both parties, \nboth for Mr. Trump, who has never stood for public office before and \nhas based his campaign, to a large degree, on campaigning against \nWashington, DC, and those of us who serve here, and of course on the \nother side is Senator Sanders, a Member of this body, but clearly one \nwho is running his campaign against the status quo. So we have been \nsurprised to see this uprising of the American voter, and I don't \nbelieve there is a Member of this body on either side of the aisle who \nwould have predicted 6 months ago that we would be where we are today.\n  This kind of program is exactly what our hard-working citizenry who \nwork hard and pay their taxes--they don't get it. They don't get it, \nwhen the GAO 10 times--10 times--said that this program is wasteful and \nduplicative, and tens of millions of dollars are being wasted on behalf \nof one industry, and that is the catfish industry--and it has been done \nby powerful appropriators, powerful members of the Appropriations \nCommittee. There was never a debate. There was never a bill before this \nbody. There was never amendments proposed. It was put in a large \nomnibus appropriations bill and kept there.\n  So sometimes we wonder why the American people have had it, why they \nare fed up. This is the best example I can come up with recently, $30 \nmillion per year being wasted on a duplicative--10 times--10 times that \nthe GAO has said it is not only unneeded but unnecessary: a special \ncatfish office, $14 million a year.\n  I don't know how many low-income taxpayers make $14 million, but I \nknow this; that when I go back to Arizona and tell my constituents that \nwe have a program GAO 10 times has said is totally unnecessary and \nduplicative and the government is spending $14 million of their tax \ndollars on it, they don't get it. They don't get it.\n  Then, after they don't get it for a while, they say: We have had it. \nThey say: We have had it. We have had it with programs that nobody ever \ndebated, nobody ever discussed. There was never a vote. It has been in \nexistence since 2012, but it began in 2002.\n  So this is why Americans are fed up. This is why our hard-working \ncitizenry does not understand why we would ever have such a program \nthat wastes $12 million per year and, I believe, was $30 million to set \nup. That is chickenfeed to us. It is in the margins. To them, it is \nsomething. It means, to them, that we are not taking care of them. It \nmeans we are taking care of a powerful interest called the catfish \nindustry, which happens to be in a number of Southern States.\n  There was a large number of Republican votes against this proposal--\nas I recall, a majority of Republican votes, Republicans who say: We \nare watchdogs of the Treasury. We don't waste money the way the \nDemocrats do. But on the resolution just taken, if it had been only up \nto Republican Members, we wouldn't be debating this right now. Isn't \nthat a little embarrassing? Isn't that a little embarrassing that a \nmajority of Members on this side would not even vote to at least debate \nthis?\n  All I can say is I have been fighting this issue for about 12 or 13 \nyears. We finally now have a chance to get rid of it. Does it make the \ndebt and the deficit any less? Is it a huge undertaking that somehow is \ngoing to save the taxpayers billions of dollars? I will tell you what. \nIf we keep this program in, with a majority vote of the United States \nSenate, I tell my colleagues on this side of the aisle: Just don't go \nback and say you are a fiscal conservative. Say you take care of the \nfat catfish industry. Maybe some people like that. But don't go back \nand call yourself a fiscal conservative.\n  I know others want to speak. They are going to raise problems; that \nthere could be contamination, there could be all these kinds of things, \nthat it is the end of Western civilization as we know it, it is going \nto be worse than Ebola; that it means we don't trust the Food and Drug \nAdministration, the people who are supposed to be inspecting all \nseafood--and if that is true of catfish, don't we have to worry about \nall the other seafood that the Food and Drug Administration inspects? \nOf course not.\n  So we are going to hear that it is the end of Western civilization, \nthat there has been some pollution detected, et cetera. All we have to \ndo is have the Food and Drug Administration do their job and inspect \nall seafood, just as they do today, including catfish. We don't have to \nhave a new $30 million bureaucracy set up at a cost of $14 million per \nyear.\n  I have a lot more to say, but the hour grows late. I just hope we \nwill show the American taxpayer that we are at least willing, in a \nsmall way, to eliminate some government duplication and waste. I say \nthat there is a lot of symbolic aspects of this vote that far exceed \n$14 million per year. It is now going to be a vote on how we do \nbusiness in the United States Senate. If we don't succeed in \neliminating this program, I then think we would be embarrassed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business and have my time charged for the proponents of the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I agree completely with my fellow Senator \nfrom Arizona on this catfish issue. We have a lot of fiscal challenges \nahead. If we hope to tackle the immense fiscal challenges ahead, we \nhave to vote right on issues like this. Where there is duplication and \nwaste going on, we have to tackle it. So I commend those who are \nsponsoring this initiative.\n\n\n                       Tribute to Matthew Specht\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to recognize Matthew Specht as the longest \nserving member of my staff. He has dedicated the past 15 years of his \nlife in service to the people of Arizona.\n  In that time, Matt has established himself as both a top-tier \npolitical strategist and one of my most trusted advisers. He has done \nso without fanfare and without self-promotion. That kind of modesty is \nrefreshing in this line of work. So I obviously had to write this \nspeech about him without telling him about it.\n  I first met Matt back in the year 2000, when he volunteered for my \nfirst campaign. Now, at that time, the main area of advertising for us \nwas the 4-by-8 big signs that we put by the side of the road. Trying to \nget them to stay by the side of the road was difficult. Arizona is dry, \nthe ground is hard, and we\n\n[[Page S3088]]\n\nhad to get big post pounders and pound big stakes, big posts in the \nground. Matt was out there with the post pounder, lifted a little too \nhigh over the post, and it came down on his head, creating a large \nwound that bled profusely. Another campaign staffer ran over to help \nhim and immediately fainted at the sight of blood. So there we had two \ncampaign workers on the side of the road. It looked like a crime scene, \nwhen it was just a campaign activity, but Matt gratefully recovered--a \nfew stitches and he was back on the job.\n  After helping me win that race, Matt came to Washington as my first \nlegislative correspondent and systems administrator. Now, if you want \nto test someone under pressure, put them in charge of troubleshooting \nBlackBerrys in the early time of BlackBerrys. It was a tough thing, but \nMatt handled it like a pro. To his relief and our great benefit, he was \nsoon promoted to press secretary.\n  It was in communications that Matt really came into his own. In the \nearly days of the fight against congressional earmarks, Matt's \nforesight and creativity played a big role in raising awareness in the \nmedia. You can thank or blame Matt for many of the gut-wrenching bad \npuns that were part of my ``Egregious Earmark of the Week'' series. Of \ncourse, I claim all the good puns as mine and all the bad ones were \nhis, but he knows that is not the case.\n  Let me just say, as a press secretary, if you can handle doing a \nsegment on the ``Daily Show,'' you can handle just about anything, and \nMatt did it well.\n  He would eventually rise to the top of my staff, serving as chief of \nstaff during my final years in the House and through my election to the \nSenate.\n  When I took this seat in the Senate, Matt--who never intended to stay \nin Washington for more than a couple years--returned home to Arizona \nafter 10 years in Washington.\n  Being director of my State office in Arizona is no easy task. There \nare countless veterans issues, loads of immigration casework, endless \nborder issues, and a myriad of public lands disputes, but Matt has \nhandled it all in stride.\n  Truly a man of few words, Matt has long been a steady and calming \nleader on my staff. He is well known on my staff for his amazing quick \nwit as well. His pranks have become the stuff of legend among my staff. \nFortunately, for Matt, none of the pranks are appropriate to detail in \na setting like this. Suffice it to say that birthdays in my office are \ncelebrated with a mixture of fear and trepidation.\n  Matt is truly a staffer's staffer, it goes without saying, but his \ncalm, steady leadership, his wealth of knowledge, his informed, \ndispassionate advice, and his sense of humor will be dearly missed as \nhe moves to the private sector.\n  The only consolation with Matt leaving is that he will have more time \nto spend with his beloved cats. He is a proud cat guy, something I will \nnever understand. I am glad I will still be able to call on Matt for \nhis wise counsel.\n  Thank you, Matt, for your 15 years of honorable service. You will be \nmissed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to S.J. Res. 28, and \nI have to comment on a number of allegations made by my friend from \nArizona and by other people who support the resolution.\n  I have in my hand a statement from the Budget Committee that is \nrequired for resolutions of this sort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this statement be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     From Budget Committee: Congressional Review Act on Mandatory \n                   Siluriformes (Catfish) Inspection\n\n       S.J. Res. 28, A joint resolution providing for \n     congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United \n     States Code, of the rule submitted by the Secretary of \n     Agriculture relating to inspection of fish of the order \n     Siluriformes (Senator McCain).\n       The Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee \n     concludes that S.J. Res. 28 (Senator John McCain, R-AZ), a \n     joint resolution providing for congressional disapproval of a \n     rule submitted by the Department of Agriculture relating to \n     mandatory Siluriformes (catfish) inspection, is not subject \n     to a budgetary point of order.\n       S.J. Res. 28 disapproves of the rule submitted by the \n     Department of Agriculture on ``Mandatory Inspection of Fish \n     of the Order Siluriformes and Products Derived From Such \n     Fish'' that was published in the Federal Register on December \n     2, 2015. The rule implements Siluriformes inspection under \n     the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Department's Food Safety \n     and Inspection Service (FSIS). Enactment of the resolution \n     means such rule shall have no force or effect and may not be \n     reissued in substantially the same form.\n       This memo is for informational purposes only. The \n     Congressional Review Act, which provides for expedited \n     consideration of a resolution of disapproval in the Senate, \n     waives all points of order against such a resolution, which \n     includes any potential budget points of order (5 U.S.C. \n     802(d)(1)).\n\n\n                            POINTS OF ORDER\n\n       Under the Congressional Review Act, budget points of order \n     are waived against resolutions of disapproval. Based on staff \n     analysis of the direct spending estimate provided by the \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO), S.J. Res. 28 would not \n     trigger any budget points of order. A revenue estimate is not \n     available at this time.\n\n\n                                  COST\n\n       CBO has determined that S.J. Res. 28 would not have any \n     impact on direct spending, but has not produced a complete \n     estimate of the budgetary effects of this resolution at this \n     time.\n\n\n                           PROCEDURAL STATUS\n\n       The Senate is expected to consider S.J. Res. 28 this week, \n     possibly as early as Tuesday, May 24, 2016.\n\n  Mr. WICKER. From the Budget Committee, with regard to S.J. Res. 28, \nwe get down to the place where it says ``COST,'' and it says that ``CBO \nhas determined that S.J. Res. 28 would not have any impact on direct \nspending. . . . ''\n  So I would submit to my colleagues that they can say as many times as \nthey want to, they can say until they are blue in the face that this \nprogram at USDA is costly and we are saving money, but it doesn't \nsquare with the information we have from the Budget Committee, quoting \nCBO that says you don't save any money by passing S.J. Res. 28. There \nmay be other reasons, but certainly it doesn't save money, according to \nthe Budget Committee information, which I have now entered into the \nRecord.\n\n  Why do we inspect catfish at all? We inspect it for the consumer. We \nwant to make sure that at restaurants, in grocery stores, and in our \nhomes, we are not consuming contaminated and adulterated product. Every \nbit of domestically raised, American farm-raised catfish is inspected \nby USDA. It is inspected just as other farm-raised meats are inspected \nby the USDA.\n  Until this new procedure went into effect in April, FDA inspected \nimported catfish. So you had the strange situation of 100 percent of \nfarm-raised American catfish being inspected by USDA, but our foreign \ncompetitors--Vietnam sending in catfish and FDA inspecting only 2 \npercent of that. Only 2 percent of imported Vietnamese catfish was \ninspected by the U.S. Government until this new inspection procedure \nwent into effect April 15. Since it has gone into effect, 100 percent \nof imported catfish has been inspected, just like 100 percent of \nAmerican-raised catfish. Isn't that fair? If we are going to inspect \nall American-produced catfish, isn't it fair to inspect our \ncompetitors'?\n  What has USDA found? This is what my colleagues seem to be missing. \nIn the short time USDA has been inspecting 100 percent of Vietnamese \ncatfish, they have found contaminated substances that would have been \nconsumed by Americans at restaurants and in homes, catfish purchased in \nsupermarkets. On May 12, USDA found crystal violet. Crystal violet \ncauses bladder cancer. Because USDA inspected the catfish coming in \nfrom Vietnam, American consumers were protected from this cancer-\ncausing substance. I think we ought to be grateful for the new law \nbecause it protected us from crystal violet, which causes bladder \ncancer.\n  A week later, on May 19, the USDA--once again inspecting, as they \nhave been required to do under the last two farm bills--found malachite \ngreen in Vietnamese catfish. Malachite green causes thyroid cancer, it \ncauses liver cancer, and it causes mammary gland cancer.\n  I would say to my colleagues who are so pleased we might go back to \nthe old regime, shouldn't we be proud of USDA for protecting Americans \nfrom cancer-\n\n[[Page S3089]]\n\ncausing substances--bladder cancer, thyroid cancer, liver cancer, \nmammary gland cancer? I take this seriously. I think Americans take \nthis seriously.\n  Since we find that this Vietnamese catfish comes in in contaminated \nform, aren't we glad we are inspecting more than 2 percent of it? No \none contends that I am wrong on this. FDA only inspected 2 percent. Now \nwe are inspecting the vast majority, if not all of it.\n  Again, my friends can say this is a duplicative program, but it \nsimply is not a duplicative program. FDA formerly did the inspections. \nThey ceased inspecting at the end of February of this year and USDA \ntook it over. That is not duplicative. According to the last two farm \nbills, FDA quit; USDA picked it up. Where is the duplication there?\n  We are told that the rule is a violation of trade policy, a WTO \nviolation. In fact, USDA has pointed out that equivalent standards are \napplied both to imported and domestic fish. There is no different \ntreatment. If we are going to look at all American catfish, we need to \nlook at all Vietnamese catfish. For the life of me, I cannot understand \nwhy we would want to do otherwise, particularly when you have crystal \nviolet and malachite green coming in.\n  Also, my friends on the other side of this issue say over and over \nagain that this is costly. As a matter of fact, USDA--which will \nimplement the program, is prepared to implement the program--says it \nwill cost $1.1 million annually to implement this new inspection \nprogram. That is a reasonable amount, and it is far different from the \nfigures that other agencies that are not going to actually be doing \nthis are talking about. USDA is going to do it, and they said we can do \nit for $1.1 million a year. That is not costly.\n  Once again, I would go back to what the Budget Committee said. There \nare no savings. There is no difference in direct spending if we pass \nthis rule or not. But there is a great deal of protection from not only \ncrystal violet, not only from malachite, but from enrofloxacin and \nfluoroquinolone. A 2009 draft version of the catfish inspection rule \nsaid the rule would yield ``a reduction of roughly 175,000 lifetime \ncancers.'' They are talking about saving Americans from contracting \ncancer, to the tune of 175,000 Americans, a reduction of 91.8 million \nexposures to antimicrobials and 23.2 million heavy metal exposures. So \nwe are not talking about something theoretical. We are not talking \nabout something that has to do with trade or good government. We are \ntalking about adulterated, contaminated catfish coming in and \nthreatening the consuming public.\n  Now that we have an inspection procedure that is working, we are told \nthat somehow it is good government to go back to the old way of only \nlooking at 2 percent of this suspect product coming in. I would hope \nthat, upon reflection, my colleagues would conclude that the farm bill \nwas right in 2008, that the farm bill was right in 2012, and that the \nAg Department was correct to follow the congressional dictates.\n  This is not an example of an agency--as we have seen so many times in \nthe Obama administration, this is not an example of the agency coming \nup with something they would like to do. They were following a House \nand Senate directive based on legislation passed here, passed down at \nthe other end of the building, and signed by the President on two \noccasions. This is not USDA overreach; this is USDA doing what has been \nrequired under law.\n  Let's prevent cancer-causing substances from coming into the United \nStates, let's vote no on this rule, and let's keep this new program, \nwhich is already working to protect the consuming public from very \nharsh chemicals that cause cancer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, the time will be charged equally to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of what, frankly, \nis an egregious example of why folks get very frustrated with \nWashington and what happens here; that is, what has been described as \none of Washington's most wasteful programs--the duplicative USDA \ncatfish inspection program, which was slipped in the farm bill in 2008.\n  All other fish species are inspected not by USDA but are inspected in \nthis country by the FDA. Yet, added to the 2008 farm bill was a \nprovision to create a special office within the USDA for the one \nspecies of catfish. We know they are bottom dwellers, but this was \nsomething that was done to protect domestic catfish producers, and it \nwas something that is wasting taxpayer dollars.\n  There have been 10 GAO reports, each finding that this inspection \nregime--set up especially for catfish but no other species--is \nduplicative and is a waste of taxpayer dollars.\n  The good-government groups, such as Citizens Against Government \nWaste, Taxpayers for Common Sense, the National Taxpayers Union, and \nmany of the other groups that my colleague Senator McCain cited on the \nfloor that are supporting the resolution to disapprove this duplicative \nrule, have called this program one of the most demonstrably wasteful \nand duplicative programs ever created. Boy, in Washington, that says a \nlot, to call something one of the most demonstrably wasteful and \nduplicative programs ever created. These groups have written that the \nGAO also notes that it not only wastes taxpayer dollars and duplicates \nwork already done by the FDA, but it actually weakens rather than \nstrengthens our food safety systems.\n  The agency's proposed catfish inspection program further fragments \nFederal oversight over our system for food safety without demonstrating \nthat there is a problem with catfish or a need for a new Federal \nprogram.\n  With all respect, I heard my colleague from Mississippi on the floor \nciting the most recent findings by the newly stood up USDA office for \nthe inspection of catfish talking about harmful contaminants in catfish \nthat the USDA intercepted. There are some facts that are conveniently \nmissing from this argument. First of all, when the FDA was inspecting \ncatfish--like they inspect all other fish in the country--at times, \nthey were also able to intercept contaminants found not only in catfish \nbut in other fish species. So the notion that the FDA couldn't find \nthese very same contaminants--well, guess what, folks, they did, just \nas they do every day when they are looking at ensuring that all of our \nfish species are appropriate for our public health and for us to \nconsume.\n  One of the interesting things about it is that not only would the FDA \nfind this in the catfish coming from overseas, but they have actually \nintercepted contaminants in the domestic catfish supply at times as \nwell. I think that is important for people to understand.\n  This notion that somehow we need to set up a special program within \nthe USDA for just catfish because that is the only way we can find \ncontaminants and protect the public health--apparently the FDA is able \nto do it for every other fish species, was able to do it before 2008, \nand yet we now have a separate office for the catfish, and the GAO \nfound that it cost us nearly $20 million extra to set up this special \noffice to inspect catfish for the one species.\n  In fact, my colleague from Mississippi serves on the Budget \nCommittee, as I do, and he mentioned on the floor the fact that the CBO \nsaid that there will not be additional spending on this program. One \nthing that is important for people to understand--and those of us who \nserve on the Budget Committee understand this--is that the Budget \nCommittee said that there is no additional mandatory spending. That \nmeans mandatory spending that has already been set aside in the budget. \nWe separate spending in the Federal Government--mandatory versus \ndiscretionary spending. Guess what? Yes, there isn't mandatory spending \non this, but, conveniently, what has been left out is that there is \nabsolutely discretionary spending on this program.\n  In fact, GAO has found that it not only cost $20 million to set up \nthis new inspection regime, but they have estimated that it costs $14 \nmillion a year in discretionary spending to run this new inspection \nregime for catfish.\n  I just want to make sure that people understand, for the record, that \nthis budget opinion that is being cited is really meaningless because \nit is saying there is no mandatory spending. Well, guess what? I could \ncome to the floor on almost any kind of domestic spending, whether it \nis on an issue of DOD,\n\n[[Page S3090]]\n\na weapons system, or anything we are talking about here, and tell you \nthat there is no mandatory spending on this, and the Budget Committee \nwould issue the same opinion.\n  What really matters is this: Are we spending any taxpayer dollars? \nThe answer at the end of the day is absolutely, because the dollars \nthat go to the USDA or the FDA are actually discretionary spending.\n  I hope my colleagues who are listening to this understand that this \nbudget opinion really means nothing. We are still spending taxpayer \ndollars that matter to you and me, and we could spend these millions of \ndollars much more effectively elsewhere than on a duplicative program \nfor catfish.\n  In fact, former FDA Safety Chief David Acheson commented that this \nduplicative program is ``everything that's wrong about the food-safety \nsystem. . . . It's food politics. It's not public health.'' For all the \nclaims that have been made on this floor about somehow needing to set \nup a separate inspection regime for catfish, the USDA itself said: \n``The true effectiveness of FSIS inspection for reducing catfish-\nassociated human illnesses is unknown.'' This is the USDA itself: \n``unknown.'' ``Also, the rate at which FSIS inspection will achieve its \nultimate reductions is unknown. . . . There is substantial uncertainty \nregarding the actual effectiveness of an FSIS''--meaning the USDA \ninspection regime--``catfish inspection program.''\n  That is not very promising. We already had an inspection regime in \nplace, as we do for every other fish species under the FDA, and that \ncosts us roughly $700,000 a year, according to the GAO reports, and \nnow, under what we have done with the duplicative inspection regime \nwith the USDA, it costs roughly $20 million to build a new inspection \nregime with new infrastructure in a different agency, and then roughly \n$14 million, according to the GAO. We just asked them again if they \ncould confirm the numbers that are being cited of it only costing $1.5 \nmillion. No, they can't confirm those numbers. There were 10 GAO \nreports defining duplicative and wasteful spending, yet here we are.\n  I was really shocked by the vote on the Senate floor. I was very \nshocked that my colleagues would have 10 GAO reports in front of them \nthat say this is a duplicative and wasteful program, and we already \nhave every other fish species inspected by the FDA. Yet we are going to \nset up a separate office for catfish. Almost every good government \ngroup that focuses on addressing wasteful spending in Washington has \ncalled this duplicative program egregious and really cited this as an \nexample of what is wrong when we are worried about taxpayer dollars and \nwhat happens in Washington.\n  I hope, as I look at the votes on the Senate floor, that as we \nproceed to this measure, my colleagues will look at these GAO reports, \nlisten to these good government organizations that have basically said \nthat this program is really a waste of taxpayer dollars, and that they \nwill support the resolution to disapprove this duplicative inspection \nprogram.\n  Before 2008, the FDA was inspecting catfish, and they were doing \ntheir job just like they do with every other fish species. They can \ncontinue to do that rather than have an entire separate program just to \ninspect one fish species under the USDA. By the way, the focus of the \nUSDA is actually on meat and poultry. They don't regulate any other \nfish. They don't have fish experts like the FDA, and that is one of the \nreasons it costs so much more to set up this new program.\n  There is a lot of talk about why people are frustrated with \nWashington; right? They are very frustrated. They want to make sure \ntheir taxpayer dollars are spent wisely. My constituents complain to me \nabout wasteful spending and duplicative programs. Yet here we have such \nan obvious example. As I look at what we have pending on the Senate \nfloor--if we don't pass this resolution of disapproval for this \nduplicative program after so many groups have said that they have \nlooked at this and concluded that it is wasteful and duplicative--and \n10 years of GAO reports saying the same thing, that we don't need a \nseparate inspection regime for catfish, I don't know how we are ever \ngoing to address $19 trillion in debt. I don't know how we are ever \ngoing to take on the big burning issues that the American people want \nus to address.\n  I know a lot of bad things have been said about Congress. I \npersonally think we might be called bottom dwellers if we don't pass \nthis legislation. I am hoping that as we look at the duplicative \nprogram of catfish inspections, we will understand that one fish \nspecies does not deserve a separate office just to look at the catfish, \nthat the FDA can handle this inspection as it does for every other fish \nspecies, that we could save millions of taxpayer dollars by doing this, \nand that we can let the American people know that we get it and we want \nto wisely spend their money wisely, we want to eliminate wasteful \nspending, we want to get our fiscal house in order, and we want good \ngovernment. We don't want protectionist government that is just trying \nto protect one industry, crony capitalism, and all the bad things. What \nwe want is common sense.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me. I thank Senator McCain and Senator \nShaheen for their efforts in helping us bring this important resolution \nfor disapproval forward, and I hope we can take a small step forward in \nthis body for good government, eliminating wasteful spending, \neliminating duplicative programs, and tell the American people: We are \nnot bottom dwellers. We really get it, and we want to make sure we do \nthe right thing by them.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                              Puerto Rico\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the ongoing crisis \naffecting the 3.5 million citizens who call Puerto Rico their home and \nto comment on the legislation that is pending in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  We are facing a critical moment in the history of Puerto Rico. The \nisland is sinking under a mountain of debt. I said it before, but it \nbears repeating. Just servicing the government's $72 billion debt \nswallows 36 percent of all of the island's revenue. That means that for \nevery dollar Puerto Rico takes in, they immediately send over one-third \nto bondholders. This is not sustainable for any government, especially \none that has been mired in a decade-long recession. Congress is faced \nwith an immediate and serious choice. Indeed, the decisions we make in \nthe next month will have profound consequences on the people of Puerto \nRico for over a generation, and the stakes are high. We simply have to \nget it right.\n  I said from the beginning that any fix needs to provide a clear path \nto restructuring with an oversight board that represents the people of \nPuerto Rico and their democratic rights. If we truly want to help the \neconomic situation on the island, we also need to provide parity for \nhealth care funds and worker tax credits that all 3.5 million American \ncitizens living in Puerto Rico have access to once they move to the \nAmerican mainland.\n  I must say I have been encouraged by Speaker Ryan and Chairman \nBishop's acknowledgement that Congress needs to act to prevent this \nfiscal crisis from becoming a full-blown humanitarian catastrophe, but, \nunfortunately, the legislation that is being marked up tomorrow falls \nfar short on several fronts. Instead of offering a clear path to \nrestructuring, the legislation creates a number of obstacles that could \nderail the island's attempt to achieve sustainable debt payments. Most \nstrikingly, it requires a 5-to-2 supermajority vote by the control \nboard to access this necessary restructuring authority--an authority \nthat Puerto Rico had years ago and somehow--in the dark of night, in \nsome legislation several years ago--was eliminated. Nobody seems to \nunderstand why. But it had the authority to restructure its debt. Now, \nrestructuring its debt isn't a bailout because no one gives them money. \nThey ultimately have to restructure the debt they have.\n  While most reasonable people agree it is absolutely vital for Puerto \nRico to be able to restructure its debt, this authority can be blocked \nby a simple minority on the board. That is right. A simple minority on \nthe board could block the pathway to restructure. Without the authority \nto restructure its debt, this legislation does virtually nothing to \nhelp Puerto Rico dig out of the hole they are in.\n\n[[Page S3091]]\n\n  Exacerbating this concern is the composition and scope of power \nendowed to the control board. The fact that the people of Puerto Rico \nwill have absolutely no say over who is appointed or what action they \ndecide to take is blatant neocolonialism. It is OK to say to Puerto \nRicans: Yes, please, wear the uniform of the United States, as they \nhave done in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. If you went with me to \nthe Mall, you would see a disproportionate number of names of Puerto \nRicans who gave their lives on behalf of the United States. Recently, \nthe Speaker awarded the Congressional Gold Medal to the Borinqueneers, \nthe 65th Infantry Division, which was one of the most decorated in U.S. \nmilitary history. Yes, it is OK. Please put on the uniform of the \nUnited States and go fight for your country. Die for America. But it is \nnot OK for you to have a voice in your future. It is not OK for you to \nhave self-governance.\n  If that control board--with no Puerto Rican representation--uses its \nsuperpowers under the bill as drafted and decides to close more schools \nand hospitals than have been closed, cut pensions to the bone, sell \nPuerto Rico's natural assets without any say by the elected \nrepresentatives of the 3.5 million U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico, I am \nsure some would suggest we look the other way and say Puerto Ricans are \nworth less than any other U.S. citizen.\n\n  While there is some fancy language to pretend that the President will \nget to pick the board members, this is all a figleaf to hide the real \nlevers of power. The board will be composed of four Republican \nappointees and three Democratic appointees, and in addition to being \nthe gatekeeper to restructuring, it will have the power to veto laws \nand regulations, override budgets, determine the level of debt \npayments, and make in essence what is the governing body of any State, \nany municipality, or of the people Puerto Rico totally obsolete. They \nwill decide--unelected, they will decide. To me, it is simply wrong and \nun-American to take away the basic democratic rights of the people of \nPuerto Rico.\n  The bill even puts speculating hedge funds above pensioners, \nincluding language to ensure that in any restructuring deal, the people \nwho worked their entire lives--their entire lives--to help the island \nare put at the back of the line behind Wall Street.\n  I remind my colleagues that each and every Puerto Rican is an \nAmerican citizen, many of whom have fought and died, as I said, for our \ncountry in every war over the past century. They deserve the same \nrights and respect as citizens in New Jersey or Wisconsin or Utah or \nany other State in the Nation. If they can do this in Puerto Rico, why \nnot see any other State that sees a crisis have it become a reality as \nwell.\n  Finally, the proposed legislation sensibly cuts minimum wage rules \nand new overtime protections that would apply to workers in Puerto \nRico. At a time when cities and States across the Nation are moving \ntoward increasing the minimum wage, I cannot fathom why anyone would \nsupport decreasing it for Puerto Rico. With the poverty rate of \napproximately 45 percent, lowering people's wages is not a pro-growth \nstrategy, as some have called it. It is a pro-migration strategy. We \nalready see an incredible migration from Puerto Rico to places in the \nUnited States--most particularly Florida, New Jersey, New York, and \nother places in the country. Why? Because as an American citizen they \nhave every right to reside anywhere in the United States. They also \nhave a right to receive any right or privilege that any citizen has in \nthe United States. So there is a brain drain leaving Puerto Rico coming \nto the mainland, which only exacerbates the problem in Puerto Rico. \nThese unrelated riders are counterproductive and will only drive more \nPuerto Ricans to migrate to the mainland, where they will not have to \nwork for subminimum wages.\n  I am afraid this bill provides little more than a bandaid on a bullet \nhole with regard to Puerto Rico's unsustainable debt. Mark my words, if \nwe don't seize this opportunity to address the crisis in a meaningful \nway and in the right way, we will be back here a year from now, but we \nwill be picking up the pieces because there will not be much left. So \nwhile it is absolutely clear that we need to act and act decisively and \nexpediently to help our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico, just as \nimportant, we also need to get it right.\n  Working together and helping each other in a time of need is what \nthis country is all about. When a hurricane hits the gulf coast or a \ntornado ravages the Midwest, I don't ask how many of my constituents in \nNew Jersey were affected. Rather, I stand with my fellow Americans and \nfight to provide relief regardless of what State or territory they are \nfrom. That is why we call this country the United States of America.\n  Let's continue to honor that timeless American tradition. Let's honor \nour country's motto of ``e pluribus unum,'' out of many, one. Let us \nprovide our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico with the tools they need to \nhelp themselves. It is not a bailout. We are not going to give them any \nmoney. They are going to have to restructure and figure out themselves \nhow they will get out of the mess, without taking away their self-\ngovernance. You can't preach democracy and human rights and then deny \nit to the American citizens of Puerto Rico.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/senate-section/article/S3084-2"}, {"day": "24", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

On behalf of the Taiwanese, \nRepresentative Shen pledged $1 million to the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention to help the U.S. combat the Ebola virus and \nstabilize the region. This act of generosity came at a critical time \nand further demonstrated Taiwan's solidarity with the United States.\n  During his post in Washington, Representative Shen made important \ncontributions to the Global Cooperation and Training Framework, GCTF. \nRepresentative Shen is a valued friend of the United States, and I \nthank him for his work and wish him well in all his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/senate-section/article/S3091-2"}, {"day": "24", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3091-S3092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DEPARTMENT OF LABOR FIDUCIARY RULE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, retirement savings are crucial for our \neconomic security, but too many Americans have little to no retirement \nsavings because of low wages and the need to provide for their \nfamilies.\n  Those who have been able to save for retirement are often confused by \nthe unknowns of retirement planning and investing and depend on \nfinancial advisers to provide advice that is in their best interest.\n  However, loopholes in the retirement advice rules have allowed some \nadvisers to recommend products that put profits ahead of their clients' \nbest interest, hurting workers and their families, and jeopardizing our \neconomic security.\n  The Department of Labor set out to update these decades-old rules to \naddress conflicts of interest and require that financial advisers put \ntheir clients first, which is just plain common sense. Unfortunately, \nmy Republican colleagues have voted to roll back this important \nconsumer protection and voted\n\n[[Page S3092]]\n\nto block the Department's fiduciary rule, an effort I did not and would \nnot support.\n  While most advisers operate under a best interest standard, some \nadvisers steered their customers into investments that award big \ncommissions and incentives to the adviser but are not in the best \ninterest of the customer.\n  No one knows this better than the Toffels of Lindenhurst, IL.\n  Merlin Toffel was a Navy veteran and an electrician, and his wife, \nElaine, was an accountant. After more than 40 years of work, they had \nbuilt up an impressive nest egg, but when Merlin was diagnosed with \nAlzheimer's and could no longer manage their finances, Elaine sought \ninvestment advice from an investment broker at their local retail bank.\n  The broker told her to liquidate their retirement account and sold \nthem variable annuities to the tune of $650,000. Elaine trusted his \nadvice because she thought that it was in her best interest. She later \nfound out that those annuities charged fees in excess of $26,000 a \nyear, and if she needed to access the money right away for an \nemergency, she would be charged a surrender charge of more than \n$45,000.\n  In the end, the Toffels lost more than $50,000 because of the \nbroker's conflicted advice. Unfortunately, they are not alone. This is \nunconscionable and should not be allowed.\n  The fiduciary rule will require advisers to disclose their fees and \nensure access to quality financial advice, restore confidence to \nsavers, and protect them from receiving conflicted advice, which has \nthe potential to erode billions from retirement accounts of hard-\nworking Americans.\n  The bottom line is that we need to support policies that safeguard \nworker retirement savings and help them prepare for retirement, and the \nfiduciary rule does just that.\n  It saddens me that my Republican colleagues have acted to undermine \nAmerican workers and families by blocking this rule. Thankfully, their \nefforts here today will not prevail because the President will veto \nthis attempt to dismantle this important rule.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/senate-section/article/S3091-3"}, {"day": "24", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING BOB BENNETT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, all of us mourn the passing of a \ndistinguished former Member of this body, Senator Bob Bennett of Utah, \nwho died of an illness on May 4.\n  I doubt that there were any in the Senate who did not truly like and \nadmire Bob Bennett. His gentle spirit, his kindness, his civility, and \nhis empathy for others were reflected in his work here for the people \nof Utah and for the Nation. Marcelle and I are fortunate to have called \nBob and Joyce Bennett our friends while we served together.\n  Senator Bennett and I were poles apart on many issues that came \nbefore the Senate, but, as with many others in this body, we were able \nto work together in good faith to find ways forward through many \nissues, knowing how important it was to our constituents, to the \ncountry, and to the Senate for us to do that. He followed the tradition \nof other highly respected Senators when I joined this body: He always \nkept his word.\n  At the very end of his life, as he lay in a hospital bed in Salt Lake \nCity, we now have heard from his family of yet another sign of his \ndecency and humanity, as he specially sought out Muslim members of the \nhospital staff to thank them and to personally apologize to them for \nwhat they have heard of the divisive and hateful messages and the \npandering to fear that has spilled out from the current Presidential \ncampaign. He wanted them to know that he and most Americans welcome \nthem, appreciate them, and recognize the pain that these invectives \nhave caused and continue to cause.\n  Reading and hearing his son's description of his dad's outreach in \nhis final days touched me deeply, as I am sure is the case for all of \nus here and for all Americans of goodwill everywhere. All of us can \nlearn from his poignant gestures, and we can resolve to deepen our own \ncommitment to the eternal values--and the American values--that \nmotivated him. What a powerful lesson he leaves for us all.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Salt Lake City \nDeseret News about this remarkable and telling episode from the final \ndays of Senator Bennett's life be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From The Deseret News, May 19, 2016]\n\n Former Utah Sen.

Bob Bennett's death, several \n     national news media outlets have published stories praising \n     the Utah politician for comments he made regarding Muslims \n     and their acceptance in America shortly before his death on \n     May 4, 2016.\n       In the weeks following former Utah Sen. Bob Bennett's \n     death, several national news media outlets published stories \n     praising the Utah politician for comments he made about \n     Muslims and their acceptance in America, shortly before his \n     death.\n       In late April the Deseret News reported about Bennett's \n     battle with pancreatic cancer and a stroke. He told the \n     Deseret News ``I want to go to every Muslim and say thank you \n     for being in our country . . .,'' and, like many other \n     politicians, Bennett expressed his distaste in the tone and \n     tenor of the Republican presidential race as he remarked ``I \n     want to apologize on behalf of the Republican Party for \n     Donald Trump.''\n       The Daily Beast picked up on the Deseret News' interview \n     with the Bennetts a few weeks after the former senator's \n     death and followed up with their own interview with Bennett's \n     family. ``He would go to people with the hijab (on) and tell \n     them he was glad they were in America, and they were welcome \n     here,'' Bennett's wife Joyce told The Daily Beast. ``He \n     wanted to apologize on behalf of the Republican Party.''\n       Quartz followed suit, citing the Deseret News and Daily \n     Beast interviews with the Bennetts, and adding that Bennett's \n     thoughts on the treatment of Muslims seemed to be frequently \n     on his mind in the weeks and months leading up to his death.\n       NBC News echoed the report that in Bennett's last days he \n     approached Muslims to offer his well-wishes to them--even \n     going as far as to ask his son, Jim, if there were any \n     Muslims in the same hospital as him so he could thank them \n     for their residence in the United States.\n       An active member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-\n     day Saints, Bennett's faith was also at the forefront of his \n     thoughts as cancer and a stroke left him partially paralyzed. \n     Bennett ``recognized parallel between the Mormon experience \n     and the Muslim experience,'' The Week reported, and he \n     ``wanted to see these people treated with kindness and not \n     ostracized.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/senate-section/article/S3092-1"}, {"day": "24", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3092-S3093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING KING ARTHUR FLOUR\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on May 19, 2016, hundreds of guests flooded \nthe Senate's Kennedy Caucus Room for the eleventh annual Taste of \nVermont, an event that brings together over 60 businesses that showcase \nthe best Vermont has to offer. From microbreweries to distilleries, \nfarms to creameries, bake shops to chocolatiers, these business \nrepresent the best of Vermont's many unique, homegrown products. All of \nthese businesses deserve acknowledgment for their contributions to our \ngreat State and for putting Vermont's business-friendly environment on \nthe map. I want to take a minute to shine the spotlight on one company \nin particular.\n  On the eve of this year's Taste of Vermont, the Employee Stock \nOwnership Plan, ESOP, Association named King Arthur Flour the 2016 \nCompany of the Year. Founded in 1790, King Arthur Flour epitomizes \nVermont values. A business leader within the community, the company is \nfocused on providing quality products to its loyal customers. After \nrelocating to Norwich, VT, in 1984, owners Frank and Brinna Sands sold \ntheir company to their employees. They became 100 percent employee-\nowned in 2004 and have helped numerous other Vermont companies \ntransition to ESOP status, including Heritage Aviation, the most recent \nVermont-based company to join the ESOP ranks.\n  King Arthur Flour has long been dedicated to bettering itself and its \ncommunity, a laudable and often uncommon commitment from businesses. \nCurrently in the midst of a large expansion of their facilities and \nprogramming, King Arthur Flour has adapted to meet the needs of their \ncustomers and introduced award-winning gluten-free baking mixes in \n2010. The life skills bread baking program recently taught its \n120,000th student, and classes from the baking education center have \nreached over 4,600 bakers.\n  In King Arthur Flour, I see a commitment to being on the cutting edge \nof new ideas and developments, while\n\n[[Page S3093]]\n\nremaining true to what their customers deserve.

The total estimated value of Major Defense \n     Equipment is $15 million. The overall total estimated value \n     is $20 million.\n       This proposed sale contributes to the foreign policy and \n     national security of the United States by helping to improve \n     the security of a regional partner. Qatar is an important \n     force for political stability and economic progress in the \n     Persian Gulf region. This proposed sale strengthens U.S. \n     efforts to promote regional stability by enhancing the \n     defense to a key U.S. ally.\n       The proposed sale will improve Qatar's capability to meet \n     current and future threats and provide greater security for \n     its critical oil and natural gas infrastructure. Qatar will \n     use the enhanced capability to strengthen its homeland \n     defense. Qatar will have no difficulty absorbing these \n     missiles into its armed forces.\n       The proposed sale will not alter the basic military balance \n     in the region.\n       The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin, Troy, AL. \n     There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection \n     with this potential sale.\n       Implementation of this proposed sale will require multiple \n     trips by U.S. Government and contractor representatives to \n     travel to Qatar for up to twenty-four (24) months for \n     equipment de-processing, fielding, system checkout, training, \n     and technical logistics support.\n       There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness \n     as a result of this proposed sale.\n\n\n                         Transmittal No. 16-20\n\n     Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to \n         Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act, as \n         amended\n\n                           Annex Item No. vii\n\n       (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:\n       1. The Javelin Weapon System is a medium-range, man-\n     portable, shoulder-launched, fire-and-forget, anti-tank \n     system for infantry, scouts, and combat engineers. It may \n     also be mounted on a variety of platforms including vehicles, \n     aircraft and watercraft. The system weighs 49.5 pounds and \n     has a maximum range in excess of 2,500 meters. The system is \n     highly lethal against tanks and other systems with \n     conventional and reactive armors. The system possesses a \n     secondary capability against bunkers.\n       2. Javelin's key technical feature is the use of fire-and-\n     forget technology which allows the gunner to fire and \n     immediately relocate or take cover. Additional special \n     features are the top attack and/or direct fire modes, an \n     advanced tandem warhead and imaging infrared seeker, target \n     lock-on before launch, and soft launch from enclosures or \n     covered fighting positions. The Javelin missile also has a \n     minimum smoke motor thus decreasing its detection on the \n     battlefield.\n       3. The Javelin Weapon System comprises two major tactical \n     components, which are a reusable Command Launch Unit (CLU) \n     and a round contained in a disposable launch tube assembly. \n     The CLU incorporates an integrated day-night sight that \n     provides a target engagement capability in adverse weather \n     and countermeasure environments. The CLU may also be used in \n     a stand-alone mode for battlefield surveillance and target \n     detection. The CLU's thermal sight is a second generation \n     Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor. To facilitate initial \n     loading and subsequent updating of software, all on-board \n     missile software is uploaded via the CLU after mating and \n     prior to launch.\n       4. The missile is autonomously guided to the target using \n     an imaging infrared seeker and adaptive correlation tracking \n     algorithms. This allows the gunner to take cover or reload \n     and engage another target after firing a missile. The missile \n     has an advanced tandem warhead and can be used in either the \n     top attack or direct fire modes (for targets undercover). An \n     onboard flight computer guides the missile to the selected \n     target.\n       5. The Javelin Missile System hardware and the \n     documentation are UNCLASSIFIED. The missile software which \n     resides in the CLU is considered SENSITIVE. The sensitivity \n     is primarily in the software programs which instruct the \n     system how to operate in the presence of countermeasures. The \n     overall hardware is also considered SENSITIVE in that the \n     infrared wavelengths could be useful in attempted \n     countermeasure development. The benefits to be derived from \n     the sale, as outlined in the Policy Justification of the \n     notification, outweigh the potential damage that could result \n     if sensitive technology was revealed to unauthorized persons.\n       6. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain \n     knowledge of the specific hardware or software elements, the \n     information could be used to develop countermeasures that \n     might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the \n     development of a system with similar or advanced \n     capabilities.\n       7. All defense articles and services listed in this \n     transmittal have been authorized for release and export to \n     the Government of Qatar.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Defense Security\n\n\n                                           Cooperation Agency,\n\n                                                    Arlington, VA.\n     Hon.

I'm delighted to have the witnesses here. \n     This is an extraordinary group of individuals with broad \n     prospective of children and elementary and secondary \n     education. And we welcome your comments on how to implement \n     the new reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act.\n       This is our third of six hearings to discuss the \n     implementation of the Every Student Succeeds Act, which the \n     President signed in December.\n       It's the second opportunity for this committee to hear from \n     the states, school districts, teachers, principals, and \n     others that helped us pass this overwhelmingly bipartisan law \n     and are today working together to implement it in a way that \n     is consistent with congressional intent.\n       I want to focus my remarks on the administration's proposed \n     ``Supplement Not Supplant'' regulation.\n       This is the very first opportunity the administration has \n     to write regulations on our new law. And in my view, they \n     earned an `F.'\n       The reason for that is that the regulation violates the law \n     as implemented since 1970, and seeks to do it in a way that \n     is specifically prohibited in the new law.\n       In writing the new law last year, Congress debated and \n     ultimately chose to leave unchanged a provision in the law \n     referred to as ``comparability.'' That's section 1605.\n       This provision says: school districts have to provide at \n     least comparable services with state and local funding to \n     Title I schools and non-Title I schools.\n       But--the law plainly states that school districts shall not \n     include teacher pay when they measure spending for purposes \n     of comparability. That's been the law since 1970. We didn't \n     change it last year.\n       There's an entirely separate provision, known as \n     ``Supplement Not Supplant'' that's intended to keep local \n     school districts from using federal Title I dollars as a \n     replacement for state and local dollars in low-income \n     schools.\n       What the department's proposed ``Supplement Not Supplant'' \n     regulation attempts to do is to change ``comparability'' by \n     writing a new regulation governing ``Supplement Not \n     Supplant.''\n       In other words, their proposal would force school districts \n     to include teacher salaries in how they measure state and \n     local spending, and would require that state and local \n     spending in each Title I school be at least equal to the \n     average spent in non-Title I schools.\n       The effect of this would be to violate the law as \n     implemented since 1970, section 1605.\n       So, the administration may get an ``A'' for cleverness, but \n     an ``F'' for following the law, in my opinion.\n       The negotiated rulemaking committee couldn't agree on the \n     proposal. At least one member, Tony Evers, a witness today, \n     said that ``Congressional intent isn't necessarily being \n     followed here.''\n       Last week, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service \n     said the same thing.\n       CRS issued a report that said quote, ``the Department's \n     interpretation appears to go beyond what would be required \n     under a plain language reading of the statute.''\n       CRS found that the proposed [supplement, not supplant \n     regulations ``appear to directly conflict'' with statutory \n     language that ``seems to place clear limits on [the \n     Department's] authority'' and ``thus raises significant \n     doubts about [the Department's] legal basis for proposed \n     regulations.''\n       Today, I am looking forward to hearing from witnesses \n     whether what I have been hearing from principals, teachers, \n     and education leaders across the country is true. Here's what \n     I've been hearing:\n       1. That the department's proposed regulation could turn \n     upside down the funding formulas of almost all the state and \n     local school systems across the country.\n       Most states and local districts allocate K-12 finding to \n     schools based on staffing ratios.\n       This often results in different amounts going to different \n     schools in the same district because teacher salaries vary \n     from school-to-school for reasons having nothing to do with a \n     school's participation in Title I.\n       Instead, salaries vary because of teacher experience, merit \n     pay, or the subject or grade level they teach.\n       2. I've been hearing that proposed regulation could \n     effectively require wholesale transfers of teachers and the \n     breaking of collective bargaining agreements.\n       3. I've been hearing that school districts won't receive \n     enough funds to comply with the proposed regulation.\n       4. That students could be forced to change schools.\n       5. That the proposed regulation could increase the \n     segregation of low-income and high-income students.\n       6. That it could require states and local school districts \n     to move back to the burdensome practice of detailing every \n     individual cost on which they spend money to provide a basic \n     education program to all students, which is exactly what we \n     were trying to free states and districts from, when we passed \n     the law.\n       According to the Council of Great City Schools, the \n     proposed regulation would cost $3.9 billion a year, just for \n     their 69 urban school systems to eliminate the differences in \n     spending between schools.\n       What the department has done for the first time is to try \n     to put together two major provisions of the law that have \n     always been separate.\n       On comparability, (which is the first one):\n       Members of this committee discussed and debated changing \n     this provision at great length over the past 6 years. We \n     discussed it at great length over the last six years.\n       Senator Bennet of Colorado has lots of experience with \n     this, had one proposal. I had another.\n       We ultimately decided not to make any changes in \n     comparability.\n       Instead, we included more transparency, in the form of \n     public reporting, on the amount districts are spending on \n     each student, including teacher salaries, so that parents and \n     teachers know how much money is being spent and can make \n     their own decisions about what to do, rather than the federal \n     government mandating it be used in comparability \n     calculations.\n       Then on the second provision in the law, on ``Supplement \n     Not Supplant'':\n       We addressed this provision and made changes with an effort \n     to simplify the law, and not make it more complicated.\n       By no stretch of the imagination did we intend, does any of \n     the language in the law say, that ``Supplement Not Supplant'' \n     would be used to modify the ``comparability'' provision.\n       In fact, we specifically prohibited that. We prohibited \n     expressly:\n       The Secretary from requiring local school districts to \n     identify individual costs or services as supplemental\n       We Prohibited the Secretary from prescribing any specific \n     methodology that local school districts use to distribute \n     state and local funds\n       Most importantly, we prohibited the Secretary from \n     requiring a state, local school district, or school to \n     equalize spending.\n       The proposed regulation is nothing less than a brazen \n     effort to deliberately ignore a law that passed the Senate 85 \n     to 12, passed the House 359-64, and was signed by the \n     president.\n       No one has to guess what the law says. As the Congressional \n     Research Service says--we can just read its plain language.\n       And if the administration can't follow language on this, it \n     raises grave questions about what we might expect from future \n     regulations.\n\n[[Page S3096]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/senate-section/article/S3095-1"}, {"day": "24", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  REMEMBERING JOE PRESTON JOSLIN, JR.\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to remember the life \nof Joe Preston Joslin, Jr., who passed away on May 14, 2016, after \nliving an extraordinary life of service.\n  Joe Joslin was born in Dallas, TX, on September 26, 1947. He served \nin the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment as a track mechanic and forward \nobserver in Vietnam. After the war, he lived in Dallas and Austin until \n1995, when he and his his wife of 30 years, Sharon, moved to Mountain \nView, AR. For the last 13 years, they lived in Leslie, AR, where Joe \nleft a lasting mark on the community.\n  This January, after nearly 50 years, Joe was finally given the \nrecognition he deserved. He received the Bronze Star with Valor for \nputting the lives of his fellow soldiers before his own and dismounting \nhis armored vehicle to help those in need. This, along with the Army \nMedal of Commendation, accompany his many distinguished medals while \nserving in the U.S. Army.\n  Like many veterans, his selfless acts have gone far past the \nbattlefield. Joe dedicated his life to helping his fellow veterans. He \nserved as a past commander of American Legion Post 131 and American \nLegion District 2. He also served as commander of Veterans of Foreign \nWars Post 12127, and in October of 2015, he retired after serving as \nthe Searcy County veteran service officer for 3 years.\n  Joe enjoyed sharing his passion for the community with others. He had \na soft spot for animals and shared his love of dogs with other members \nof the Searcy County Humane Society.\n  A true family man and dear friend, Joe leaves behind many loved ones, \nincluding his wife, Sharon; his mother, Helen Loftin; five children; \nnine grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. I want to offer my \nprayers and sincere condolences to his loved ones on their loss. Joe \nwas a true American hero. I would like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize him and join with his family and friends in showing gratitude \nfor his life and legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/senate-section/article/S3096-1"}, {"day": "24", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO COLONEL ROBERT ERICKSON\n\n Mr. DAINES.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nMichigan Milk Producers Association on the occasion of its 100th \nanniversary. Over a century ago, on May 23, 1916, some 400 dairy \nfarmers from across southern Michigan met in East Lansing at the \nMichigan Agricultural College, spurred into action by their peers from \nLivingston County, who had just a month before raised a critical issue: \nthe establishment of a fair price for their product. The result of \ntheir meeting was Michigan Milk Producers Association, MMPA.\n  In the early 1900s, Michigan dairy farmers faced a variety of \npressures, including the increasing costs of land, labor, and feed, \nwhich threatened the livelihood of many producers. Without a unified \nvoice, farmers were confronted with growing difficulties in negotiating \nprices for their products which would cover their production costs. For \nmany, the severity of these challenges was leading to the real \npossibility of the collapse of Michigan's dairy farm industry.\n  Engaging in a cooperative endeavor, dairy farmers from Michigan \nsought to speak with one voice in their mission to secure a fair price \nfor their products. As an organization for dairy farmers, open only to \ndairy farmers, MMPA immediately embarked on finding a resolution to \nthis existential crisis. Within its first 5 months, MMPA membership \nswelled from just under 200 to nearly 1,000 milk producers from almost \nevery county in southern Michigan. Within a year, MMPA successfully \nensured a cost for milk that would support the livelihood of its \nmembers. With this vital goal met, MMPA stretched its efforts to \ninclude increasing the quality of its members' products, an effort that \nwas vital to counter prevailing public opinion. By joining together, \nMichigan dairy farmers were also well positioned to work with the \nFederal Food and Drug Administration in its efforts to accommodate \nproducers' price demands.\n  As with all Americans, MMPA faced considerable hardship during the \nGreat Depression. An overproduction of milk\n\n[[Page S3097]]\n\ncoupled with decreasing urban density, MMPA labored to formulate \nsolutions for their crisis and create new innovations in the marketing \nof milk. Thanks to its efforts, many of MMPA's members were able to \nsurvive the Great Depression.\n  From its early challenges, MMPA and its members have persevered. \nToday MMPA is a respected and recognized advocate for dairy farmers, \nrepresenting 2,100 members across 1,400 farms from Michigan, Indiana, \nOhio, and Wisconsin. It is the eleventh largest dairy cooperative in \nthe United States, and its members market 4 billion pounds of milk \nannually.\n  Again, I am pleased to rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing such an auspicious milestone for the Michigan Milk \nProducers Association. On its 100th anniversary, MMPA and its members \nhave much to celebrate, and I wish them continuing success and \nprosperity in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/senate-section/article/S3096-4"}, {"day": "24", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 184.

Res. 473\n\n       Whereas American Craft Beer Week is celebrated annually in \n     breweries, brew pubs, restaurants, and beer stores by craft \n     brewers, home brewers, and beer enthusiasts nationwide;\n       Whereas, in 2016, American Craft Beer Week is celebrated \n     from May 16 to May 22;\n       Whereas craft brewers are a vibrant affirmation and \n     expression of the entrepreneurial traditions of the United \n     States--\n       (1) operating as community-based small businesses and \n     cooperatives;\n       (2) providing employment for more than 120,000 full- and \n     part-time workers;\n       (3) generating annually more than $3,000,000,000 in wages \n     and benefits; and\n       (4) often leading the redevelopment of economically \n     distressed areas;\n       Whereas the United States has craft brewers in every State \n     and more than 4,400 craft breweries nationwide, each \n     producing fewer than 6,000,000 barrels of beer annually;\n       Whereas, in 2015, 620 new breweries opened in the United \n     States, creating jobs and improving economic conditions in \n     communities across the United States;\n       Whereas, in 2015, craft breweries in the United States \n     sustainably produced more than 24,500,000 barrels of beer, \n     which is 2,800,000 more barrels than craft breweries produced \n     in 2014;\n       Whereas the craft brewers of the United States now export \n     more than 446,000 barrels of beer and are establishing new \n     markets abroad, which creates more domestic jobs to meet the \n     growing international demand for craft beer from the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the craft brewers of the United States support \n     United States agriculture by purchasing barley, malt, and \n     hops that are grown, processed, and distributed in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the craft brewers of the United States produce more \n     than 100 distinct styles of flavorful beers, including many \n     sought-after new and unique styles ranging from amber lagers \n     to American IPAs that--\n       (1) contribute to a favorable balance of trade by reducing \n     the dependence of the United States on imported beers;\n       (2) support exports from the United States; and\n       (3) promote tourism in the United States;\n       Whereas craft beers from the United States consistently win \n     international quality and taste awards;\n       Whereas the craft brewers of the United States strive to \n     educate the people of the United States who are of legal \n     drinking age about the differences in beer flavor, aroma, \n     color, alcohol content, body, and other complex variables, \n     the gastronomic qualities of beer, beer history, and \n     historical brewing traditions dating back to colonial times \n     and earlier;\n       Whereas the craft brewers of the United States champion the \n     message of responsible enjoyment to their customers and work \n     within their communities and the industry to prevent alcohol \n     abuse and underage drinking;\n       Whereas the craft brewers of the United States are \n     frequently involved in local communities through \n     philanthropy, volunteerism, and sponsorship opportunities, \n     including parent-teacher associations, Junior Reserve \n     Officers' Training Corps (commonly known as ``JROTC''), \n     hospitals for children, chambers of commerce, humane \n     societies, rescue squads, athletic teams, and disease \n     research;\n       Whereas the craft brewers of the United States are fully \n     vested in the future success, health, welfare, and vitality \n     of their communities, as local employers that--\n       (1) provide a diverse array of quality local jobs that will \n     not be outsourced;\n       (2) contribute to the local tax base; and\n       (3) keep money in the United States by reinvesting in their \n     businesses; and\n       Whereas increased Federal, State, and local support of \n     craft brewing is important to fostering the continued growth \n     of an industry of the United States that creates jobs, \n     greatly benefits local economies, and brings international \n     accolades to small businesses in the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) appreciates the goals of American Craft Beer Week, \n     established by the Brewers Association, which represents the \n     small craft brewers of the United States;\n       (2) recognizes the significant contributions of the craft \n     brewers of the United States to the economy and to the \n     communities in which the craft brewers are located;

which was \nreferred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 40\n\n       Whereas there is a 12 percent Federal excise tax on new \n     tractor trailer trucks and certain other heavy-duty trucks;\n       Whereas the 12 percent Federal excise tax is the highest \n     percentage rate of any Federal ad valorem excise tax;\n       Whereas the Federal excise tax was first levied by Congress \n     in 1917 to help finance the involvement of the United States \n     in World War I;\n       Whereas, in 2015, the average manufacturer suggested retail \n     price for a heavy-duty truck was more than $178,000;\n       Whereas the 12 percent Federal excise tax adds, on average, \n     an additional $21,360 to the cost of a heavy-duty truck;\n       Whereas the average in-use, heavy-duty truck is 9.3 years \n     old, close to the historical all-time high;\n       Whereas the Federal excise tax, by significantly increasing \n     the cost of new heavy-duty trucks, keeps older, less \n     environmentally clean, and less fuel efficient heavy-duty \n     trucks in service for longer periods of time;\n       Whereas the model year 2002-2010 tailpipe emissions rules \n     of the Environmental Protection Agency (in this preamble \n     referred to as the ``EPA'') account for $20,000 of the \n     average price of a new heavy-duty truck;\n       Whereas, according to the 2011 EPA and National Highway \n     Traffic Safety Administration Regulatory Impact Analysis \n     entitled ``Final Rulemaking to Establish Greenhouse Gas \n     Emissions Standards and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium- \n     and Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles'', model year 2014-2018 \n     EPA-Department of Transportation fuel economy rules will add \n     approximately $8,000 to the price of a new heavy-duty truck;\n       Whereas the $28,000 average per truck cost of these \n     regulatory mandates results, on average, in an additional \n     $3,360 in Federal excise taxes;\n       Whereas achieving the goal of deploying cleaner, more fuel \n     efficient heavy-duty trucks, given the $30,000 average per \n     truck regulatory cost, would be slowed even further if the \n     Federal excise tax were increased;\n       Whereas achieving the goal of deploying heavy-duty trucks \n     with the latest safety\n\n[[Page S3104]]\n\n     technologies, such as lane departure warning systems, \n     electronic stability control, and automatic braking for \n     reduced stopping distance, would be slowed if the Federal \n     excise tax were increased;\n       Whereas all of the heavy-duty trucks sold in the United \n     States are manufactured in North America; and\n       Whereas more than 8,000,000 people in the United States are \n     employed in the United States trucking industry: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) the Federal excise tax under section 4051 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 on new tractor trailer trucks \n     and certain other heavy-duty trucks inhibits the sale of the \n     cleanest, safest, and most fuel efficient heavy-duty trucks \n     and trailers;\n       (2) the Federal excise tax on new tractor trailer trucks \n     and certain other heavy-duty trucks adds uncertainty and \n     volatility to the Highway Trust Fund due to the cyclical \n     nature of heavy-duty truck and trailer sales;\n       (3) the Federal excise tax on new truck tractors, heavy-\n     duty trucks, and certain truck trailers should not be \n     increased; and\n       (4) Congress should carefully review the detrimental \n     impacts of the Federal excise tax when considering future \n     transportation policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/24/senate-section/article/S3103-2"}, {"day": "24", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3104-S3105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4082.

SEMIANNUAL REPORT ON IRAN AND NORTH KOREA NUCLEAR \n                   AND BALLISTIC MISSILE COOPERATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Iran developed a close working relationship with North \n     Korea on many ballistic missile programs, dating back to an \n     acquisition of Scud missiles from North Korea in the mid-\n     1980s.\n       (2) By the mid-1980s North Korea reverse-engineered Scud B \n     missiles originally received from Egypt, and developed the \n     500-kilometer range Scud C missile in 1991, and sold both the \n     Scud B and Scud C, as well as missile production technology, \n     to Iran.\n       (3) In 1992, then-Director of the Central Intelligence \n     Robert Gates, in testimony to Congress, identified Iran as a \n     recipient of North Korean Scud missiles.\n       (4) In 1993, then-Director of Central Intelligence James \n     Woolsey provided more detail, stating that North Korea had \n     sold Iran extended range Scud C missiles and agreed to sell \n     other forms of missile technology.\n       (5) Annual threat assessments from the intelligence \n     community during the 1990s showed that North Korea's ongoing \n     export of ballistic missiles provided a qualitative increase \n     in capabilities to countries such as Iran.\n       (6) The same threat assessments noted that Iran was using \n     North Korean ballistic missile goods and services to achieve \n     its goal of self-sufficiency in the production of medium-\n     range ballistic missiles.\n       (7) The intelligence community assessed in the 1990s that \n     Iran's acquisition of missile systems or key missile-related \n     components could improve Iran's ability to produce an \n     intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).\n       (8) Throughout the 2000s, the intelligence community \n     continued to assess that North Korean cooperation with Iran's \n     ballistic missile program was ongoing and significant.\n       (9) In 2007 a failed missile test in Syria caused the death \n     of Syrian, Iranian, and North Korean experts.\n       (10) North Korea built the nuclear reactor in Syria that \n     was bombed in 2007. Syria failed to report the construction \n     of the reactor to the International Atomic Energy Agency \n     (IAEA), which was Syria's obligation under its safeguards \n     agreement with the agency.\n       (11) Official sources confirm that Iran and North Korea \n     have engaged in various forms of clandestine nuclear \n     cooperation.\n       (12) North Korea and Iran obtained designs and materials \n     related to uranium enrichment from a clandestine procurement \n     network run by Abdul Qadeer Khan.\n       (13) In the early 2000s, North Korea exported, with the \n     assistance of Abdul Qadeer Khan, uranium hexafluoride (UF6) \n     gas to Libya, which was intended to be used in Libya's \n     clandestine nuclear weapons program.\n       (14) On January 6, 2016, North Korea conducted its fourth \n     nuclear weapons test.\n       (15) Iranian officials reportedly traveled to North Korea \n     to witness its three previous nuclear tests in 2006, 2009, \n     and 2013.\n       (16) Before North Korea's 2013 test, a senior American \n     official was quoted as saying ``it's very possible that North \n     Koreans are testing for two countries''.\n       (17) In September 2012, Iran and North Korea signed an \n     agreement for technological and scientific cooperation.\n       (18) In an April 2015 interview with CNN, Secretary of \n     Defense Ashton Carter said that North Korea and Iran ``could \n     be'' cooperating to develop a nuclear weapon.\n       (19) On February 9, 2016, Director of National Intelligence \n     Jim Clapper provided written testimony to Congress that \n     stated that Pyongyang's ``export of ballistic missiles and \n     associated materials to several countries, including Iran and \n     Syria, and its assistance to Syria's construction of a \n     nuclear reactor . . . illustrate its willingness to \n     proliferate dangerous technologies''.\n       (20) A 2016 Congressional Research Service report confirmed \n     that ``ballistic missile technology cooperation between the \n     two [Iran and North Korea] is significant and meaningful''.\n       (21) Admiral Bill Gortney, Commander of United States \n     Northern Command, testified to Congress on April 14, 2016, \n     that ``Iran's continuing pursuit of long-range missile \n     capabilities and ballistic missile and space\n\n[[Page S3113]]\n\n     launch programs, in defiance of United Nations Security \n     Council resolutions, remains a serious concern''.\n       (22) Iran has engaged in nuclear technology cooperation \n     with North Korea.\n       (23) It has been suspected for over a decade that Iran and \n     North Korea are working together on nuclear weapons \n     development.\n       (24) Since the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2013 (Public Law 112-277) repealed requirements for the \n     intelligence community to provide unclassified annual report \n     to Congress on the ``Acquisition of Technology Relating to \n     Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional \n     Munitions'', the number of unclassified reports to Congress \n     on nuclear-weapons issues decreased considerably.\n       (25) North Korea's cooperation with Iran on nuclear weapon \n     development is widely suspected, but has yet to be detailed \n     by the President to Congress.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the ballistic missile programs of Iran and North Korea \n     represent a serious threat to allies of the United States in \n     the Middle East, Europe, and Asia, members of the Armed \n     Forces deployed in those regions, and ultimately the United \n     States;\n       (2) further cooperation between Iran and North Korea on \n     nuclear weapons or ballistic missile technology is not in the \n     security interests of the United States or our allies;\n       (3) the testing and production by Iran of ballistic \n     missiles capable of carrying a nuclear device is a clear \n     violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 \n     (2015), which was unanimously adopted by the United Nations \n     Security Council and supported by the international \n     community; and\n       (4) Iran is using its space launch program to develop the \n     capabilities necessary to deploy an intercontinental \n     ballistic missile that could threaten the United States, and \n     the Director of National Intelligence has assessed that Iran \n     would use ballistic missiles as its ``preferred method of \n     delivering nuclear weapons''.\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, and every 180 days thereafter, the \n     President, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, the \n     Secretary of State, and the heads of other relevant agencies, \n     shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a \n     report on nuclear and ballistic missile cooperation between \n     the Government of Iran and the Government of the Democratic \n     People's Republic of North Korea, including the identity of \n     Iranian and North Korean persons that have knowingly engaged \n     in or directed the provision of material support or the \n     exchange of information between the Government of Iran and \n     the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of North \n     Korea on their respective nuclear programs.\n       (2) Form.--The report required under paragraph (1) shall be \n     submitted in unclassified form, but may contain a classified \n     annex.\n       (3) Appropriate committees of congress defined.--In this \n     subsection, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' \n     means--\n       (A) the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee on \n     Armed Services, and the Select Committee on Intelligence of \n     the Senate; and\n       (B) the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on \n     Armed Services, and the Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the House of Representatives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4109.
