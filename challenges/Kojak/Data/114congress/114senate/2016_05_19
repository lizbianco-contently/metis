Mr. President, I come to the floor today not to talk about \na political issue, in the real sense of the word--not Democrat versus \nRepublican--but a very difficult sensitive issue. It is hard to talk \nabout, but we as a nation can't keep ignoring this important topic.\n  It has been more than 20 years since I learned about something called \nfemale genital mutilation, known as FGM. Since then, I have spoken \noften against this awful procedure and the devastating effect it has on \nwomen and girls around the world.\n  A number of people warned me 20 years ago that this isn't a subject I \nshould talk about. It was taboo. They thought it would be untoward for \nme to do so. But I told them I had to because no one else was talking \nabout it. So I am going to continue doing everything I can to bring \nattention to this issue and fight to end this horrible, awful, brutal \npractice perpetrated against women and girls.\n  It was a 1994 cable news program that introduced me to this practice. \nOne of my friends in Las Vegas said: You can't imagine this. This was a \nyoung woman who sent this to me. I didn't expect getting this from her \nor anyone else. But we were friends, and so I watched this. She said: \nYou have to. And I did: A 10-year-old little girl in a party dress held \ndown by two men, her legs spread apart, and she was brutally mutilated \nas her genitals were cut away. These images have continually haunted me \nover the years. I will never ever forget the picture that I saw.\n  There are different forms of female genital mutilation around the \nworld. The most severe and atrocious is the one in which the girl's \ngenitals are cut away. But then the little girls are literally sewn \nshut, leaving only a small opening for urine and menstrual blood.\n  Though FGM is performed for different reasons around the world. One \nthing is very clear: Whatever rationality you try to give to this \npractice, it is a form of control and oppression of women and girls.\n  In addition to the psychological impact, this form of gender-based \nviolence has serious medical risks, including death, of course. It is \nrecognized by the United Nations as a human rights violation, as it \nshould be.\n  But FGM is still happening. As we speak, 200 million women and girls \nworldwide have undergone FGM--200 million women and girls who are alive \ntoday who have undergone that procedure that I watched on cable news, \nor something like it. More than two decades after I first saw that \nprogram, women and girls are still being hacked, mutilated. It is not \ndone in a hospital, an operating room. It is done in very unsanitary \nconditions most of the time.\n  This practice remains prevalent in at least 30 countries. In some \nplaces, the rates of FGM are higher than 90 percent--90 percent. In \nmany of these countries, girls are cut before the age of 5. In most \nplaces they are cut between the ages of 5 and 14. In many of these \ncountries, girls--well, enough. Imagine that--girls who haven't even \nstarted school yet, of kindergarten age or younger, being subjected to \nthis horror.\n  Because of these millions of girls, I have spent more than 20 years \ntrying to do something about it. I have worked hard to pass legislation \noutlawing the practice in the United States and banning so-called \nvacation cutting, which goes on when young girls are shipped overseas. \nBecause it is illegal here, due to the laws we passed, they take them \noverseas to be cut.\n  There was some bipartisan support, obviously, for this. It is not a \npartisan issue. We were able to have a few victories--certainly not \nenough, but some. Still, this brutal practice continues around the \nworld, and it is clear there must be much more done--much more done.\n  That is why, at my request, the General Accountability Office began a \nstudy on the American Government's efforts to stop this practice. The \nGAO has now completed its report about our government's international \nefforts. It wasn't much of a report. It was kind of short. The report \nis shameful in terms of what we have not done.\n  The title of the report says it all: ``Female Genital Mutilation/\nCutting:\n\n[[Page S3004]]\n\nU.S. Assistance to Combat This Harmful Practice Abroad is Limited.'' \nAnd ``limited'' is an understatement.\n  I am publicly releasing this report today, which outlines the U.S. \nGovernment's limited--limited--efforts. I am terribly disappointed. I \nam embarrassed that the State Department and the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development are not fully engaged in dedicating resources \nto put an end to this.\n  According to the GAO report, USAID and the State Department each had \njust one active stand-alone project focused on stopping female genital \nmutilation. One of these projects is gone--already ended. Less than $2 \nmillion has been spent on these projects combined.\n  The GAO also found that the United States has never contributed--\nnever contributed--a penny to the world's largest international effort \nagainst this horrible, awful practice. It is called the Joint Programme \non FGM/C. It is embarrassing. We have not put one penny into this.\n  During the course of the GAO investigation, State and USAID both \nbegan to take action. They were embarrassed, I assume. If they weren't, \nthey should have been. But they haven't done much. USAID, for example, \ndecided to update the guidance it released 16 years ago, and Secretary \nKerry recently announced that the United States will be contributing to \nthe Joint Programme for the first time. Bravo.\n  I commend this commitment, but I understand these funds are not a \ndedicated funding source. They are just a one-time, very limited \npledge. Maybe we will have to get another GAO report before we get \nsomething into that program. It shouldn't take a GAO investigation for \nState and USAID to act. The United States should prioritize ending this \npractice, but it hasn't.\n  This is shameful. It is a tragedy that our great government is not \ndoing more. It is inexcusable that the United States, a nation with \nwealth and power, is standing by while such sickening violence against \nwomen and girls is occurring. As we speak, 200 million have undergone \nthis in the world--200 million.\n  The State Department and USAID should end it or do everything they \ncan to make female genital mutilation a priority and dedicate \nsubstantial resources to this issue. It is a cause. It should be, if it \nisn't. The United States can and must do far more to eliminate this \npractice worldwide. We still have problems here in the United States.\n  This shameful GAO report, I hope, is a wake-up call. Something had to \nwake us up because we have done almost nothing as a country. The report \nshould be a turning point in the fight against FGM, a moment when the \nmost powerful nation in the world commences the stopping of this brutal \nform of abuse.\n  The United States should be a leader in this fight and not a \nbystander. We must put this brutal practice to an end. America must \nlead the world in stopping these assaults of little girls and big girls \nand women. I hope the Senate will join me in these efforts.\n  Mr. President, I don't see anyone on the floor. I ask the Chair to \nannounce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/19/senate-section/article/S3003-5"}, {"day": "19", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I appreciate seeing the Presiding Officer \nin the chair and having a ``Corey'' represented and presiding over the \nU.S. Senate.\n  I rise today to speak against an amendment now pending to this bill \nthat would block a rule that seeks to fulfill the promise of the Fair \nHousing Act. This issue is very deeply personal to me and one that \nreally has defined my own personal history. I would like to start by \ntelling a story.\n  In 1969, just 1 year after the passage of the Fair Housing Act, a \ncouple here in Washington, DC, married with two boys, decided to move \nto New Jersey. In New Jersey, they encountered a lot of a practice \ncalled real estate steering, where Black couples were steered away from \ncertain neighborhoods.\n  Realizing they were being steered away from White neighborhoods, they \ngrew frustrated, and they sought the help of the fair housing council. \nThey set up an elaborate sting operation where my parents would go look \nat a home--or this couple would go look at a home--and they would then \nbe followed by a White couple. The couple was told the house was sold \nor it was not for sale. The White couple would then appear and find out \nif that was, indeed, true. Most often for this couple from Washington, \nDC, yes, they would find out the house was still for sale.\n  Eventually this couple found a house they loved in a small town \ncalled Harrington Park, NJ, but they were told that the house was not \nfor sale. They were told the house had been pulled off the market or \nsold. They left. Then the White couple came behind them. Lo and behold, \nthe house had not been sold or was not pulled off the market. The White \ncouple pretended that they loved the house as the Black couple did and \nput a bid on the house. The bid was accepted.\n  On the day of the closing, instead of the White couple showing up, \nthe African-American gentleman from the Black couple and a volunteer \nlawyer came to confront the real estate agent. The real estate agent \nwas so upset that he stood up and punched the lawyer representing the \nBlack couple and sicced his dog on the African-American man. Yet the \nlaw was on their side. The fair housing law of the United States of \nAmerica, the law of the Federal Government, was on their side.\n  Eventually, that Black couple and their two kids moved into that home \nin Harrington Park, NJ. That was 1969. It was the year I was born, and \nthat couple was my parents, Cary and Carolyn Booker. That is my origin \nstory. Legislation that this body passed empowered my family to move \ninto the home of their dreams in an all-White neighborhood with \nincredibly good schools that I went through from K-12. I am the \nbeneficiary of work this body did to ensure that our American values \nare preserved, our values of inclusion and integration, to make sure \nfair housing is the law of the land. That work gave me my start in \nlife. The activism of local activists, combined with the law of the \nland as passed by us, defined my path.\n  After decades of struggle in communities across the country, we have \nlargely been successful in banning overt housing discrimination. We\n\n[[Page S3005]]\n\nshould be proud of our work. But legislation that we passed should not \nbecome a relic of history. It is not something for us to turn and \nadmire. We all know on many issues the cause of freedom and the cause \nof justice necessitate constant vigilance.\n  So I rise today with the knowledge that while major pieces of civil \nrights legislation like the Fair Housing Act have had a significant \nimpact on millions of Americans--White, Black, Latino, Asian, \ndisabled--this has had a full impact. We still have work to do to \ncontinue that vigilance to make sure that those values, those ideals, \nand the law of the land are made real for families.\n  Unfortunately, for nearly 50 years there has not been real guidance, \ndirection, or tools to help local officials achieve the goals of the \nFair Housing Act, which are integrated housing, fair housing, equal \naccess. In 2010, in fact, the Government Accountability Office found \nthat the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, failed to \nproperly administer oversight obligations under the Fair Housing Act \nand failed to monitor its guarantees for compliance with the law.\n  In 2013, HUD proposed affirmatively furthering fair housing, a new \nrule that would seek to fulfill the promise of the Fair Housing Act and \neliminate a lot of the historic patterns of segregation that still go \non in America today. The vision for the rule is to institute a data-\ndriven analysis of localities and to develop Federal grant programs for \nhousing and economic inclusion.\n  When I was mayor, people came to me with passions and accusations and \nthe like. I used to always say: In God we trust, but, everybody else, \nbring me data. It is important to look at the numbers to know what \nreally is going on.\n  So HUD brought about this idea of making sure we have that data--not \nin a rushed process. The administration engaged in a diligent 2-year \nrulemaking process with public inclusion, participation from others, \nand lots of public comment periods. They finalized that rule in July \n2015.\n  It is unfortunate that one of my dear colleagues--somebody whom I \nvalue very much because we do a lot of work across the aisle--has \nintroduced an amendment that would block this rule's implementation, \nand I must respectfully disagree with the intent of this amendment. The \nFair Housing Act and, really, the entirety of the Civil Rights Act were \nmeant, again, to be real today, not just relics of yesterday. They were \nmeant to be guideposts and standards by which we hold ourselves \naccountable for the values we put forth.\n  The affirmatively further fair housing rule is a measure of \naccountability for HUD and for ourselves. You cannot change what you \ncannot measure. Let me say that again. I learned this as a manager: If \nyou can't measure it, you can't change it or affect it.\n  The rule will arm communities most in need with knowledge and numbers \nso they can make intelligent local decisions and best apply their \nresources. It is what everyone who has to manage something needs: \naccurate data. It will improve the access to quality data on local \ndemographics and streamline the process for analyzing local fair \nhousing impediments, helping grantees establish their own local fair \nhousing priorities. This rule does not interfere with local zoning or \nhousing laws, and it prevents further taxpayer dollars from being used \nto discriminate.\n  Every stakeholder--every one of us--is afforded an opportunity to \ncomment on the rule that HUD made, and, as a former local leader, it \nempowers people at the localities to do justice by their communities. \nThis is a balanced and a measured rule, and it takes up the cause of \nthe work to make our country more and more just.\n  I know personally that so much of the character of our country comes \nfrom the values we have as a whole. There are rare times in our history \nwhere this body is called upon to affirm those values. This body's \nhistory--the noble history of this body--is something I have benefited \nfrom personally around fair housing. Now we have more tools necessary, \nwith big data and analysis, to more effectively and affirmatively \nassert our values and ensure injustice is not being done.\n  I want to make sure that we defeat this amendment for those reasons. \nI believe and know the values of my colleague who proposed this. I do \nnot think it achieves the end that we want to see by disempowering \npeople to try to help families like mine. I was a child in DC moving to \nNew Jersey and found justice--found a pathway toward integration. \nIndeed, I doubt I would be here right now if it weren't for the laws of \nour land.\n  I hope we can defeat this amendment and ensure that our Nation \nbecomes more fair and more just and that more families like mine can \nfind the America we hail when we pledge allegiance to the flag and say \nwe are a Nation of liberty and justice for all.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time during the \nquorum calls be charged equally, fairly--like fair housing--fairly, to \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                       The Appropriations Process\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senators have been working diligently \nthis week, continuing our efforts to advance American priorities and \nresponsibly fund important programs through the appropriations process. \nWe have made good progress so far. The Senate already passed one \nfunding bill by a broad majority at a record early time. Another \nAppropriations subcommittee approved its own funding bill just the \nother day, and it is my hope that we will be able to move two more \nfunding measures across the finish line very shortly. With continued \nwork and cooperation, we can do just that.\n  The two measures before us are the result of hard work, negotiation, \nand compromise. They are the product of strong leadership by Senators \nCollins and Kirk, and they are the culmination of a good deal of input \nfrom both sides of the aisle.\n  Here is what we know these bills can achieve: The transportation and \nhousing infrastructure appropriations bill will invest in our \ntransportation systems and help ensure safety and efficiency. The \nveterans and military construction funding bill will help improve care \nfor veterans and increase oversight and accountability efforts at the \nVA.\n  The legislation before us will also include a provision to help \naddress Zika. This compromise provision will focus on immediate needs \nwhile also providing resources for longer term goals such as a vaccine. \nIt is another reminder that keeping Americans safe and healthy is a top \npriority for us all. Let's continue our work today to move these \nimportant funding measures closer to passage.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3897\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, a home is more than just a roof over \nsomeone's head; it is actually where a family builds their lives. In \nour country, we need to do everything we can to make sure families have \noptions when it comes to finding a place to live, and they need access \nto affordable, safe, and fair housing. Unfortunately, today Republicans \nwant to deal a significant blow to fair housing. The amendment they are \noffering would tear down the civil rights protections in the Fair \nHousing Act of 1968, and I am here today to strongly urge my colleagues \nto vote against it.\n  Before the civil rights movement, African Americans faced an enormous \namount of injustice and racism in housing. People of color were often \nrelegated to substandard housing. They were denied mortgages, and rent \nin an\n\n[[Page S3006]]\n\nAfrican-American neighborhood was often higher than rent in a White \nneighborhood.\n  When the Fair Housing Act went into effect in 1968, it not only \nbanned discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing, it \nwent a step further: A new Federal housing agency was charged with \nproactively rooting out discrimination and segregation in communities \nacross the country. That is an important part of the law because today \npeople across the country still face systemic and sometimes racially \nmotivated barriers to housing. People with disabilities, people of \ncolor, families with children, and religious groups in many areas have \nlimited housing choices.\n  Last year the Department of Housing and Urban Development, also known \nas HUD, issued a long-overdue rule to help carry out that mission to \nproactively eliminate housing segregation and discrimination. For \nStates and local governments that get HUD investments, this rule would \nimprove the quality and access to data on demographics, it would help \nresearchers analyze the barriers people face to access fair housing, \nand it would help set priorities and goals for carrying out the mission \nto actively fight back against discrimination and segregation.\n  Based on pilot programs from around the country, we know this rule \ncan help expand opportunity to more Americans. One of those pilots was \nin Seattle in my home State of Washington. After an assessment of high-\npoverty areas in Puget Sound, the city saw that neighborhoods that \nhistorically have been disenfranchised lacked job opportunities. Armed \nwith that data, the city is setting up a food distribution center and a \njob incubator in those neighborhoods. The city's work is helping to \nfoster job growth in places where low-income residents live, and \nthrough that work, the city expanded economic security to more people. \nThat would not have been possible without the data this long-overdue \nrule provided us.\n  This is the kind of success this new rule will help further, but \nunfortunately we are seeing that some Republicans want to put a stop to \nthose positive changes and backtrack on the gains we have made on civil \nrights in housing, and to me, that is unacceptable. Here in Congress, \nwe should be clearing pathways for more Americans to access more \nhousing, not blocking the away.\n  I am here today to urge my colleagues to vote against that amendment, \nwhich we will be voting on later.\n  Mr. President, while I have the floor, I wish to talk about another \ntopic that is very important to me. I am very honored to come to the \nfloor today with good news for thousands of military families, \nincluding three couples I met just last week here in the Nation's \nCapital. Each of the veterans I met with had suffered a catastrophic \ninjury while fighting for our country, which changed the course of \ntheir lives and their families' lives forever.\n  Matt Keil was shot by a sniper and paralyzed. Kevin Jaye was injured \nby a roadside bomb in Afghanistan. Tyler Black was paralyzed during a \nfirefight. What was the one thing each of these veterans wished for \nafter he returned home and got out of the hospital? Well, like so many \nwomen and men in our country, they dreamed of having a family of their \nown.\n  Even though each veteran suffered injuries that made it nearly \nimpossible to conceive naturally, they have hope because in this day \nand age, the medical technology exists to make their dream of having a \nfamily come true. The most popular path is in vitro fertilization, \nknown as IVF, but because of a policy enacted decades ago, the VA is \nbarred from covering the costs of IVF, which forced Matt, Kevin, and \nTyler, with their partners, to go down that road alone even though \ntheir injuries were caused while serving all of us overseas. \nCollectively, they have paid tens and tens of thousands of dollars out-\nof-pocket. Matt said to me that when he heard the VA wouldn't cover the \none medical procedure he and his wife wanted so badly, he felt like his \ncountry had abandoned him. We are talking about a man who sacrificed \nhis body for our country.\n  I believe this is wrong. When this country sends brave men and women \nto work, we promise to take care of them when they return home. That is \nwhy I have been fighting to change this policy once and for all, and \ntoday I am very proud to see this effort take a big step forward with \nbipartisan support here in the Senate. My provision in the underlying \nVA appropriations bill will finally allow the VA to cover those costs \nand let our veterans know their country is there for them when they \ncome home. It is the right thing to do for Matt and his wife Tracy, \nKevin and Lauren, Tyler and Crystal, and every other military family in \nthis country.\n  As we move to pass this bill through the Senate, I call on my \ncolleagues in the House to follow suit and get this done. This is not \nabout politics or partisanship, and we shouldn't be cutting corners \nwhen it comes to our veterans and their families. This is a chance to \nsupport our veterans and the dreams they have fought so hard for--to \nhave a family.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3900, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I call for regular order with respect to the \nBlunt amendment No. 3900.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. LEE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise not to debate the broad question of the Federal Government's \nproper role in protecting and advancing public health; instead, I am \nhere to stress to my colleagues that with a growing national debt that \nwill soon exceed $20 trillion, we cannot continue spending money we \ndon't have.\n  If this emergency supplemental measure is adopted, it will be the \n15th emergency supplemental we have passed since 2006, totaling about \n$190 billion in deficit spending. This is not how responsible \ngovernments budget. It is not how responsible governments behave.\n  Indeed, we have the ability to provide the resources the country \nneeds to fight the Zika virus without adding to our national debt. For \nstarters, we can undo the $500 million President Obama took from the \ninternational infectious diseases account which was placed in his \nunapproved Green Climate Fund. USAID is sitting on $1.2 billion in \nunobligated Ebola funds. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for \nPreparedness and Response currently has $347 million not being put to \nuse. There is $525 million in CDC's global health security agenda that \nis unspoken for.\n\n  To the extent that the Zika virus is truly an emergency, one that \ndeserves the Federal Government's attention, we already have more than \nenough unused emergency funds to pay for the fight against this \nemerging threat.\n  Yesterday, my colleague, the distinguished junior senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Lankford, illustrated that this administration has tens \nof billions of dollars in unobligated discretionary funds to pay for \nthis as well.\n  What we should not do, however, is allow the Zika virus to be yet \nanother excuse to run up the national debt, just so appropriators can \ncome back and use unspent emergency money on nonemergency parochial \npriorities at some later date.\n  The entire emergency spending label is to some, perhaps, a little bit \nmisleading. It does not mean that the money gets spent any faster. All \nit does is give Congress the ability to spend the money without having \nto pay for it, to spend the money without having to offset it somewhere \nelse. That is not how we should operate.\n  I urge my colleagues to uphold this budget point of order.\n  Mr. President, pursuant to section 314(e) of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, I raise a point of order against all of the emergency \ndesignations contained in amendment No. 3900, a list of which I am \nsending to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I certainly share the deep concern \nexpressed by my colleague from Utah over the growing size of the \nFederal debt. It is a serious problem. I encourage him to look at the \nchart that Senator Alexander has produced, which shows where the \nproblem is.\n\n[[Page S3007]]\n\n  The problem is on the mandatory side of the budget, not the \ndiscretionary side of the budget, which, due to efforts we have made, \nhas been held relatively flat for several years. But the mandatory \nspending side of the budget is soaring. There is no doubt about that. \nFor example, many of us, when the administration presented its budget, \nrejected the gimmicks that were included, for example, in the \ntransportation budget to shift some $7 billion from discretionary to \nmandatory spending. That was unwarranted. We did not do that.\n  But if ever there were an emergency, it is the threat posed to public \nhealth by the Zika virus. About 2 weeks ago, Senator Johnny Isakson and \nI went to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, \nGA, and heard briefings from the top experts in the world about the \nthreat posed by the Zika virus.\n  The fact is that the news keeps getting worse and worse. Zika has now \nbeen linked for certain to a severe kind of birth defect, making \npregnant women particularly at risk. It has also been linked to a \ndisease known as Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can cause paralysis and \neven death.\n  Those of us who live in Northern States--this kind of mosquito, for \nexample, is found only in the very southern tip of Maine--should take \nno comfort from that fact. The CDC has documented cases of the Zika \nvirus in virtually every State in the Union, and that is because \ndisease knows no boundaries in this world of international travel. In \naddition, the CDC has documented approximately 1,000 cases of Zika. It \nis an epidemic in Puerto Rico, where there are more than 475 documented \ncases--a true crisis for that U.S. territory.\n  From my perspective, we have to act. We have to act quickly. The \nBlunt-Murray compromise bill deserves the emergency designation which \nis attached to it.\n  Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974 and the waiver provisions of applicable budget regulations, \nI move to waive all applicable sections of that act and applicable \nbudget resolutions for purposes of the Blunt-Murray amendment No. 3900, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I believe we are going to have that vote \na little bit later.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4039\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, last night I was off the floor when \nSenator McCain of Arizona offered an amendment regarding the Veterans \nChoice bill. Before the decision is made, I wish to memorialize my \nsupport for the McCain amendment.\n  As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, we waived \njurisdiction so it could be offered on the VA component of this bill.\n  I wish to add one further comment. The cost associated with extending \nthe eligibility of Veterans Choice by 3 years, which is the McCain \namendment, scores at a cost. But to recognize that cost, you have to \nassume we would not have treated an eligible veteran under any other \nprogram if Choice expired.\n  We are never going to abandon our veterans. We have a commitment to \nthe veterans for the health care they have signed up for.\n  What Senator McCain is doing is trying to improve access to health \ncare and to maintain access through the choice of a private sector \nprovider or through a VA provider. There is no additional cost, unless \nyou assume that you want to take away a benefit that we gave 2 years \nago in the omnibus that we passed.\n  I commend Senator McCain for extending the eligibility for Choice for \n3 more years. I will support the amendment when it comes before the \nSenate, and I encourage all other Members to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to each vote in relation to \nH.R. 2577.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3900, as Modified\n\n  Under the previous order, all postcloture time has expired.\n  The question occurs on agreeing to the motion to waive.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am disappointed that Republicans \nrefused to work with us to fully fund the President's emergency \nsupplemental proposal, and it shouldn't have taken us so long to get to \nthis point, but I am pleased that this will move us to a down payment \non the President's emergency funding package through the Senate.\n\n[[Page S3008]]\n\n  I want to commend Chairman Blunt for his work with us on this and all \nthe Democrats and Republicans who are supporting it. But I want to \nremind all of us, this is only a first step, and we have to make sure \nthat this agreement gets through the House and to the President's desk \nin the least amount of time.\n  I hope we can separate it from this bill and move it quickly.

Mr. President, I thank Senator McCain for his tremendous \neffort on behalf of veterans and the different approaches he has used. \nI don't think anybody has worked harder on it or understands it better.\n  I wish there were more we could do for veterans and will work with \nhim to see that that happens, but this amendment isn't the right place \nto do it. This amendment proposes that we increase overspending by $7.7 \nbillion for a continuation of the Veterans Choice Program. It doesn't \noffer badly needed reforms to the program, it simply provides more \nfunding.\n  Unfortunately, the accountability measures currently in place at the \nVA do not go far enough in ensuring that the health care needs of our \nveterans are the priority. By extending the Choice Program, we would be \nextending problematic waiting periods, we would be extending a backlog \nof health care claims, and we would be giving little or no authority to \nthe VA to manage its employees.\n  We have been getting complaints about many of these things, and \nanother veterans proposal in the Senate improves both health care \naccess for veterans and expanded disciplinary\n\n[[Page S3009]]\n\nmeasures at the VA. Senator McCain has worked on that as well. At the \nsame time, it provides offsets to ensure that we continue to help our \nveterans in the future.\n  I have been concerned about what I thought was $6 billion of \nemergency expense every year. I had them actually total that up in the \ncommittee and found out that we do $26.1 billion a year in emergency \nspending. We are going to have to find that money somewhere because if \nwe don't provide offsets, we will not be able to help our veterans or \nour military or our education or anything else. Continued spending \nwithout making responsible choices for priorities will put us in a real \nhole.\n  In order to make sure we are spending on our priorities, such as \nnational defense and our veterans, and that they are not crowded out, I \nraise a point of order.\n  Mr. President, pursuant to section 314(e) of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, I raise a point of order against the emergency designation \nfound on page 3, lines 7 through 12, of amendment No. 4039 to H.R. \n2577, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I note with some interest that the Senator \nfrom Wyoming did not have the same zeal for the $1.1 billion that we \njust passed in emergency spending for Zika that is not paid for, but \nthe important issue is, that this is a program for 1.4 million \nappointments for veterans who would otherwise wait for delayed care, \nover 2.5 million separate payments to doctors, 450,000 Choice health \ncare providers--the list goes on and on.\n  All I am asking for is an extension of a program that is in effect \nand helping our veterans. The fact is, the chairman of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee said last night: What Senator McCain is trying to do \nto improve access to health care is maintain the access through the \nchoice of a private sector provider or VA provider. There is no \nadditional cost unless you assume that you want to take away a benefit \nthat was given 2 years ago in the omnibus bill we passed. He goes on to \nsay he would support this amendment.\n  Who is taking advantage? The majority of the people who are taking \nadvantage of this Choice Card, I will tell the Senator from Wyoming, \nare the young men and women who are just returning from Iraq and \nAfghanistan. We are giving them a choice. We are giving them a choice \nto be able to get the care they need and deserve.\n  In my home State of Arizona, 50 veterans died while on a nonexistent \nwaiting list--50 of them. That is why we have a Choice Card, so they \ncan go out and get the care they need and want and not be on a \nnonexistent waiting list.\n  I don't know what the priorities are of the Senator from Wyoming, but \nI can tell him now, they are not mine, and they are not of the men and \nwomen who are serving this Nation who deserve the best care and the \nchoice of going to the provider that they want to within certain \nparameters.\n  This is simply an extension of a program that is in existence that \ncares for our men and women who served our Nation with sacrifice, and \nsome of them didn't even come back to have a chance to have a Choice \nCard.\n  Mr. President, I ask to waive the budget point of order.\n  Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and \nthe waiver provisions of applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive \nall applicable sections of that act and applicable budget resolutions \nfor the purposes of my amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I wish to speak to the issue that was \njust brought up dealing with veterans funding and specifically the \nChoice Program.\n  Three years ago, Congress put into place a response to what was \nhappening in VA centers all over the country. We were all appalled with \nwhat was happening at VA centers all over the country. But for any of \nus who are in congressional offices, we were aware, were pushing on \nthis issue, and had pushed on this issue for a while.\n  But the media exposed what we all saw, and that was long-secret \nwaiting lists for veterans so that the VA centers could keep their \npositive numbers up and look better--months of waiting for things that \nwould take days across the street.\n  As I dealt with the VA center in my own city, at times it would take \n6 months to get a knee replacement surgery at the VA center, when at \nthe great hospital directly across the street, they could get that same \nsurgery within 2 days.\n  As to hearing aids, it would take months and months to actually go \nthrough the process and to get them at our VA centers.\n  As to cancer care, if you were diagnosed with cancer and had needs \nand treatment that was going to be required, they would literally send \nyou across the country, sometimes more than 2,000 miles away, to \nactually get cancer treatment--away from your family.\n  Congress responded to that by putting into place the Choice Act. It \nwas an emergency. There were major problems that were happening around \nthe country in multiple VA centers, and there had to be a response \nright then. Congress set aside emergency funding and an emergency \nresponse to make sure something came into existence that only loosely \nexisted before. What was called community care was now clarified to say \nthat this is Choice, and it was simple. If a veteran had to wait\n\n[[Page S3010]]\n\nmore than 30 days to get into an appointment or get treatment or if \nthey lived more than 40 miles from a VA center, they would be given the \noption to go wherever they wanted to go. VA was required to start \nworking relationships in every community across the country so that \nveterans would have the option to go wherever they wanted to go.\n\n  I would acknowledge that program is in its infancy. It is 2 years old \nat this point. It has a ways to go to be perfected. There are still \nproblems with it, and there is a constant push from Congress to provide \naccountability to make sure that program is done and done well. That \nshould be the first step in giving veterans real choice. The first step \nof that is 30 days or 40 miles. The second step of that is any VA-\neligible veteran would get a card and they could go to anyplace that \naccepts Medicare. If they accept Medicare anywhere in the country--any \nlab, any hospital, any doctor--they should also be able to receive \nveterans as well. So veterans can go wherever they choose to go \nregardless of the distance.\n  I have veterans who drive past six great hospitals, drive 200 miles \nto get to a VA center, and their families have the burden of all of \nthat travel. It should not be that way. Veterans should be able to go \nwherever they choose to go for care.\n  So the Choice Program is not only a good program, it is the right \ndirection to go and it is a positive first step. But here is the \nproblem: The way this particular amendment has come up, it is not only \nnot germane to this bill because it deals with something that started 3 \nyears ago and we are dealing with a new bill right now, but it is also \nan issue of, we are doing the right thing the wrong way.\n  My staff has heard me say this over and over again: There is a right \nthing to do and there is a right way to do it. Three years ago, we knew \nthis was an issue. Three years ago, the planning should have been put \nin place to put this into the normal appropriations process. This \nprocess puts it into place, so we are adding $7.5 billion onto our \nchildren for a program that should be in the normal appropriations \nprocess that was started 3 years ago and that is not an emergency \nanymore. This is not an emergency. This is now normal funding of a \nprogram we want to keep going and expand. So there is a big issue here \nwe do have to resolve.\n  I want to see us do the Choice Program and do it right, but there is \na right thing to do and a right way to do it. This program is already \nfully funded through the next year. It is not an emergency. It is in \nplace, funded, and ready to go. It doesn't go away in the next year, \nall the way through the fiscal year. Let's put it in the normal \nprocess, let's do it the right way, and let's not add $7 billion to our \nchildren for an emergency that is actually a year away. No one is going \nto convince me that in a $4 trillion budget, there are not areas we \ncould cut. Earlier this week I identified $86 billion in funds that are \navailable to cover the $1 billion for Zika that this Congress decided \nto do in emergency funding anyway. We have the funds available.\n  We can honor our veterans. We can do this and also honor our \nchildren. At the same time we are honoring our veterans, let's honor \nthe next generation and make sure we are not adding debt to the next \ngeneration.\n  With that, Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the McCain \namendment No. 4039 is not germane to the Collins amendment No. 3896, as \namended, or H.R. 2577.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained, and the \namendment falls.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support my VA \nspending bill to final passage. It is a very bipartisan bill.\n  I also would like to thank my ranking Democratic member, Senator Jon \nTester of Montana, who has been a great partner. We have worked with \nall Senators on both sides of the aisle to include their priorities and \nhave worked through dozens of amendments. We include more than two \ndozen amendments in this bill.\n  The bill provides record funding for our veterans' health care, \nprotects whistleblowers, includes opioid safety, and also has the RAID \nAct to clean up the VA so that cockroaches are not in the VA kitchens \nand dining facilities. This bill also adds 100 staff to the IG's office \nand combats veteran homelessness. It requires better screening of VA \ndoctors so they can't switch from State to State. The bill also \nincreases medical research and adds money for health care for our \nveterans.\n  I thank the subcommittee staff for doing outstanding work this year, \nand that includes Tina Evans, Chad Schulken, Michael Bain, Robert \nHenke, D'Ann Lettieri, Patrick Magnuson, and Carlos Elias.\n  The bottom line: This bill does right by our troops and does right by \nour veterans. I thank my Senate colleagues and urge its rapid adoption.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to voice my full support for the \nfiscal year 2017 Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development, and \nrelated agencies appropriations bill which includes the fiscal year \n2017 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and related agencies \nappropriations bill. Each of these bills was passed out of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee by a vote of 30-0 last month. I urge all my \ncolleagues to support this bipartisan package of bills.\n  I commend Senators Collins and Reed for their hard work on the T-HUD \nbill and their collegiality on the floor this week managing this bill. \nT-HUD is our annual jobs bill making investments at the State and local \nlevel, delivering on America's physical infrastructure needs and \nAmerica's compelling human needs. The bill before us will keep our \nroads and transportation systems safe and in good repair while \npreserving housing assistance for our Nation's most in need.\n  I am especially proud of Senators Collins and Reed for making renewed \ninvestments in lead paint poison prevention. As the Maryland Senator \nfrom Baltimore, this is an issue I know all too well. Senator Kit Bond \nand I worked together on the VA-HUD bill to first bring attention to \nthis crippling public health problem. April 19 marked the anniversary \nof Freddie Gray's death, a young man who grew up in Baltimore's low-\nincome housing. Before Freddie's second birthday, his blood lead levels \nwere seven times the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's \nsuggested level, leaving Freddie severely and permanently brain \ndamaged. Today there are still half a million children under the age of \n6 with lead poisoning.\n  This bill increases lead prevention funding in three programs. First, \nthe Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes is funded at $135 \nmillion, an increase of $25 million to support lead-based paint hazard \nreductions in 1,750 additional units. This program provides safer homes \nfor more than 6,200 people. Second, the Mikulski-Bond Lead Hazard \nReduction Demo Program is funded at $55 million, an increase of $10 \nmillion. This program provides competitive funds to State and local \ngovernments to implement lead hazardous reduction programs in privately \nowned and owner-occupied housing. Third, the Public Housing Capital \nFund is funded at $1.9 billion, an increase of $25 million. This will \nremediate 1,500 public housing units.\n  This bill also includes a number of reforms to HUD's lead programs. \nAmong these is the requirement for HUD to update its blood level \nstandard to the stronger Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nstandard. HUD's standard hasn't been updated since 1999. In addition, \nthe bill makes studio and efficiency apartments eligible for \nremediation grants for the first time. It is estimated that 34,000 \nzero-bedroom dwellings house children under 6 years old.\n  The transportation portion of this bill makes significant investments \nin Maryland's highways, byways, and transit systems. It cuts the first \ncheck under the FAST Act passed last December. This means more formula \nfunding for every State. For Maryland, that is an increase of $62 \nmillion.\n  For transit, this bill provides increased funding for the Federal \nTransit\n\n[[Page S3011]]\n\nAdministration totaling $575 million. It includes the Job Corridor-\nPurple Line project in the Washington suburbs of Maryland. A total of \n$125 million is provided for the construction of this light rail \nproject.\n  For the DC Metro system, this bill provides the eighth installment of \n$150 million in Federal dedicated funding. This is the fully authorized \nlevel and will be matched dollar for dollar by the three jurisdictions. \nFighting for this annual appropriation was the promise I made and have \nkept since the deadly Fort Totten crash in June 2009. This funding must \nbe used on capital improvements relating to safety including buying new \nrail cars, track improvements, and signal upgrades.\n  I included bill language requiring the U.S. Department of \nTransportation Secretary to do three things before this funding money \ncan be spent. First, the Secretary must approve each expenditure. \nSecond, the Secretary must certify Metro is making progress \nimplementing FTA's safety and financial management corrective actions. \nThird, the Secretary must determine that Metro is using this money for \ntop safety priorities.\n  In addition to this dedicated funding, I am proud of the safety \namendment I introduced with Senators Shelby, Cardin, Warner, Kaine, and \nBrown that was passed earlier in the week. This amendment provides \nadditional funding to FTA to expand its safety oversight workforce for \na total increase of $5.25 million over the current year funding level. \nIt will enable FTA to hire six full-time employees for Metro's Rail \nOperations Control Center, four more investigators, seven additional \ninspectors, and six more contractors.\n  This additional funding means FTA will now have more inspectors to \nwatch as Metro crews work to complete SafeTrack, the yearlong plan to \naccelerate repairs on the system. Inspectors will be there to make sure \nthe track work is fixed the right way for good. FTA also will have \nsafety staff at the Rail Operations Control Center 24 hours a day and 7 \ndays a week making sure emergency procedures are followed to prevent \nfuture incidents. FTA staff will help Metro implement the National \nTransportation Safety Board's recent recommendations to overhaul the \ncenter's emergency operations and training. FTA staff will make sure \nthese reforms remain in place and are followed. Finally, more \ninvestigators will help FTA tackle approximately 100 Metro \ninvestigations conducted each year.\n  I also want to say a few words about the Military Construction and \nVeterans Affairs appropriations bill. This is another bipartisan bill \nfunding vital programs for the health and well-being of our Nation's \nveterans, troops, and their families developed by Senators Kirk and \nTester. Overall, this bill provides $83 billion in discretionary \nfunding which is an increase of $3.2 billion above the current year \nfunding level.\n  This bill fully funds VA Medical Services at the President's request \nof $52.8 billion. This is $1 billion over what we advanced last year to \naddress increased demand for VA medical care both within and outside \nthe VA health care system.\n  The bill provides additional funding for disability claims \nprocessing. Significant progress has been made to eliminate the backlog \nin processing initial claims, but unfortunately, the backlog in appeals \nis rapidly building. This bill includes $2.9 billion for claims \nprocessing, $30 million above the request, to hire 300 new claims \nprocessors and 240 additional employees for the Board of Veterans \nAppeals. Also included is an increase of $46 million for the Board of \nVeterans Appeals, bringing their total funding to $156 million. This \nwill provide for hiring an additional 240 new employees focused on \nappeals processing.\n  For our women veterans, this bill makes significant strides bring \nparity between male and female veterans. This bill mandates that the VA \nresearch and acquire prosthetic devices specifically designed for \nwomen. It includes $5.3 billion overall to treat more than 500,000 \nfemale veterans who get care through the VA. This bill targets $535 \nmillion for gender-specific health care which is $20 million over the \nrequest and nearly $70 million over the current funding level. This \nincludes gynecology, reproductive health, and mental health care for \nwomen. I also was proud to support Senator Murray's amendment in \ncommittee, allowing the VA to cover the cost of reproductive services \nfor veterans who suffered service-related injuries that prevent them \nfrom starting families.\n  The military construction part of this bill fully funds all seven \nMaryland projects included in the President's budget request. This \nmeans a total of $340 million for construction jobs at Fort Meade, Pax \nRiver, Joint Base Andrews, and Bethesda Medical Center.\n  Finally, the bill includes $1.1 billion in emergency spending to \ncombat the urgent Zika crisis. CDC, NIH, and USAID need this funding on \nthe ground today. $1.1 billion is a bottom line, not a starting point \nfor negotiation. I am committed to sending a Zika supplemental to the \nPresident as soon as possible.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this package of bills. It \nmeets many compelling human needs and physical infrastructure needs of \nour nation and does not include poison pill riders. It is an example of \nhow, working together, we can solve problems and put America to work.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I rise to speak in support of the \nMilitary Construction and Veterans Affairs division of the substitute \nbefore us. I commend Chairman Kirk and Ranking Member Tester for their \nleadership in crafting the fiscal year 2017 Military Construction and \nVeterans Affairs funding bill. As a member of the Military Construction \nand Veterans Affairs Subcommittee, I have appreciated their steady, \nstrong advocacy for our Nation's veterans, servicemembers, and their \nfamilies.\n  As the daughter of a World War II veteran, I know well the sacrifices \nof those who serve and have served on our behalf, as well as the \nsacrifices made by their families. The vital programs and benefits \nfunded by this bill will help fulfill our obligations to them and honor \ntheir commitment to our Nation.\n  While we can never fully repay these debts, we must strive to provide \neach veteran with the quality health care that they deserve. One way \nthis bill helps to meet this goal is through the extension it would \nprovide of the highly successful Access Received Closer to Home, or \nARCH, program. This pilot program, which is scheduled to expire in \nAugust, serves rural veterans in northern Maine, Montana, Kansas, \nVirginia, and Arizona, providing them access to high quality care in \ntheir communities and near their families.\n  Many of my constituents tell me that this program has proven to be a \nlifeline for them and has saved them the arduous burden of traveling up \nto 600 miles round trip to receive care at the Togus VA Medical Center \nin Augusta, ME.\n  In Maine, the program not only reduces wait times for appointments \nand prevents veterans from going through a third-party administrator to \nreceive care, but it is cost effective. According to the VA's own \nstatistics, the average cost of ARCH per veteran in Maine is less than \nhalf the average cost for VHA direct care. More than 90 percent of ARCH \nveterans are overwhelmingly satisfied with their care, a testament to \nwhy ARCH should be a model for the Nation.\n  Ensuring that veterans continue to receive this seamless care is \nparamount, and I thank Chairman Kirk and Ranking Member Tester for \nincluding an extension of this vital program in the fiscal year 2017 \nfunding legislation.\n  I am also pleased that this legislation would fund the President's \nfiscal year 2017 request for VA medical leases, including funding to \nlease a new Community Based Outpatient Clinic--CBOC--facility in \nPortland, ME. This project would allow VA to consolidate and colocate \nthe Saco and Portland CBOCs with Maine Medical Center and its \naffiliate, the Tufts University School of Medicine. This collaboration \nwill provide primary care, mental health, women's health, and specialty \ncare medical services for veterans.\n  This legislation would also help to address the opioid epidemic by \nrequiring the Department to improve appropriate pain care for veterans. \nIt also includes programs to help end veteran homelessness, expand care \nservices focused on our growing population of female veterans, and \nsupport caregivers, who shoulder the enormous responsibility of caring \nfor veterans who are unable to care for themselves\n\n[[Page S3012]]\n\n  Finally, I want to highlight the funding included in this legislation \nfor our Nation's civilian and military members--and their families--who \nserve at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, ME. The legislation \nincludes $74.9 million for housing, the replacement of the medical and \ndental clinic, and utility nuclear improvements. These projects will \nhelp provide the exceptional personnel at PNSY with the facilities they \nneed and deserve to carry out the mission.\n  Again, I thank the chairman and ranking member for their excellent \nwork in balancing the priorities within their bill, and I urge my \ncolleagues to advance this important legislation.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, universal, safe, and consistent trucking \nregulations are vital to all aspects of the trucking industry and to \nall users of the national highway system. Ensuring highway safety must \nremain a priority of this body. It also remains critical that this body \nmaintain predictable safety laws to sustain efficient outcomes for \ntruckers, trucking companies, the manufacturers and growers of the \ngoods that trucks transport, and the customers who buy the products.\n  Congress determined years ago that a uniform system of Federal \ntrucking rules would lead to safer and more productive outcomes than a \n50-State patchwork of trucking regulations, as goods are often \ntransported across State lines. Despite Congress's intentions, we are \nseeing various State trucking rules being implemented across the \ncountry that stray from the Federal guidelines. We need to figure out \nhow to address this. We need to make sure that we have commonsense \nrules that don't change every time a driver crosses a State line while \ncontinuing to protect truck drivers and road users from unsafe \nsituations.\n  I think we have got a little more work to do before we are ready for \na solution, but I pledge to work with all who are willing and maybe we \ncan figure something out in the coming months.\n  Thank you.\n\n\n                       Maritime Security Program\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I join today with my good friend, Senator \nHirono, to address the requirement for full authorized funding of the \nMaritime Security Program. Senator Hirono and I serve together on the \nSeapower Subcommittee and firmly believe that this program is important \nto our national security.\n  The United States needs a U.S.-flag merchant marine that is strong, \nactive, competitive, and useful to the military. Our merchant marine \nhas a long history of providing sealift support to our Armed Forces for \nglobal military operations. The Maritime Security Program is a unique \npublic-private partnership that helps the merchant marine, enhancing \nAmerica's commercial sealift capability while saving the American \ntaxpayer billions of dollars.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Seapower \nSubcommittee, I could not agree more with the Senator from \nMississippi's views concerning the importance of the MSP program. The \n60-ship MSP program is the most prudent and economical means to address \nthe U.S. military's current and projected sealift requirements. A 2006 \nreport prepared for the Military Sealift Committee of the National \nDefense Transportation Association concluded that ``the likely cost to \nthe government to replicate just the vessel capacity provided by the \nMSP dry cargo vessels would be $13 billion.'' In addition, the U.S. \nTransportation Command, TransCom, has estimated that it would cost the \nU.S. Government an additional $52 billion to replicate the ``global \nintermodal system'' that is made available to the Department of \nDefense, DOD, by MSP participants. In contrast, MSP participants now \nprovide DOD with the same vessels and global intermodal system at a \nfraction of what it would cost our government to do the job itself.\n  Mr. WICKER. The Senate version of the Transportation-HUD \nAppropriations Bill for fiscal year 2017 includes $275 million for the \nMaritime Security Program. This is an increase of $65 million above the \nenacted level for fiscal year 2016. Although we are pleased that the \nSenate Appropriations Committee has recommended this increase in \nfunding, we hasten to point out that Congress acted last December to \nincrease the authorization level for the Maritime Security Program to \n$299,997,000 for fiscal year 2017. The House Appropriations Committee \nhas recommended funding for the next fiscal year that would meet this \nauthorization.\n  As this appropriations bill works its way through Congress, we urge \nthe chairs and ranking members of the Transportation-HUD Appropriations \nSubcommittees and the full Appropriations Committee to work in a \nbipartisan, bicameral fashion to provide funding for the Maritime \nSecurity Program at its fully authorized level of $299,997,000 for \nfiscal year 2017.\n  Ms. HIRONO. I strongly agree with Senator Wicker. Despite the clear \nbenefits the MSP program provides, the MSP commercial fleet is under \nextreme economic pressure from reductions in government-impelled \ncargoes and foreign competitive factors. I completely share the \nconcerns expressed by the then-TransCom commander, GEN Paul Selva, in \nhis March 2015 testimony before the Armed Services Committee, where he \nstated that the ``reduction in government impelled cargoes due to the \ndrawdown in Afghanistan and reductions in food aid . . .are driving \nvessel owners to reflag to non-U.S.-flag out of economic necessity . . \n.With the recent vessel reductions, the mariner base is at the point \nwhere future reductions in U.S.-flag capacity puts our ability to fully \nactivate, deploy and sustain forces at increased risk.''\n  Accordingly, to ensure that this essential U.S. commercial sealift \ncapability provided by the MSP program remains available to meet \nAmerica's national security requirements, the MSP program needs to be \nfully funded as authorized by the Congress.\n  Mr. WICKER. I would like to add a comment from the current TransCom \ncommander, GEN Darren McDew. In January, General McDew said, ``As a \nmilitary professional and senior leader, I think about and plan for \nwhat the future may hold, and I would tell you we must prepare for the \nreal possibility we will not enjoy the uncontested seas and broad \ninternational support experienced in 1991. If either of those \npossibilities becomes reality, and if we remain committed to responding \nto security incidents around the globe, the only way of guaranteeing we \ndecisively meet our national objectives is with U.S. ships operated by \nU.S. mariners.''\n  I thank Senator Hirono for joining me in this effort to ensure that \nfull funding is secured for the Maritime Security Program in fiscal \nyear 2017.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  U.S. Innovation and Competitiveness\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the need to drive \ninnovation and competitiveness here in the United States.\n  I vividly remember watching the Apollo missions on TV and the launch \nof that 36-story tall Saturn V rocket that took Neil Armstrong and Buzz \nAldrin to the surface of the Moon.\n  The space program not only inspired a generation of Americans, but it \nalso led to incredible advances in science and technology that over the \nlast 50 years have accounted for as much as half of all the economic \ngrowth in the United States. These groundbreaking advances firmly \nestablished our Nation as an international leader in innovation.\n  During the height of the space race, America's Federal investment in \nresearch and development reached nearly 2 percent of the Nation's GDP. \nToday, overall Federal R spending--the seed corn of our future \nprosperity--has fallen to a historic low of 0.78 percent of GDP.\n  With the United States investing less on science, research, and \neducation, and our competitors outpacing us, we are losing our footing \nin the global marketplace. Congress must increase the Federal \ninvestment in R to 1 percent of GDP if we want to continue to be \nleading the world in innovation. This commitment should include a focus \non increased Federal support for basic research--an essential component \nof any kind of innovation economy.\n\n[[Page S3013]]\n\n  In addition to increased investment, we in Congress need to implement \npolicy solutions that will reassert American leadership \ninternationally. We need to invest in what works. We need to listen to \nthe innovators, academic leaders, and industries that are making the \nlife-changing inventions of the future a reality. To that end, my \ncolleague Senator Cory Gardner and I have convened a series of \nroundtable discussions on ways to improve the American innovation \nsystem. Just last week, our Commerce Committee leaders, Chairman Thune \nand Ranking Member Nelson, held a productive hearing on ways to \nleverage the U.S. science and technology enterprise. After receiving \ninput from industry, academia, science organizations, and economic \ndevelopment organizations, Senators Thune, Nelson, Gardner, and I are \nworking to develop new legislation to guide our Nation's research \npriorities in the coming years and to improve America's innovation \nsystem. Through these roundtables, we heard that the stakeholder \ncommunity agrees that modest, sustained, and predictable increases in \nFederal research and development investments are absolutely critical to \nensuring the economic competitiveness of the United States.\n  We need continued Federal investment in basic research, while also \nproviding opportunities to commercialize that research. There is basic \nresearch that our companies simply cannot afford to conduct, making \nFederal investment absolutely critical. We also need to work to reduce \nadministrative burdens on researchers so that we can maximize our \nFederal research investment. We need that investment to be put into the \nlab and not filling out more paperwork. We need stronger partnerships \nbetween government, the private sector, and academia in order to \ncapitalize on discoveries emerging from our world-class research \nuniversities, such as the University of Michigan, Wayne State \nUniversity, and Michigan State University.\n  We must also close the significant employment gap in the STEM \nworkforce for women and underrepresented minorities. Women make up less \nthan 50 percent of post-bachelor STEM degree programs and only about \none-quarter of the STEM workforce. Underrepresented minorities, \nincluding Hispanics and African Americans, make up about 10 percent of \nthe science and engineering workforce. Last month, I joined a number of \nmy colleagues in introducing the STEM Opportunities Act, legislation \nthat would improve inclusion of women, minorities, and people with \ndisabilities in STEM careers. It is a top priority for me to see that a \nsimilar provision is included in our bipartisan legislation.\n  Finally, if we want to continue to be a leader in the global economy, \nwe need to be a nation that makes things. Michigan is a State that \nbuilds and grows things, and I will continue to fight to make sure we \ncontinue doing that. Investments in advanced manufacturing will support \nfirms of all sizes and support good-paying jobs and help keep them here \nin the United States. That is why it is one of my top priorities for \nthis legislation that we ensure American manufacturing companies can \ncompete and succeed in the highly competitive global marketplace.\n  Last month, I joined my colleagues, Senators Coons and Ayotte, to \nintroduce the bipartisan Manufacturing Extension Partnership \nImprovement Act. The Manufacturing Extension Program, or MEP, is a \nFederal public-private partnership that helps businesses get their \nproducts to market through a variety of consulting services. The MEP \nImprovement Act would expand and improve the MEP Program to serve \nsmall- and medium-sized manufacturing companies, which are a critical \npart of our economy and our national competitiveness. Including key \ncomponents of the MEP Improvement Act will be a top priority for me in \nthe new legislation being drafted.\n  Science and technology are inseparable from the American \ncompetitiveness ecosystem. However, we need to focus on the entire \necosystem--from STEM, or STEAM, to basic research, to application and \ncommercialization--and the inspiration that drives ambitious endeavors \nlike exploring space and the other frontiers of science. We in Congress \nmust do our part by supporting and investing in our efforts to drive \neconomic growth, unleash increased productivity, enhance our safety and \nsecurity, and make the world a better place for future generations.\n  We are facing big challenges as a Nation, but I am committed to \nworking with everyone--Democrats, Republicans, industry, academia, \nworkers, students, and employers--to increase investments and implement \nthe solutions that will ensure American competitiveness and create more \ngood-paying jobs here in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if there is one specialty that every \nMember of Congress has, it is air travel. We spend more time on \nairplanes, more time in airports, more time waiting for flights and \nworrying about flights than most other Americans.\n  As Members of Congress, we are veterans of air travel.\n  We have all seen the footage of people waiting to go through security \nscreening at major airports, particularly in the city of Chicago at \nboth O'Hare and Midway. The lines are so long that people have had to \nwait 2 to 3 hours--2 to 3 hours to go through a security checkpoint.\n  People are angry, and I don't blame them. Thousands of people have \nmissed their flights, and some were stuck sleeping in airports \novernight. The commissioner of aviation, Ginger Evans, told me: We \npulled out the cots that we save for snow emergencies so that people \nnow, in the heat of early summer, are facing the same kinds of delays.\n  Our highest priority is to protect those who travel on our airplanes. \nPoor planning and inadequate funding have led to alarming delays across \nairports in America, and in Chicago we have felt it more than most. \nMore needs to be done to fix the problem. That is what I have been \nworking to do.\n  Earlier this week, I talked to the Department of Homeland Security \nSecretary Jeh Johnson on the phone about the next steps. Yesterday, I \nfollowed up with a call to TSA Administrator Peter Neffenger to hear \nhis thoughts. We all agree that the real problem is the shortage of TSA \nscreeners. More people need to be hired and trained so security lines \ncan stay open and people can move through the checkpoints faster.\n  In the meantime, there are immediate steps we need to take in \nChicago. First, we are going to get 58 more TSA screening officers in \nthe next 2 weeks and 224 by August. That is about a 15-percent increase \nin TSA staff, and it is a good start.\n  O'Hare will also receive 5 K-9 teams. That will double the number of \nK-9s we have at the airport. Two teams were brought in yesterday, and \nthe rest will arrive within 5 days. These bomb-sniffing dogs do \nimportant work. They check carry-on baggage. If there is no problem, \nthe passengers can move out of the standard line and into the expedited \nline. These dogs can help us speed up the process by allowing up to \n5,000 additional passengers a day to move through the faster security \nlines.\n  There will also be a shift of 100 TSA staff from part-time to full-\ntime status so more people can be on deck to help with the lines. And \nofficers who currently work on nondirect security functions are going \nto be called to pitch in and help officers at the checkpoints.\n  We are also working to get more people enrolled in TSA PreCheck. I \ncan't emphasize enough how important that is. For $85, a regular \ntraveler can buy--or at least apply for and be given--a TSA PreCheck \nstatus for 5 years. PreCheck lines can scan nearly twice as fast as the \nordinary lines. Customers don't have to wait as long or remove their \nshoes, belts, or light jackets. We need to make sure more people are \nhearing about this option and are signing up for it as quickly as \npossible.\n  TSA is now working on a mobile app to help people get enrolled while \nthey are waiting in lines, and they are also looking at lowering \nPreCheck signup costs by competing out the actual function of signing \nup for PreCheck.\n\n[[Page S3014]]\n\nPreCheck has gotten a lot of traction, especially in Chicago, where \nthis past month alone we have seen 5,700 new enrollments. I hope we can \ncontinue to quickly expand this program to help more people into the \nfaster lines.\n  The airlines have to be part of the solution as well. I am glad \nSenator Blumenthal of Connecticut is on the floor because both he and \nSenator Markey of Massachusetts spoke out early on this aspect that I \nam about to address.\n  Airlines can help us by reducing high wait times, especially during \nthe peak summer season. I have joined my colleagues Senator Blumenthal \nand Senator Markey in urging the airlines to suspend the checked bag \nfees over the summer. A lot of people are dragging their bags on the \nairplanes because they don't want to pay to have them checked. On \nMonday, I spoke with Secretary Johnson, who told me baggage fees are \ncontributing to long lines because more people are carrying on luggage \nthat should be carefully screened through check-in.\n  Over the last year, the volume of passengers and personnel passing \nthrough security checkpoints has increased 7 percent while the number \nof checked bags has increased only 3 percent. That tells the story: \nMore people are carrying on their luggage and causing problems as more \ntravelers pack their roller bags to the brim, making the bags take even \nlonger to be scanned. Waiving the checked baggage fee during the summer \ntravel season can reduce the incentive for passengers to carry-on \nluggage, and it can help speed up the process.\n  Let me also add that it is in this baggage that people are dragging \nonboard that TSA screeners are finding things that aren't supposed to \nbe on an airplane. Last year, they found 2,653 firearms, and 83 percent \nof them were loaded. Most of them were from one State; I will not name \nit. But by and large, we have to be more mindful of the fact that this \nstops the process or at least slows it down.\n  I am convening a meeting with Administrator Neffenger tomorrow, along \nwith State and local officials and airlines at Chicago O'Hare, and then \nwe are also going to be visiting the Midway airport. We will see \nfirsthand what airlines are experiencing and what their response is. We \nhave to stop this meltdown when it comes to airport security.\n  Let me close by saying this: The news today about EgyptAir was a grim \nreminder that we still live in a very dangerous world. The role and \nresponsibility of the Transportation Security Agency is to make sure \nthat when we and our families travel, we come off those planes just as \nsafely as we went on. It is an important security responsibility. Yes, \nit is an irritation and a frustration, but we need to do it in this \ndangerous world to make sure that we stop people from using their \ncarry-on baggage and other sources to cause harm to innocent people.\n  I stand behind TSA and its mission, but what happened in Chicago is \nunacceptable. This meltdown should have been avoided. There should have \nbeen better management, more screeners, and we should have been ready \nfor the surge in passengers. Beginning this week, we are going to make \nthat right. I hope the visit by the TSA Administrator tomorrow will be \nthe beginning of a conversation that will not only help our airports in \nChicago but also help our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from \nIllinois for his leadership on this issue and his support for the \ninitiative that Senator Markey and I first raised, which he has \nsupported so very helpfully, and essentially that is to persuade the \nairlines to stop charging for bags that are checked onto planes as \nopposed to being carried on. Obviously, the fee for checking those bags \nadds to the number of carry-ons and provides an incentive for larger \nnumbers of carry-ons. In fact, TSA itself reports that there has been \nan increase in carry-ons due to these fees.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The elimination of the fees for checked bags is not a panacea. It is \nnot going to solve this problem alone. But it will, along with other \nmeasures, help reduce lines that result from screening.\n  I commend Admiral Neffenger for his very close and prompt attention \nto this matter and for a number of the initiatives he has taken. We \nheard about them in the Commerce Committee this morning. I also thank \nSecretary Johnson for supporting elimination of the fees for checked \nbags. I think his leadership will be important.\n  There are a number of other initiatives that can and should be taken. \nThere is automated equipment that can expedite the screening of those \ncarry-on bags. The use of additional screeners is important. The number \nhas been reduced over the last 3 years by about 5,800. The addition of \nanother close to 800 will help compensate. But again, alone, none of \nthese solutions will provide the answer.\n  As far as the automated equipment is concerned, the cost for the 20 \nbusiest airports is about $30 million--a pittance compared to the $3.8 \nbillion in revenue the airlines make every year as a result of the fees \nfor checked baggage. I will repeat that: $3.8 billion is going to \nairlines as a result of their purposefully charging for bags checked \ninstead of carried on. Many of those bags that go through screening now \nwind up in the holds of those airplanes anyway because there isn't room \nfor them on the plane, so they wind up being checked at the gate. That \nsimply adds to the cost and inconvenience of passengers: delayed \nflights, missed flights, flights that are in effect late because of the \nboarding problems. All of these accumulating issues are reasons to \neliminate these fees and also give passengers the benefit of lower \ncosts.\n  My hope is that the airlines will voluntarily eliminate these fees \nfor checked bags. After the meeting we had today with Admiral \nNeffenger, I am encouraged that the TSA will take initiative and help \nto implement other measures as well.\n  In the meantime, we need the airlines to show some leadership as \nwell, and I am hopeful they will do the right thing. The U.S. Travel \nAssociation has called it a national crisis. The evidence is \nirrefutable. At checkpoints that have no fee charges for bags, the \ncarry-ons are 27 percent lower, so the numbers of carry-ons definitely \ndiminish as the fees are eliminated. This evidence is irrefutable and \nargues powerfully that the airlines should not keep their passengers \nwaiting in line. They should make some sacrifice to their bottom line \nand should not be profiting at the expense of their passengers.\n  I will conclude by saying on this point--and I am so glad to see my \ncolleague and friend from Massachusetts--that we need this initiative \nnow, and we need it to happen.\n  I also want to advocate on behalf of the safety of our roads. \nBlumenthal amendment No. 4002 will not be called up in part because it \nhad been willfully mischaracterized by an industry campaign. In effect, \nwe need to make truck drivers more safely empowered on the roads to \ntake steps to protect themselves. Drivers who spend too much time \nbehind the wheel are tired. They can't drive as safely. This amendment \nwould enable them to drive more safely, give them the rest they need, \nprotect them, and enable the roads to be safer not only for them but \nfor people generally.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I yield to Senator Markey.\n  Mr. MARKEY. I just want to thank the Senator for his work. We have \nbeen partnering on this issue of eliminating bag fees at airports. \nSince they have been imposed, 27 percent more bags now go through \nbaggage clearing with passengers. If we could just get that out of the \nway, get rid of those baggage fees, I think it would expedite \ndramatically the ability of people to get on planes in this country. So \nI am glad we are able to have this moment to be able to speak about the \nimportance of this issue.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and I have been partners in this effort, and I hope \nwe can prevail.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n[[Page S3015]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3970 to Amendment No. 3896\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I call up the Collins-Reed-Cochran \namendment No. 3970.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3970 to amendment No. 3896.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to carry out a final rule and \n       notice of the Department of Housing and Urban Development)\n\n       At the appropriate place in division A, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to \n     direct a grantee to undertake specific changes to existing \n     zoning laws as part of carrying out the final rule entitled \n     ``Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing'' (80 Fed. Reg. 42272 \n     (July 16, 2015)) or the notice entitled ``Affirmatively \n     Furthering Fair Housing Assessment Tool'' (79 Fed. Reg. 57949 \n     (September 26, 2014)).\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the amendment that Senator Jack Reed, \nSenator Thad Cochran, and I are offering would make very clear that \nnone of the funds made available in this appropriations bill can be \nused by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to direct a \nrecipient of Federal funds to undertake changes to their zoning laws. \nThere has been concern that some have brought up that a new rule that \nwas issued last year by the Department would somehow allow HUD to be \nthe national zoning authority for every neighborhood in our country. \nWhile I do not believe that is a correct interpretation of the fair \nhousing amendment or regulation that HUD has promulgated, the Collins-\nReed-Cochran amendment ensures that HUD cannot do that. It eliminates \nthat possibility and ensures that communities will continue to make \ntheir own decisions to address these Federal requirements.\n  By contrast, the proposal offered by my colleague from Utah, Senator \nLee, would prohibit all funding for a rule that was issued by HUD based \non a requirement that is included in the landmark civil rights era law \nknown as the Fair Housing Act of 1968. It is important to know that \nthis regulation was in direct response to a 2010 GAO report that \ncriticized HUD's implementation of the requirement of the law that \ngrantees, recipients of these funds, affirmatively enhance fair housing \nopportunities. It also was issued in response to requests from \ncommunities seeking guidance to ensure compliance because they don't \nwant to be sued for inadvertently violating Fair Housing Act \nrequirements. So communities asked HUD for more tools, better \nassessments, and more guidance to make sure that they were in \ncompliance.\n  It is important to know that the Fair Housing Act prohibits \ndiscrimination not only based on race, national origin, and religion \nbut also against those with disabilities. Indeed, 56 percent of the \ncomplaints of housing discrimination have been initiated by individuals \nwith disabilities. That is why Senator Lee's amendment is opposed by \nthe Paralyzed Veterans of America and other disability groups, as well \nas the Urban League, the NAACP, and countless civil rights groups. On \nthe first vote, we will be voting on the Collins-Reed-Cochran \namendment.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Will Senator Collins yield briefly for a question?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Yes, I will yield.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Senator Collins and every member of this body know \nthat I support fair housing. It is so important for my State, where \nthere is a lack of affordable housing, and the Anchorage School \nDistrict is one of the most diverse in the Nation. However, I have \nheard concerns from people in Alaska. They worry not so much about the \nrule itself but about how HUD could implement it. Many communities in \nAlaska are overwhelmingly Alaska Native, 90 percent or more of the \npopulation.\n  Will this affirmatively furthering fair housing rule result in \nFederal grants being withheld from communities that are currently and \nhave long been populated almost entirely by Alaska Natives because \nthose communities are now considered to be segregated?\n  Ms. COLLINS. No community in the United States or its insular areas \nwill lose Federal housing funds solely because of its racial \ndemographics. There are communities throughout the United States that \nare racially homogenous for reasons that have nothing to do with \ndiscrimination or other historic barriers.\n  The rule does not change the Fair Housing Act, which for decades has \nincluded the affirmative fair housing requirement. The whole purpose of \nthe rule is to ensure that States and communities that receive Federal \nfunds take this requirement seriously.\n  This rule is a planning tool, created to help grantees identify \nbarriers to fair housing and plan how to address them. The rule does \nnot penalize any community for where it starts but rather assists a \ncommunity in taking meaningful steps to address any barriers it may \nfind.\n  HUD would never deny Federal funds to a community simply because of \nits demographics. It has never done so in the 48 years since the \npassage of the Fair Housing Act, and it will not under this rule.\n  Additionally, I know some have expressed concern about what effect \nthis rule would have on Alaskan Natives and other Native Americans. \nHUD's housing programs for Native Alaskans and other Native Americana \nare authorized under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self \nDetermination Act, NAHASDA. NAHASDA includes a statutory exemption from \nthe Fair Housing Act, which the affirmatively furthering fair housing \nrule does not change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the affirmatively furthering fair housing \nrule, which my amendment would defund, is equal parts condescension and \nwillful blindness. The condescension of this particular rule and its \nproponents is that local governments and public housing authorities \nacross America can't figure out how to provide fair and affordable \nhousing to their communities without the help, without the \npaternalistic interference of Federal bureaucrats. This is the epitome \nof the paternalism that informs so much of what happens in Washington, \nDC, today.\n  I don't doubt, as Senator Collins has said repeatedly, that local \ngovernments would like ``better guidance'' from the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development in Washington. But this is a problem that \nwas created by HUD, with its onerous requirements and its vague \nmandates, not the result of local governments being unable or unwilling \nto provide adequate low-cost housing for their neighbors in need.\n  This brings us to the willful blindness part of the affirmative \nfurthering fair housing rule. Proponents of the rule claim that HUD \nofficials consulted closely with local governments and public housing \nauthorities when drafting and finalizing the AFFH rule. In their \ntelling, local housing agencies across the country are welcoming the \nAFFH rule with open arms. But this ignores what local officials have \nactually said about AFFH.\n  I will let these local officials speak for themselves. Roger \nPartridge, the county commissioner of Douglas County, CO, had this to \nsay, in an email, about AFFH, the closed process that produced it, and \nthe immense burdens it will place on local governments:\n\n       Douglas County believes that the Assessment of Fair Housing \n     tool as it now stands is an unfunded mandate that will create \n     an administrative nightmare for jurisdictions who want to \n     further fair housing and implement community programs with \n     HUD grants.\n\n  Partridge continues:\n\n       HUD headquarters has repeatedly ignored the local \n     practitioners responsible for AFFH and implementing the AFH \n     in our communities.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       In fact, HUD headquarters staff was in Denver for a Public \n     AFFH roundtable on April 21st, during [the AFH tool] comment \n     period. They ignored the opportunity to inform Region VIII \n     Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) staff or the local \n     practitioners attending the roundtable. No notice from the \n     HUD EXCHANGE to the grantee list serve was found. The local \n     governments who were asked to comment on the publication were \n     shut out of the process.\n\n  Likewise, this is what we have heard from Salt Lake County officials:\n\n       The administrative burden imposed by this tool is \n     excessive. Resources that could be put\n\n[[Page S3016]]\n\n     into housing related tasks are being funneled into completing \n     the tool and its associated administrative tasks.\n       Additionally, although HUD claims that this tool can be \n     completed without the use of a consultant, the assessment is \n     complex enough to warrant considering a consultant. The rule \n     imposes a jurisdictional and regional analysis that is too \n     complex to be effectively completed by staff without specific \n     statistical and mapping knowledge. As housing providers, most \n     staff at PHAs have comparative advantages that lie in \n     providing affordable housing services, but not providing \n     complex statistical data analysis. Forcing PHA staff to do \n     this analysis is an inefficient use of their scarce time.\n\n  Salt Lake County officials added the following:\n\n       The AFH does not recognize the zero-sum nature of a PHA's \n     resource allocation. By allocating resources to complete this \n     process, PHAs are not allocating resources somewhere else. \n     Those resources could be used to provide additional housing \n     assistance.\n\n  Instead of ignoring the words and the experiences of our local \nofficials, and instead of condescending to them, we should listen to \nthem and learn from them. We should stop this disastrous new housing \nrule from causing more problems than it has already caused.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Alabama is going \nto speak, and the Senator from Rhode Island should have an opportunity \nto speak. So I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute for each \nside prior to the votes in this series.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator Lee's \namendment that would prevent the implementation of HUD's affirmatively \nfurthering fair housing regulation.\n  Contrary to statements that have been made, the Senator's amendment \ndoes nothing to change fair housing laws or to prevent the enforcement \nthereof. What the Lee amendment does is to prevent the implementation \nof a rule that would give HUD Federal control over local planning \ndecisions.\n  Supporters of this program have argued that it is intended to protect \ncommunities from fair housing lawsuits. It is quite the contrary. This \nrule, if allowed to be implemented, will actually lay the predicate for \nendless litigation against every community in our respective States \nthat are required to participate. This should be unacceptable to every \nMember of this body.\n  Supporting Senator Lee's amendment is the only option before us to \nprevent centralized Federal control of local planning decisions. In my \njudgment, the Collins-Reed amendment does nothing to restrain the full \nimplementation of HUD's program. I urge my colleagues to support the \nLee amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the pending amendment is authored by my \ncolleague from Maine and myself. The amendment makes very clear that \nlocal officials will remain in charge of zoning decisions and will \ndetermine how to best meet their obligations under the Fair Housing \nAct. Those obligations are fundamental to our American fabric, our \nlives, and the aspirations of this country, because they protect \nAmericans' housing choices no matter their physical ability, race, \nfamily status, or religion. These protections are fundamental to who we \nare. But without effective information and transparency so that local \ncommunities can make wise decisions, these aspirations can never be \nrealized, are seldom realized, or are not realized to the extent that \nwe, as Americans, feel that they should be.\n  Senator Collins and I have worked very hard to develop language that \nprovides local communities with wide flexibility to meet their \nrequirements under the Fair Housing Act. Those requirements will still \nbe there regardless of our action today. If the resources made \navailable under the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing regulations \nare not provided, however, those communities will still be required to \nensure that housing is available within their communities, regardless \nof race, physical ability, or the other protected classes under the \nlaw.\n  The Lee amendment would make grantees liable for compliance without \nproviding the data and tools needed to comply. The thrust--the heart \nand soul--of this HUD proposal, based on GAO analysis, is to give local \ncommunities the tools, so that they can determine the local answer that \nmakes sense.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 4 minutes \nequally divided on the Collins amendment.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I will be very brief. Let me just \nreiterate what I have been saying repeatedly. What the amendment \nSenator Reed, Senator Cochran, and I have introduced does is make very \nclear that HUD is prohibited from intervening in local decisions \nregarding zoning ordinances. That is in direct response to what some \npeople have been claiming, incorrectly in my view; that the rule on \naffirmatively furthering fair housing would somehow allow HUD to be a \nnational zoning commissar. That is not the case, but to make absolutely \nsure that could never happen, we have teamed up on this amendment to \nprohibit HUD from intervening in local zoning matters. It is very \ndifferent from the Lee amendment, which we will discuss shortly.\n  This is an important clarification that should take away any fear \nthat there is any possibility of HUD using funds authorized by this \nbill to interfere in local zoning decisions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the amendment offered by my friend and \ncolleague from Maine in and of itself is unobjectionable and does no \nharm, and on that basis I intend to vote for it. Unfortunately, it also \ndoesn't do anything. It does nothing to help the many housing agencies \nthat have told the Federal Government that President Obama's AFFH rule \nimposes far too many reporting costs and their already stretched staffs \nare going to suffer as a result. It does nothing to shield local \nhousing authorities from the very many real lawsuits they will face as \na result of the data collected from this regulation, and it does \nnothing to stop HUD from blackmailing local housing agencies with \nCommunity Development Block Grant Program funds.\n  At this time, I wish to cede the remainder of my time to my friend, \nthe senior Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, we should all be aware that the Collins-\nReed amendment provides no protections to local communities on their \nlocal planning rules because it merely prohibits an activity that the \nrule does not contemplate. Even the sponsor of this amendment \nacknowledged earlier today that the amendment prohibited an activity \nthat she believed would not occur.\n  Make no mistake that the so-called affirmatively furthering fair \nhousing rule will likely heavily influence local zoning decisions. \nHowever, it does so indirectly, not through direct action as in the \nCollins-Reed amendment. HUD advertises this fact on its own Web site, \nwhere it details how communities will have to submit for approval an \nassessment of fair housing and that these communities will ``use the \nfair housing goals and priorities established in their [assessment] to \ninform the investments and other decisions made in their local planning \nprocesses.''\n  In other words, HUD does not intend to direct any specific zoning \nrequirements. It does, however, intend to significantly influence local \nzoning decisions by withholding approval of local plans until they meet \nHUD's central planning goals.\n  This amendment is not sufficient on its own. I believe the only way \nto prevent HUD from intruding into local community planning exactly as \nthey openly state they intend to do is to support the Lee amendment. I \nbelieve the Collins-Reed amendment is not alternative to Senator Lee's \namendment, it is, at best, complementary to the Lee amendment, and that \nis something we will have to vote on in just a few minutes.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of time on our \nside, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, unlike the Collins amendment that just passed \nwith broad support, my amendment would actually do something with \nrespect to affirmatively furthering the fair housing rule. \nSpecifically, it would defund this rule and ultimately force the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development to respond to the GAO in a \nway that does not undermine local control or increase costs on already \nstretched thin local housing agencies.\n  My colleagues who oppose this amendment have given a number of \nexamples of local governments being newly connected to make better \ngoverning decisions, but my amendment in no way stops local governments \nfrom continuing to do that. All my amendment does--the only thing it \ndoes--is to prevent the Federal Government from forcing local \ngovernments to comply with a costly and unnecessary new data collection \nprogram, and it does so in order to protect local autonomy. I therefore \nencourage each of my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the amendment offered by my colleague \nSenator Lee would prohibit all funding for a fair housing regulation \nissued by HUD based on a requirement of a landmark civil rights law, \nthe Fair Housing Act of 1968. Not only was this not a regulation that \nappeared out of thin air, the GAO did a report criticizing HUD, and \nonce the regulation was implemented, closed the recommendation.\n  In addition, communities asked HUD to issue better guidance on this \npart of the law so that they could avoid being sued under the Fair \nHousing Act of 1968.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the Lee amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me return the compliment to the Chairman \nof the committee, Senator Collins of Maine, for her extraordinary \ninsight, leadership, and ability to bring us together. This bill \nreflects the priorities of members on both sides of the aisle, it \nreflects sound policy, and it was a pleasure to work with her.\n  I think that she will also commend our extraordinary staffs who \nprovided support, working many times when we were not working to get \nthe job done. I thank Dabney Hegg, Heideh Shahmoradi, Christina Monroe, \nNathan Robinson, Jordan Stone, Jason Woolwine, Mike Clarke, Lydia \nCollins, and Gus Maples. These are professionals who are thoughtful, \nskillful, pleasant, and probably deserving of the real praise for work \ndone on the floor.\n  Let me once again thank Senator Collins for her thoughtful leadership \nand her commitment to fairness and principle. I think that she is one \nof the major reasons we are here today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Senate has completed its \nconsideration of this appropriations measure, which provides essential \nfunding for the Department of Transportation, the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development, related agencies, military construction \nprograms, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and to combat Zika. I \nthank all of my colleagues for working together with us in an open and \ncollaborative manner.\n  I would note that the legislation we just passed incorporates some 40\n\n[[Page S3019]]\n\namendments. There were also recommendations from more than 75 Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle included in the Transportation-HUD \nappropriations portion of this bill which were incorporated at the \ncommittee level. I thank all of my colleagues for giving us their \nsuggestions, their requests, and their insights. It made for a better \nbill.\n  As I mentioned, I am particularly grateful to Senator Jack Reed, the \nranking member of the Transportation-HUD Subcommittee, for his work.\n  I also thank the staff for their diligence and commitment throughout \nthis process. As Senator Reed mentioned, we worked extremely hard, but \nour staff worked even harder. So I thank Heideh Shahmoradi, Rajat \nMathur, Jason Woolwine, Lydia Collins, Gus Maples, Dabney Hegg, Nathan \nRobinson, Christina Monroe, Jordan Stone, and Mike Clarke on the \nsubcommittee staff.\n  I also give special thanks to the floor and cloakroom staffs who \nworked so hard. Without the help of Laura Dove and her team and the \nteam on the Democratic side, we could not be where we are today. They \ndid a lot of the vetting that needed to be done on various amendments. \nThey helped us in the negotiations and compromises that ultimately were \nincluded in this bill.\n  I would note that our Transportation-HUD portion of this bill \nrecognizes the fiscal reality while making critical investments into \nour crumbling infrastructure and economic development projects. It \nmeets our responsibility to vulnerable populations. I think most of our \ncolleagues are unaware that 84 percent of HUD's budget goes to \nsubsidized housing. When we fund that, we keep very vulnerable low-\nincome families, disabled individuals, and our low-income seniors from \nbeing at risk of homelessness.\n  We also paid special attention in this bill to vulnerable homeless \npopulations, such as our veterans and our young people. We continued a \nprogram the administration wanted to abolish that helps our homeless \nveterans, to whom we owe so much--$57 million in new vouchers, so that \nwe can continue the progress we are making in housing our homeless \nveterans. Since we started this program, the number of homeless \nveterans has declined by about one-third. This program works, but we \ncan't declare victory until the job is done. That is why both last year \nand this year we funded the program, even though the President's budget \nsought to eliminate it.\n  We have made real investments in helping some of our most vulnerable \nyoung people, and those are youth who have been in the Foster Care \nProgram and then age out of that program. In some cases, they are aging \nout of the program before they have even graduated from high school, \nand they have nowhere to go. So through family reunification vouchers \nand other programs, we are beefing up support so they don't fall \nthrough the cracks and become vulnerable to traffickers, to dropping \nout of school, to couch surfing, or ending up in shelters. In \nparticular, I am very proud of the work we have done in that area.\n  I am very pleased this bill funds the TIGER Grant Program at $525 \nmillion. This program has been extraordinarily popular and effective. \nIt has funded projects in each and every State--projects that have led \nto job creation and economic development. When we think about it, at \nheart, much in this bill is about creating jobs and security for our \nfellow citizens. If you don't have a place to live, it is very \ndifficult to show up for work every day. If the infrastructure is \ncrumbling, it is very difficult for a business to hire the employees \nwho produce the products and get those products to market. The \nconstruction projects this bill will fund creates good-paying jobs. In \nmany ways, I think of this as a jobs bill.\n  Let me give another example of a very popular program, the Community \nDevelopment Block Grant Program. If you ask of the mayors and other \ntown and city officials in your State, they will point to that program \nas one that gives them the flexibility to improve their downtowns, to \nmake investments that bring new employers to the region, to build \naffordable housing, whatever their needs are, and that is the beauty of \nthat program. It is not dictated from Washington. It gives tremendous \nflexibility to States and communities to design the kinds of economic \ndevelopment programs that boost growth and create jobs.\n  In short, our bill strikes the right balance between thoughtful \ninvestment and fiscal restraint and thereby sets the stage for future \neconomic growth, something I know the Presiding Officer has been a real \nleader in speaking out about and reminding us that must be our focus as \nMembers of the Senate.\n  I am also pleased we were able to bring spending bills to the floor \nfor Members to examine, debate, and vote on in a transparent manner. \nThe worst situation is when we do a series of continuing resolutions \ntemporarily funding the essential functions of government. They create \nsuch uncertainty, they lock in priorities from previous years rather \nthan reflecting today's priorities, and they end up costing more money. \nAgencies are unable to enter into contracts. Businesses, because of the \nuncertainty, tend to build in a little extra into their bids. It is a \nterrible way to operate.\n  Equally bad is the practice of bundling all 12 of the appropriations \nbills into one gigantic omnibus bill, thousands of pages long, that is \nrushed through at the end of the fiscal year--or, more often, at the \nexpiration of one of those continuing resolutions that I just deplore. \nWe are not doing that this year. This is the third appropriations bill \nthat the Senate has passed earlier than ever, with great cooperation \nfrom both sides of the aisle. The Members of the Appropriations \nCommittee and its two leaders, Senator Cochran and Senator Mikulski, \ndeserve great credit for putting us on a strict schedule and keeping \nthe process moving.\n  In fact, in the full committee today, we approved two more \nappropriations bills that are ready to come to the Senate floor. That \nis the way the process used to work. That is the way the process should \nwork, and that is the way the process is working this year. I believe \nit is a great credit to the Senate, to the leaders of the \nAppropriations Committee, and to Majority Leader McConnell, who has \nmade it a goal that all 12 bills be reported by the Appropriations \nCommittee and brought to the Senate floor, individually or two or three \ncombined, for full and open debate.\n  Again, I thank Members on both sides of the aisle. Many of your \nrequests are included in this important legislation. I feel fortunate \nto have worked with Senator Jack Reed on this bill. He is not only a \ngreat colleague and a terrific Senator but also a good friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/19/senate-section/article/S3004-2"}, {"day": "19", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Madam President, there is an ongoing debate in our \npolitics today about the value of leadership around the world in the \n21st century. There is a view that seems to be gaining traction and \nfavor--that our international engagement is one-sided, that our allies \nare free riders, that we contribute too much and get too little in \nreturn, and so why should we be involved in the world? These voices \nexist in both parties, and I would like to answer them today.\n  I want to start by looking back at the last century, when the world \nemerged from the death and destruction of the Second World War. The \nUnited States could have decided after that war to wall ourselves off--\nthat after the loss of so many of our best and brightest, we had \nalready paid enough for peace.\n  Instead, our country became the driving force behind international\n\n[[Page S3020]]\n\norder. We forged a series of strong alliances, led with moral clarity, \nand positioned our military strength strategically around the world. In \ndoing so, the American people benefitted immensely as we helped to \nstave off the threat of another global conflict and oversaw decades of \neconomic growth and the spread of democracy and freedom around the \nworld. Then, like now, our people benefitted tremendously from our \nstatus in the world, even though our engagement was disproportional to \nthat of other nations; in fact, we benefitted precisely because our \nengagement was disproportional to that of other nations.\n  International engagement has never been a business deal. \nInternational engagement is not a transaction in which we give \nsomething tangible and receive something tangible in return. America \nhas more to give to the nations we are helping, and that is one of the \nreasons why we have a responsibility to lead. It is written in the \nBible: ``From everyone who has been given much, much will be \nrequired.'' But our leadership ends up paying dividends for the entire \nworld, and especially for the American people.\n  First of all, American workers and families benefit economically. \nInternational affairs have a bigger impact on the financial well-being \nof our people today than ever before. In our global economy, someone on \nthe other side of the planet can now buy a product from an American \nwith the tap of a finger. But when nations or entire regions are torn \napart by war and by oppression, they become closed off, and economic \ngrowth in our own country is restricted as a result.\n  If America were to fail to protect the openness of international \nwaters, global shipping would be threatened and prices would rise for \nconsumers on virtually everything. Similarly, if space and cyber space \nbecame threatened or restricted, global communications and commerce \nwould suffer as well.\n  Americans also see real benefits in terms of our safety at home and \naround the world. Without American leadership, regional order tends to \nbreak down, and then instability spreads. This opens up vacuums that \nare filled up by radicals, and those radicals always--irrespective of \nwhat we are doing or what we are not doing--target America, and they do \nso either to bolster their own prestige or for ideological reasons or \noften for both. As President Obama has found, leaving the Middle East \ndoesn't mean terrorists stop trying to kill Americans. Our families, \nour homeland, and our men and women in uniform are less safe when \nAmerica disengages from the world.\n  We also benefit geopolitically when we help other nations. Think what \nEurope would look like if it had not been for America's moral and \nstrategic leadership during the Cold War. Europe still faces many \nchallenges today, mainly because of our neglect of the crisis in Syria, \nbut for centuries prior, Europe was driven by conflict. European peace \nwas thought to be impossible. Yet that is what NATO and other \ninstitutions have helped achieve with American support.\n  What would Asia look like right now had the United States not helped \nit to rebuild after the Second World War. Look at the way that American \nleadership allowed South Korea to go from a poor country--a \ndictatorship--to a vibrant democracy and one of the largest economies \nin the world. South Korea is now a net donor to foreign aid and a \ncrucial ally for us in a region that includes an aggressive China and a \nbelligerent North Korea.\n  Japan has gone from a country devastated by war and not trusted by \nits neighbors to one of the most peaceful societies in the world. It \nhas also become a net contributor to global security through its \nmilitary and humanitarian assistance programs.\n  Then there is the Middle East. Whether we should continue to play a \nrole there is a question that weighs particularly heavily on the minds \nof many Americans. I understand the doubts and frustrations. We have \nbeen involved in the region for decades. Nothing seems to be getting \nbetter, and despite our attempts to help, we watch on television as \nsome celebrate our tragedies and burn our flag in the Arab streets.\n  It is true that we cannot solve all of the region's problems, but we \nhave an interest in what happens there, nonetheless. That interest is \nserved by our involvement, not by our withdrawal. ISIS arose, in the \nfirst place, because of the political instability that exists in both \nSyria and Iraq, and that instability was created in part because \nPresident Obama withdrew or withheld American leadership at crucial \nmoments.\n  Failing to lead costs us more in the long-term than it saves us in \nthe short-term, and we will continue to pay a steep price each time we \nfail to lead in the future.\n  There are complex considerations to make regarding our engagement in \nevery region, but I believe a world without sustained American \nengagement is not a world any of us want to live in. This idea shared \nby prominent voices in both parties--that America is such a weak nation \nthat we cannot afford to be engaged in the world--is one of the biggest \nlies ever told to the American people. Just because our government \nleaders are weak does not mean America is weak.\n  No American wants to live in a world where Vladimir Putin sets the \nagenda or ISIS holds us hostage to their demands. Yet this is the world \nwe are heading toward as political leaders continue to embrace \nAmerica's decline.\n  Defense spending is currently at roughly 3.3 percent of our budget, \ncompared to 14 percent at the height of the Korean war. Our Army is on \ntrack to be at pre-World War II levels. Our Navy is already at pre-\nWorld War I levels, and our Air Force has the smallest and oldest \ncombat force in its history. These are the results of specific policy \nchoices made by politicians right here. It is no accident that the \nresult has been more conflict around the world and less American \ninfluence.\n  I saw firsthand on a recent trip to Iraq how our men and women in \nuniform around the world are doing their best to keep us safe with \nlimited resources. We put them in an untenable position. They are asked \nto maintain our global commitments, fight ISIS and other terrorist \ngroups, and deter countries such as Russia, Iran, North Korea, and \nChina. They and our country deserve better.\n  ``Spend less abroad so we can spend more at home'' has become a \ncommon refrain among leaders in both parties. It is used to excuse cuts \nto the military and our presence around the world. The truth is that \nthe defense budget is not the primary driver of our debt. It is our \nentitlement programs. Every time we try to cut a dollar from our \nmilitary, it seems to cost us several more just to make up for it.\n  In addition to investing in our strength, we must apply that strength \nin a way that respects our values and supports our economic interests.\n  Americans deserve a foreign policy we can be proud of. But for the \nlast 8 years, we have had a Commander in Chief who praises and appeases \ndictators to promote the illusion of peace. Some in my party have now \nadopted a similar approach. They may claim to represent different \nideas, but both emanate from the same notion--that Americans are too \ntired, that America is too weak, and that we are too much like the rest \nof the world to stand up to tyrants, so we should just cut deals with \nthem instead.\n  This is not only morally wrong, but it is contrary to our interests. \nWhenever our foreign policy becomes unhinged from its moral purpose, it \nweakens global stability and it forms cracks in our national resolve. \nBut whenever freedom and human rights spread, partners for our Nation \nare born. We must restore America's willingness to state boldly what we \nstand for and why. Just as Reagan never flinched in his criticisms of \nthe Soviet Union, we must not shy away from demanding that China allow \ntrue freedom for its 1.3 billion people or boldly stating that Vladimir \nPutin is a corrupt thug. Nor should we hesitate in calling the source \nof atrocities in the Middle East by its real name--radical Islam. We \nshould always stand with Israel, and we should not abandon the cause of \nfreedom in our own hemisphere and allow cruel and immoral dictatorships \nin Cuba and Venezuela to be absolved of their crimes.\n  The world needs America's moral and military strength just as much as \nour people and our economy do. No other nation can deter global \nconflict by its presence alone. No other nation can offer the security \nand benevolence that\n\n[[Page S3021]]\n\nAmerica can. No other Nation can be trusted to defend peace and advance \nliberty.\n\n  America cannot avoid its role as a global leader. But we also know \nAmerica cannot be tasked with protecting the world on its own. It will \ntake an international order of free nations with free economies to do \nso. We must work with like-minded allies whenever possible and \nencourage them to do their part, but no other nation has the ability to \norganize or lead such a coalition if we fail to do so.\n  That is why I will continue to make the case for an engaged America, \nno matter who becomes our next President, no matter how the political \nwinds may blow. Our safety and our prosperity depend on it. The ideal \nof America depends on it. That was true last century, and it is even \nmore so today.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING Officer. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/19/senate-section/article/S3019-2"}, {"day": "19", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3021-S3022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND MILITARY \n         CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS BILLS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I am pleased that today the Senate \npassed two annual spending bills--Transportation, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs--and \napproved funding to combat the Zika virus.\n  Senators Collins, Reed, Kirk, and Tester worked hard to craft good, \nbipartisan bills with no ideological, partisan policy riders.\n  They have reminded us of the way we should do business here in the \nSenate.\n  I was proud to support both bills when they were considered by the \nAppropriations Committee in recent weeks and proud to support them \nagain today.\n  I am pleased that the bill includes long-overdue funding to fight \nZika. The bill does not provide the full amount of funding that our \nhealth and infectious disease experts say they need, but it does \nprovide a good down payment of $1.1 billion.\n  We must do more, and we must do it now, in order to protect pregnant \nwomen nationwide.\n  This bill builds on the surface transportation bill, the FAST Act, \nthat Congress passed last year that provides funding over 5 years for \nrail and highway infrastructure.\n  Illinois rail lines are at the center of our national transportation \nnetwork.\n  In 2014, 5 million people boarded or exited trains in Illinois, \ngiving residents a safe, affordable option when traveling.\n  The bill supports rail options by providing strong funding for \nAmtrak, including $1.42 billion for the national network.\n  It increases funding for TIGER and Core Capacity Capital Investment \nGrants, which supports transportation improvement projects across \nIllinois like the CTA's Red Purple Modernization project to provide \nmore commuter passenger rail options to people in Chicago.\n  The bill also funds important rail safety programs across the \ncountry.\n  First-time funding for passenger rail grant programs authorized in \nthe FAST Act will address gaps in supporting and growing our nation's \npassenger rail infrastructure.\n  Rail line relocation and grade crossing enhancements will reduce \naccidents and improve passenger safety in Illinois and around the \ncountry.\n  Nearly 1.1 million barrels of crude oil are hauled on our nation's \nrailroads every day. Last year's derailment in Galena, IL, highlights \nthe need to invest in rail safety.\n  The bill continues funding for Positive Train Control programs and \nsupports the Safe Transport of Energy Products Program.\n  There is always more work to be done. According to the American \nSociety of Civil Engineers, America scores a D in investment in roads, \ntransit, and aviation and a C-plus in rail.\n  This bill is a good start. This bill not only invests in our \ntransportation infrastructure, but it also invests in our housing \ninfrastructure.\n  I want to thank Senators Collins and Reed again for their efforts to \naddress lead-based paint hazards in our Nation's low-income housing.\n  Since Flint, we have learned that exposure to lead, be it through our \ndrinking water or paint in our homes, is still a major problem in \ncommunities across Illinois and the country.\n  We have also learned that, when government shortchanges our \ninfrastructure because of opposition to commonsense protections and \ndraconian spending cuts, families suffer the consequences.\n  In the case of Flint, local and State government was the problem, and \nnow, it, along with Federal Government, have to be part of the \nsolution.\n  And the provisions in this bill can help us do that. This bill \nrequires HUD to update its standards to the CDC's blood level standard, \nwhich is currently four times the CDC level. It improves tenant \nawareness and education of the lead-based paint hazards. And it \nprovides a modest increase in funding for the identification and \nremediation of lead-based hazards found in federally assisted housing.\n  These are all good things, and they will go a long way in addressing \nthe government's abysmal and embarrassing record in dealing with this \nproblem, which has led to far too many children living in federally \nsubsidized housing suffering from lead poisoning, including one family \nin Chicago. Lanice Walker's 4-year-old daughter was diagnosed with lead \npoisoning less than 5 months after her and her family moved into a home \nsubsidized by a Housing Choice Voucher.\n  But Lanice Walker was not able to move without the risk of losing her \nvoucher because her daughter's blood lead level, which was two times \nthe CDC level, didn't meet the standards under HUD regulations. It \nwasn't until all nine of her children had elevated blood levels and \nlegal advocates intervened on her behalf before she was granted \npermission to move.\n  This is unacceptable, and we must do more to protect children in \naffordable housing before they become poisoned by lead. We must ensure \nthat lead-based paint hazards are properly identified before a family \nmoves into a unit. We must update all outdated lead regulations using \nthe most recent science and enforce them. And we must adequately fund \nprograms designed to identify and eliminate lead paint hazards.\n  I hope that our efforts today are just the beginning of our \nrecommitment to addressing our lead epidemic.\n  The Senate also approved the Military Construction and Veterans \nAffairs appropriations bill, which provides a $3.1 billion increase \nabove fiscal year 2016 enacted levels.\n  This funding will support a wide variety of projects to ensure the \nmilitary readiness and quality of life on military bases within the \nUnited States and around the world.\n  It provides $70 million for Arlington National Cemetery to ensure \nthat the final resting place for our servicemembers is well maintained.\n  The bill ensures that we provide for our Nation's veterans and their \nfamilies, those who have sacrificed so much over the years and deserve \nour gratitude.\n  The Veterans Benefits Administration will receive $2.8 billion more \nthan last year to help the VA modernize its claims processing as well \nas help reduce and eliminate backlogs.\n  Forcing veterans to wait months and sometimes years to get the \nbenefits they deserve is unacceptable.\n  The bill increases funding for critical programs and emerging needs, \nincluding hepatitis C treatment, whistleblower protection, as well as \nfamily caregiver support.\n  For years, I have championed the caregivers program in Congress, so I \nam pleased that this program is a priority in this bill.\n  Hundreds of veterans and their caregivers in Illinois and more than \n23,000 nationwide participate in this program, with much success.\n  The bill increases medical and prosthetic research funding by $44 \nmillion compared to fiscal year 2016, at $675 million. These funds are \ncritical to continuing our national commitment\n\n[[Page S3022]]\n\nto medical research and will help our veterans that return home with \nboth the physical and mental wounds of war.\n  The number of veterans using VA services is dramatically increasing \nas the population ages. The VA provides more care for veterans now than \never before, and more of these veterans and their families have \nincreasingly critical needs.\n  I would also like to take a moment to address an amendment I offered \nthat was included as part of a managers package.\n  My amendment directs the Secretary of the VA to spend at least $21 \nmillion to fill critical staffing shortages in VA leadership at \nnetworks, medical centers, and health care systems across the country.\n  At least three dozen key VA leadership positions are currently filled \nby acting or interim directors, sometimes for years at a time. In my \nhome State of Illinois, for example, Hines VA Hospital has not had a \npermanent director since 2014.\n  Permanently assigned leadership that is capable of overseeing and \nmanaging networks and medical centers is critical to delivering high \nquality care to our Nation's veterans in a timely fashion, especially \nat a time when the VA faces a number of challenges.\n  This funding will help the VA prioritize filling these key positions, \nas well as address staffing shortages in other management and clinical \npositions, including in rural and underserved areas.\n  It is my hope that this funding will allow the VA to quickly fill \nthese important positions within the Department.\n  I am glad to say that overall, moving this bill is good for our \nNation's military and their families.\n  I hope today's action by the Senate is another step in the direction \nof passing all 12 appropriations bills, all without ideological riders.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to continue to \nwork with us in a bipartisan manner to pass additional appropriations \nbills without ideological riders.\n  I would also like to urge my colleagues to quickly send these funding \nmeasures to the President. Zika funding is needed now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/19/senate-section/article/S3021-1"}, {"day": "19", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3022-S3023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, today I wish to join Americans across \nthe country in recognizing the immeasurable sacrifices made every day \nby the men and women of law enforcement. Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement officers put their lives on the line to help uphold the \nrule of law in America. Their professionalism and commitment to justice \nunderpin so much of what has allowed this country to thrive for \ngenerations.\n  In May 1962, President John F. Kennedy designated May 15 as Peace \nOfficers Memorial Day and the week containing May 15 as National Police \nWeek. In that proclamation, President Kennedy stated, ``. . . from the \nbeginning of this Nation, law enforcement officers have played an \nimportant role in safeguarding the rights and freedoms which are \nguaranteed by the Constitution and in protecting the lives and property \nof our citizens. . . .''\n  It is that twofold role of protecting both the constitutional and \nphysical well-being of all Americans that earns law enforcement \nofficers such a revered place in American society. In the 53 years \nsince President Kennedy established this national celebration of law \nenforcement, much has changed in regards to the tactics and procedure \nfor protecting essential rights and freedoms, as well as the nature of \nthreats against personal property and the citizenry. What has not \nchanged in the unwavering commitment to addressing these challenges by \nlaw enforcement agencies nationwide.\n  My home State of Maryland is home to a close-knit, well-trained, and \ndedicated network of law enforcement agencies. Maryland is often called \nAmerica in Miniature, and as such, Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement officers across Maryland are expected to be able to respond \nto an incredibly diverse set of situations.\n  Being on the front lines of upholding the rule of law and protecting \nAmericans from harm is not easy work. There is hardly a law enforcement \nofficer in the United States who will not face the threat of bodily \nharm during their career. Unfortunately, due to the dangerous nature of \npolice work, law enforcement officers across the country are killed on \nthe job every year.\n  Thus far in 2016, 35 law enforcement officers have been killed in the \nline of duty. Every one of those men and women left a family and \ngrieving law enforcement agency. California, Colorado, and Maryland \nshare the painful distinction of leading the Nation in law enforcement \ndeaths in the line of duty. Three officers from each one of the \naforementioned States were killed in the line of duty; in Maryland, all \nthree were killed by gunfire.\n  Senior Deputies Patrick Dailey and Mark Logsdon of the Harford County \nSheriff's office and Officer Jacai Colson of the Prince George's County \nPolice Department were all model officers who were tragically killed \nwhile protecting colleagues and civilians. All three of these men \nserved communities in Maryland with distinction and contributed greatly \nto not only public safety but also to helping build strong and lasting \nrelationships among law enforcement and the people they protect.\n  Senior Deputies Dailey and Logsdon were both fathers and military \nveterans. Both served honorably with the Harford County Sheriff's \nOffice.\n  On Christmas Eve 2002, Deputy Dailey saved the life of a teenager \ntraveling in an SUV that collided head-on with a cement mixing truck. \nDeputy Dailey, a number of fellow sheriffs, and two civilians emptied \nsix fire extinguishers in an attempt to quell a fire that threatened to \nengulf the vehicle and the unresponsive driver. Using only their bare \nhands and batons, the group managed to free the driver seconds before \nthe fire consumed the passenger compartment. The teen was able to thank \nhis rescuers 3 months later at the Harford County Sheriff's Office \nAwards Banquet.\n  Exactly 11 years before his death, Deputy Logsdon confronted a \nsuicidal man who was armed with a loaded shotgun. In a display of great \nbravery and at great risk to himself, Deputy Logsdon managed to talk \nthe man into surrendering his weapon. After the man was disarmed, \nDeputy Logsdon continued to help the man by transporting him to the \nhospital, where he received medical care.\n  Officer Colson was an undercover narcotics agent. He had a dangerous \njob with zero margin for error. Officer Colson did not make errors. He \nwas a 4-year veteran of the Prince George's Police Department. The \ncommander of the Prince George's County Police Department's Narcotic \nEnforcement Division said of Colson, ``Not only is he good at his job, \nhe's that guy that you wanted on your team.''\n  The President of the Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 89 described \nOfficer Colson as ``. . . always the first person here in the morning, \nready to work and put in a full day's work.''\n  All three of these men could have done anything with their lives, and \nthey chose to uphold the law. I am thankful that, for the many people \nthey interacted with on a daily basis, these men embodied justice. I \njoin Marylanders in mourning their loss.\n  It is my hope that this National Police Week serves as a catalyst to \ncommunities and governments across the country to evaluate ways to \nbetter serve those who are sworn to protect and serve.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, this evening, I want to honor our \nNation's peace officers and to remember those who we have lost in the \nline of duty over the last year.\n  Sunday was Peace Officers Memorial Day, a day set aside by President \nKennedy in 1962 to honor those law enforcement officers who we have \nlost in the line of duty, a day that unfortunately has touched me \npersonally, both in the past while serving as attorney general for \nNorth Dakota and tragically again earlier this year when the city of \nFargo, ND, lost one of its finest in the line of duty.\n  On the evening of Wednesday, February 10, 2016, Fargo Police Officer \nJason Moszer answered the call to serve and protect for what would turn \nout to be the last time. He knew when he answered that call that he \nwould confront an active-shooter situation, and he never hesitated in \ntaking up a position to put himself between the shooter and the \ncommunity he so very much loved.\n\n[[Page S3023]]\n\n  Officer Moszer was struck down that evening, and his name will \nforever be etched in stone on the North Dakota's Peace Officer's \nMemorial that sits on the grounds of the State capitol in Bismarck. \nThrough rain, sleet, and snow--extreme heat and cold--he will now stand \nalongside those other North Dakota officers who gave the ultimate \nsacrifice. They provide an unwavering example that, regardless of what \nconditions they face, our peace officers will stand steadfast \nregardless of what challenges they may face.\n  National Police Week is very special to me. When I served as attorney \ngeneral of North Dakota in the 1990s, I had the privilege to work \ndirectly with many of our State's law enforcement officers, from the \nhighway patrol, to State and local officers, various Federal officers, \nand our tribal police. It was in that job that I truly began to \nappreciate the hard work and dedication of those officers who serve the \npeople of North Dakota. These are some of the finest men and women I \nhave ever met.\n  During my time as a U.S. Senator, I have been able to see many old \nfriends that continue their service and have met an entire new \ngeneration of law enforcement officers at the beginning of their \ncareers. I can tell you that this new generation of law enforcement \nofficers are not only up to the task, but will most certainly meet the \nsame standards of excellence as their predecessors.\n  I want to give special recognition to the Grand Forks Country Drug \nTask Force, a collection of State, local, and Federal law enforcement \nmembers who were honored earlier this year by the HIDTA program with an \nOutstanding Cooperative Effort award. This award came was the result of \nOperation Denial, a multiagency investigation into the international \ntrafficking of fentanyl and other lethal drugs that led to multiple \narrests and convictions in various States and countries. As we talk \nabout the opioid abuse epidemic in the Senate and look to address this \nscourge on our communities, law enforcement officers are on the front \nlines tackling this challenge head-on.\n  When honoring the service and sacrifice of our Nation's law \nenforcement officers, all too often there is a group of officers that \ndon't garner the attention and praise that they deserve, our tribal law \nenforcement officers. Tribal officers work in some of the most \nchallenging conditions, with incredible jurisdictional challenges and \nan embarrassing lack of resources, but they do not let that stand in \nthe way of their dedication and passion to protect Indian Country. This \nevening, I want to extend special recognition and a personal thank you \nto all of our tribal law enforcement officers.\n  I continue to work on behalf of our men and women in law enforcement, \nand all of us in Congress must continue to support our law enforcement \nofficers with the resources and protections necessary for them to \nperform their duties.\n  Last year, I was proud see a bill that I cosponsored, the Rafael \nRamos and Wenjian Liu [Wen-Gin Lew] National Blue Alert Act, enacted \ninto law. This bipartisan legislation established a national Blue Alert \ncommunications network to disseminate information about threats to \nofficers. The law seeks to make sure that appropriate steps can be \ntaken as quickly as possible to provide for an officer's safety.\n  Just yesterday, the President signed two more bills into law that I \nsupported and that will give law enforcement additional and sorely \nneeded resources, the Transnational Drug Trafficking Act that will \nprovide increased tools to go after foreign manufacturers or \ndistributors of chemicals that will eventually end up in the U.S. as \nillicit drugs, and the Bulletproof Vest Reauthorization Act will extend \nfor 5 years the matching grant program that helps law enforcement \npurchase lifesaving bulletproof vests.\n  Just last week, another bill, the POLICE Act, passed out of the \nJudiciary Committee. This bill would make Federal grants available for \nlaw enforcement officers and medical personnel to help them better \nprepare for active-shooter situations, including training civilians on \nhow to respond if confronted by an active shooter. Congress needs to \nswiftly pass this bill.\n  And I am a proud cosponsor of Senator Leahy and Senator Grassley's \nresolution recognizing among other things, the dedication and sacrifice \nof all of our law enforcement officers and our debt of gratitude to \neach and every one of them.\n  Thank you to all of our Nation's law enforcement officers for the \njobs you do every day. I want to especially thank the law enforcement \nofficers in my home State of North Dakota. I believe they are the \nfinest collection of officers in the Nation. They are out there working \nday and night to keep our families safe, and just as they do for us, I \nwill keep fighting for them every day. This Nation, our State, and our \nlocal communities owe our law enforcement officers a continuing debt of \ngratitude for their selfless actions to meet their sworn duty to \nprotect and serve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/19/senate-section/article/S3022-1"}, {"day": "19", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BOB NEWMAN\n\n Mr. DAINES. Madam President, in honor of National Military \nAppreciation Month, I wish to recognize Bob Newman of Musselshell \nCounty, a U.S. Army veteran. After leaving the Army, he went into law \nenforcement and served his community in the Musselshell County \nSheriff's Department. Newman has dedicated his life to serving God, his \ncountry, and his community by giving countless hours of his time to \nmilitary service, as well as helping fellow veterans in a countless \nnumber of ways.\n  Since leaving the Army, Newman has participated in hundreds of \nservices aimed towards veterans. Two great examples of his dedication \nare his work with the Patriot Guard of Montana and with Big Sky Honor \nFlights. The Patriot Guard of Montana was founded in 2005, and Newman \nwas one of its original members; he now serves as a ride captain. This \ngrassroots organization consists of motorcycle riders who want to show \nrespect for fallen American soldiers by escorting funeral processions \nfor fallen heroes and protecting mourning family and friends from any \npotential disturbances caused by protestors.\n  Newman also partakes in Big Sky Honor Flights, an organization whose \nmission is ``to recognize Montana World War II Veterans for their \nsacrifices and achievements by flying them to Washington, D.C., to see \ntheir memorial at no cost.'' Upon one flight's return in 2013, he was a \npart of the celebrating crowd that welcomed the veterans back at the \nBillings Logan International Airport with loud cheering and waving of \nAmerican flags. Newman said, ``It's an honor to be able to stand for \nthem and give them the recognition they deserve.''\n  Other services Newman has been involved in are the Missing in America \nProject, assisting families of our fallen heroes in various capacities, \nhelping disabled veterans and homeless veterans in addition to an \nendless amount of other projects for those in need.\n  Montana has a rich legacy of military service, and Bob is a true \nMontana hero and role model for us all. It takes a devoted and \ncourageous person to sacrifice their life to protect the lives and \nfreedom that we hold so dear. I am deeply grateful for the many \nsacrifices Bob has made for our Nation and State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/19/senate-section/article/S3023-1"}, {"day": "19", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3023-S3024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO STAFF SERGEANT KAT KAELIN\n\n Mr. HELLER. Madam President, today I wish to recognize SSG Kat \nKaelin for her outstanding contributions in serving our country. In \n2011, Staff Sergeant Kaelin was selected to serve as a member of a 20-\nwoman cultural support team, CST, that assisted Special Operations \nmissions in locating terrorists for an 8 month period. It gives me \ngreat pleasure to recognize her achievement in qualifying for this \nprestigious position and for her continued dedication in serving the \nfemale military community.\n  Staff Sergeant Kaelin joined the Nevada National Guard while she was \nstill in her junior year of high school at Spring Creek High School. \nBeginning in August of 2011, she served in an 8-month mission in Iraq \nas a member of CST-2. The team was designed specifically to serve as a \nresource for the 75th Ranger Regiment in its mission by gathering \ninformation from Afghan\n\n[[Page S3024]]\n\nwomen and children. To become a member of the team, Staff Sergeant \nKaelin endured intense fitness training and psychological testing. \nAfter successfully finishing training, she became the first and only \nwoman from the Nevada National Guard to join a CST. Staff Sergeant \nKaelin earned a Combat Action Badge for her service in this role. Her \nsacrifice in defending our freedoms is invaluable.\n  In May of 2012, Staff Sergeant Kaelin returned to the United States, \nand she is currently finishing her military career in the Inactive \nReady Reserves. Since returning from deployment, she has dedicated her \ntime to a new mission to help others returning home from service. \nSpecifically, she has been fighting to assist women veterans and their \nchildren who are homeless. She has become a powerful voice on behalf of \nfemale veterans, and I am thankful for all that she has done for our \ncountry and the State of Nevada. She is now running for Ms. Veteran \nAmerica for 2016 in her endeavors to increase awareness for female \nveterans. I wish her the best of luck in this competition.\n  I extend my deepest gratitude to Staff Sergeant Kaelin for her \ncourageous contributions to our Nation. Her unwavering dedication to \nher career is commendable, and she stands as a shining example for \nfuture generations of heroes. Staff Sergeant Kaelin's service to her \ncountry and her bravery earn her a place among the outstanding men and \nwomen who have valiantly defended our Nation.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I recognize \nCongress has a responsibility not only to honor the brave individuals \nwho serve our Nation, but also to ensure they are cared for when they \nreturn home. Equally as important, it is crucial that female \nservicemembers and veterans have access to their specific health care \nneeds. There are countless distinguished women who have made sacrifices \nbeyond measure and deserve nothing but the best treatment. I remain \ncommitted to upholding this promise for our veterans and servicemembers \nin Nevada and throughout the Nation and will continue to fight until \nthis becomes a reality.\n  Throughout her tenure, Staff Sergeant Kaelin has demonstrated \nprofessionalism, commitment to excellence, and dedication to the \nhighest standards of the U.S. Army. I am both humbled and honored by \nher service and am proud to have had someone from the Nevada National \nGuard serve our Nation in such a significant role. Today I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in recognizing Staff Sergeant Kaelin for all of \nher accomplishments and wish her well in her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/19/senate-section/article/S3023-2"}, {"day": "19", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING ANNE PERSHING\n\n Mr. HELLER. Madam President, today we honor the life and \nlegacy of Anne Pershing, whose passing signifies a great loss to \nNevada. I send my condolences and prayers to her family and friends \nduring this time of difficulty. Ms. Pershing was an upstanding Nevadan, \ncommitted to bringing journalistic excellence to the Fallon community. \nShe will be sorely missed by the entire Nevada family.\n  Ms. Pershing was raised in Bushnell, IL, and moved to the Silver \nState over 30 years ago. She received her bachelor's degree in speech \ncommunications, in addition to studying journalism, at the University \nof Nevada, Reno, UNR. In 1983, she started her professional career \nworking for the Lahontan Valley News as a general assignment reporter. \nBy 1987, she had successfully climbed the ladder and was chosen to \nserve as editor of the newspaper and, later, as general manager.\n  During her tenure, Ms. Pershing went above and beyond in her role to \nbecome acquainted with the city of Fallon and its residents, embodying \nwhat it means to be a true community journalist. Throughout the late \n1990s, Ms. Pershing and her team covered the child leukemia cluster \nthat greatly affected the local community, gaining national attention \nfor her work on the breaking story. Ms. Pershing and her team were \nlater recognized for their efforts by being nominated for the Pulitzer \nPrize in Public Service and were honored in 2002 with an Associated \nPress Public Service Award. Ms. Pershing stands as a role model to the \nNevada journalism community with her commendable and reliable \nreporting. We will always remember her resilient spirit in shining \nlight on issues important to our State.\n  In 2004, Ms. Pershing moved on to work for the Star Press, a small \nweekly newspaper in Fallon, and after this newspaper ceased \npublication, she continued writing as a contributing columnist for the \npublication at the School of Medicine at UNR. In 2008, she was inducted \ninto the Nevada Press Association Hall of Fame for all of her efforts. \nMs. Pershing spent her final journalistic years writing in her weekly \nnewspaper column about the most important issues affecting Nevada's \nsenior population. Throughout her decades of service to Nevada \njournalism, Ms. Pershing demonstrated unwavering dedication to bringing \nNevadans truthful and insightful news coverage. She was truly one-of-a-\nkind in her endeavors to support her local community. Her legacy of \nkindness, loyalty, and drive will echo on for years to come.\n  For over 30 years, Ms. Pershing served as a tremendous contributor to \nNevada journalism. Her commitment to the Silver State will never be \nforgotten. Today I join the Fallon community and citizens of the Silver \nState to celebrate the life of an honorable Nevadan, Ms. Anne \nPershing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/19/senate-section/article/S3024-1"}, {"day": "19", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/19/senate-section/article/S3024-2"}, {"day": "19", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/19/senate-section/article/S3024-3"}, {"day": "19", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3024-S3029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n        EC-5425.

A bill to prevent the proposed amendments to rule 41 of the \nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure from taking effect; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I, along with my colleague Senator \nPaul from Kentucky, Senator Baldwin from Wisconsin, and Senators Daines \nand Tester from Montana, am introducing the Stopping Mass Hacking Act, \nS. 2952, a bill to protect millions of law-abiding Americans from \nGovernment hacking.\n  On April 28, 2016, at the request of the Department of Justice, the \nU.S. Federal Courts recommended administrative changes to Rule 41 of \nthe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the rule\n\n[[Page S3033]]\n\nthat governs search and seizure procedure. The changes have been \napproved by the Supreme Court, and pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act \nthe amendments take effect on December 1, 2016, absent Congressional \naction. Despite the seriousness of the changes, Congress has not spoken \non the subject. It should. Making changes like this simply by \nadministrative fiat is not good enough. So, today, Senator Paul and I \nintroduce this bill.\n  The administrative changes will provide a magistrate judge with the \nauthority to issue a warrant for remote electronic searches of devices \nlocated anywhere in the world when law enforcement does not know the \nlocation of the device. While it may be appropriate to address the \nissue of allowing a remote electronic search for a device at an unknown \nlocation, Congress needs to consider what protections must be in place \nto protect Americans' digital security and privacy. This is a new and \nuncertain area of law, so there needs to be full and careful debate.\n  The second part of the change to Rule 41 gives a magistrate judge the \nauthority to issue a single warrant that would authorize the search of \na large number--potentially thousands or millions--of devices that can \ncover any number of searches in any jurisdiction. These changes would \ndramatically expand the government's hacking and surveillance \nauthority. The American public should understand that these changes \nwill not just affect criminals: computer security experts and civil \nliberties advocates say the amendments would also dramatically expand \nthe government's ability to hack the electronic devices of law-abiding \nAmericans if their devices were affected by a computer attack.\n  Finally, these changes to Rule 41 would also give some types of \nelectronic searches different, weaker notification requirements than \nphysical searches. This raises the possibility of the FBI hacking into \na person's computer after they are the victim of a cyber attack and not \ntelling them about it until afterward, if at all. Under this new rule, \nthey are only required to make ``reasonable efforts'' to notify people \nthat their computers were searched. You can see how that might be \nproblematic. It could lead to circumstances in which law-abiding \nAmericans are not told that the government has secretly hacked into \ntheir computer.\n  These changes are a major policy shift that will impact Americans' \ndigital security, the government's surveillance powers and the Fourth \nAmendment. Part of the problem is the simple fact that both the \nAmerican public and security experts know so little about how the \ngovernment goes about hacking a computer to search it. If a victim's \nFourth Amendment rights are violated, it might not be readily apparent \nbecause of the highly technical nature of the methods used to execute \nthe warrant.\n  As a body of elected representatives, it is Congress's job to make \nsure we do not let the Executive Branch run roughshod over our \nconstituents' rights. That is why action is so important: this is a \npolicy question that should be debated by Congress. Although the \nDepartment of Justice has tried to describe this rule change as simply \na matter of judicial venue, sometimes a difference in scale really is a \ndifference in kind. By allowing so many searches with the order of just \na single judge, Congress's failure to act on this issue would be a \ndisaster for law-abiding Americans. When the public realizes what is at \nstake, I think there is going to be a massive outcry: Americans will \nlook at Congress and say, ``What were you thinking?''\n  I am here today, introducing this legislation, to sound an alarm. \nThis rule change would could have a massive impact on Americans' \ndigital security and privacy, and I plan on spending the next seven \nmonths making sure my colleagues fully understand the huge \nramifications of inaction.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Paul for his efforts on this bill, and I \nhope the Judiciary Committee will consider our proposal quickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/19/senate-section/article/S3032-1"}, {"day": "19", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3033-S3034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 38--REAFFIRMING THE TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT \n    AND THE SIX ASSURANCES AS CORNERSTONES OF UNITED STATES-TAIWAN \n                               RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. RUBIO (for himself, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Brown, and Mr. \nGardner) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S.
