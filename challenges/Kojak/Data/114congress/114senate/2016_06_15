Mr. President, 7 months ago ISIL terrorists massacred \n130 civilians across the city of Paris, 6 months ago ISIL supporters \nmurdered more than a dozen Americans at a holiday party in San \nBernardino, 3 months ago ISIL bombings killed and maimed \nindiscriminately in the heart of Europe, and then last month ISIL's \nspokesman issued a chilling declaration of war against the Western \nworld. He called for attacks--specifically lone wolf attacks--\nthroughout the month of Ramadan in Europe and the United States. He \nsaid:\n\n       Get prepared . . . to make it a month of calamity for the \n     nonbelievers. [T]he smallest action you do in their heartland \n     is better and more enduring to us than what you would do if \n     you were with us here.\n\n  On Sunday, a terrorist claiming allegiance to ISIL took 49 American \nlives. The next day, an ISIL supporter in France murdered two people, \nincluding an off-duty police officer.\n  We hope to learn more about the Orlando terrorist attack and the \ndepth of that particular terrorist's involvement with ISIL when \nSenators are briefed later today by the FBI Director and the Homeland \nSecurity Secretary. This much seems clear already: I do not believe \nthis was some random act of violence. It seems clear this was a cold-\nblooded murder committed by a terrorist who picked his targets with \ndeliberate malice, who pledged his allegiance to a group who stones gay \nmen and tosses them from rooftops, enslaves women, and crucifies \nchildren.\n  ISIL is not the JV team; it is the personification of evil in our \nworld. ISIL is not contained, nor can it be. The way to prevent more \nISIL-inspired and ISIL-directed heartbreak is to defeat ISIL. This is \nwhy we have repeatedly demanded a serious plan from the President to \ndefeat ISIL and have done what we can to fill the leadership vacuum he \nhas left. This is why we worked to strengthen law enforcement, rebuild \nour military, and develop counterterrorism tools designed to save \nlives. The terrorist attack in Orlando underlines the critical \nimportance of this work, and it presents each of us with a choice: Do \nwe want to make the tough choices to actually solve the problem and \ndefeat ISIL, or do we want to use the Senate floor to make a 30-second \npolitical ad?\n  As I said, the principle way to defeat ISIL-inspired or ISIL-directed \nattacks is to defeat ISIL inside Iraq and Syria. The President's \ncontainment strategy, which has relied primarily upon a ground proxy \nforce of Syrian YPG Kurds, will not be sufficient to dislodge ISIL from \nits headquarters in Raqqa or clear and hold ground in Arab parts of \nSyria.\n  The next President must do much more, and there are steps we can take \ntoday to help him or her succeed in that effort. The sweeping Defense \nbill we passed yesterday represents a decisive step in the right \ndirection. Not only will it help prepare our next Commander in Chief, \nit will help strengthen military readiness, better enable \nservicemembers to confront threats, and help keep the American people \nsafer from an array of national security challenges. Passing that bill \nsent a strong signal to our men and women in uniform, it sent a strong \nsignal to our allies, it sent a strong signal to our adversaries, but \nthere is more we can and must do.\n  This week, through the appropriations process, we will continue to \ndiscuss ways we can shore up our efforts to fight terrorism. Several \nRepublican colleagues have already offered ideas on how we can do so. \nRepublicans have offered ideas to address the threat of lone wolf \nattacks like the one we saw in Orlando. Republicans have offered ideas \nto help connect the dots with respect to terrorists' communications. \nRepublicans have offered ideas to help disrupt terrorists' plans. These \nare the kinds of things we have long advocated. They were important \nbefore the horrific events this weekend and are all the more important \ntoday.\n  By passing the underlying appropriations bill, we can provide the FBI \nwith more of the support it needs to follow leads generated here within \nour borders. In the meantime, I encourage Senators to work with the \nvery capable\n\n[[Page S3876]]\n\nbill managers who crafted this legislation, the senior Senators from \nAlabama and Maryland. If they have other effective ideas, talk to them \nand try to make the bill even stronger.\n  This much is clear: We can choose to respond to terrorist attacks \nafter the damage is already done, or we can make it our goal to prevent \nthem in the first place. I know my choice. I am going to keep doing \nwhat I can to prevent the pain and loss from terrorism. Our families \nand communities are counting on us. Our freedoms and rights as \nAmericans are counting on it too. We must continue to do what is \nnecessary to seek out terrorist threats at every level and protect the \ncountry we love.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/15/senate-section/article/S3875-5"}, {"day": "15", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY BILL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, both the Senate and House took decisive \naction to combat the heroin and prescription opioid epidemic that has \ndevastated so many of our communities. We are now working to take the \nnext important step forward. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery \nAct we passed would expand education and prevention efforts, improve \ntreatment programs, and enhance tools for law enforcement. This \ncritical legislation can bring hope to those affected by this horrible \nepidemic and would not have been possible without the dedicated \nleadership of Members such as Senator Grassley, Senator Portman, and \nSenator Ayotte. We are currently working toward an agreement that will \nallow us to go to conference with the House and work out the final \nlegislation.\n  We have all seen the toll this heroin and prescription opioid crisis \nhas taken on our home States. It is absolutely heartbreaking to see the \ncontinuing impact in Kentucky. Getting this done is important for our \ncountry. With continued cooperation from both sides, we will get a good \nbill to the President's desk very soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/15/senate-section/article/S3876-1"}, {"day": "15", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, here is a frightening quote from an Al Qaeda \nspokesman urging would-be terrorists to buy weapons in the United \nStates. This is exactly what he said:\n\n       America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable \n     firearms. You can go down to a gun show at the local \n     convention center and come away with a fully automatic \n     assault rifle, without a background check, and most likely \n     without having to show an identification card. So what are \n     you waiting for?\n\n  This is an Al Qaeda blueprint for would-be lone wolf terrorists. They \nare telling them to buy guns because nobody will stop them and then go \nand murder Americans. That statement should make every Member of \nCongress think long and hard about our Nation's gun laws.\n  Terrorist groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda are using America's gun laws \nagainst America. They are using these gun laws against Americans in \nevery State. These murderers are calling on their radical followers to \nexploit loopholes in America's gun laws. Why? Because firearms are \neasier to obtain in America than making their homemade bombs. \nRepublicans need to think about this very closely because, as Adam \nLankford, an expert in criminal justice at the University of Alabama, \ntold the Washington Post this week, ``It is becoming increasingly \napparent that mass shootings may be just as deadly as bombings. And the \nscary part is it's often much easier to pull off.''\n  Republicans are in denial about the connection between terrorism and \nguns. In the aftermath of the mass murders with guns at the LGBT \nnightclub in Orlando, Republicans are saying that these attacks have \nnothing to do with guns.\n  The senior Senator from South Carolina said yesterday: ``This is not \na gun control issue.'' It is a gun control issue, and that is \nundeniable. There is no question about that--none.\n  Terrorist leaders are urging lone wolves to exploit our Nation's gun \nlaws by telling them to buy assault weapons and then go out and murder \nAmericans.\n  The Republicans have blocked every attempt we have tried to address \nthe deficiencies in our Nation's gun laws. Last December, Republicans \nblocked legislation that would close the so-called terror loophole, \nwhich allows suspected terrorists to enter a gun store and legally buy \nfirearms or explosives or both. Republicans also blocked legislation \nthat would close the gun show loophole, which allows criminals and \nterrorists to purchase guns without any background check. Remember what \nAl Qaeda's spokesman said:\n\n       You can go down to a gun show at the local convention \n     center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle, \n     without a background check. . . .\n\n  That is what he said. This terrorist was talking about the gun show \nloophole. He was specifically pointing to a flaw in our Nation's gun \nlaws that allows convicted terrorists to slip through, and it is a big, \nwide hole to slip through. Yet the Republicans refuse to respond to \nthis crisis. Why? Because the National Rifle Association and the Gun \nOwners of America told them not to allow us to address this flaw in the \nlaw. This flaw in the law is leading to Americans being murdered.\n  By blocking sensible gun safety, Republicans are playing into the \nterrorists' hands. Republicans' failure to legislate has added a new \nchapter in the ISIS playbook. As we have seen in Orlando and San \nBernardino, deranged individuals are using the terrorist playbook. When \nterrorist groups are urging lone wolves to buy assault rifles and \nmurder Americans, keeping guns away from terrorists is one of the most \nimportant steps we can take to protect Americans.\n  How many more people must be murdered by terrorists wielding assault \nweapons before Republicans stop their obstruction? How many more? \nPerhaps 49 is enough. Hopefully we will find out this week with a vote \nhere. How much longer will Republicans allow killers to manipulate our \nlaws and continue their campaign of terror? How much longer will \nRepublicans fail to protect the American people by allowing these gun \nloopholes to remain? Democrats are going to wait no longer. We are \ngoing to demand solutions to our Nation's gun law epidemic every chance \nwe get.\n  On Monday, I stated that we would demand a vote on the terror \nloophole, and we are going to do that. This is our obligation. We must \ntry at every opportunity to say to the Republicans: The American \npeople, not the NRA and not the Gun Owners of America, should be their \nobligation. There is no excuse for allowing suspected terrorists to buy \nguns. Guns are the problem. It may not be the only problem, but it is a \nproblem, and it is a big problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/15/senate-section/article/S3876-3"}, {"day": "15", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3876-S3877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DACA PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today marks the fourth anniversary of \nPresident Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program. Four \nyears ago today, President Obama announced that young people--\nDREAMers--who do not present a risk to national security may become \neligible for temporary protection from deportation. Since that day, \nover 730,000 DREAMers no longer live in fear of deportation. More than \n12,000 of these young men and women are in Nevada, and they have been \nprotected by this program. They are our newest college students, \nteachers, engineers, small business owners, and they have contributed \nenormously to our communities, making America better. Because of the \nPresident's program, the authorities can sensibly prioritize those who \ndo present a threat to our safety and our country.\n\n  What a shame that Donald Trump and his Republican supporters in the \nSenate want to deport these kids who know no other country than the \nUSA. In my morning briefing this morning, I heard that the House is \ngoing to do something really unique today. They have a measure not to \nallow these young men and women to serve in the United States military.\n  It doesn't matter what you do, you can't be mean enough using the \nRepublicans' playbook. There have been efforts made, votes taken to \nrescind what the President did. There have been efforts made to make \nsure there is no money in the Immigration and Naturalization Service to \nexpedite the processing of these young men and\n\n[[Page S3877]]\n\nwomen to become legitimate in the only country they know.\n  These are the same Republican Senators who last year were willing to \nshut down the Department of Homeland Security--stop it. Why? They \nwanted to stop this program. These are the same Republican Senators who \ninsist on eliminating the Constitution's guarantee of birthright \ncitizenship, ending family-based immigration and deporting hard-working \nfamilies.\n  It is because of what has happened by Republicans in the Congress \nthat we are now faced with Donald Trump. We are here because of what \nthe Republicans in Congress have done. Look at the Senate. Who was the \nleader initially of birthright citizenship? President Obama was not \nborn in America; he was born in Africa. Everybody should know that. He \nis an illegitimate President.\n  Republicans in Congress have made Donald Trump legitimate--to some, \nbut not to us.\n  So I look forward to the day when programs like DACA are replaced \nwith permanent, comprehensive immigration reform. It needs to be done. \nIt is long overdue. I am hopeful the Supreme Court builds DACA's \nsuccess when their opinion is rendered over the next few weeks, which \ncould extend the same protection to the parents of DREAMers that the \nDREAMers have.\n  Mr. President, I would ask the Chair to announce the business of the \nday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/15/senate-section/article/S3876-4"}, {"day": "15", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a few moments ago I got to speak to 45 \nstudents from 5 towns in Wyoming who are here for National History Day \ncompetition. So it is only fitting that I rise today to recognize a \nhistoric event, and that would be the 100th anniversary of the Boy \nScouts of America receiving a congressional Federal charter. On this \nday in 1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Charter of the \nBoy Scouts of America, and I am submitting a resolution to commemorate \nthat important event.\n  The congressional charter has helped the Boy Scouts to become one of \nthe largest youth organizations in the United States. In fact, it is \nestimated that more than 110 million Americans have served as members \nwithin its ranks.\n  Scouting offers those young people friendship, an opportunity to set \npositive goals, and outdoor experiences. But, above all, Scouting is \nabout building character and service. That concept of service is based \non a young boy in London who happened to guide an American through fog, \nand when the American tried to pay the boy, the boy said: No, that was \nmy good deed for the day. The man brought that concept back to the \nUnited States and started the Boy Scouts. A few years later, in 1916, \nthey got the Federal charter.\n  The service that Scouts perform is immeasurable, but there are many \nnoteworthy moments I'd like to mention. During World War I, Scouts \nplayed an important role by collecting used paper and glass from homes. \nScouts also sold Liberty Bonds valued at over $147 million. That was a \nlot of money at that time.\n  President Roosevelt called on Scouts to help the needy during the \nGreat Depression, and throughout World War II, the Scouts again \ncollected materials and sold war bonds.\n  The call to service continues, and today Boy Scouts are doing \nprojects all over this country, thousands of hours every year, to earn \ntheir Eagle award.\n  Another service opportunity will happen next year when the National \nScout Jamboree takes place 13 months from now in West Virginia. \nVolunteers are needed for that effort. The jamboree dates back to 1937 \nwhen more than 27,000 Scouts camped on the National Mall, right out \nthere. On July 19 of next year, 35,000 Scouts and Venturers will arrive \nat the Summit Bechtel Reserve in West Virginia for the 18th National \nScout Jamboree.\n  I went to a National Scout Jamboree at Valley Forge when I was in \nScouts. It started with trains on the West Coast and picked up cars as \nit came through each State, heading east to Valley Forge. It was the \nlargest civilian movement of people in the history of the United \nStates. It was an opportunity to get together with people who were \nfellow Scouts from all over the United States, as well as from other \ncountries. I remember getting to meet some Australian Scouts at that \nparticular jamboree. We were having a campfire with them in the \nevening, and somehow a garter snake happened to come through the camp. \nThey leaped up and hacked that snake to pieces.\n  We said: What is that all about?\n  They said: In Australia, we have 25 snakes and 23 of them are \npoisonous, so we try to kill them first and then identify them.\n  There are a lot of opportunities in Scouts. This jamboree will \nprovide some outstanding experiences, adventures, and achievements for \nmerit badges through a number of outdoor sports such as whitewater \nrafting, rock climbing, and zip-lining. In keeping with the Boy Scout \nslogan of ``Do a Good Turn Daily,'' there are also opportunities to \nparticipate in service projects near the reserve.\n  I am especially excited by next year's jamboree because Matt Myers, \nthe Scout executive director from my home State of Wyoming, is the \nNational Scout Jamboree director. But Matt can't do this alone. \nThousands of volunteers have to work to make the jamboree a success by \nserving as first responders, media specialists, IT support, doctors, \nand more. An interesting thing about these volunteers is they have to \npay their own way to the session, they have to pay the same fee as \neverybody who camps there, and they have to spend two weeks of their \nvacation volunteering. When they had the last jamboree 3 years ago, I \nthink there were 8,000 of these volunteers that came and dedicated \ntheir time to the boys in Scouts.\n  Scouting has meant a great deal to me and my family over the years. \nIncidentally, there are 10 U.S. Senators who are Eagle Scouts. The \nnormal percentage would be about 4 percent. In the Eagle Scouts you \nlearn a lot of leadership skills and are also encouraged to participate \nin your community, your country, and the world. Scouts do that.\n  Incidentally, there are a whole lot more in this body who have been \nin Scouts. I remember one saying that he made it only to Life Scout, \nand he wanted me to know that they call it Life Scout because if that \nis as far as you get--if you don't make that next step to Eagle--you \nwill regret it for life. But no matter what rank you go to in Scouts, \nno matter how long you are in Scouts, you will learn some things that \nyou will not learn anywhere else.\n  Part of it is the merit badge system. We have a Scout in Wyoming who \nhas earned all 132 of the merit badges--what a tremendous adventure in \npersonal finance, safety, and career exploration. You can learn about \njust about any career working on a merit badge, and you can find out \nwhat is involved in it, what you have to know, how you get into that \nprofession.\n  There have been some outstanding Scouts over the years. Richard Byrd, \nwhen he went to the South Pole, took a Boy Scout with him. That was the \nfirst Scout to visit the pole, and there have been opportunities for \nAntarctic Scouts at the South Pole ever since. Paul Siple was the first \nScout who got to go because he earned the taxidermy merit badge. The \nexpedition wanted to capture some of the animals to have specimens when \nthey came back to the United States, so Siple was chosen.\n  A year and a half ago on the space station, there was a Boy Scout. He \nhad been to an academy and had been a test pilot, but after he was \nselected and got to see his reviewed application, there was only one \nthing on the application that was circled, and that was ``Eagle \nScout.'' While he was up in the space station, they had a piece of \nequipment\n\n[[Page S3878]]\n\nbreak loose. Anything floating around in space, especially if it is \nbig, can be a real hazard. So the Scout took the thing and tied it down \nusing a clove hitch. Of course, they reported back to NASA and said \n``We have this little problem.'' NASA worked on it for 2 days and sent \nback word that they needed to tie the equipment down with a clove \nhitch. NASA sent instructions. But the Scout had already taken care of \nthe problem. This shows that you never know what you can learn in \nScouts and how it can be used later.\n  Yesterday I got to meet with some of the Upward Bound TRIO students. \nThose are kids who would be first generation college students. One of \nthem was named Michael Nadig. He was proud to tell me during our \nmeeting that he is an Eagle Scout. I am pretty certain that this young \nman is going to complete his college because one of the things that an \nEagle Scout represents is a symbol of perseverance and a quest to get \nextra knowledge. I am pretty sure Michael is one of those young people \nwho is going to get that extra knowledge and make it through college.\n  I am pleased to meet with Scouts everywhere and hear of their \nadventures and remember my own. And Mr. President, today I am proud to \nrecognize the 100th anniversary of the Boy Scouts Federal Charter. The \nvalues of leadership, service, character, and achievement will live on, \nthanks to the Boy Scouts of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/15/senate-section/article/S3877-3"}, {"day": "15", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3878-S3879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DACA PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

It was \ncalled the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as \nDACA. This was an action by the President which I had asked him to \nconsider. I had written a letter with Senator Richard Lugar, a \nRepublican from Indiana, and later with another 21 Senators, asking \nPresident Obama to consider the creation of this program because many \nof us believed that it was the right thing to do and the fair thing to \ndo.\n  It was 15 years ago that I introduced the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act \nwas really a response to a constituent case in my home State of \nIllinois. A young woman, Korean, had been brought to this country at \nthe age of 2, came in on a visitor's visa, and when the visa expired, \nshe and her mother and the rest of the family stayed. The papers were \nfiled for everyone in the family but her. Now she was here in the \nUnited States, undocumented and illegal at the age of about 18. She \nwanted to go on to college. She had a promising music career ahead of \nher. But under American law as written--and still written--it was very \nclear that she didn't belong in the United States and that she had to \nleave for 10 years and petition to come back.\n  It seemed fundamentally unfair that a young person brought in at the \nage of 2 would face that sort of onerous responsibility and have to \nleave America, so I introduced the DREAM Act. If you were brought here \nunder the age of 16, finished high school, had no serious criminal \nrecord, and you were prepared to go to college, enlist in the military, \nwe would put you on the path to citizenship. It was that simple.\n  That was 15 years ago. That measure has been passed in the House, it \nhas been passed in the Senate, but it has never passed in both Chambers \nin the same year, so it is still a bill waiting to become law. Yet \nthere are 2.5 to 3 million young people who could qualify under the \nDREAM Act. So we wrote to President Obama and said ``Could you give \nthese young people some protection from deportation if they were \nbrought here under the conditions of the DREAM Act,'' and 4 years ago \nhe said yes. He created the DACA Program. The signup was to start in \nAugust of that same year, 4 years ago, and I joined with Congressman \nLuis Gutierrez in offering a signup day at Navy Pier in Chicago. We had \nvolunteer immigration lawyers come in to help these young people fill \nout their forms so they could qualify to stay in the United States for \na few years, not be deported, and pay their fee and be here and have a \nfuture. We didn't know if 200 would show. We were worried when we heard \nit might be 300. In the end, there were thousands who came signing up. \nMany of them waited in line all night with their parents. This was \ntheir first chance to stay in America legally.\n\n  It was an amazing day, one of the most rewarding days of my public \ncareer, to see these young people so anxious to be part of America's \nfuture to sign up under this program. That was 4 years ago that \nPresident Obama created it. He thought--and I think wisely--that if \nthese young people are a part of America's future, what about their \nparents? What if in the same household there is a father or mother \nundocumented? If they have no serious criminal issues, if they are \nprepared to pay the fee, if they will pay their taxes, if they will \nsign up with the government, shouldn't they be allowed to stay in \nAmerica at least on a temporary, renewable basis? That led to the DAPA \nProgram--DACA for the children, DAPA for the parents, created by \nExecutive order by the President.\n  Well, that Executive order has been challenged in Court, across the \nstreet in the Supreme Court. In a few weeks, I expect it will be \nresolved, and I believe the President's position will be sustained. He \nhas said it is his Executive responsibility to decide priorities in \ndeportation. He wants to deport felons, not families, and he wants to \nmake sure young people have a chance.\n  The President is doing what every other President has done in both \npolitical parties. He has been challenged by Republican Governors in a \nhandful of States, and those challenges have suggested that these young \npeople and their parents should be deported. In fact, there is a \nPresidential candidate on the Republican side, the presumptive nominee, \nMr. Trump, who has called for the deportation of these people--the \ndeportation of people whom you are going to meet every single day. They \nare your neighbors. They are the people who wait on you in the store. \nThey may be working in a nursing home caring for your parent. They \nmight be sitting next to you in church.\n  The Trump position--and those of the more radical wing of the \nRepublican Party--is that they should be asked to leave America and \ndeported. To me, that is unwise and unfair. These people should be \ngiven a chance to earn their way to legalization and citizenship, to \npay their taxes, pay their fees, go through a background check to make \nsure they are no threat to our country, and be allowed to continue and \nstay and live in the United States.\n  Well, the challenges to DACA, the program for the original DREAMers, \nhave reached the point where one judge in Texas, Andrew Hanen, a \ndistrict court judge, hearing the case challenging DACA, ordered the \nJustice Department to turn over the details on 108,000 of these \nDREAMers who received 3-year DACA permits, including their contact \ninformation. Judge Hanen indicated this information could be provided \nto the Republican Governors who filed the lawsuit. DREAMers are \nunderstandably very nervous about this personal information being \nturned over to Republican officials who made clear they want to deport \nthese young people back to countries where they haven't lived since \nthey were children. Thankfully, Judge Hanen's order to turn over this \ninformation has been put on hold while we await the Supreme Court's \ndecision.\n  Even if the Supreme Court upholds President Obama's actions in \ncreating DACA and DAPA, consider the possibility of Donald Trump as the \nnext President. Mr. Trump has referred to Hispanic immigrants in the \nmost offensive terms. He has called them ``killers'' and ``rapists.'' \nMr. Trump has pledged that if he is elected President, he will \neliminate DACA and DAPA and deport the 11 million undocumented \nimmigrants who live in this country.\n  Over the years, I have come to the floor to tell the individual \nstories of these DREAMers, the young immigrant students who grew up in \nthis country. I want to put a face on the people Donald Trump would \ndeport. I want people who are following this debate to meet the young \npeople who they believe have no right to be in the United States and \nhave no future in this country and should be asked to leave--in fact, \nforced to leave. I want to show America who these people are. Let's not \ntalk\n\n[[Page S3879]]\n\nabout these undocumented people. Let's talk about the individual who is \ninvolved and the families who are involved.\n  This photo is Lisette Diaz. Lisette was brought to America when she \nwas 6 years old from Chile. She grew up in Long Island, NY, and was a \npretty good student--in fact, excellent. In high school, she won the AP \nScholar with Distinction Award and was a member of the National Honor \nSociety. She made the high honor roll because she had an overall \naverage grade above 95 percent. I wish I could say the same for my high \nschool career. Lisette was involved in extracurricular activities, \nincluding soccer, the literary magazine, and the dance team.\n\n  Here is what she said about growing up in Long Island, NY:\n\n       I knew that being undocumented made me different from my \n     [high school] classmates. But I couldn't help but feel like I \n     belonged here. I recited the pledge of allegiance every day \n     in school. I knew U.S. history better than Chilean history. I \n     watched American television. The vast majority of my friends \n     were American. I just really felt American.\n\n  Lisette went on to attend Harvard University, where she received \nnumerous awards and participated in many extracurricular activities. \nShe volunteered at the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic, where \nshe worked as an interpreter. Of course, because of her immigration \nstatus, Lisette wasn't eligible for any Federal financial assistance \nfor college. Thanks to the DACA Program, which we are commemorating \ntoday, she has been able to work as a student supervisor at Harvard \nKennedy School Library to help support herself and put herself through \nschool. Just last month, Lisette graduated from Harvard with honors. \nHer dream--to become a lawyer and to work in public service.\n  Lisette Diaz is one story. One of the 730,000 who have successfully \napplied for this deferred action under President Obama's Executive \norder. Lisette is one of these undocumented people Donald Trump would \ndeport and send away from America.\n  Mr. Trump and those who happen to be endorsing him don't have any use \nfor young people like Lisette Diaz. They believe they should leave. \nThey add nothing to this country, in their estimation. They are just \nwrong. Both Donald Trump and other Republicans have made their agenda \nclear. They want to shut down DACA and DAPA and deport hundreds of \nthousands of DREAMers and the parents of American children who may be \nundocumented. If they have their way, Lisette will be deported back to \nChile, a country where she hasn't lived since she was 6 years old. Will \nAmerica be a stronger country without her? Will we be a better country \nif someone of her extraordinary talent is gone? Will it make us any \nsafer, any better, if she is deported, as Donald Trump has called for? \nThe answer to most rational people is very clear.\n  I am hopeful the Supreme Court will uphold the President's \nimmigration action. Then I hope the Republicans in Congress will reject \nDonald Trump's bigoted rhetoric and work with us to pass comprehensive \nreform immigration and fix our broken immigration system once and for \nall. There was a time, and it wasn't that long ago, when we passed \ncomprehensive immigration reform in the U.S. Senate. Fourteen \nRepublicans joined with the Democrats to make this bipartisan measure \nat least a vehicle for us to finally address immigration reform in \nAmerica. It was one of the better days in my service in the U.S. \nSenate. What happened to that bill after it passed with a bipartisan \nmajority? It went to the House of Representatives, where it languished \nand died.\n  In 3 years, not a single piece of legislation has been brought \nforward on the issue of immigration reform. Everyone concedes our \nimmigration system is broken. We know we have undocumented people in \nthis country. Those who are dangerous should be deported immediately; \nthose who are not should be given a chance. That is what the bill \nsaid--a chance to file their filing fee, to go through a criminal \nbackground check, to pay their taxes, to register with the government, \nand go to the back of the line and wait, many times waiting for 10 or \n15 years for that chance to finally become a citizen of this country. \nThat is what our bill said. I think it is fair, but the House of \nRepresentatives, under Republican leadership, would not bring it up. \nSadly, this Presidential campaign has shown that many in the Republican \nParty are not only opposed to that legislation, they are opposed to the \nconcept of immigration. They are opposed to the notion that people can \ncome to this country and make a difference.\n  Of the Fortune 500 companies in this country, the biggest employers, \nthe ones that have had the most impact on our economy--a study found \nthat 90 were started by immigrants to the United States, including some \nof the biggest and the most important.\n  This is a nation of immigrants. I have said before, and I will again, \nI am proud to stand here as a first-generation American. My mother was \nan immigrant to this country. Thank goodness my grandparents had the \ncourage to get up and leave Lithuania and come to the United States of \nAmerica. Because of that, I stand here today. That is my story. That is \nmy family's story. It is America's story, and those who reject that \nhistory of this country and that heritage of this country are rejecting \nour birthright and our identity as the United States of America.\n  This campaign by Donald Trump against immigrants--building walls and \nall the hateful things he said--is going to be remembered by a lot of \npeople for a long time. It is going to be transformational as people \nidentify where they think America's future will be. I don't believe it \nis going to be part of the hatred and fear that is being peddled by Mr. \nTrump and others who support him.\n  We are a hopeful, positive nation. When we come together, our \ndiversity is our strength. It is our unity. It is what distinguishes us \nin the world.\n  Today, on the fourth anniversary of the President's Executive order \nfor the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, I thank the \nPresident again for his leadership. I hope the Supreme Court decision, \nin a few weeks, will chart a path for us to open this so we can start \nmoving through the President's leadership toward a goal which we \nstarted in the Senate and unfortunately which died in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to continue setting the record \nstraight for the ongoing issue of water rights between Alabama, \nFlorida, Georgia, and the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  As I said yesterday, language from the committee report that \naccompanies this CJS--Commerce-Justice-Science--bill has been inserted \nin an attempt to strong-arm the outcome of a matter that should clearly \nbe left to the States. This is an interstate dispute, with negotiations \nand litigation still pending, and much like other parts of the country, \nthe States have been in negotiations for many years.\n  Clearly, this is not a matter for Congress. This is not a matter that \nCongress in any way needs to insert itself into. Furthermore, this is a \ndebate we have already had.\n  Last year, the leaders of both Chambers here in Washington determined \nthat Congress has no business using the appropriations process to tip \nthe scales one way or the other on this water rights issue. Why are we \ngoing through this again?\n  This is not the work our constituents had in mind for us when they \nsent us here. They expect us to deliver results on the priority issues \nof our day, and they expect the national interests and the Constitution \nto come before the self-interests of a select few Members of the \nSenate, but, yet again, the senior Senator from Alabama is attempting \nto impose Washington as the solution for a matter that should be and is \nbeing handled by the States.\n  For over 20 years, Alabama, Florida, and Georgia have litigated and \nnegotiated over water rights issues. Despite decades of litigation, \nneither Alabama\n\n[[Page S3880]]\n\nnor Florida has been able to prove any real or substantial harm \nresulting from the Army Corps of Engineers' or Georgia's water \nmanagement practices. As a matter of fact, they are under court \ndirection today.\n  The numbers show this. Since 1980, the population of the Metro \nAtlanta water district has more than doubled from just over 2 million \nto over 5 million, and that is as a percentage of about 10.5 million \npeople in the State as a whole in 2014. Since 2000 alone, the \npopulation of this metro area has grown by more than 1 million.\n  Since the formation of the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning \nDistrict in 2001, water withdrawals in Metro Atlanta have decreased \ndramatically even as the population grew by more than 1 million. As a \nmatter of fact, the consumption per capita has gone down by more than \none-third.\n  This is good water management. Georgia has been a good steward of \nwater resources, and this has been repeatedly validated. In fact, Metro \nAtlanta water systems have gone above and beyond the necessary water \nmanagement practices to ensure that they are conserving as much as \npossible and efficiently properly using the water they do withdraw.\n  Again, the numbers back this up. There are 15 counties in the metro \ndistrict. As I said before, from 2000 to 2013, water withdrawals have \ndeclined by more than one-third. Both Alabama and Florida have \nconsistently lost in court because their claims have been found to be \nbaseless. Because they cannot win in court, now we see the senior \nSenator from Alabama trying to win through the appropriations process \nin Congress.\n  There is a case on this issue currently being litigated between the \nStates in the U.S. Supreme Court that is due to be heard by a court-\nappointed special master in November of this year. There is another \ncase pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, \nand yet another one is pending in the U.S. District Court for the \nNorthern District of Georgia. We need to allow the legal process to run \nits natural course on these cases.\n  But, again, some in this body are short-circuiting that litigation \nthrough the appropriations process. That is just not appropriate. This \nshort-circuiting would have improper influence on the outcomes of these \ncourt cases. That speaks volumes.\n  We are not sent here to pick winners and losers among the States. \nThis is a matter for the States involved to litigate and negotiate, as \nare all interstate disputes. By the way, this could set a dangerous \nprecedent not just for these three States but for all States that have \nwater rights issues.\n  This is a matter for the States involved to litigate and negotiate, \nas are all interstate disputes. This is not a matter to be dealt with \nthrough the appropriations process of the Federal Government.\n  Attempts at this kind of Washington meddling are exactly why many of \nour constituents have lost trust in this body. We must remove this \nlanguage from the CJS bill or we will set a dangerous precedent moving \nforward.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise this morning to encourage my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to support H.R. 2578, the \nCommerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 2017.\n  Before I discuss this bill, I want to take a few minutes to extend my \ncondolences to all who lost loved ones in the horrific act of terrorism \nthat took place over the weekend in Orlando, FL. The unthinkable act of \nviolence underscores how critical it is for the Nation's law \nenforcement to have the tools they need to prevent future incidents and \nprotect the American people.\n  This bill funds important functions that are vital to our Nation's \nsecurity, including law enforcement, immigration enforcement, cyber \nsecurity, and severe-weather forecasting. I believe this bill reflects \nour strong bipartisan relationship on the Committee on Appropriations, \nand I thank my colleagues across the aisle for working with us to move \nthe bill out of the committee.\n  As chairman of the Commerce, Justice, Science Subcommittee, I worked \nwith my colleagues to provide critical funding for the U.S. Departments \nof Commerce and Justice, the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration, and the National Science Foundation, among others.\n  The Commerce-Justice-Science bill before us meets the subcommittee's \nallocation of $56.3 billion in discretionary spending. This level is \n$563 million above the fiscal year 2016 enacted amount and is $1.6 \nbillion above the budget request. However, when taking out scorekeeping \nadjustments and comparing true spending, this bill is actually $1.83 \nmillion below the President's request.\n  The committee has made difficult but I believe responsible decisions \nto craft a bill that stays within the 2-year budget agreement that was \nagreed to last fall. Within these budgetary boundaries, I believe the \ncommittee has achieved a careful balance between the competing \npriorities of law enforcement, national security, economic development, \nscientific research, and space exploration.\n  The bill also funds the Department of Commerce at $9.3 billion, which \nkeeps our next generation of weather satellites on schedule and ensures \nthat the National Weather Service can continue to provide timely \nwarnings for severe weather.\n  To help NOAA modernize the way it manages fisheries, the bill \ncontinues to provide strong funding for NOAA to expand its adoption of \nelectronic monitoring and reporting in order to increase coverage of \nour Nation's fisheries and reduce costs for our commercial fishermen.\n  The red snapper fishery is vital to fishermen and businesses across \nmy State of Alabama and the rest of the Gulf Coast States. I am pleased \nthis bill continues several provisions that will help respond to the \nchallenges facing anyone who wants to fish for gulf red snapper.\n  This committee remains supportive of science and innovation by \nmaintaining healthy funding for the National Science Foundation, while \npreserving a balanced space program within NASA. The budget request \nthat NASA presented to Congress included, I believe, a disingenuous \ncombination of discretionary spending and an unprecedented amount of \nfunding disguised as mandatory spending. The truth is that NASA's \nrequest only totaled $18.2 billion--a cut of $1 billion from what \nCongress provided last year. These cuts, if they were enacted, would \nerode ongoing science missions, delay exploration launches, and stifle \nAmerican innovation.\n  In contrast to the budget request, the bill now before us funds NASA \nat $19.3 billion, preserving the funding Congress provided in 2016. \nThis level makes it possible for the agency to continue supporting \nongoing science and exploration missions, especially the Space\n\n[[Page S3893]]\n\nLaunch System and the Orion capsule development, which are both in \ncritical stages of development.\n  The bill maintains strong funding for the Department of Justice at \n$29.2 billion, and the bill provides either the budget request or at \nleast a 1.5-percent increase for all Federal law enforcement operations \nto support men and women on the frontlines of preserving public safety. \nThe bill before us also includes essential cyber security funding \nthrough the Department in order to protect our Nation and to track \ndown, arrest, and prosecute child predators to keep our communities \nsafe.\n  I want to point out that this bill provides $2.96 billion for victims \nof violent crime from the Crime Victims Fund, or CVF, which meets the \n3-year average of deposits into the fund and is a metric the Committee \non the Budget requested. As a result, overall funding for victims and \nvictim-related grant programs--which are widely supported by many \nmembers of this committee as well as Members of the Senate--remain at \nor above the 2016 levels.\n  I believe this bill strikes a balance between the competing \npriorities of law enforcement, terrorism prevention, research, \nscientific advancement, and U.S. competitiveness. I think we have \nbasically a transparent product that accommodates the Senate's \npriorities and addresses the needs of our Nation. I urge my colleagues \nat the proper time to support the bill's swift passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I, too, rise in support of the Commerce-\nJustice-Science appropriations bill. As my colleague, the chair of the \nsubcommittee, the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby, said, the CJS bill \ndoes provide $56.3 billion to fund the Department of Commerce and its \nmany agencies, the Justice Department, the National Science Foundation, \nand the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. It meets the \nBipartisan Budget Act of 2015. Every account is pretty much at the \nlevel we funded last year. It is a bipartisan bill, it is free from \npoison pill riders, and it was reported 30 to 0 from the committee. I \nsupport the underlying bill and look forward to moving it through the \nSenate.\n\n  What a difference a few days make. When I left the Senate on Thursday \nto return to Maryland to be with my constituents, I was so excited \nabout joining with Senator Shelby to bring the Commerce-Justice-Science \nappropriations bill to the floor. I was excited about it for several \nreasons--not only about the legislation, but what the legislation and \nwhat we brought here actually meant.\n  First of all, we actually were going to bring a bill that was \nbipartisan, and I was going to join with my colleague of so many years, \nSenator Shelby of Alabama, where we have worked together, where we have \ntried to come up with how we meet the needs of the United States of \nAmerica to protect our citizens, to make sure that we are the country \nof innovation and discovery, and that we do this in a way that is also \nfiscally responsible. In order to have bipartisanship, you must start \nwith friendship. Senator Shelby and I have developed that over the \nyears based on mutual respect, candor, civility, and consultation. I \nwas looking forward to bringing the bill based on context.\n  This will be the last subcommittee bill that I will bring to the \nSenate. With my retirement at the end of this session, I will be \nleaving. But this subcommittee is one that I have chaired for a number \nof years, and I have worked with such wonderful colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle. So there was a whole sense of excitement in bringing \nthe bill to the floor. People were working together to bring something \nbefore our colleagues in a spirit of, No. 1, meeting America's needs, \nbeing fiscally responsible, and showing that with mutual respect we can \nget a mutual job done. But that excitement ended. It ended Sunday \nmorning when I woke up and, to my horror and shock, saw what had \nhappened in Orlando.\n  Orlando, I saw, was bleeding. The LGBT community was bleeding. The \nLatino community was bleeding. America was bleeding. It was a terrible \nact of terrorism and hate, killing 49 innocent people, with a death \ntoll possibly on the rise, at a nightclub in Orlando. This was just \nterrible. I knew it wasn't the first time a terrorist with hate in his \nheart and a gun in his hand had mowed down his fellow citizens with a \nhigh-powered weapon. It seemed too hard to believe, yet I noted that \nlast Friday it was 1 year since the murder at Charleston. Innocent \nAmericans going about their lives have been murdered in churches, \nschools, movie theaters, at work. They have names like Newtown, Aurora, \nand San Bernardino. America wants to know: What are we doing to keep \nAmerica safe?\n  I want to say to America, first of all, that in the underlying bill \nwe really worked hard to make America safe. The Senate CJS bill \nincludes $3.7 billion to protect Americans from terrorism and to \nrespond to growing threats and incidents. With Senator Shelby leading \nthe way and working with me, we worked to help the FBI transform from \nfighting bank robbers to fighting ISIL and lone wolves. The bulk of the \nDepartment of Justice, or DOJ, counterterrorism funding is for the \nFBI--$3.5 billion to uncover and disrupt plots against America. For \nexample, we fund the Joint Terrorism Task Force, where all the agencies \nwork together in 104 cities. We make sure we have a watch list through \nthe Terrorist Screening Center of individual investigations resulting \nin arrests for those who seek to join ISIL in Syria. This legislation, \nthis appropriations bill before us, also funds something called the \nNational Security Division--$95 million to make sure we have the \nprosecutors, law enforcement, and coordinated intelligence communities \nto make the case against terrorism. We fund the Office of the U.S. \nAttorneys at $51 million, and we also make sure that when we catch the \nbad guys they go to Federal prison.\n  Also, we help local law enforcement to train and respond to the \nactive shooter incidents. In the last decade, we have had to respond to \n160 incidents in which there was an active shooter trying to commit \nmass murder. Overall, the bill contains a 1-percent increase for \nFederal law enforcement. It is what we could do with our budget \nallocation, but that is not enough. Our tight allocation means we can't \nafford the resources to respond to the threats of America and stay \nwithin the budget caps. The FBI needs the right tools, the right \ntechnology, and the right training to stop terrorists before they act \nto uncover these lone-wolf and organized operations. That is why later \non in the bill, I will offer an amendment for emergency funding for the \nFBI to add $170 million to fight terrorism, whether it originates \noverseas or here in the United States. We have helped with emergency \nsupplemental funding for the FBI before, every year between 2001 and \n2008, but the threat is growing with emergencies now.\n  But Sunday's attack was also a hate crime. No hate crime should be \ntolerated against any community or any group, ever. America's strength \nlies in its diversity. We also have to stay together, and we have to \nstand strong in denouncing prejudice and violence directed at any \ngroup. We must speak out against hate in any form.\n  I, too, want to express my condolences to those people who died in \nOrlando. I also want to express my condolences to their family members, \nto the injured, and to all who will bear the permanent impact of this.\n  This bill is also a way of showing that we are serious about hate \ncrimes. The bill that Senator Shelby and I brought here maintains \nfunding for the Civil Rights Division of $148 million to enforce anti-\ndiscrimination laws. We worked with Assistant Attorney General Gupta \nand her colleagues to keep schools, workplaces, and companies safe and \nfree from intolerance and discrimination. But again, there, we need \nmore help, and I hope to add $30 million to that agency to fight \ndiscrimination. Hearing the strong cries across the country, I know \nthere will be those who will be calling for action on gun control. \nSenator Feinstein and others will speak later on today on that.\n  In terms of what just happened--it happened in Orlando, but it \nhappened in Newtown and so on--I think we have a good response in the \nbill, and I think there are good pending amendments. But I also want to \nspeak to the other part of the bill. One of my big issues is jobs--jobs \ntoday and jobs tomorrow. In this legislation, working again with my \ncolleague, we put money into this for jobs and innovation.\n\n[[Page S3894]]\n\n  Why is innovation so important? For the companies in the S 500, \nabout 80 percent of their value comes from intangible assets--patents \nand trademarks and research software--not bricks and mortar and \ninventory. That means that through innovation, companies need new \nknowledge to invent new products and to have new jobs. We want to win \nnot only the Nobel Prizes, but we want to win the markets, and we have \nto start with research. That is why we fund the National Science \nFoundation at $7.5 billion, supporting more than 11,000 research \ngrants, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology at $974 \nmillion to make sure that it sets our standards for products to be sold \neverywhere in the world. Those are American standards, not Chinese \nstandards. We are not buying Chinese mammogram equipment. We are not \nbuying Chinese equipment to make our cars lighter and safer. Also, we \nare doing important work there on cyber security.\n\n  Also, we have the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. I \nam very proud of the work they do in terms of fisheries and our oceans \nand certainly their work in the Chesapeake Bay. But we also have the \nvery important weather prediction, where, again, working with the other \nside of the aisle, we made sure they had the right computational \ncapacity to be able to do the weather forecasting that we need.\n  Hurricane season is upon us. We need to pinpoint when a hurricane is \ncoming to be able to save lives and be able to save property. Every \nmile of evacuation costs $1 million. The more accurate we can be, the \nearlier we can be, the more lives we will be able to save and also \nprotect property. That is what they do.\n  Then, of course, there is NASA. My colleague from Alabama, Senator \nShelby, and I have worked a number of years on the national space \nagency. We have worked so hard for a balanced space program--human \nspace flight, reliable space transportation, aeronautical and space \nscience. We have inspired new discovery. We have helped promote \ninnovation. We have looked at new stars from the Hubble. We have looked \nat new planets using Pluto. We have spawned a new satellite servicing \nindustry. We have also looked out for the planet. Whether it is in \nHuntsville, AL, or at the Goddard Space Flight Center, we have really \nmoved this work.\n  We need our science agencies to invent and to be able to sell their \nproducts, but we also want to protect ideas and innovation. That is why \nwe fund the Patent and Trademark Office. Senator Shelby and I believe \nthat private property needs to be protected. But intellectual property \nis private property, and we want to make sure that our Patent and \nTrademark Office really is able to be not a bottleneck but a pathway to \nprotecting this. We also promote the International Trade Administration \nand the Economic Development Administration.\n  I look forward to a robust amendment process to address the issues \nrelated to safety and security and other aspects of the bill. I hope \nour colleagues will come forth to debate--there are no restrictions \nhere--and then to offer amendments. Now is the time to seize the \nmoment.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague Senator Shelby and all of \nour colleagues to move this bill. I think at the end of the day, we can \nbe very proud of what we are doing to protect America on many different \nlevels.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I commend the chairman and ranking member \nfor many, many things. I want to say to the ranking member, Senator \nMikulski, that we are going to miss her upon her retirement. As one who \nis near and dear to our Nation's space program, both civilian and \nmilitary, their leadership has been extraordinary.\n\n\n                        Mass Shooting in Orlando\n\n  I want to talk about Orlando. Since I didn't have time to blow this \nup, I want people to see this small print, where my finger is on an AR-\n15. A similar weapon is what the shooter Mateen used called a Sig \nSauer, and it has some designation of letters. It has a collapsible \nstock. That is probably why he was able to conceal it as he went into \nthe nightclub late in the evening while some people were leaving. It \nwas last call. There was probably some reduction of heightened \nawareness because the evening was over.\n  The AR-15 is an extremely lethal military weapon which, like the \nmilitary M-16, can shoot a bullet called a .223, or it can shoot a \nbullet that is a little larger and more powerful called a .300 AAC \nBlackout, all the more that will do damage tearing into flesh.\n  This tragedy in my State, in the town in which I live, could have \nbeen prevented, since he had been on the terrorist watch list for over \n2 calendar years. While he was questioned three times--in 2013 and \n2014--upon that questioning, the FBI saw no prosecutable evidence to \ncontinue and closed the case.\n  As the Director of the FBI said, ``Once an investigation is closed \nthere is then no notification of any sort that is triggered by that \nperson then attempting to purchase a firearm,'' when the case or cases \nwere closed as inconclusive. That was FBI Director Comey.\n  Therefore, I have introduced legislation that would--if you have been \nquestioned about a possible terrorist act--much more so if you have \nbeen put on the terrorist watch list but have been taken off because, \nas the Director said, that case was closed as inconclusive, his words--\nwhen you go to purchase a gun, you can purchase that gun legally. Why \nshouldn't the FBI be notified that the person who has just purchased \nthe weapon had been on the terrorist watch list? It is common sense. I \ndon't think that even the NRA can object to this--and they are \naccustomed to getting their way around here--because this does not in \nany way inhibit the purchase of that firearm. This is after the fact of \nthe purchase that a notification is given to the NCIS system--the \nNational Instant Criminal Background Check System--that this person was \nonce under investigation by the FBI and/or put on the terrorism watch \nlist.\n  It seems to me this is common sense. Had that law been in place, 50 \npeople--49 innocent victims--would not be dead, and there would not be \nanother 50, some of whom are fighting for their lives.\n  I will also say we have already hotlined a resolution that my \ncolleague Senator Rubio and I have introduced expressing the condolence \nto Orlando, condemning the terrorist attack, giving our support for the \nfamilies and friends of those affected, and applauding the dedication \nof the law enforcement who responded and the interagency officials.\n  I will also say what I repeated in my remarks Monday afternoon, as I \nhad just returned from South Orange Avenue, the street in Orlando not \nfar from the nightclub and not far from ORMC, the hospital where so \nmany of those victims are still in critical condition: We are healing. \nIt is going to take a long time, but one of the things in the healing \nprocess that we need is the expression of unity instead of division.\n  It was a marvelous sight in the temporary command center, set up in \nthe middle of Orange Avenue, to see the State, local, and Federal level \nall working together seamlessly, with the FBI taking the lead. That is \nhow government is supposed to respond.\n  How is a society supposed to respond? Was it on Sunday when we opened \nour Orlando office to try to help with the incoming calls, all of which \nwere support; was it like the ceremony two nights ago at the First \nBaptist Church of Orlando, where it was one of unity and the members of \nthe Muslim community were prayed for by the other faith communities in \nthat church setting; or was it in the 400 calls we had in our Orlando \noffice on Monday, the day after--95 percent of which were expressing \nhate, anti-gay, anti-immigrant, anti any gun control, anti whatever it \nwas, expressing not a message of unity but a message of division?\n  This Senator had just been elected in 2000. In the first year of my \ntenure in the Senate, 9/11 happened. What I saw was remarkable. This \nSenate came together to crowd around the Senators from New York, \nConnecticut, and New Jersey, offering them the unity of the Nation. At \nthe time that we were still under the terror watch on that very evening \nof September 11, 2001, the Members of Congress in this Senate and the \nHouse said: We don't care. We are going to the center steps on the\n\n[[Page S3895]]\n\neast front of the U.S. Capitol Building, and we broke out in unison \nsinging ``God Bless America.'' We were showing our unity.\n  Where is that unity now? It is being expressed in pockets around this \ncountry, and it is being expressed to those grieving in Orlando. We \nmust do more.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to follow up on the remarks of our \nfriend Senator Nelson from Florida.\n  Let me first say a couple of things about the bill that is on the \nfloor. This is a challenging bill to bring to the floor. Senator Shelby \nis the chairman of the committee. He has done a great job on bringing a \nbill to the floor. It is not the bill he would have written if he were \nwriting the bill by himself. Senator Mikulski has done the same thing. \nBy having these bills on the floor, we have a chance to let all the \nSenators express their views by offering amendments and voting on \namendments.\n  This bill has some excellent things in it at a critical time and \npursues a national network of manufacturing centers. A couple of years \nago, Senator Brown and I were able to get Advanced Manufacturing \nCenters of Excellence into the law in a way that the Commerce \nDepartment could do things that they otherwise are not able to do. This \nfully funds an important program that the administration zeros out \nevery year. The victims of child abuse advocacy centers are centers \nwhere kids can go who have either been the victims of a crime or the \nwitness to a crime and have the interview that needs to be had and have \nit one time, in almost all cases by somebody who knows what they are \ndoing--a forensic interview that puts that crime on the record in a way \nthat kids don't have to constantly relive that moment because somebody \nwho might be very good at interviewing adults isn't very good at \ninterviewing kids, someone who doesn't understand how traumatic that \nmoment is if you are 2, 5, or 15.\n  Senator Coons and I were able to put legislation on the books that \nextended that program a few years ago, and I am grateful to see the \nprogram fully funded, even though I am annually puzzled by why the \nJustice Department says we don't need these programs for these victims. \nThat is taken care of here.\n  Lots of things happened, as we should be focusing on the law \nenforcement community. Once again, after what happened Sunday morning, \nwe are praising the law enforcement community. We are praising the \nequipment they have. I haven't heard anybody critical of the fact that \nthere were armored vehicles--not armed vehicles but armored vehicles--\nthere, the BearCat they used that could perforate the wall. Those \nweren't in the State capital, and the local police didn't have to call \nand ask: Is it OK if we get the armored vehicle brought down here from \nTallahassee? They had a vehicle.\n  Many of these vehicles were bought under programs that uniquely allow \neither funding or equipment to be transferred. When you see those holes \nin the wall where victims got out and law enforcement officials got in, \nthat was the very kind of vehicle that many in this Congress were \ncritical of just a couple of years ago when those same vehicles were \nbeing used to save lives, bring people out who had been injured in our \ncountry, and we heard a lot about the militarization of the police. We \ndidn't hear any of that over the weekend, and thank goodness we didn't \nhear that.\n  I am pleased the Senate has responded to Senator Rubio and Senator \nNelson's resolution that expresses our gratitude for those who helped \nin this tragedy, gratitude to the law enforcement community, gratitude \nto first responders, gratitude to people in the community who stepped \nforward to donate blood, people in Orlando and around the country who \nsent in national support groups to offer counseling at a time when a \nlot of counseling is necessary.\n  It is hard to imagine what it would have been like to be in that \nnightclub. It is hard to imagine what it would have been like. One \nfather I heard yesterday had a message from his son, over his son's \niPhone, that he thought was the last time he would ever hear from his \nson, and only hours later he saw a video of his son. He was one of the \npeople who was being helped out of the building. Only then did he know \nhis son was alive.\n  A lot of counseling needs to happen for a lot of people who lost \ntheir loved ones, people who have lost people who mean so much to them. \nForty-nine innocent people were killed on Sunday. Fifty-three people \nare still suffering injuries, and many more people are suffering the \ntrauma of what happens when you are there or when this is your \ncommunity or this is your family. We need to be thinking about that, \nand the resolution recognizes that.\n  People need help at times like this. After a tragedy such as this, we \nare almost certain to hear two debates; one is about the Second \nAmendment, and one is about how big of a problem is the mental health \nproblem of this. We have now added to this debate Orlando, San \nBernardino, and other places around the world. We now have to deal with \nradical Islamic terrorism being used as a motivator, those who have \ntaken faith out of any rational concept of faith and have used it as an \nexcuse for violence.\n\n  We will have debates about the no-fly list and terror watch list. By \nthe way, those are two very different lists. The no-fly list is a \nrelatively small list. The terror watch list has about 1 million people \non it.\n  As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I am still waiting to hear \na better explanation as to why a terror suspect was taken off the list \nother than them coming to the conclusion that the interview was \ninconclusive. The Senator from Florida said that was the reason for the \ndecision that was made by the FBI Director. ``Inconclusive'' is not a \ngood enough answer. I would think that if there is a reason an \nindividual is on that list, there should be a conclusive reason that \nperson is taken off the list and not an inconclusive reason for being \ntaken off the list. I suggest we need to be thoughtful here. When the \ngovernment can put people on the list outside the normal justice system \nand because the government has put your name on a list, somehow you \nlose rights you might otherwise have--that is the kind of thing we \nwouldn't assume our government would be able to do. To put somebody on \na list who needs to be watched is a different thing, and how they get \non and off that list is a different debate. But just the idea that we \ncould have a government put your name or my name or the name of anybody \nlistening to this on a list and that because you are on that list, \ncertain things could happen that wouldn't happen otherwise, is \nconcerning to me.\n  Senator Stabenow and I have been working for a long time now to try \nto create an opportunity for States--back to the counseling element of \nthis--to treat all health care, including mental health care, the same. \nWe have a bill, the Expand Excellence in Mental Health Act, where we \nhave had 24 States that have applied for the grant process to make a \nproposal to the Federal Government that would allow them to try this \nprogram for a couple of years so they can see what happens. The 8 to 24 \nStates that are able to do this will likely find out that not only is \nthis the right thing to do on all fronts, but it is the right thing to \ndo in terms of health care costs generally. If we treat mental health \ncare like we treat all other health care, all of those costs will go \ndown.\n  The last bill President Kennedy signed into law was the Community \nMental Health Act at the end of October 1963. The law was meant to free \nthe thousands of Americans who suffered from mental illness and were \ninstitutionalized. The only problem was that once those mental health \ninstitutions closed, no other alternatives had been made available in \nthe way they should have been. According to the National Institutes of \nHealth, one in four adult Americans has a diagnosable and almost always \ntreatable mental health issue, and they say that one in nine adult \nAmericans has a mental health issue that impacts how they live every \nday.\n  This brings me to one of the points I wanted to be sure to make \ntoday. We always talk about mental health after one of these tragedies \noccurs. People with a mental health issue are much more likely to be \nthe victim of a crime than they are to be the perpetrator of a crime. \nAs we have this discussion, we want to be careful that we don't drive \npeople further away from an interest in seeking treatment.\n\n[[Page S3896]]\n\n  If one out of four adult Americans has a diagnosable mental health \nissue, this is not unique. If one out of nine adult Americans has a \ndiagnosable mental health issue that impacts how they live every day, \nwe should be talking about this as a health care issue. Clearly, \nsomebody who does irrational things may have a mental health concern, \nbut we don't ever want to make the mistake that mental health and crime \nare somehow the same thing.\n  I will repeat this one more time: If you have a mental health issue, \nyou are much more likely to be the victim of a crime than the \nperpetrator of a crime.\n  For far too long, we have allowed the law enforcement community and \nthe emergency rooms in this country to be the de facto mental health \ncare delivery system. We are doing significant and helpful things in \nthis bill for law enforcement. Let's look for other opportunities to do \nthe right thing for law enforcement by being sure that we take one of \ntheir daily obligations--the mental health care delivery system \nobligation--and look for every way we can to minimize that by creating \nopportunities to have mental health care treated like all other forms \nof health care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, first, I extend my thanks to Chairman \nShelby and Ranking Member Mikulski for putting together a truly \nbipartisan bill. I am honored to be a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee and honored to support this bipartisan compromise. This was a \ndifficult bill to put together, but they did very good work to make \nthis a product both sides could support. I thank them for allowing me \nto be a part of that process.\n  Second, let me acknowledge the remarks of Senator Mikulski, who noted \nthat in many ways the world and the country have changed since this \nbill was scheduled to come to the floor.\n  Our hearts break collectively in this country for the citizens of \nOrlando. In particular, for those of us from Connecticut, our hearts \nbreak for the people of Orlando because we know in a very real way \nabout the pain that exists there today, and we also know how that pain \nis really never-ending. The ripples of that pain are unceasing and \nunrelenting, and they span generations, neighborhoods, and years. \nNewtown is still putting itself back together and probably will be for \na long time, and the same goes for Orlando. Our hearts break for what \nthat community is going through.\n  The world is different today than it was at the end of last week. \nThere is a newfound imperative for this body to find a way to come \ntogether and take action to try to do our part to stem this epidemic of \ngun violence and in particular this epidemic of mass shootings that \nplagues this Nation like no other industrialized nation in the world. \nThere is something fundamentally different happening in the United \nStates that causes us to have these catastrophic-level mass shootings \non almost a monthly basis. In 2015 it caused us to have 372 mass \nshootings. The definition of a mass shooting is when four or more \npeople are shot at any one time. Every day results in 80 or more people \nbeing killed by guns through domestic violence, accidental shootings, \nand homicides.\n  It won't surprise you to know that for those of us who represent \nConnecticut, the failure of this body to do anything at all in the face \nof that continued slaughter isn't just painful to us, it is \nunconscionable. I can't tell you how hard it is to look into the eyes \nof the families of those little boys and girls who were killed in Sandy \nHook and tell them that almost 4 years later, we have done nothing at \nall to reduce the likelihood that that will happen again to another \nfamily. I shudder to think what it will be like for Senator Nelson 4 \nyears from now to talk to the parents of those who were killed this \npast weekend in Orlando and tell them that 4 years after Orlando and 8 \nyears after Newtown, Congress has been utterly silent.\n  I have stood on this floor dozens of times talking about this \nsubject. I often come down to tell the story of the voices of the \nvictims of these gun homicides and mass shootings just to make sure \npeople know who these victims are. They are real people with families. \nThis isn't new to me, but I am at my wit's end. I have had enough. I \nhave had enough of the ongoing slaughter of innocents, and I have had \nenough of the inaction in this body.\n  Every shooting is different. There are a different set of facts \naround every single shooting. The story in Newtown was about a deeply \nmentally ill individual who had been isolated in his school and \nneighborhood. It was a story about a young man who had a fascination \nwith violent content and violent video games. It was a story of a young \nman who had access to a very powerful weapon and who was able to shoot \nand kill 20 kids.\n  The shooting in Orlando has a different set of facts as well. There \nis clearly a terrorist connection. It is a story about radicalization. \nIt is also a story about a very ill, very confused young man. It is a \nstory of access to a very powerful weapon. It is a story about \ninteraction with the FBI and the holes in the network of surveillance \nand checks that we need to discuss.\n  Every set of facts is different, but what unites all of these \nshootings--from Littleton, to Aurora, to Newtown, to Blacksburg, to \nOrlando--is that the weapon of choice in every case is a gun, often a \nvery powerful gun, an AR-15 or AR-15 style of gun that was designed for \nthe military and law enforcement to kill as many people as quickly as \npossible. What unites all of these incidents is our failure to do \nanything about it.\n  No one can guarantee that a shooting won't occur. No set of laws can \nallow us to say with certainty that there won't still be killings in \nChicago, New Haven, and Los Angeles. There is no legislative guarantee \nthat there won't be another Omar Mateen. But the idea that we haven't \neven tried or proffered ideas on this floor and debated them is \noffensive to those of us who have lived through these tragedies.\n  I have great respect for the product that Chairman Shelby and Ranking \nMember Mikulski have put on the floor. I know this isn't going to make \nme popular with many of my colleagues or with the leadership of this \nbody, but I don't think we should proceed with debate on amendments to \nthis bill until we have figured out a way to come together on--at the \nvery least--two simple ideas that enjoy the support of 80 to 90 percent \nof Americans. These two ideas, two pieces of legislation, would have \nbeen potentially dispositive and impactful with respect to the case in \nOrlando.\n  Senator Feinstein has introduced one of those pieces of legislation \nwhich would simply say that if you are on a terror watch list, you \nshouldn't be able to buy a weapon. I heard one of my colleagues talk \nabout reservations about this legislation, but I am certain there is a \nway to bridge any divide we have on how to administer that protection \nin a way that could bring Republicans and Democrats together.\n  Second, in order to make that protection meaningful, we also need to \nmake sure that wherever a would-be shooter buys a gun, he goes through \na background check. If you put terrorists or suspected terrorists on a \nlist of those who are prohibited to buy guns, it doesn't do much good \nwhen around half of all gun purchases today are made outside of the \nbackground check system.\n  Let's say that the Orlando shooter was on a list that prohibited him \nfrom buying a weapon and he went to a store and was denied that AR-15-\nstyle weapon because he was on that list. But all he would have to do \nis go to a weekend gun show or go online, and he would be able to get \nthat weapon without a background check. So if you really want to \nprevent terrorists or would-be terrorists or suspected terrorists from \nobtaining weapons, you have to pass legislation that puts those on the \nterrorist watch list on the list of those who are prohibited to buy \nguns; give them an ability to get off that list if they are on there \nwithout reason, but put them on that list as a default. Second, we have \nto expand the sales that are subject to background checks to make sure \nthat we are creating a web that catches that potential terrorist when \nhe tries to buy that weapon.\n  I am prepared to stand on this floor and talk about the need for this \nbody to come together on keeping terrorists away from getting guns--\nthrough those two measures--for, frankly, as long as I can, because I \nknow we can come together on this issue. I know there is\n\n[[Page S3897]]\n\nother really important business to be done here. I know other people \nhave amendments they would like to call up. I know there are other \nissues that Senators would like to raise. But having come through the \nexperience of Newtown, I have had enough.\n  It has been 4 years and nothing has been done, despite the fact that \n90 percent of the American public wants us to act. The vast majority of \ngun owners want us to expand the reach of background checks. Polls \nsuggest that 80 percent of Americans believe that people on a terrorist \nwatch list shouldn't be able to buy guns. There is no controversy out \nthere about these two provisions. We can work it out. We can work it \nout today.\n  We got a majority of the Senate to support Manchin-Toomey. That \nlegislation still exists. Senator Schumer has introduced other \nlegislation. Senator Feinstein has introduced a bill to keep terrorists \nfrom getting guns. I am certain there are ways that it can be made \nbetter.\n  As someone who represents the community of Sandy Hook, which is still \ngrieving today, I am going to stand on this floor and talk about our \nexperience at Sandy Hook and Orlando's experience and the need to come \ntogether on this issue of making sure that dangerous people who have \ndesigns on mass murder don't get dangerous weapons, as long as I can, \nso that we can allow time to try to figure out a path forward, to bring \nthis body together on the issue of changing our gun laws so that they \nreflect the will of 90 percent of the American people. I know what I am \nsuggesting is extreme, but we have had enough of inaction in \nConnecticut. I just don't want the Senator from Florida, who just \nspoke, to say to those families 4 years from now that he couldn't do \nanything either.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what I mean about how this affects Sandy \nHook in an ongoing way and why I couldn't help myself but to come down \nand take this stand today. The families that are dealing with this \ngrief in Orlando are spread out all over the country and all over the \ngreater Orlando area. It is awful. We just can't imagine--I certainly \ncan't imagine--what it is like to lose a child. These are young men and \nwomen who died in that nightclub. But it is something different to lose \na 6- or 7-year-old. It is something different when four or five of \nthose kids lived on one road in Newtown. All of a sudden, overnight, \nfour or five kids disappear. They are gone. It is something different \nwhen all of the other kids in that school heard those gun shots. They \nhad to flee, stepping over the bodies of the administrators and their \nteachers.\n  That pain stays with you for a long time as a community, such that in \nthe months and months after what happened in Sandy Hook occurred, you \ncould be in a classroom and hear a young child scream out a word that \nseemed like a non sequitur. In one particular class the word was \n``monkey'' and, every so often, we would have a student stand up and \nyell ``monkey.'' That was a safe word. The teachers had worked out that \nif a conversation started in class about the shooting, about maybe what \none kid had seen and another student didn't want to be a part of that \nconversation--because we remember there were survivors from these \nclassrooms as well as from the classroom next door--if one kid didn't \nwant to be in that conversation, then that one child would stand up and \nsay ``monkey'' at the top of their lungs, and a teacher would come over \nand break up that conversation. I don't know why, but I think about \nthat a lot--about a little kid standing up and screaming ``monkey'' in \nthe middle of the classroom, just as a reminder of how the trauma of \nthese events doesn't end.\n  They say in cities across America that when one American is shot, \nthere are 20 people surrounding them--friends, family members including \naunts, uncles, children--who experience post-traumatic stress after \nthat event. Studies suggest that there are 20 people that experience \nlevels of trauma. Often in our cities, that leads to a cycle of \nviolence; the anger that comes from a loved one being killed often \nleads to someone else getting killed as well. It is part of the reason \nwhy, over Memorial Day weekend in Chicago, there were over 60 people \nwho were shot.\n  So this grief is never-ending for communities like Newtown, which is \nwhy I am as passionate today as I was in the days and weeks following, \nand why, for me, Orlando was a breaking point. I just look at myself in \nthe mirror and I think--as we will hear from some of our colleagues who \nwill interject with questions and who have reached a breaking point as \nwell--that we couldn't proceed with business as usual in the Senate \nthis week, that we couldn't do what we have largely done after mass \nshooting after mass shooting; we couldn't go on and debate other issues \nand ignore the fact that the vast majority of Americans--80 to 90 \npercent--want us to take this action, and that it would be impactful.\n  Now, again, you can say what I am proposing today wouldn't have \nchanged the result in Sandy Hook because this individual in Sandy Hook \ndid buy the weapon with a background check through a legal means--his \nmother. I understand that. There is no one change in law that is going \nto apply to every situation. But it potentially would have been \nimpactful in Orlando. As I am sure Senator Feinstein will explain later \ntoday, there is a possibility that if her bill had been in effect, the \nFBI could have put this individual on a list that would have prohibited \nhim from buying a weapon. And had we expanded background checks to make \nsure that they applied to Internet sales and gun show sales, then he \nmight have been stopped in his ability to get this weapon. We can't \nknow that for sure, but we certainly can say that it would have been \nless likely that he would have been able to get that weapon and carry \nout this crime had those laws--again, supported by the vast majority of \nthe American public--been in effect. And by acting, by coming together \nand finding a way to act on these two noncontroversial measures, I \nthink we also send an important signal to the American public and to \nwould-be murderers that we are serious about stemming this epidemic.\n  I think people notice when we remain silent. I know it is \nunintentional, but it almost seems to some people as if we don't care \nabout what happens when we don't try to do anything about it. I \nunderstand that we have deep disagreements about how to proceed, but \nwith the exception of one week in 2013, we have not brought a debate to \nthis floor in which we try to hash out our differences. The Republican \nleadership didn't announce in the wake of Orlando that we are going to \nspend this week working on trying to enact measures to make sure that \nanother mass shooting doesn't happen. And there is a fundamental \ndisconnect with the American people when these tragedies continue to \noccur and we just move forward with business as usual.\n  So I am going to remain on this floor until we get some signal, some \nsign that we can come together on these two measures, that we can get a \npath forward on addressing this epidemic in a meaningful, bipartisan \nway.\n  Orlando is the worst mass shooting in American history. A gunman shot \nand killed 49 people and shot and injured at least 53 others outside of \nPulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando. At about 2 o'clock in the morning on \nSunday, a gunman opened fire inside Pulse, a large gay nightclub in \ndowntown Orlando. It opened in 2004. The owner started it to, frankly, \npromote awareness of the area's lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender \ncommunity, and they host monthly LGBT-related education events. There \nwas one ununiformed Orlando police officer working security at the \nnightclub, along with a number of other private security officers. The \npolice officer working security exchanged fire with the gunman after \nthis incident began. The gunman proceeded to retreat back into the \nnightclub and take the remaining club-goers hostage, where he held them \nfor three hours until 5 a.m. A SWAT team comprised of true heroes \nstormed the club with stun grenades and an armored vehicle. The gunman \nwas killed in the resulting firefight. One officer was injured. Law \nenforcement rescued approximately 30 hostages.\n  In a press conference at about 10:30 that morning--we all remember \nthis--the police indicated that 50 people were killed and 53 more were \ninjured. The shooter was identified as Omar Seddique Mateen, 29, a U.S. \ncitizen from St. Lucie County, FL.\n\n[[Page S3898]]\n\n  We now know that this shooter became a person of interest to law \nenforcement in 2013 when the FBI learned that he had made comments to \ncoworkers alleging possible terrorist ties, and again in 2014. The FBI \ndid open an investigation into the shooter, but it was subsequently \nclosed when they didn't think that it warranted any further \ninvestigation.\n  Mateen was armed with an AR-15-style assault rifle and a Glock \nhandgun. He did obtain licenses to buy both of these guns legally--a \nhandgun and a long gun. He bought them about a week or two before the \nincident, so it is pretty clear he was buying these weapons with an \nintent to kill civilians.\n  Prior to the shooting, Mateen called 911 and pledged his allegiance \nto ISIS. He mentioned the Boston bombers. It is a complicated story \nline, and we know some of the other story lines about this shooting, as \nwell, including whether he had been frequenting that club prior to \nentering it as the shooter. It is a complicated story line. But at the \nroot of it is someone who had been flagged by the FBI. The root of it \nis someone who had access to a weapon that was not designed for \ncivilians.\n  AR-15-style weapons weren't legal in the United States until 2004 \nafter being banned for 10 years. It is not coincidental that there was \na massive increase in mass shootings in this country after 2004. We are \nstill gathering information on the exact nature of the motive, but what \nwe know is this incident is the deadliest mass shooting and the highest \ncasualty mass shooting in American history, but it is not the first, \nand if we don't do something, it won't be the last.\n\n  In 2009, in Fort Hood, TX, a gunman shot and killed 13 people and \nshot and injured 30 others at the Fort Hood military post. In August of \n2012, in Oak Creek, WI, a gunman shot and killed six people and injured \nthree others at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek. In June of 2015, in \nCharleston, SC--and we are sitting on the 1-year anniversary of this \nmass shooting--a gunman shot and killed nine people at the Emanuel \nAfrican Methodist Church, one of the oldest Black congregations in the \nSouth. About a month later, in July, a gunman shot and killed five \npeople, including two U.S. marines and a naval officer, and shot and \ninjured two others. In San Bernardino, at the beginning of December of \n2015, 2 gunmen killed 14 people and injured 21 others at the Inland \nRegional Center. I mention these particular shootings because these \nwere the shootings that were investigated as acts of terrorism. These \nare the shootings that have involved connections to radical groups or \nthe intention to commit an act of terrorism against a minority group.\n  So I think it is right that we drill down today on this issue of \nstopping would-be terrorists from getting guns because just since 2009 \nthis would be the sixth American mass shooting to be investigated by \nthe FBI as an act of terrorism. We think of terrorists as using bombs \nor improvised explosive devices as their weapons of choice. In fact, \nthe reality is that over the course of the last 12 months, it has been \nthe military assault weapon that has been the weapon of choice of \nwould-be terrorists.\n  The San Bernardino shooter and the Orlando shooter chose a gun, not a \nbomb, in order to carry out their attacks. Why? Because it is, frankly, \na lot easier to get a powerful rifle that was designed for the military \nthan it is to obtain or construct a military-capacity bomb or explosive \ndevice.\n  We have to admit that there is this trendline heading in the \ndirection of powerful firearms that used to be banned in this country--\nand by the way, through bipartisan legislation--to carry out this \ndestruction. You don't have to listen to me; you can listen to \nterrorist organizations themselves. ISIS today relies on lone wolf \nattackers in order to perpetuate its mythology of increasing strength. \nWhy is that? Well, it is because we have actually had success in \nreversing their territorial gains in Iraq and Syria. ISIS is on the run \nin the Middle East. They are far from being defeated, and we need to \nkeep up strong steps to continue to support the Syrian rebel forces and \nto support the Iraqi Army to push ISIS back.\n  They have two narratives that they proffer in order to recruit people \ninto their ranks: No. 1 is that the caliphate was inevitable and \ngrowing, and for a long time it was. That so-called caliphate--their \ngeographical territory of control--was growing. No. 2 is that the East \nis at war with the West, that this is a fight between the Muslim faith \nand the Christian faith.\n  Well, that first narrative is not as available to them as it used to \nbe because the people who are thinking of signing up for ISIS don't \nhave to read too deep in the news to know that the so-called caliphate \nis shrinking, not growing. It doesn't look so inevitable that ISIS is \ngoing to control big portions of the Middle East for the long term. \nLooks like the gig might be up for them, so they are now more than ever \nrelying on the second narrative--that this is a much broader war \nbetween the East and the West, and so lone wolf attackers in places \nsuch as Paris or Brussels or Orlando or San Bernardino become much more \nimportant to their continued international growth. So it is not without \ncoincidence that terrorist groups have made it very clear to potential \nconverts in the United States that a firearm works just as well as a \nsuicide bomb. They took credit very quickly for this attack, and they \nare going to be hoping there are others who will go to a store and buy \na powerful assault weapon and turn it on Americans. It is our duty to \ndo everything possible to make sure that doesn't happen.\n  It isn't an either/or proposition. It is not fight them there or \nfight them here. It is not focus on terrorism or focus on guns. It is \nboth. It is the need to continue to support the momentum that exists on \nthe ground in the Middle East to defeat ISIS and defeat them for good \nand to harden our defenses here in the United States to make sure these \npotential lone wolf attackers can't get access to an assault weapon.\n  Think about this statistic today. We know who is on the list of those \nwho are being watched as potential terrorists, and we can match that \nagainst who has requested to buy a weapon, and the statistics are \npretty stunning. Individuals on the consolidated terrorist watch list \ncleared a background check when seeking to obtain a gun in 91 percent \nof the attempted transactions between 2004 and 2014. That is a total of \n2,043 successful transactions out of 2,233. There are 2,000 people, \nover the course of 10 years, who are on the terrorist watch list and \nwho walked into a gun store and bought a weapon. Now, those are only \nthe ones we know about, because 40 percent of gun sales happen outside \nof gun stores. So there are likely another 1,000 to 2,000 people on the \nterrorist watch list who got guns through other mechanisms.\n  If we are serious about taking on terrorism, then we have to beat \nthese guys where they live in the Middle East, and we have to support \nthe administration's efforts to do that and supplement them, but we \nalso have to make sure these potential mass shooters don't get their \nhands on powerful weapons, especially when we know they have \nconnections to terrorist sources. In order to do that, we have to do \nboth. We have to put those people who are on the terrorist watch list \non the list of those who are prohibited from buying weapons, and we \nalso have to make sure that wherever that person is going to buy a \nweapon, they are checked to make sure they aren't a terrorist.\n  Mr. President, I don't know how long I will last here, but I hope I \nwill be able to give time to our leadership to come together and try to \nfind a path forward on legislation that will make this country safer \nand will acknowledge that our gun laws are part of the story--not the \nwhole story but part of the story--as to why this mass slaughter \ncontinues in this country. I live every single day with the memory of \nSandy Hook. I know this is inconvenient for the leadership and for \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. I get that. Most of the time \naround here, I am a team player, but I have had it. I have had enough, \nand I just couldn't bring myself to come back to the Senate this week \nand pretend like this is just business as usual. We have to do \nsomething. We have to find a way to come together.\n  I don't know how long this will take, but I am going to stand here \nand continue to hold the floor while we give time for our colleagues to \ntry to figure out a path forward to recognize that without changes in \nthis Nation's gun\n\n[[Page S3899]]\n\nlaws supported by the vast majority of Americans, the slaughter will \ncontinue.\n  I see my colleague from Connecticut rising. I will yield to my \ncolleague from Connecticut for a question without losing my right to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I have a question which I will preface \nwith the context of that question. First, I thank him for his \nleadership.\n  We have worked together as a team on this issue of gun violence \nprevention and the fight against terrorism abroad and at home, and I \nthank our other colleagues who will be part of this effort. It is very \nmuch a team effort that we bring to the floor today, involving our \nfriend and distinguished colleague from New Jersey, Senator Booker; \nSenator Feinstein, who has worked so hard on this legislation before we \narrived here; our colleague Senator Durbin, who is with us now; and \nSenator Schumer. So many of us feel so deeply.\n  I think for Senator Murphy and myself, the deeply emotional \nexperience of Orlando evokes the images and sounds and sights of \nNewtown on that tragic day when both of us were there and witnessed the \naftermath of 20 beautiful children and sixth grade educators gunned \ndown senselessly and needlessly in an act of unimaginable and \nunspeakable horror.\n  This effort is more than about just words. This Chamber is filled \nwith words. Rhetoric is the business of the floor of the Chamber. We \nare here today to seek action, and action has been too long delayed on \nbanning gun violence, the kinds of acts of hatred and terror that \nhappened in Orlando. Actions speak louder than words, and the Nation \ndeserves action. Ninety percent of the American people want sensible, \ncommonsense measures like background checks to be adopted by the \nSenate.\n  There is no question that we are learning more in shock and horror \nabout the details of Orlando. It seems to have involved potentially \ninsidious bigotry and hatred, a pernicious, extremist ideology, perhaps \ninspired by ISIS and others abroad, as well as very likely mental \nillness of some kind. But we know it was an act of terror and hatred \nthat can be prevented by the kinds of measures we are seeking today, \nspecific measures preventing anybody who is too dangerous to fly in a \ncommercial plane from buying a gun--no flying, no gun. Someone who is \ndeemed to be a terrorist or deserving to be on the terrorist watch list \nshould also be deemed too dangerous to purchase the kinds of weapons \nthis individual was able to purchase.\n  We need to strengthen the FBI because its investigative authority, in \neffect--perhaps not legally but in effect--would have been strengthened \nby this kind of measure, enabling anybody too dangerous to fly to also \nbe stopped from buying a gun. This individual could have been stopped--\nnot with any certainty, but at least the possibility is realistically \nthere--and its investigations might have been continued and pursued had \nthat law been in effect. Background checks are a means to enforce \nexisting law and prevent categories of people already deemed too \ndangerous to buy guns--convicted felons or drug addicts or others in \nthose categories adopted literally decades ago with the full support of \nthe opponents of background checks who may be in opposition now. These \nmeasures complement each other.\n  We know we must fight terrorism abroad. We are at war against ISIS. \nWe must pursue that war effectively, aggressively, and relentlessly. We \nmust fight the homegrown terrorists who are either inspired or \nsupported by ISIS, the lookalikes and soundalikes who claim allegiance \nto ISIS, whether they are supported or inspired, and for whom ISIS may \nclaim responsibility.\n  The defenses must be hardened at home. That is part of what we are \nseeking to do here, just as we fight abroad against terrorism that \nwould reach our shores and threaten our security.\n  Those measures must involve some military action, and that military \naction includes intercepting intelligence and finances, air \nsuperiority, and air aid for our allies on the ground, without \ncommitting massive numbers of U.S. troops to that effort. That war must \nbe pursued even as we pursue the war against terror and hatred here at \nhome.\n  But hardening our defenses requires that kind of action. So as a body \nwe must commit to stop the terrorist gap from continuing to threaten \nour security at home, as well as implementing universal background \nchecks that will keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. We owe \nit not only to the memory of the children and educators at Sandy Hook \nand to the countless innocent people who have perished since in the \nmass shootings that so preoccupy our attention but also the daily \nshootings--30,000 of them every year. In downtown Hartford and around \nConnecticut, no place is immune. No one is safe so long as there is \nthis threat.\n  These measures are modest, and they should be followed by others, \nsuch as a repeal of PLCAA, the protection against domestic violence for \nvictims, and the kind of measure I have offered, the Lori Jackson Act. \nThe repeal of PLCAA, which my colleague from Connecticut and I have \nchampioned, would repeal immunity that is unique to the gun industry. A \nban on illegal trafficking and straw purchases, mental health issues, \nand school safety steps are measures that must be pursued as part of a \nstrategy to combat gun violence and terrorism, whether it is inspired \nby ISIS or an organization abroad or homegrown here. These measures are \ncomplementary, and they must be pursued together.\n  We have lived too long, and I have worked literally for decades since \nI first supported a ban on assault weapons in Connecticut in the early \n1980s and then defended it in court after it was adopted. These \nmeasures of protection will require steps against those kinds of \nassault weapons that are truly weapons of destruction, designed to kill \nand maim human beings as quickly as possible and as many people as \npossible.\n  Those assault weapons, whether they were involved in Orlando or not \nor in any of those other examples, such as Aurora, Virginia Tech, and \nSandy Hook, clearly presented threats and were implements of \ndestruction there. We must take action. We must come together. We must \nunify as a nation to recognize the common threat rather than divide \nourselves with the kind of demagogy that has been all too common in the \nwake of these tragedies.\n  So I ask my colleague a question, and I look forward to continuing to \nask questions and working with him as part of this team today to \ncontinue the pressure that we feel must be brought to bear at this \nmoment of national crisis, when the conscience of the nation can be \nevoked, when we all owe it to ourselves to search our consciences and \nconvictions, look at ourselves in the mirror, and look the Nation in \nthe eye and say: We must act. We cannot allow this moment in our \nhistory to pass without action.\n  I ask my good friend and colleague, Senator Murphy, if he can \nunderstand why this body has so long refused to recognize the will of \nthe Nation and why for so long the Senate has been, in effect, \ncomplicit by its inaction in these kinds of killings--30,000 a year.\n  What about the influence of the gun lobby has made it so powerful in \nexerting this hold over the Congress and many of our State legislators, \nand what can we do to address this public health crisis? It is more \nthan just an epidemic; it is a public health crisis, a scourge of gun \nviolence that we must counter.\n  If 30,000 people died as a result of Ebola or Zika or some other \ndisease, the Nation would be rightly outraged. There would be drastic \nand immediate action. Why is there not for this public health crisis \nand this health epidemic that is not only threatening but is deadly to \nour Nation?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank my colleague for the question, and I want to \nreiterate the nature of our partnership that he underscored.\n  He and I were there together in Newtown in that firehouse hours after \nthat shooting, and we have spent probably hundreds of hours with the \nfamilies. Since then, we have probably spent hundreds of hours together \non this floor arguing as a team for changes in our laws.\n  I am so grateful to my friend Senator Blumenthal for being part of \nthis effort today. He is right in stating that long before I was, shall \nwe say, a convert on this issue myself in the days and weeks following \nSandy Hook, it was Senator Blumenthal as our attorney general and then \nas our Senator\n\n[[Page S3900]]\n\nwho has been fighting this fight for years.\n  Connecticut has some of the strongest laws keeping guns out of the \nhands of criminals in the Nation, and it is not a coincidence that our \ngun homicide rate is one of the lowest.\n  I will just say this to answer the Senator's question. I know my \ncolleague from New Jersey is rising as well. The United States is \nunique. We have written into our Constitution language about the \nintersection of private individuals and firearms. So we have to take \nseriously the words that are in that Second Amendment. But even in the \ncontroversial Supreme Court case, which overturns decades of precedent \nand held that there was, indeed, in the Constitution an individual \nright to own a firearm, the author of that decision, Justice Scalia \nsaid definitively that it is not an absolute right and that, yes, the \nmajority of that Court was holding that there is an individual right to \na firearm, but there is not an individual right to any firearm under \nany conditions at any time that you want it.\n  So I think part of the problem for my colleague from Connecticut is \nthat the gun lobby has managed to convince many members of the public \nthat the Second Amendment is unconditional, when it is not. It allows \nfor reasonable limitations on the right to own a weapon.\n  What we know is that in States that have imposed those reasonable \nlimitations, there are less gun crimes. There are less homicides. There \nis no truth to this mythology that the only way to stop a bad guy with \na gun is to have a good guy with a gun. There is no truth to the \nmythology that if there are more guns in a community, there is less gun \nhomicides. It is the exact opposite.\n  I think the gun lobby has been able to convince not just colleagues \nbut many of our fellow Americans that the Second Amendment is absolute \nin its terms. It isn't.\n  I think they have also been successful in perpetuating this mythology \nthat good guys with guns stop bad guys with guns, when, in fact, most \nof the time when you have a gun in your home, it is going to be used to \nkill you and not used to kill an intruder.\n  I don't know if the Senator has another question. But if he does, I \nyield to the Senator without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I need to follow up with an additional question, and \nthen my colleague from New Jersey is on the floor to ask a question.\n  On the issue of Second Amendment rights, which Senator Murphy has \njust pointed out so well, that is the law of the land. There is a \nSecond Amendment right for law-abiding people to buy and possess \nfirearms. But is it not true that in these measures, we are talking \nabout people who are dangerous and who are recognized to be dangerous? \nThat is why they are on the list. And there is also a right on their \npart to remove their names from that list if there is an error or a \nmistake of fact that has caused them to be on that list without good \nreason. So these measures that bring us to the floor today acknowledge \nand recognize the importance of that Second Amendment right, and the \npotential impact of our opponents in their arguments against it--saying \nthat there is a lack of due process and that the people will be denied \nthat Second Amendment right--is really mistaken. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. MURPHY. That is true. I thank the Senator for making that \npatently clear.\n  What we are suggesting here is that the way we can come together in \nthis body is around the simple premise that individuals with serious \ncriminal records, individuals who have been deemed mentally incompetent \nor incapable, and people on the terrorist watch list shouldn't be able \nto buy firearms. That is it. That is what we are talking about here \ntoday and to build out that system in an effective way that is as \nfoolproof as possible.\n  That has nothing to do with the limitation on an individual's Second \nAmendment right. If someone wants to go buy a firearm, they are not a \nsuspected terrorist, they do not have a serious criminal record, and \nthey have not been judged or deemed by a judge to be mentally incapable \nof making their own decisions, then there is nothing in what we are \nproposing in this body to come together on that would restrict that.\n  I yield to my friend, the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Booker, for a \nquestion, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I thank the Senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy, and \nthe senior Senator from Connecticut as well.\n  I do want to echo his spirit and the deference he gave to Senator \nBarbara Mikulski and Senator Shelby. Both of these two Senators are \npeople I respect a tremendous amount. In fact, I would go beyond that \nfor Senator Shelby and Senator Mikulski because I have deep affection \nfor them. They are great, strong legislators, and they have produced \nlegislation that is important to this country. I have a reverence for \ntheir work, the attention to detail, and the focus they have provided \npreparing legislation to move forward.\n  I asked for indulgence from them to understand why I stand on the \nfloor today preparing to ask a question to Senator Murphy. Last night, \nSenator Murphy and I talked about the tragedy of what happened in \nFlorida. It was painful to both of us because we knew this was not in \nany way an anomaly. This was something happening with terrible, savage \nroutine. In this Nation we are seeing mass killing after mass killing \nafter mass killing after mass killing.\n  We both understood, with other colleagues, that right now our Nation \nstands at a point of vulnerability to those who seek to do us harm, \nthose who seek to inflict terror, those who seek to inflict grievous \nbodily harm, those who seek to kill Americans, and they have the \nability to exploit loopholes in order to have access to weapons.\n  So I stand on the floor today in preparation to ask a question to \nSenator Murphy, wanting to say that the motivation for his presence on \nthe floor right now is that we just cannot go on with business as usual \nin this body at a time where there is such continued, grievous threat \nand vulnerability to our country, where you see again and again mass \nshooting after mass shooting.\n  There is a saying that the only thing necessary for evil to be \ntriumphant is for good people to do nothing. I am grateful to Senator \nMurphy for his conviction in our conversations yesterday and into the \nnight that we could not just go along with business as usual; that we \nhave had enough; that we have to push this body to come to some \nconsensus on that which the overwhelming majority of Americans, indeed, \nthe overwhelming majority of gun owners in this country and, indeed, \nthe overwhelming majority of NRA members in this country believe; that \nwe should put commonsense safety measures in place to protect against \nterrorists obtaining firearms to inflict the kind of carnage we have \nseen too often in this country and in others. Please understand, while \nmany people imagine that when terrorists act, they act with bombs, more \nand more across the globe and across the United States they are acting \nwith assault weapons and firearms.\n  We are here today to say: Enough. I have cleared my entire day. This \nwill not be business as usual. I cleared my evening events so that I \ncould stay on this floor and support Senator Murphy as he pushes this \nbody to come to some consensus, in the way the country has already \ndone, to find commonsense, practical ways we can protect this Nation \nfrom terrorism.\n  The Constitution of this country begins with the understanding that \nthe primary responsibility of this Nation is about the common defense. \nIt says in our preamble that ``We the People of the United States, in \nOrder to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic \nTranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general \nWelfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our \nPosterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United \nStates of America.'' Written there in plain English, the Constitution \nlaid out the very form of government in which this body stands and put \nin clear English at the beginning that we are to focus on domestic \ntranquility, the common defense, the general welfare. So we cannot go \non with business as usual in this body. We must stand because this \nviolence in our country will continue unless we take measures, \ncommonsense\n\n[[Page S3901]]\n\nmeasures, to restrict these firearms from going to known or suspected \nterrorists.\n  I believe this is a day that should not be business as usual. I \nbelieve this should be a day that this body comes together as it has \nbefore, to put forth commonsense safety measures to prevent terrorism. \nI want to paraphrase one of our great leaders, Martin Luther King, who \nsaid: What we will have to repent for in this day and age is not just \nthe vitriolic words and violent actions of the bad people but the \nappalling silence and inaction of the good people.\n  That is why I stand now to ask a question of the Senator. That is why \nI will stay on this floor with my colleague from Connecticut and \nsupport him in this effort to move this body into putting forth the \ncommonsense steps we should take to prevent weapons from getting into \nthe hands of our enemies, from getting into the hands of terrorists, \nfrom getting into the hands of people who seek to wreak the kind of \ncarnage that our Nation tragically witnessed this past weekend.\n  The Senator from Connecticut, my colleague and friend, went through \nthe unforgettable lists of mass shootings--Newtown, 20 schoolchildren \nand 6 employees killed; Santa Monica, 5 Americans killed; Washington, \nDC, at the naval yard, 12 people killed; Fort Hood, 3 people killed; \nIsla Vista, CA, 6 people killed; Marysville, WA, 4 people killed in a \nhigh school cafeteria; Charleston, SC, 9 people at a church killed; \nChattanooga, TN, at a military recruiting office, 4 marines and a naval \npetty officer killed; Roseburg, OR, 10 people killed at a local \ncommunity college; Colorado Springs, CO, 3 people killed at a Planned \nParenthood clinic; San Bernardino, CA, in an act of terrorism, 14 \npeople killed; Orlando, this past weekend--this past Saturday night--49 \ninnocent people murdered, killed.\n  I rise to ask Senator Murphy a question because there is a question \non the hearts and minds of the majority of the people of our Nation. \nThey are asking the question: How long will this go on? They are asking \nthe question: How can we be a nation so mighty and great, yet hold this \ndistinction on the planet Earth where these kinds of mass killings go \non at a rate, at a level nowhere else seen on the planet Earth? It is \nhere in this country--founded upon the idea that we formed this \ngovernment for our common defense, that we formed this government to \nensure domestic tranquility, that we formed this government based on \nthe idea that we can make for a safer, stronger, and more prosperous \nland--that question is being asked from coast to coast, from north to \nsouth.\n  Senator Murphy and I talked yesterday about coming to the floor today \nand not letting business as usual happen. We talked with our other \ncolleagues who will come to this floor today and who all have in their \nhearts that word: Enough. Enough. Enough. What we are seeking is not \nradical. What we are seeking is not something that is partisan. What we \nare seeking is common sense and is supported by the overwhelming \nmajority of this Nation. In study after study, poll after poll, survey \nafter survey of gun owners, of people who have weapons and who take to \nheart their Second Amendment rights--when you ask them ``What should we \ndo? Do you support closing the terrorist loophole, creating practical, \ncommonsense bars for people who are suspected of terrorism from buying \na gun,'' 82 percent of gun owners say ``Yes, we should do that.'' They \nsay: Enough.\n  Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, humbly, I raise a point of order about \nwhether there is a question. I would like to ask a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Shelby). The Senator from Connecticut may \nyield for a question only without losing his rights.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I have a question, but I think I can have \na preamble to my question to set the context of the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ask the question through the Chair.\n  Mr. BOOKER. The question I would like to ask is, Given the fact that \nthe overwhelming majority of Americans support commonsense gun \nlegislation, given the fact that 82 percent of gun owners support \nclosing the terrorist loophole, and given the fact that 75 percent of \nNRA members support closing the terrorist loophole, why does the \nSenator from Connecticut feel this body is not moving on commonsense \nlegislation that will protect our Nation, that will defend us against \nterrorists, and that will prevent tragedies such as the one that \nhappened in Orlando?\n  I direct my question to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank my colleague for his question. I think this is a \nquestion people throughout this country are asking today: Why are these \nmeasures we are asking for consensus on today so controversial in the \nSenate when they are not controversial in the American public?\n  My colleague Senator Booker talked about the statistics. It is not \njust that 90 percent of the American public supports expanded \nbackground checks to make sure people aren't criminals when buying \nguns; it is that the majority of gun owners support expanded background \nchecks. It is Democrats who support it. It is Republicans who support \nit.\n  Similarly, on the issue at hand today, which is making sure potential \nterrorists don't obtain weapons, a similar majority of the American \npublic supports that as well. There is less polling on that question, \nbut suggestions are that 75 to 80 percent of Americans support the idea \nthat if you are on the terrorist watch list, if you are on the \nconsolidated list, then you shouldn't be able to obtain a weapon.\n  The question of my colleague is, Why can we not get consensus here? I \nguess, at some level, it is tough for me to answer that because it \nseems so clear to me that I am willing to vote for those measures. I am \nwilling to cosponsor them. I am willing to come to the floor and speak \nin support of them. In many ways, it is a question for those who are \nblocking these measures from coming forward. As I said before, I \nbelieve much of it is rooted in what I believe is a misunderstanding of \nthe Second Amendment. It is not an absolute right; it comes with \nresponsibilities and conditions. I think a lot of it is a \nmisunderstanding about the data that suggests--State by State, \ncommunity by community--if you have tougher gun laws that keep guns out \nof the hands of criminals or prevent these powerful military-style \nassault weapons from flowing through your streets, you are going to \nhave less level of gun homicide.\n  So part of our effort--and part of my belief--is to come to the floor \ntoday to continually reinforce what the real story is about the nature \nof the underlying right and about what the data tells us, but also, \nSenator Booker, about what we know to be the threat to this country. \nResearch shows that on U.S. soil, people who are seeking to commit acts \nof terror rely almost exclusively on guns. And when guns are used in \npotential acts of terror, they are vastly more likely to result in \ncasualties--when guns are used.\n  Now, this isn't me talking. This is an analysis of domestic terror \nattacks in the United States by Professor Louis Klarevas of the \nUniversity of Massachusetts. He showed that since September 11, 2001, \n95 percent of the associated deaths connected with terrorist attacks--\nwith terrorism--were committed with guns.\n  According to a project run by the Department of Homeland Security's \nCenter for Excellence at the University of Maryland--something called \nthe Global Terrorism Database, which is a government database run by \nthe Department of Homeland Security--terrorist attacks in the United \nStates are 10 times more likely to result in fatalities when they \ninvolve guns than when they do not. Between 1970 and 2014, nonfirearm \nterrorist attacks resulted in deaths 4 percent of the time, whereas 40 \npercent of the attacks involving firearms resulted in deaths.\n  If you really want to get down to the chilling bone here, Mr. \nPresident, listen to the words of one of the most notorious Al Qaeda \noperatives--actually an American who is now deceased--whose name is \nAdam Gadahn. He released a video in 2011. In it he said:\n\n       In the West, you've got a lot at your disposal. Let's take \n     America for example. America is absolutely awash with easily \n     obtainable firearms. You can go down to a gun show at the \n     local convention center and come away with a fully automatic \n     assault rifle without a background check and most likely \n     without having to show an identification card. So what are \n     you waiting for?\n\n\n[[Page S3902]]\n\n\n  Even if his facts weren't 100 percent correct on whether you can get \na fully automatic weapon at a gun show, this is clearly a message being \nsent by some of the most notorious operatives and recruiters within the \nAl Qaeda and ISIS network: Go get a gun. They are easily obtainable. Do \nas much damage as possible.\n  So to answer Senator Booker's question, I guess I don't want to sit \nhere and impute malevolent motives or intentions or the interference of \ninterest groups on my colleagues. I just have to believe that we have \nthe facts wrong and that we are maybe misreading our constituents. I \nknow people who listen to the NRA are very vocal. I know they call in \nto all of our offices frequently and express their opinions very \nstrongly. I will admit that the majority of Americans--and this \nmajority exists in every single State--who support expanded background \nchecks, support keeping terrorists off the watch list, they are maybe \nnot as passionate in their views. So it may also be that there is a \nmisread coming on where the American public exists on this question. I \nthink there are more and more Americans who are rising up and choosing \nto make this a priority when they come to the polling places and when \nthey talk to us.\n  To Senator Booker, I think this is just about trying to do our best \nto correct the record--as the Senator said, doing our best to explain \nthat what we are asking for is not revolutionary. It is not radical. It \nis simply commonsense. If we lay it out in plain facts, most of the \npeople we represent would expect that we would have already taken care \nof this. If we told them we have not yet put individuals who are on the \nterrorist watch list on those that are prohibited from buying guns, I \nthink they would be very surprised. If we told them that the majority \nof gun sales happen without background checks, I think they would \nprobably be surprised by that. I think they expect us to act on this.\n  I know the Senator from Nebraska is looking to ask a question. I \nwould be happy to yield to the Senator from Nebraska for a question \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SASSE. I thank the Senator from Connecticut.\n  I am happy to defer to the assistant Democratic leader if he has a \nquestion first.\n  I thank the junior Senator from Connecticut for helping lead us into \nan important discussion. I do have a genuine question.\n  In your colloquy with the senior Senator from Connecticut, I think \nthe question was asked that there is due process for I think what the \nSenator has been calling the terrorist watch list. I would just ask if \nthe Senator can explain to me what the terrorist watch list is. I am \nfamiliar with the terrorist screening database. There is a series of \nlists that fall from the database, but I don't think there is any such \nthing as the ``terrorist watch list,'' and I certainly don't understand \nwhat due process rights would apply to this list. If the Senator could \nhelp clarify that, that would help me. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his question.\n  There is something called the consolidated watch list, which is an \namalgam of a number of different databases. As the Senator understands, \none of them is the no-fly list. The legislation Senator Feinstein has \npropounded and will propound refers to those consolidated lists and \nthen provides the ability for an individual to contest their placement \non those lists, to be able to be notified why they were prohibited from \nbuying a gun and to be able to contest that with either the agency that \nput them on that list or with the NICS database itself. I take \nseriously this issue of due process. As we know, there are certainly \npeople who are on that list who should not be--as, frankly, there are \npeople today on the list of those prohibited from buying guns who \nshould not be. There are mistakes made on the NICS list today--names \nthat get put on there that shouldn't be put on, people who may have \nbeen wrongfully convicted.\n  I would agree with the gentleman that it is important that the \nlegislation we come to agreement on specifically refers to the set of \nlists--which I would suggest mirror the consolidated database that is \nmaintained by Federal law enforcement--and have a very explicit right \nto get off that list. I don't think it is impossible that we can come \ntogether on that in very short order.\n  I yield to the Senator from Illinois for a question without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Connecticut will yield for a \nquestion--first, let me say at the outset I thank him for his \nleadership. I am happy to join with this willful band who feels as he \ndoes; that this is an issue long overdue and that the American people \nhave asked us over and over again: When is Congress going to do \nsomething about these mass shootings and the carnage which has taken \nplace?\n  I would like to ask a specific question, though, about an element \nhere. We have talked about terrorism, those who may be on a terrorism \nwatch list or some version of it, which Senator Feinstein will address \nin her amendment, but there is a second part to this which is equally, \nif not more, important, from my perspective. We define mass murder as \nthose that involve more than four victims, but many of us are living \nand representing communities where there is massive murder taking place \nover long periods of time. Maybe not so many deaths in one particular \nincident but over a long period of time. Yesterday, our colleague from \nNew Jersey eloquently explained to us, in our private caucus luncheon, \nabout the carnage in his hometown that has taken place in New Jersey \nfor a long period of time.\n  My question to the Senator from Connecticut goes to a city which I am \nhonored to represent, the city of Chicago. There were 488 homicides in \nChicago in 2015. The vast majority of those were shootings. Chicago's \n488 murders were the highest total number of any U.S. city last year. \nIn New York, there were only--only--339 in comparison, and in Los \nAngeles, 280, cities much larger than Chicago with much smaller numbers \nof homicides.\n  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has gone to \nthe areas of Chicago where we have the most intense gunfire and \nkillings taking place on a regular basis. Here is what they told me in \n2015: Forty percent of the crime guns confiscated after these homicides \nand killings came from gun shows in Northern Indiana, just across the \nborder from Chicago.\n  The reason I raise this question is, I believe the second part of \nthis suggested approach--terrorists, the loophole, closing that once \nand for all, and, secondly, closing the loopholes when it comes to \nbackground checks--would include and envision putting an end to what we \nsee happening in Chicago, where in the most dangerous neighborhoods 40 \npercent of these crime guns are crammed into the trunks of cars at gun \nshows in Northern Indiana, with no background checks. Then, the people \nwho buy them head for the city, to the streets of Chicago, to sell \nthem, usually to teenagers who then spray their bullets at night in \ngang warfare and other activity.\n  My question to the Senator from Connecticut--there are so many other \naspects we need to address--straw purchasing is one, assault weapons is \nanother--but what the Senator is trying to focus on is not just the \nhorrible tragedy that occurred in Orlando but to really expand our \nreach in terms of addressing new legislation when it comes to closing \nthe loopholes in the law--loopholes which allow gun show sales without \nbackground checks and sales over the Internet without background \nchecks. I would ask the Senator from Connecticut the rationale behind \nincluding that provision.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator. The Senator from Illinois, like \nSenator Blumenthal, has been a leader and a hero on this issue since \nbefore I got to the Senate, and he is exactly right. The state of this \nNation is not just this repeated story line of mass shooting after mass \nshooting, it is the fact that even on days when there is not a mass \nshooting, there is the equivalent of a mass shooting happening in \ncities like Chicago, Baltimore, or New Orleans every single day. The \nnumbers over Memorial Day weekend over Chicago are absolutely chilling.\n  Think about living in a city in which, over the course of what should \nbe a celebratory weekend, there are 60-some odd incidents of gunfire, \nand that is just gunfire that hits people. So it is\n\n[[Page S3903]]\n\ncritical we acknowledge that this epidemic that we are often focused on \nbecause of these mass shootings is an epidemic that exists every single \nday in this country.\n  Senator Durbin is right that part of the reason we are asking that \nexpanded background checks be part of this agreement that we come to \nover the course of today is because while we are on the bill that funds \nthe Justice Department, while we are debating the bill that funds, in \npart, the background checks system, let's make sure it works. As the \nSenator knows, the data is clear: In jurisdictions that have near-\nuniversal background checks, there are less gun deaths--period, stop. \nIn jurisdictions that decide they are going to apply background checks \nto as many sales as they can--let's be honest, you often can't get \nevery sale, but you can certainly say, if you are selling guns online \nthrough advertisement or you are selling guns at a gun show that is \norganized and marketed, that those sales should be subject to a \nbackground check. In States that do that, they have lower rates of gun \ncrimes. As the Senator knows so painfully--because Chicago sits right \nat the intersection of other jurisdictions--States can't do this by \nthemselves. Even if a State decides to expand out the forums in which a \ngun sale is subject to a background check, if the other State next-\ndoor--let's say Indiana--has a lower standard, then your law is \nvirtually meaningless. Of course, that is the story line in Chicago. \nThe story line in Chicago is a handful of gun dealers--irresponsible \ngun dealers across the State line--selling guns to individuals who then \ntake them into Chicago.\n  This is certainly a debate brought on by another mass shooting, and \nwe certainly have an obligation to make sure the terrorists don't \nobtain guns, but the Senator is right that this ultimately has to be an \nissue of doing something about our urban gun violence as well.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I yield to the Senator from Connecticut for a question \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I thank the Senator for yielding for a question only. \nI want to ask more specifically about a point he made so well at the \nvery beginning of this conversation; that the fight against gun \nviolence and extremism abroad and at home is not an either/or, that we \nneed to fight the violent extremism abroad, whether it is called \njihadism or radical Islam or violent extremists, whatever label we give \nit. This fight is about that battle and about enlisting our allies \nabroad in supporting us in that battle and combating the homegrown \nterrorists, the extremists who are supportive or inspired by ISIS or \nothers abroad. We do not have an either/or situation here, as the \nSenator said so well. They are complementary.\n  My question to my colleague from Connecticut is whether these kinds \nof measures that we are seeking to advance on the floor today also \nempower and enable a stronger alliance with our allies abroad that are \njoining us in this fight.\n  I ask that question of him because he as a member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, as I am a member of the Armed Services Committee, \nis aware of the importance of acting with our allies abroad. These \nmeasures, do they not, enable us to form and enlist and advance those \nalliances?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for the question because of course \nthis is a global fight against terrorism. This is not a battle that can \nbe waged by one country and one country alone. The Senator is right \nthat we are right now calling on our allies in Europe to take steps \nthat would better protect all of us from these terrorist plotters. For \ninstance, we have real concerns about the degree to which European \nnations are sharing data about potential terrorist plotters. Right now, \nlaw enforcement and terrorism surveillance in Europe is largely done on \na country-by-country basis. Even within some countries, it is heavily \nsiloed. In Brussels itself, I think by last count, there were six \ndifferent police departments that didn't even communicate with each \nother. So there is a big problem in Europe about agencies not being \nable to talk to each other, and we are pressing Europe and Europeans to \nget more serious about both tracking terrorists throughout that \ncontinent and then sharing information with us.\n\n  How is that relevant to the Senator's question? It is very hard for \nus to preach to the Europeans that they should get more serious about \ntracking terrorists if we have big holes in our databases as well, and \nwe do today. From the information that is out there, we know that in \nOrlando, this individual was on a watch list. He came off of it. \nBecause of the way in which the network of lists and notifications work \ntoday, the FBI was not notified when he went to buy a gun.\n  We can have a debate as to whether he should have been prohibited \nfrom buying a gun if he was no longer on those lists, but it probably \nmakes sense that the FBI should at least be notified so they can \nperhaps do some followup. As long as we have these gaps in our laws \nrelated to access to firearms for potential terrorists, then I think it \nis hard for us to tell the Europeans to do better. As the Senator \nknows, we also want to be able to connect what they know with what we \nknow.\n  There are American citizens who travel to other countries, and they \nmay be radicalized in part in connection with those visits. We want to \nbe able to get that information to the extent that a foreign country \nknows about the activities of American citizens when they travel abroad \nso that it is incorporated into our databases, incorporated into the \nlist of people we are concerned about getting access to a weapon.\n  I yield to the Senator from New Jersey for a question without losing \nmy right to the floor.\n  (Mr. SASSE assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BOOKER. Senator Murphy, I am grateful for your yielding for a \nquestion. I think I want to drill deeper down on that point because I \nam not sure if Americans understand that there is a lot of \nbipartisanship when it comes to CVE, countering violent extremism. I am \nvery proud to serve on the Homeland Security Committee. I have worked \nwith members on the other side of the aisle to do a lot of commonsense \nthings to try to counter violent extremism here at home. Those involve \nefforts of coordination, as Senator Murphy was talking about, investing \nresources in trying to counter violent extremist efforts here at home.\n  There is a tremendous bipartisan effort that has gone on in this \ncountry since 9/11 in trying to take down silos of information--\nsharing, cooperating, coordinating, and investing resources in many \nways to keep us safer as a nation. We should all be very proud of that. \nBut it is clear--especially from what should be stunning to people who \ndon't know this and from the information you read--that the very \nenemies we are talking about--terrorist organizations that now have \nbecome common knowledge in this country, because people know Al Qaeda, \nthey know ISIS, and folks are focused on that--the very enemies we are \nfighting against are aware of the big loophole that exists in this \nNation--that someone who is a suspected terrorist, who has a terrorist \nintent, who is even known by the FBI, can come to our Nation or can be \na citizen of our Nation and go to a gun show and buy weapons.\n  I want to clarify what I said. That was not an accident. This could \nbe someone who is in our Nation as a citizen or it could be someone who \nhas come to our Nation through the Visa Waiver Program and could still \nexploit this loophole of buying weapons without a background check. So \nwe have actually enough sharing of information to go on that we \nactually can stop an individual from getting on a plane.\n  Think about this. We can take an action to stop someone from flying, \nbut we do not have the ability in this country right now to stop that \nknown individual from getting in a car and driving down 95 from New \nJersey and going to a gun show and buying weapons.\n  The data show that the GAO has found that between February of 2004 \nand December of 2014 there were at least 2,033 cases where a known \nsuspected terrorist tried to buy a firearm or even obtain it. We know \nthere are that many people trying to do this and that we have the \nability to stop those folks. So given the context of all the areas in \nwhich we are cooperating to stop terrorism and that there is this one \nblack hole where now the information isn't being shared for actions to \nstop folks from getting these weapons that can do such carnage, isn't \nthis a\n\n[[Page S3904]]\n\nglaring gap in our overall security procedures, policies, and \nstructures in our country?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator. It is a glaring loophole, and it is \nunclear why it has persisted. This idea of closing the loophole has \nbeen backed by both Democratic and Republican administrations, and I \nthink the Senator talked about how this has been a bipartisan \ncommitment. The George W. Bush Department of Justice supported the \nexact same bill that we are talking about today, in 2007. Attorney \nGeneral Holder, in response to a question from Senator Feinstein at a \n2009 Judiciary Committee hearing, said: I think that legislation was \ninitially proposed by the Bush administration. It was well conceived, \nand we will continue to support that.\n  Not so long ago, this was an issue that was conceived by a Republican \nadministration. It didn't seem to become controversial until gun \nlobbying organizations decided that it should be. We should remember \nthat about all the things we are discussing here, because we live in a \nworld today in which we think the issue of gun laws is the third rail \nof American politics. But all of the legislation that we are talking \nabout could not have passed if it wasn't for Republicans and Democrats \ncoming together, whether it be to support the existing background check \nsystem or to support the existing ban on assault weapons--plenty of \nRepublicans voted for that--or to conceive of this idea of terrorists \nbeing kept off the list.\n  Here is how it plays out in real time. Elton Simpson is the name of \nthe individual who opened fire on a Texas community center that was \nhosting an event displaying cartoons of the prophet Muhammad. I think \nwe all agree that was an act of terrorism that was perhaps as a result \nof the radicalization of this individual. He was reportedly on the U.S. \nno-fly list. One of the Boston marathon bombers, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was \nreportedly placed on two terrorist watch lists in 2011. He committed \nthat act with an explosive device, but he also killed a police officer \nwith a handgun. Orlando is the latest example of crimes being committed \nby those who were in and around this database.\n  The Senator from Nebraska asked the question earlier: How do we make \nsure that people aren't on there by mistake? Both parties will only \nsupport legislation that gives a practical means for individuals to \ngrieve the fact that they are prohibited from buying a gun when indeed \nthey should not be. I think at some level, we should accept that in \nvirtually every Federal database that exists of people who are \nineligible to buy a gun or people who are eligible to receive Medicare \nreimbursement, there are occasionally mistakes. But that does not stop \nus from trying to engage in collective action as a community to better \nprotect our Nation.\n  Let's get that list right. Let's give people the ability to get off \nit if they are on it wrongly. But let's accept that what we know is \nthat in 90 percent of the cases over that 10-year period where people \ntried to buy a gun and were on the terrorist watch list, they were able \nto buy it.\n  Let's be honest. This is only one element of what needs to be a \nbroader strategy to combat either the potential radicalization leading \nto violence of American citizens or this broader question of combating \ngun violence at-large that Senator Durbin brought up. But it is an \nimportant glaring hole that needs to be corrected.\n  I yield to my friend from Connecticut for a question without losing \nmy right to the floor.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Thank you to my friend and colleague from Connecticut \nfor yielding for a question and his holding the floor.\n  I want to follow a question that was asked by our colleague from New \nJersey. I have heard him speak so eloquently about the people in his \ncity of Newark, and, in fact, children dying in his arms as victims of \ngun violence. Those kinds of acts of violence are unpredictable.\n  The FBI was investigating the killer in the Orlando tragedy and knew \nof his potential dangerousness, but there are countless individuals who \ncommit these acts of murder. Thirty thousand deaths every year occur as \na result of gun violence. Many of them are unpredictable and perhaps \nunpreventable under current law, but they could be prevented with \nstronger laws.\n  So my question to my colleague from Connecticut is whether this \nmeasure will enhance the fact-finding and investigative powers of the \nFBI in seeking to stop gun violence where we know it may occur and--in \nfact, as much as I deeply respect the diligence and dedication of the \nFBI--whether additional resources combined with this kind of measure \nwill enhance their ability to stop these acts of hatred and terror such \nas we saw so tragically in Orlando.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Thank you, Senator Blumenthal, and I want to thank you \nfor your work on the Judiciary Committee for leading this fight to try \nto make sure that law enforcement has what it needs to protect this \ncountry.\n  Again, I spoke to this broader conversation about how you protect \nthis country from domestic terrorist attacks. I think there are a lot \nof people who want to drill it down to only one silo of conversation. \nAs I remarked at the beginning, some people want to make this just \nabout the fight in the Middle East. Some people want to make this just \nabout surveillance. Other people want to make this just about gun laws.\n  It is not any of those things. It is about a combination of efforts. \nSo we have to admit that this fight against ISIS and against Al Qaeda \nin the areas in which they have large amounts of control is an ongoing \nfight. That is not going to be concluded tomorrow or next week or the \nmonth after. We think we are making dramatic progress, but it is going \nto take us a while.\n  As I remarked at the outset, it also means that there is an inverse \nproportionality between our success in taking the fight to Al Qaeda and \nISIS inside theaters of war and their importance in attacking us here \nat home in the sense that they are going to need to take the fight to \nus here if they are having less success in repelling our efforts to \npush them back inside the Middle East.\n  That is where law enforcement comes in, Senator Blumenthal, and you \nare exactly right. Let's make it a priority to defeat ISIS. But let's \nadmit that for the time being, they are going to try to launch lone-\nwolf attacks here. What we know is they generally don't go through the \ntrouble of trying to coordinate these attacks ahead of time. So it \nmakes it much more difficult to stop. They are trying to find someone \nwho is on the fringes of society, who may be mentally ill or prone to \nradicalization and weaponize them. Sometimes it makes it difficult for \nlaw enforcement to find that needle in a haystack.\n  What we know is that in this case, they had found that needle in a \nhaystack. They had found him twice. Perhaps his inclusion permanently \non one of these lists wouldn't have done much good because it wouldn't \nhave prevented him from getting a firearm. There wasn't as much due \ndiligence done as should have been.\n  This clearly is an important tool of law enforcement, and we need to \ngive it to them. I hope--and I think Senator Mikulski talked about this \nin her opening comments--we can talk about giving broader resources to \nthe FBI and to law enforcement to do the job they need do. We ask them \nto do more and more, but we don't give them the resources that are \nnecessary. If we are going to give them additional responsibilities--\nkeeping a better monitored, consolidated database, having a process for \nindividuals to grieve their inclusion on it--then we have to make sure \nthey have the resources necessary.\n  To the Senator from New Jersey, I yield for a question without losing \nmy right to the floor.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Again, I appreciate this point that I want to keep coming \nback to, which is that we are--and both Republicans and Democrats talk \nabout--in a war with a determination to defeat our enemy. Yet our enemy \nhas spoken very clearly about exploiting the loopholes that exist in a \nway for those who are seeking to do terror to buy weapons. In other \nwords, as to someone who is suspected already by the FBI, suspected by \nthe American Government to have designs on the kind of terroristic act \nthat could take many Americans, as we saw this past weekend, we already \nknow who that person is, and our enemy has basically advertised the \nfact that it doesn't matter. If they were already suspected by the FBI \nand had been interviewed by\n\n[[Page S3905]]\n\nthem last year or 5 years ago, they explicitly said: Don't worry about \nthat because America--singling us out from European countries and \nothers that are terrorist targets--in particular has this loophole we \ncan exploit. Even though you have been suspected of terrorism and have \nbeen interviewed by the FBI, you can still find ways to easily obtain \nweapons by taking these measures, such as going to a gun show or \nordering online.\n\n  We just passed a Defense authorization bill that will allocate \nbillions and billions of dollars for our national defense. I don't mean \nto be over the top about this issue, but if our past enemies and past \nwars have specifically showed us what our vulnerabilities are and that \nthey are going to continue to exploit these vulnerabilities and \nliterally have ISIS-inspired individuals who have been interviewed by \nthe FBI carry out these horrific actions by using a loophole, as we saw \nthis past weekend, doesn't it make common sense to close that loophole \nwhen we are at war with folks who are inspiring individuals to take so \nmuch human life?\n  When we talk about closing the terrorist loophole, we need to be very \narticulate and make sure that it is done in a way that just has to do \nwith those people. As it stands now, the NICS system can potentially \ncheck to see if a person is on one of those aggregated watch lists. I \nwish to ask the Senator from Connecticut: Doesn't it make sense to have \nuniversal background checks in this context? That is what I would \nreally like to get at. If you have steps to stop terrorists from \nexploiting this loophole but it is not a universal stop, we are not \nsolving this problem. We are not really arresting it in the way that we \nshould.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for that question. \nThat is why it is so important to link those two pieces together. If \nyou really want to protect this country from terrorist attacks by a \nfirearm--as I stated before, that is the weapon of choice for those who \nwant to do harm to this country for political reasons--then you have to \nboth make sure those individuals are on the list of those prohibited \nfrom buying weapons and you have to make sure when you go and buy a \nweapon you intersect with that list.\n  This has been a long trend line, as both of my friends know. It used \nto be that almost everybody who bought a gun went into their local gun \nstore to purchase that weapon, and over the course of time, for a \nvariety of reasons, the means by which you bought a firearm has \ndiversified significantly. We now have lots of sales occurring online, \nas we do with almost every other commercial good, and there is this \nbuildout of gun shows, which are places where both licensed and \nnonlicensed dealers go to sell their guns in a very organized and \ncontrolled fashion. We have story upon story of individuals who have \ngone to buy guns in those gun stores in mass quantities, knowing that \nthey would not have to go through a background check and then selling \nthem on the black market. So someone who knows they are prohibited from \nbuying a gun decides not to buy a gun in a gun store; instead, they go \nbuy a number of weapons at a gun show, which is unregulated. Those \nindividuals who are not licensed gun dealers are able to sell their \nweapons without background checks at a gun show, and they can get as \nmany as they want. That is not a secret. I mean, you don't have to \nscratch the surface of America's gun law or debate this subject very \nhard to find out that there are easy ways to get guns without getting a \nbackground check. You can also go online. You can very easily buy a \nweapon on ARMSLIST without going through a background check.\n  We cannot adequately protect this country from terrorist attacks by \nfirearm unless you do both, and that is why those two are linked \ntogether. As the Senator also knows, let's not shy away from the fact \nthat the reason we are on the floor today is that this slaughter also \nhappens outside the realm of terrorist attacks. In fact, the majority--\n95-plus percent--of Americans who have been killed by guns were not \nkilled in a terrorist attack, but many of them were killed by guns sold \noutside the background check system.\n  This is a two for one. If there are objections on the Republican side \nto the provisions of the Manchin-Toomey legislation, I hope that over \nthe course of this afternoon and this evening we can come together on \nthose issues. If you pass some version of that legislation, which is \nsupported by 90 percent of the American public and the vast majority of \ngun owners, in conjunction with putting terrorists or would-be \nterrorists or suspected terrorists on that same list, then you have not \nonly protected our country from terrorist attacks, but you have also \naddressed this epidemic that we all live with on a regular basis, \nwhether it be in Newark, Bridgeport, or, as Senator Durbin talked \nabout, Chicago. The regularity of gun crime that is often associated \nwith weapons that were purchased outside of the background check system \nis not an inevitability that we have to accept. We can do something \nabout it by coming together today.\n\n  I think that is what my friend is getting at by linking together two \npolicies that have to be interdependent in order to protect ourselves \nfrom a terrorist attack, and it is also about this broader issue of \ntaking on crimes in our city.\n  I yield to the Senator from Connecticut for a question without losing \nmy right to the floor.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank Senator Murphy. I wish to draw \nout a point he was making by posing another question. There is no one-\nsize-fits-all fix to the problem of hatred and terrorist attacks in \nthis country that involve gun violence. The kind of attack that we saw \nin Orlando may have been motivated by an insidious bigotry that \ninvolves deep-seated hatred or pernicious extremist ideology inspired \nby ISIS or some enemy abroad or mental illness. The facts are \ndeveloping. We will know more, as the Senator from Connecticut knows. \nThe point is that the laws we now have enable our enemies to weaponize \nthe people in this country who may be prone to use assault weapons that \nare designed to kill as many people as possible and as quickly as \npossible. This idea of weaponizing our enemies or homegrown terrorists \nor people who can be inspired by the twisted insidious ideology that \nISIS spawns should really bring us to recognize that there is not only \na security threat abroad but one at home as well.\n  I ask my colleague, the Senator from Connecticut, whether people who \nare too dangerous to be permitted to board a plane should be in some \nway stopped from buying one of these guns that can be used--whatever \ntheir motive--to do the kind of destruction that we saw with such \nunspeakable horror in Orlando, Virginia Tech, Aurora, Columbine, and \nour own town of Newtown? We have met with these families in our State \nand in towns and cities across the country. We have heard their cries \nbeseeching us to do something. Is there more that we can do?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank my friend. Let me put it to the \nbody this way, through the Chair. This is also about sending a message \nto everyone in this country that we are serious about taking on this \nepidemic of gun violence, whether it is a terrorist attack or it is an \nattack by someone who is deeply mentally ill, such as the attack in \nNewtown, or the ordinary, everyday violence that is just epidemic in \nour cities. I think it is incredibly important for us to send a message \nthat we are serious about this and, frankly, not worry about whether we \nhave addressed every aspect of this debate and solved every problem at \nonce--not allowing the perfect to be the enemy of the good. I say that \nto my colleague, through the Chair, for two reasons. One is this notion \nI talked about earlier in which I really do worry that there is a quiet \nunintentional message of endorsement that is sent when we do nothing or \nall we do is talk. I believe that when there is not a collective \ncondemnation of policy change from what is supposedly the world's \ngreatest deliberative body, there are very quiet cues picked up by \npeople who are contemplating the unthinkable in their minds. This isn't \nintentional. I am not accusing anybody of being intentional in their \nendorsement, but I think when we don't act, there is a quiet signal \nbeing sent to those whose minds are becoming unhinged and who are \nthinking about doing something truly horrific. Since we have been \ntalking about this--since Sandy Hook--we haven't heard anything that \nwould suggest that the highest levels of government condemn it with any \nreal policy change.\n\n[[Page S3906]]\n\n  Second, this is more deeply personal, and I know both of my \ncolleagues on the floor today share this point of view. Almost every \none of us has had a conversation with a family member who has lost a \nson or daughter to gun violence. Too many of us have had that \ncollective conversation with families who have lost a loved one or have \nspoken to someone who lost a family member or their loved one in a mass \natrocity. As for me personally, I need to be able to tell them \nsomething. They need to be able to hear something that helps in their \nhealing.\n  The fact is, every day there are 80 sets of families who begin a \nprocess of grief surrounding the taking of a life through a firearm, \nand for many of them, their process of healing is encumbered by the \nfact that their leaders are not doing anything to stop it. If we could \nsimply be compassionate as a body--forget the broader systemic impact \nof passing laws that will reduce the levels of violence in this \ncountry--that would enable us to help in the healing process of the \nfamilies in Sandy Hook and Orlando. I know that after my colleagues met \nwith the families in Sandy Hook, they came to the floor to plead for \nchange.\n  We should pass legislation. This is easy, given that it should unite \nbroad members of the American public.\n  I think the Senator's question is right: What are the other things we \ncan do? We can go down the list. The Senator from Connecticut suggested \nthat we make sure that individuals who have a restraining order against \nthem by a spouse or partner aren't able to buy a weapon, and other \nsuggestions have been to ban military-style assault weapons and provide \nmore resources to law enforcement. There are a variety of other things \nwe can do. Here is an easy place to start. Here is an easy place to \nstart, where we know there is no real disagreement among the American \npublic; 80 to 90 percent approval. We know there are Republicans and \nDemocrats at least who can start negotiating this afternoon and this \nevening. Here is an easy place to start.\n\n  I don't know, maybe it is a muscle. Maybe it is a muscle. Maybe once \nyou start to exercise that muscle, once you start to get in the habit \nof coming together to try to find ways to address gun violence, it \nmakes it easier to take the next step. And also, maybe people see that \nthe sky doesn't fall. Maybe people will see that if we do expand \nbackground checks, that hundreds won't lose their right to go practice \ntheir sport, that people who want to shoot for sport don't all of a \nsudden lose access to that pastime. So maybe we will also see, as we \nhave seen in Connecticut, that the sky doesn't fall when we pass these \ncommonsense laws, that people still enjoy a fulsome right to own a \nfirearm so long as they can prove that they are not a criminal, that \nthey are not on the terrorist watch list, and that they haven't been \nadjudicated as mentally ill.\n  I yield to the Senator for an additional question.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. We need to be realistic, don't we, I ask Senator \nMurphy? The President has said we are not going to prevent every death \nfrom gun violence. I think we owe the President a great debt of thanks \nfor his leadership and courage and strength for advancing the debate on \ngun violence and seeking specific, constructive steps that will help to \nstop it, but we know we are not going to be successful in preventing \nevery single death as a result of gun violence. This kind of set of \nmeasures is a start.\n  My colleague from Connecticut has said it is an easy start. It is \neasy to understand and it is easy to see the effect and the tangible \ndifference it can make. But obviously, if it were easy to achieve, it \nwould have been done long ago.\n  Unfortunately, as he and I have said all too often and as we have had \nto say to those families from Connecticut and around the country who \nhave come to us at the vigils and the townhalls and the public meetings \nand in our offices, there is no one single solution, and Congress has \nbeen complicit by its inaction on any solution to this problem. So we \nare not going to completely prevent all 30,000 deaths or every act of \npotential terror and hatred, like Orlando, but we can make a start, \ncan't we?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, through the Chair, that is exactly right. \nLet's make a start.\n  I guess what is so offensive to the people Senator Blumenthal and I \nrepresent, especially in Connecticut, is that we have done absolutely \nnothing; that in the face of mass slaughter after mass slaughter, this \nbody has taken absolutely no action. I know times are tough here. I \nknow we are often at each other's throats. But that in and of itself is \nunacceptable.\n  Let's find some limited common ground on issues that the broad \nAmerican electorate support, and let's move forward on it. Maybe we \nwait to litigate some of the more controversial pieces until later on.\n  As Senator Blumenthal said earlier, this level of death would be \nabsolutely unacceptable if it came by way of disease or if it came by \nway of infection. No one would contemplate standing pat and doing \nnothing if a mosquito-borne illness were killing 80 people a day in \nthis country or wiped out 50 in one evening. No one would accept \nCongress doing nothing and just moving on to the next piece of \nlegislation after the next wave of people dies. That is just not \nsomething people would accept. But for some reason in this country, we \nhave come to accept that gun violence is inevitable and that there is \nnothing we can do or should do about it.\n  I am going to make this argument with greater specificity later this \nafternoon, but it is important for us to look at the data on gun deaths \nin America versus gun deaths in every other industrialized nation. It \ndoesn't happen in other places like it happens here. And it is not \nbecause America has more people who are mentally ill. It is not because \nAmerica spends less money on law enforcement. It is not because America \nhas a less well-funded system of mental health, although we have a \nterrible system of mental health that we should fix. The reason we have \nepidemic levels of gun violence is not that we are different from other \ncountries in all of these other ways; it has to be explained in part \nbecause we have allowed so many people who shouldn't have guns to have \nthem. There is a reason we are different, and thus we shouldn't accept \nit.\n  I yield to the Senator from Florida for a question without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON. Yes. Mr. President, if I may, if the Senator will yield \nfor a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue.) The Senator from Connecticut has \nyielded to the Senator from Florida for a question.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I wish to ask the Senator about the weapon \nthat was used in Orlando. My home is in Orlando. I was there right \nafter the shooting. Of course, I speculated at the time that this was \ngoing to be a combination of ISIS-inspired, a hate crime, anti-gay, and \nvery likely anti-Hispanic because 44 of the 49 had Hispanic surnames.\n  I want to ask the Senator if he is aware of the difference between \nthe lethal killing machine that was used and the AR-15, which is a \nmilitary weapon used by the military called the M-16, and the SIG SAUER \nMCX. They can use the same bullets, but this one, in fact, can use an \neven larger, more lethal bullet, traveling at 2,000 miles per hour. I \nwanted the Senator to see this. Is he aware that down in Orlando, this \nkiller used this rifle?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, through the Chair, I thank my colleague \nfor the question. From the layman's perspective, they don't seem like \nthey are different weapons. They are both incredibly powerful weapons. \nThey are both derivatives of weapons that were intended to kill as many \npeople as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. NELSON. For the military, that is expected.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I yield for an additional question.\n  Mr. NELSON. And the Senator no doubt but unfortunately agrees, along \nwith the rest of us about what happened in Orlando, that these are not \nweapons for hunting; these are weapons for killing. And this particular \nweapon has a collapsible stock. Would the Senator be surprised? This is \nhow he got it in. You take out the magazine. You collapse the stock. He \nprobably had a blousy outer garment. It is near the 2 o'clock closing \ntime. People are leaving, security is lessening, and he walks in with \nthis. How did he get it in? He didn't have to have a long rifle; he had\n\n[[Page S3907]]\n\na collapsible stock. What would the Senator think about that?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Well, it is not surprising to me, would be my answer.\n  I think, as the Senator knows, the marketing techniques of the \ncompanies that sell these guns are very disturbing. They often are \nmarketing these guns in a way that would suggest that the intended use \nby the manufacturer is, in fact, to kill as many people as possible. \nThey advertise the fact that you can conceal them easily, so they don't \nshy away from the fact that the collapsible elements make them easily \nconcealable. The manufacturers are not suggesting that they should be \nused for mass slaughter, but they certainly are selling them in a way \nthat speaks to an audience who is contemplating what they were \ncontemplating.\n  I yield to the Senator for an additional question.\n  Mr. NELSON. Those who are listening to this, if they are concerned \nabout this stilted parliamentary language we are using, it is the \nSenate's rules that I am requesting through the Presiding Officer \npermission to ask a question, so I will ask this in the form of a \nquestion.\n  Would the Senator believe that these are the shoes of one of the \ntrauma surgeons? It just so happened that two blocks from the nightclub \nis the trauma center in Orlando, the Regional Medical Center, the No. 1 \ntrauma center with trained trauma surgeons. They called them all in in \nthe middle of the night.\n  Would the Senator like me to read what the doctor who owns these \nshoes said?\n  Mr. MURPHY. First of all, let me say that it doesn't surprise me \nbecause we know the level of carnage that entered that emergency room. \nBut I think it should pain everyone to look at that pair of shoes, look \nat the blood splattered on them, think of the amount of blood that was \nlost by those who died and lived, and to think that we are not going to \ndo anything about it.\n  I yield for an additional question. I know the Senator from New York \nis waiting as well.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, since the Senator would like to know what \nDoctor Joshua Corsa, the medical doctor who owns these shoes, said, he \nwrote in one of the Orlando publications:\n\n       These are my work shoes from Saturday night. They are brand \n     new, not even a week old. I came to work this morning and saw \n     these in the corner of the call room, next to the pile of \n     dirty scrubs. I had forgotten about them until now. On these \n     shoes, soaked between its fibers, is the blood of 54 innocent \n     human beings. I don't know which were straight, which were \n     gay, which were black, or which were Hispanic. What I do know \n     is that they came to us in wave upon wave of suffering, \n     screaming, and death. And somehow, in that chaos, doctors, \n     nurses, technicians, police, paramedics, and others, \n     performed super human feats of compassion and care. This \n     blood, which poured out of those patients and soaked through \n     my scrubs and shoes, will stain me forever. In these \n     Rorschach patterns of red I will forever see their faces and \n     the faces of those that gave everything they had in those \n     dark hours.\n       There is still an enormous amount of work to be done. Some \n     of the work will never end. And while I work I will continue \n     to wear these shoes. And when the last patient leaves our \n     hospital, I will take them off, and I will keep them in my \n     office. I want to see them in front of me every time I go to \n     work. For on June 12, after the worst of humanity reared its \n     evil head, I saw the best of humanity come fighting right \n     back. I never want to forget that night.\n\n  Dr. Joshua Corsa, Orlando Regional Medical Center.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I yield to the Senator from New York for a question \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. First, I thank my colleague from Florida for that \namazing presentation. I thank my colleagues from Connecticut and New \nJersey for the amazing job they have done in making sure they do \neverything they can, using the procedures of this body, to see that we \nget votes on this important legislation. I also thank my friend from \nConnecticut, who has held the floor for some time today--both Senators \nfrom Connecticut, who have done an amazing job. And I know we will all \nbe looking forward to hearing from our friend from West Virginia for \nhis words. I thank all of the Senators on the floor because this is so \nimportant.\n\n  The Senator from Connecticut said it has been nearly 4 years since \nSandy Hook and this body has done nothing. He is right. This body is \nshameful. This body is shameful in its obeisance to the hard right of \nthe gun lobby in not even doing the most reasonable things that almost \nall Americans support, that don't affect the rights of legitimate gun \nowners, and that would simply make our country safer.\n  I say to the Senator from Connecticut, we are in a new world. We are \nin a world where lone wolves can get a hold of guns and do huge damage, \nas we saw and as our friend from Florida eloquently talked about in his \nown State. We have to change and adapt to that world. Maybe in the old \ndays people would say: Well, terrorism is not going to happen here. It \nhas. It has, and we need to make sure we do everything we can to \nprevent terrorists from getting guns.\n  My colleagues have talked about two pieces of legislation; No. 1, \nmaking sure that if someone is a person the authorities suspect might \ncommit terrorism and may be planning a terrorist attack and they also \nknow that a gun which that person purchased can be used in that attack, \nthey would stop them from getting a gun, and, No. 2, legislation on \nuniversal background checks because we need both.\n  My question to my colleague is along these lines. If we closed the \nterror loophole, we still could have a terrorist go to a gun show or go \nonline and buy a gun. If we just deal with making sure there are \nuniversal background checks, we haven't prevented terrorists from \ngetting guns at a gun show, online, or at a gun shop, as we saw.\n  As the author of the Brady law, there was no online then, so we \ndidn't ban online purchases. The NRA, to get the vote--it only passed \nby one vote on the House floor--said let gun shows get in. In those \ndays, gun shows were what they used to be, not a massive place where \npeople go buy guns but people who needed to sell the one gun they had. \nWhat has evolved is that the people who want to get around the law use \ngun shows methodically and regularly to avoid the background check. I \nwould simply ask my colleague this. Isn't it true that these two pieces \nof legislation go hand in hand? Isn't it true that if we did one--\neither one but not the other--that terrorists or suspected terrorists \ncould still get their hands on guns? And isn't it true that both pieces \nof legislation have the overwhelming support of a huge number of \nAmericans?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for his lifelong leadership on this \nquestion. I feel as though I am in a caucus of giants here, where \npeople are coming down to the floor--from Senator Durbin to Senator \nSchumer, to Senator Blumenthal--who have all been working on this issue \nabout firearms, trying to protect Americans from gun violence far \nlonger than I have. Of course, as one of the original authors of the \nbill, Senator Schumer knows better than anyone that had you known that \nyou were building a bill that would only cover 60 percent of gun sales, \nyou never would have designed it, nor probably voted for it, with the \nterms that exist today. What has happened is that over time gun sales \nhave migrated to other places.\n  What we are simply trying to do is to reinforce the existing \nintention of the law. We are not trying to change the law at all. For \neverybody who voted for that bill originally to make sure criminals \nwere not able to buy guns, they did so because they believed they were \ngoing to cover the majority of sales that were done in a commercial \natmosphere. Now commerce happens in gun shows and online, and we need \nfor the system to migrate to it.\n  The Senator is also right that protecting America from terrorist \nattacks is ineffective unless we do both--make sure people on the \nterrorist watch list can't buy guns and that the forums which that list \nreaches are both gun stores and gun shows but also Internet sales.\n  Further, the Senator is right that this is the only place where this \nissue is controversial. This is the only place in which there is a 50-\n50 argument over this question. You find any other forum in any other \npart of the country and it is 90-10 on this issue, which is why my \nfriend from West Virginia has led on this because he knows that in all \nof our States, this is something that\n\n[[Page S3908]]\n\nbrings Republicans and Democrats and gun owners and nongun owners \ntogether. Maybe other things don't, but this issue does.\n  I yield to the Senator from New York for a question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I have one other question, if I might, Mr. President, \nfor the Senator from Connecticut, and then we want to hear what the \nSenator from West Virginia has to say. He has been a courageous leader \non this issue.\n  There is some talk on both sides of a compromise. I know I have \ntalked with the Senator from Connecticut and all of my colleagues here, \nthat on our side of the aisle we are willing to compromise. It doesn't \nhave to be one way to do it, but I would just ask the Senator: Isn't it \ntrue that we don't want to compromise so we can say we did something \nand not really close both of these loopholes?\n  Mr. MURPHY. That is right.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That the compromise that is built around what the \nSenator from Texas has proposed--which says that you have to go to \ncourt to prove that the person might be a terrorist, and after 3 days \nthey can get a gun, and that no court proceeding would take that long--\nwould be a meaningless compromise, a pyrrhic victory, and something the \nvast majority of us on this side of the aisle would not accept?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I think that is a very important point, and I thank the \nSenator for making it. Let's be honest. The American people support the \nproposal that is in the underlying Feinstein legislation. The American \npeople support the underlying legislation that is incumbent in Manchin-\nToomey.\n  So, yes, we want to be able to find common ground, but that common \nground can't result in loopholes that are big enough to drive a truck \nthrough, allowing terrorists or those on the terrorist watch list to \nget guns.\n  This idea that you can give law enforcement 72 hours to go to court \nto stop somebody from obtaining a gun is ridiculous. There are not \nenough resources in our system of law enforcement and our judicial \nsystem to track every single terrorist who is buying guns and bring \nevery single one of those sales to court. Secondly, the legislation I \nhave seen would only give 72 hours to do that, which would leave \nthousands of these sales to go through without prohibition. No, we can \nfind common ground here, but let's remember, the American public by big \nnumbers already supports the proposals that have been put before this \nbody and have failed previously.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague and agree with him completely and \nlook forward to the questions from the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia for a question \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Let me first thank all our colleagues and Senators for \nbeing here today speaking about this most important issue for the \ncitizens in each one of our respective States.\n  My question to the Senator from Connecticut is on gun culture. I \ndon't think there is another State--if there is, I don't know--that has \nmore of a gun culture than West Virginia. We take the Second Amendment \nrights extremely seriously, and I want to make sure we are on the same \npage because some people come from States that don't have much of a gun \nculture or weren't exposed to guns as a young person growing up.\n  I can state that in West Virginia, at a very young age, we are \ntaught, first of all, how to handle guns safely. We are taught to never \nsell our gun to a stranger, never sell a gun to someone who has a \ncriminal background, never sell a gun to someone who is mentally \nunstable. We don't give our guns to a family member or a friend if we \ndon't think they are responsible. This is how we are taught in our gun \nculture.\n  I am sure Connecticut has the same gun culture we have. So how this \nall came about with the amendment 3 years ago, after the horrible, \nhorrific tragedy in Newtown, was that if we respect a law-abiding gun \nowner who didn't buy the gun because they want to do something wrong \nwith it or they are a criminal or are soon to be a criminal because \nthey own it, then you have to assume they are law-abiding, and they are \ngoing to do the right thing. If they are going to do the right thing, \nthe right thing is we don't sell to strangers, we don't sell to \ncriminals, we don't sell to mentally unstable people.\n  Doesn't it make sense that if you go to a gun show that would allow \nsomebody not to go through that but to go to a table where there is an \nunlicensed dealer selling to someone who isn't required by law to have \na background check, to say: Well, wait a minute. You can't do that. \nThis is a commercial transaction. As a law-abiding gun owner, I don't \ndo that. I don't know who you are. I don't know you. You want to buy my \ngun, but before I sell you my gun, I am not going to do that until I \nknow you are capable of owning a gun and respect it and know how it \noperates. That is what we said and we do so much more.\n  I would say to my good friend from Connecticut, is the gun culture \nthe same? You come from a State that has a gun culture. Even those \nwonderful families who suffered in the tragic loss of their children \nweren't trying to ban anything. They wanted common sense. So is the gun \nculture in your State similar to ours; that we treat people as law-\nabiding gun owners who do the right thing, and the right thing is to \nfind out who wants to buy your gun and don't let them go to a gun show \nor on the Internet where they are able to skew around that?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I would be interested in the Senator's reaction when I \nanswer his question, and then he can ask another question to follow up.\n  People are going to say that Connecticut and West Virginia are very \ndifferent States, and they are. There are a lot of differences between \nthe citizens of Connecticut and West Virginia, but I have found that \ngun owners aren't that different in the sense that they are serious \nabout their guns. They are serious about being a collector. They are \nserious about having the right to protect themselves. They are serious \nabout the right to be able to hunt. But they also recognize that it is \na responsibility, and you can lose that responsibility if you commit \ncrimes.\n  Almost every single gun owner I have talked to has said, yes, \nabsolutely criminals should not be able to buy guns. And every gun \nowner in Connecticut that I asked this question to said to me: What? \nTerrorists, people on the watch list, are allowed to buy guns?\n  So I think as different as our States are, I think gun owners are \nlargely the same in that they come to this issue with the sentiment of \nnot wanting the government to take away their ability to own a firearm, \nand they want a diversity of products available to them. They want to \nmake sure they are able to collect or hunt, but also they don't want a \ncriminal--somebody convicted of domestic violence, murder, or assault \nand battery--to be able to get their hands on a weapon. I think that is \nwhere both of our gun communities are, and I will yield to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia for another question or if he wants to correct me, \nif I am wrong.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. My question is a followup on that.\n  After we tried to do the Manchin-Toomey amendment to put commonsense \nmeasures into place--as law-abiding gun owners do every day--did you \nhave anybody in Connecticut come and say to you that the Manchin-Toomey \namendment would take away their gun rights and make it so they can't \nkeep their gun, can't own a gun, or can't buy a gun? Because, in fact, \nfor those who took time to read it, we protected the Second Amendment \ngreater than it had ever been protected. We protected law-abiding gun \nowners so they are able to do what the Second Amendment right gives \nthem the right to do. We never banned anything because we know the law-\nabiding gun owners will do the right thing.\n  I think in West Virginia and I would say in Connecticut that 70 to 80 \npercent of the real ardent collectors, shooters, sportsmen say it makes \nsense. They don't mind getting a background check. Why we hit a \nroadblock, I don't know.\n  Did you have anybody coming to you in your State and saying: Senator \nMurphy, please don't vote for that because I don't want you to take my \nrights away.\n  Mr. MURPHY. No one in Connecticut thought this was taking their \nrights away, and as the Senator from West Virginia knows, we have a \nstrict background check system in Connecticut already, so in \nConnecticut we had already subjected these sales to the\n\n[[Page S3909]]\n\nbackground check system. My impression is that our hunters, sports \nshooters, and collectors have never felt that they were on the \nprecipice of losing their right to enjoy their sport or their pastime, \nor to be able to build on their collection.\n  As you mentioned, there are definitely disputes when you get into the \narea of banning this kind of weapon or that kind of weapon, but that \nhas nothing to do with this bill. This bill is just about saying that \nif you are a criminal, you can't buy a weapon.\n  There may be other things that are controversial, but this one is \nnoncontroversial. The Senator has told me it is not controversial in \nWest Virginia either, when laid out as to what it really is.\n  I yield for a question.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. If I can ask my good friend from Connecticut a question.\n  When the Senator goes home to Connecticut to explain it, they \nunderstand it, they read it. If anything, we are protecting them more \nto do the thing they do every day and the way they were trained, and \nthey believe that we are correct. What happens is they start saying: \nDid you get this question? Yes, but if you do that, then they will just \nexpand it further, and they will take more of our rights away.\n\n  I say that this is a constitutional amendment. It cannot be by an \nExecutive order. It has to have the action of Congress. So don't worry \nabout someone expanding it or some office or law saying that they are \ngoing to expand the rule or expand the interpretation of it, or that \nthe executive--the Governor--is basically going to have an executive \nruling that takes more of your rights away.\n  I said you cannot do that with a constitutional amendment. We have to \ndo what we are doing right now. So can't we do the logical thing in \npassing something that is a building block for us to make sure those \nwho are unstable, who have been criminals, or who want to do harm to \nall of us should not be able to conveniently go anywhere they want to \nin America, to a gun show in America, or on the internet--which we \nnever know--and buy that.\n  Did the Senator have any feedback on that to him?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I did. We hear it constantly, which is this belief that \nthere is a secret agenda, that this is really about a slippery slope to \ngun confiscation.\n  As the Senator stated very eloquently in his remarks, there is a \nSecond Amendment, and there is an interpretation by the Supreme Court \nof that Second Amendment that guarantees the individual's right to a \nfirearm, which we cannot broach and which we cannot breach as a \nlegislative body. So that is unquestioned.\n  The question of whether there is a secret agenda is one we have to \nconfront, but the reality here is when we passed the initial background \nchecks law, I am sure people at the time said this is just the camel's \nnose under the tent.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Sure.\n  Mr. MURPHY. And it was not. As we stated, this system worked for a \nvery long time until all of these gun sales migrated out of the system. \nBut we have plenty of examples in which we have passed sensible \ncommonsense gun laws that didn't lead to all of the worst case \nscenarios that many people often proffer to us.\n  I yield to Senator Manchin for another question.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. My other question would be that I am understanding that \nthe Senator and most of my colleagues would like to do two amendments \nhere. We have two amendments proposed. They are basically commonsense \nbuilding blocks to protect the citizens of this great country in each \none of our respective States.\n  There is the one on terrorists, if you are on a terrorist watch list. \nI have heard my colleagues on both sides here and my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle say: Well, there is no due process. Basically, \nwe are taking people's rights away, which is the foundation and the \ncornerstone of this great democracy of ours.\n  I said: You know, there is not another nation on Earth that has a \ntarget on its back the way the United States of America does.\n  Understanding that if a person is being called in--let's take the \nshooter in Orlando. Our hearts and prayers go out to the families of \nthose who have lost loved ones and those who are still suffering. With \nthat being said, I think this gentleman was called in a couple of \ntimes. He was suspected of being a terrorist or of being of a terrorist \nmindset. They are thinking: How was he able to still legally go and buy \nthe firearms--legally? He didn't go illegally.\n  So they said: You mean you cannot even stop that from happening?\n  Then they said: Well, due process.\n  I know one of my colleagues wants 72 hours, which we know is not even \nreasonable or practical.\n  But on that, I think both sides--Democrats and Republicans--both want \nto keep terrorists from getting firearms.\n  The question has been, I am sure--and your people are asking you in \nConnecticut: How do you go further? How do we get this to the point to \nwhere if you have been questioned and are suspected, you should be at \nleast on a watch for 5 years, and you can't buy on a NICS no-buy list?\n  There is the easy list, which they keep asking me about. I don't know \nif the Senator from Connecticut is asked this same question. But, my \ngoodness, if a person is thought to be of a terrorist mindset and we \nhave flagged them not to fly on an airline--a commercial airline in the \nUnited States of America--don't you think we ought to have the same \nconcerns about them being able to buy a weapon legally?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Through the Chair to my friend, it is important to \nremember that there is consensus in this body that those individuals \nshouldn't fly. There is nobody who has come to the floor of the Senate \nand has proposed a law that we should take all of these individuals who \nare on these watch lists and give them back the ability to fly; right? \nNobody would propose that on the floor of the Senate because they would \nget tarred and feathered by their constituents if you came in and said: \nEverybody who has been investigated by the FBI who is on the terrorist \nwatch list, we think that you are depriving them of their right, and so \nlet them fly. No, no one would propose that.\n  So if it is not controversial that individuals who have had \nintersections with law enforcement over terrorism are not permitted to \nfly, why is it so controversial that they should be stopped from buying \na firearm, at least until they grieve the process and make it clear \nthat they had no reason to be feared?\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Senator, do you have anybody in the State of Connecticut \nwho is coming to you and saying: You know, I have a friend who was \nsuspected of being a terrorist, and their rights have been taken away. \nThey are an American citizen, and for some reason they were on the \nInternet, they were checked out, and the FBI has come to their home and \nsuspected them and questioned them.\n  Should that person still be on the no-buy list, if you will, because \nthey are a suspected terrorist?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I think people in my State are shocked that this isn't \nalready law. I think at some level people don't understand why this \nhasn't been baked into the background system as it is. As you know, \nthis is just simply not a controversial issue anywhere but in this \nChamber.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Do they think we have broached the amendments and the \nBill of Rights, that we have taken people's rights away?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Nobody believes that, no.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I have not had that in West Virginia at all. If \nanything, they said: Please, err on the side of caution. Keep me and my \nchildren safe.\n  That is what they are saying. We are not taking any people's rights. \nBut we have to have a process where if that person, basically, over a \nperiod of time has shown that they haven't really engaged and haven't \nbeen involved, then they can come back. I think we have all said: That \nmakes sense to us; we can do that.\n  I think Senator Feinstein has a 5-year provision in there for that \nwhich is very reasonable.\n  I can't go back home this weekend and explain to the people in West \nVirginia why we haven't moved forward on this. There could be another \nOrlando in, God forbid, one of our States.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the gentleman for joining us on the floor today. \nI think that is really what this is\n\n[[Page S3910]]\n\nabout--not being able in our heart of hearts to go back to our States, \nespecially those that have been touched by these crimes, and tell them \nthat we wasted another week, that we sat here and we ignored the \nproblem for yet another week.\n  The reason I am on the floor, the reason that Senator Blumenthal and \nSenator Booker are joining me, is that we have just had enough. We have \nhad enough of these shootings, enough of this talk. We think it is time \nfor action and time for action now.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I thank the Senator for answering the questions that we \nhave had. I thank all of you for being informative in the questions \nthat we still have furthermore to ask.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I know the Senator from Maryland is on the floor, but I \nyield to the Senator from Connecticut for a question.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Thank you, Senator Murphy.\n  I want just to pursue some of the questions, the excellent inquiries \nthat have been posed by our colleague from West Virginia and just to \nsay that some folks in America who may be listening or watching or may \nhear afterward about this debate may say to themselves: Somebody who \nhas been put on that watch list erroneously, someone who is precluded \nfrom boarding a plane or traveling in the United States--regardless of \nwhether they can buy a gun or not--aren't they entitled to the due \nprocess right to correct that list?\n  The answer, in my view, is very simply yes, as a matter of \nconstitutional right and due process, as a matter of equal protection, \nas a matter of the right to travel freely in the United States of \nAmerica. If someone is on that list erroneously, he or she deserves the \nright to have that record corrected. I am going to pose that question \nto my colleague from Connecticut now.\n  But I have a second question, which is also probably on the minds of \na number of our Connecticut constituents who are watching or listening \nor may hear about it afterwards: Don't we have some of the strongest \ngun protection laws in the United States of America, and isn't that \nenough? Why are we worried about this terrorist watch list? Why are we \nworried about background checks for the Nation as a whole when \nConnecticut has helped to lead the Nation; when Illinois, as a matter \nof fact, has strong gun laws, perhaps in theory; when California or \nother States pass their own laws? Why are we here on the floor of the \nSenate seeking action and saying enough is enough? Why are we so \noutraged and passionate about achieving gun violence protection barring \npeople on a terrorist watch list from buying guns, making sure that we \nhave universal background checks, a ban on straw trafficking, and \nillegal importation across State borders?\n  I think the answer is these measures are necessary because even the \nstrongest State laws are basically ineffective--at least to protect \nmany people--as long as stolen guns, lost guns, can be transported \nacross State boundaries. Guns have no respect for State boundaries. In \nConnecticut we are vulnerable because of the weaker laws in other \nStates. So this national protection is vitally important.\n  Is that not the case, I ask Senator Murphy?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank Senator Blumenthal.\n  I think that is critically important here. I would answer it in two \nways.\n  The first is to underscore your point. Our Nation's set of State-\nbased firearms regulations are only as strong as the weakest link. We \ncan have the strongest laws in Connecticut, but guns, terrorists, and \nwould-be criminals don't observe State boundaries. If you are intent on \ncommitting a heinous crime, you probably also have the means to figure \nout how to get around one State's tough gun laws.\n  Senator Durbin was here earlier talking about the fact that a large \nnumber of the weapons that are used in Chicago to commit murders--60-\nsome odd shootings over Memorial Day weekend alone--come from outside \nthe State of Illinois. Illinois has some pretty tough gun laws, but \nIndiana doesn't. So you can get to Indiana from Chicago in a heartbeat, \nand you could pick up a firearm online or at a gun show, or you can go \nto a pretty miserably regulated gun dealer and bring what effectively \nare illegal weapons back to Chicago. Yes, we are talking about a \nFederal law because this cannot be a State-based solution.\n  Through the Chair, that being said, as Senator Blumenthal knows, \nState laws do have an effect.\n  That is helpful in showing, through this body, that we are not \npowerless, that if we pass these laws and apply them on a national \nbasis, it will have an effect.\n  In Connecticut, we have seen a 40-percent reduction in gun crimes \nsince these laws went into effect. That is a preview to this body, that \nif we were to adopt that standard--yielding to my friend for another \nquestion--then we could potentially bear the same reward in human lives \nsaved on a national basis.\n  I yield to the Senator for another question.\n  I know Senator Cardin is on the floor as well.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I would be pleased to yield to other colleagues for \ntheir questions, but let me just ask the Senator one more quick \nquestion.\n  Again, somebody unfamiliar with this topic might be wondering. \nConvicted felons under law are barred from buying firearms. So someone \nwho has been to prison, paid the price, done probation, been out of our \nprisons for years and years, and done nothing to repeat that criminal \nepisode--whatever it was--is still barred from buying a gun. Yet \nsomeone who is deemed dangerous enough to be on a watch list or a no-\nfly list--the consolidated list that the Senator from Connecticut \nreferred to earlier--is free to walk into any gun store or any gun show \nand, in 7 minutes--a reporter of the Philadelphia Inquirer, I believe, \nwas able to do it in 7 minutes--simply present the money and walk out \nwith an AR-15 automatic weapon, a firearm designed to kill as many \npeople as quickly as possible, designed for combat and largely \nmanufactured and used around the world to kill people--not \npredominantly for hunting or recreation. It is designed to kill people.\n  Isn't there an irony to this kind of an inconsistency? Irony is \nprobably a euphemism. Or isn't that an outrage that the terrorist watch \nlist people can buy an AR-15--no questions asked--in 7 minutes or less \nor slightly more? And a convicted felon, having committed a serious \ncrime, having paid his dues to society, having paid a fine, having \nserved time in prison, done and out--and we talk a lot now about a \nsecond-chance society, about their being able to live normal lives and \nwork and so forth--is barred, even though that person may be far less \ndangerous, far less a threat to innocent people in Orlando or at \nVirginia Tech or in Newtown, CT, or to the 30,000 people every year who \neither are killed or kill themselves because of this easy availability \nof guns to people who are dangerous.\n\n  The terrorist watch list--again, not a panacea, not a single \nsolution--barring those people from buying guns will not fix this \nproblem alone, but it is a start. It sends a message, and it will \nprovide hope to those families who have looked in our eyes, the \nfamilies of Newtown, families across the country who have lost loved \nones and who say: Why can't Congress act? That is why we are here \nsaying enough is enough, if I am correct.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I say to Senator Blumenthal, I don't think there is any \nmore I can offer in answer. You are correct that it is both ironic and \noutrageous.\n  I yield to the Senator from Maryland for a question without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, through the Chair, I would like to inquire \nof my friend from Connecticut with regard to the relationship between \nthe tragedies we have seen far too often in this country--most recently \nin Orlando but, as Senator Murphy and Senator Blumenthal know all too \nwell, in Newtown and at Virginia Tech and the list goes on and on--and \nthe work we have done in order to protect our homeland from \nradicalization.\n  I would like to ask my colleague because he has been one of the \nleaders on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and he has worked \nvery hard to make sure we have the very best intelligence information \nto keep our country safe, to support law enforcement against \nterrorists, and that we do everything we can to make sure we identify \nthose who would commit terrorist\n\n[[Page S3911]]\n\nactions and take law enforcement action against those individuals.\n  With regard to the Orlando episode, although we don't know all about \nit yet, we are still learning information about the perpetrator, we do \nknow the LGBT community feels particularly threatened by what happened. \nThey were victimized at this particular spot.\n  Senator Murphy, Senator Booker, Senator Blumenthal, and Senator \nMarkey--all who are on the floor--have worked very hard to deal with \nthe root causes of hate in our society, which is another factor \nconcerning safety in our communities.\n  I would like to get the connection here on the gun issues, but I \nthink it is important to point out that we have worked very hard to \nsupport the LGBT community, to make it clear that the rights of all \npeople in this country are going to be protected. We celebrated the \nSupreme Court decision that recognized marriage. We celebrated some \nactions within our military to open up full participation by the LGBT \ncommunity, and we were particularly pleased with the recent \nconfirmation of Eric Fanning that we saw take place in our military. We \nhave seen some progress in America.\n  Globally, we have seen some progress in regard to the LGBT community. \nWe have seen in several countries--and I mention this specifically in \nasking the question of Senator Murphy because of his work on the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee--such as Malta, Ireland, Thailand, Libya, \nand Vietnam, that laws have been passed to protect transgenders. That \nis all work we have done to try to keep all of our communities safe. \nUkraine passed a law that repealed one of the workforce discrimination \nlaws against the LGBT community.\n  These are all important steps we have taken to try to keep not only \nour community but the global community safe from these types of hate \nacts. So we have taken some positive steps in trying to isolate \nterrorists, in trying to make sure law enforcement has all the tools \nthey need, and we have done a lot of work to protect vulnerable \ncommunities to make sure we stand for the rights of all people.\n  I applaud my colleagues for being here on the floor to talk about the \nrelationship here--this is what I want to ask Senator Murphy about--\nwhy, in the week following Orlando, he is here on the floor talking \nabout gun safety.\n  I noticed in the Orlando tragedy that one of the weapons used was an \nassault weapon, a military-style weapon. I must say that in my \nobservations in Maryland, I don't know too many people who need to have \nthat type of weapon in order to do hunting in my State or to keep \nthemselves safe. It seems to be a weapon of choice by those who want to \ncommit crimes.\n  My colleague talked at great length about terrorists and those on the \nterrorist watch list and that loophole that exists. We can talk about \nwhat happened in my colleague's State with a high-volume ammunition \nclip that certainly added to the numbers of victims before law \nenforcement could deal with the perpetrator.\n\n  So my question is, As we are looking at ways to keep Americans safe, \nhow does my colleague see these issues coming together? How can we have \na coordinated strategy, and why haven't we acted?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for his question, and I want to thank \nhim for the work he has done as our leader on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee to make LGBT rights not just a domestic priority but an \ninternational priority for this country.\n  I started this out about 3 hours ago talking about how complicated \nthe attack in Orlando was and how many different competing influencers \nthere were on the incomprehensible decision this individual made. But \nclearly he had a hatred in his heart for people in the LGBT community. \nAnd it is a reinforcement for us to pay attention to the words that we \nuse, the things we do, and the legislation we contemplate or pass. If \nwe build inclusive societies in this country and promote--as my \ncolleague from Maryland is--inclusive societies abroad, then we give \nless room for individuals who might be contemplating these hateful \nactions against individuals who are members of a minority group--LGBT, \nHispanic, or whatever it may be.\n  So I think our obligation here is multiple. We need to pass stronger \ngun laws and we need to take the fight to ISIS, but we also need to \ndouble down on inclusive societies and we need to double down on \nfighting discrimination against our LGBT brothers and sisters because \nto the extent that we make discrimination, that we make hatred, and \nthat we make malevolent thought much more of an outlier in our society, \nwe cut down on the potential for this to happen in the future.\n  I thank the gentleman for also bringing together all these other \npotential steps forward on our gun laws. Of course assault weapons \nshould not be legal in this country. When they were prohibited for 10 \nyears, we saw a diminution in the number of mass murders committed. Of \ncourse these mega-clips--the 30-round and 100-round clips--have no \nplace in a civilized society.\n  I guess our hope is that if we start exercising this muscle of \ngetting consensus on gun laws, we start with background checks and the \nterror gap, which we know the American public is together on and we \nknow we can find agreement on in this body, then that will give us the \nplatform with which to get agreement on some of these other issues. If \nwe start finding common ground today, this afternoon, tonight, then we \nwill have the room to find more common ground in the future.\n  But the Senator is right--we have to link these efforts together. We \nhave to understand how complicated the motivations were for the \nshooter, but we also have to understand we are not powerless in \nconfronting it.\n  I yield again to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, one additional question, if I might ask at \nthis time.\n  The Senator pointed out--and rightly so--that there is no one problem \nwe have to deal with, there are multiple issues involved. I have heard \nsome of my colleagues say, well, the problem is not the weapons they \nuse or the problem is not the social issues or the problem is not this \nor that, but I would ask this of my friend from Connecticut: It seems \nto me the one option that should be off the table is doing nothing.\n  It just seems to me that the American people are demanding--and \nrightly so--that we take action now to make our communities safer. \nQuite frankly, they don't understand the inaction of this body. Quite \nfrankly, I don't understand the inaction of this body.\n  Would my colleague agree that the only option we should take off the \ntable in trying to deal with this is doing nothing?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Through the Chair, I thank the Senator for the question, \nand let me say that I think that is why we are here. I think that is \nwhy we are here. This was just backbreaking. The idea of this body \nmoving on as if it is just business as usual after the worst mass \nshooting in the history of this Nation, coming on the heels of the \nsecond and the third and the fourth worst mass shootings in the history \nof this country, was unacceptable.\n  I think the reason that I am here with Senator Blumenthal, Senator \nBooker, Senator Durbin, why you are here, why Senator Markey has now \njoined us, why Senator Manchin was here, why Senator Schumer was here, \nand why so many others will be coming to ask questions of me later \ntoday, is because there is no option other than action. The idea that \nwe wouldn't even try, the idea that the leadership of this body \nwouldn't even schedule a debate this week to try to find common ground \ninstead of just moving on as if it didn't happen, is the only thing \nthat is truly unacceptable.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts for a question without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  (Mr. CRUZ assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. MARKEY. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his leadership \non this issue. It is the issue we should be debating this week and next \nweek in the Senate. I thank him and Senator Blumenthal from \nConnecticut, Senator Durbin, Senator Booker, Senator Cardin--everyone \nwhose voices down here are saying the same thing.\n  We have learned a lot about this problem, but we still don't know all \nof the answers. The answers we do know we should be voting on this \nweek. We should be putting those protections on the books.\n\n[[Page S3912]]\n\n  There is some commonsense knowledge we each have--that the FBI should \nhave the authority to block gun sales to potential terrorists. How hard \nis that? No gun sales to potential terrorists in the United States.\n  The NRA says no. The NRA said no last year. The NRA said no the year \nbefore. The NRA controls the agenda of the Senate. They control this \nbody. They are the ones who decide whether guns can be sold to \nterrorists in the United States of America--the NRA.\n  The American people say that NRA should stand for ``not relevant \nanymore'' in American politics, but it is not so. The NRA controls \nwhether we are going to be able to vote on banning terrorists from \nbeing able to purchase guns.\n  So a terrorist can be on a no-fly list and can't get on a plane. We \ndon't want a terrorist in the passenger cabin of a plane in the United \nStates, so they are banned from getting on that plane. But they can \njust walk across the street into a gun shop and buy an assault weapon \nthat they can then use to kill people whom they hate in the United \nStates. Does that really make any sense? Of course not. Why don't we \nhave the vote? Because the NRA does not want a vote on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate. They don't want a debate on this issue.\n  So we are going to continue to stand up and fight for this vote, for \nthis issue to be considered on the floor for as long as it takes \nbecause if the FBI believes there is a reasonable chance that someone \nis going to use a gun in a terrorist attack on our people, it should \nhave the ability to block the sale of a gun to that person. That is \nonly common sense. That is what the police chiefs want. It is what the \nFBI wants. Why are we being denied a vote on the floor of the Senate on \nthat issue?\n  Historically, this goes all the way back to the incredible power of \nthe NRA. From 2004 until 2014, people on the terrorist watch list \nlegally purchased guns more than 2,000 times because the FBI had no \nauthority to block those sales. Over a 10-year period, over 2,000 \ntimes, the FBI could not stop a terrorist--a potential terrorist--from \nbuying a gun in the United States because the National Rifle \nAssociation does not want potential terrorists to be denied purchasing \nguns in the United States. What kind of crazy position--that potential \nterrorists should be allowed to buy guns in the United States--is that \nfor the NRA to take?\n  Back in 1994, we were having a debate over the ban of assault weapons \nin our country, but it came to my attention that China was actually \nselling 1 million semiautomatic assault weapons per year for $80 apiece \ninside the United States--1 million guns a year--and we were \nnegotiating a treaty with China at the same time. So I organized about \n130 members of the House on a letter to President Clinton saying no \nsupport for any deal with China until China agrees that they will not \nbe selling assault weapons for $80 apiece in our country. That was 22 \nyears ago--1 million assault weapons a year being sold by China. That \nwould be 22 million additional assault weapons in our country coming in \nfrom China. That is banned. However, the domestic ban here expired a \ncouple years ago.\n  Now, here we have another case of a terrorist saying that he was \ninspired by ISIS--inspired by this so-called caliphate outside of our \nborders to buy a weapon to kill Americans. Like China, are we just \ngoing to allow the NRA to say: No, it is all part of free commerce; no, \nwe don't have any rights to limit the sale of these weapons. Or are we \ngoing to say there has to be commerce with a conscience; that not \neverything can be sold to anyone in our country; that some people and \nsome things are too dangerous to be allowed to be purchased within our \ncountry.\n  I support very strongly the bill which Senator Feinstein has \nintroduced to give the Attorney General the discretion to prevent \nsomeone from buying a firearm or explosives or obtaining a firearms \ndealer license if the Attorney General determines the individual is a \nknown or suspected terrorist and has a reasonable belief that the \nindividual may use the weapon in connection with terrorism.\n  Can it happen again? You know that it can happen again. This \nterrorist cited the two terrorists in Boston, the Tsarnaev brothers, as \nan inspiration to him. There is an online brainwashing recruitment \nwhich is going on all across our country. So that idea is out there.\n  The question is, How easy are we going to make it for them to be able \nto gain access to the instrumentality of their devastating acts against \nour society? Are we just going to allow them to walk into any gun store \nonce they have been so radicalized that they are about to act on these \ndangerous activities? Well, Senate Republicans oppose that commonsense \nlegislation.\n  Senate Republicans aren't allowing us to have a vote or a debate on \nthis issue out on the Senate floor. One day after the tragic terrorist \nattack in San Bernardino last December, Senate Republicans voted \nagainst Senator Feinstein's legislation to close the terrorists' gap in \nterms of their ability to be able to buy these assault weapons. Six \nmonths later, Omar Mateen, a terrorist investigated by the FBI, \ntargeted the LGBTQ community and murdered 49 innocent people at the \nPulse nightclub in Orlando. Yet Republicans continue to willingly \nfollow the NRA and oppose this bill from becoming law in our country. \nThe NRA has repeatedly opposed and worked to block that legislation, \nand apparently they think it is OK for someone like Omar Mateen to be \nable to buy an assault weapon with impunity in our country.\n  Mark Twain once remarked that common sense is very uncommon. He was \nsurely talking about the Senate Republican caucus when it comes to \nhaving a terrorist be prohibited from buying an assault weapon in the \nUnited States of America. This mass shooting in Orlando has exposed the \nSenate Republicans and their common suffering from a commonsense \ndeficit disorder. Today I call on them to stop their opposition. I call \non them to have the courage to stand up for what is right for the \nAmerican people and for the people of Orlando because I truly believe \nthat a vote on that bill--if you hold hands with the NRA, the Americans \nwill hold you accountable. I hope our Republican colleagues understand \nthat and fear that because Americans are tired of living in fear that \ntheir community will be the next Orlando.\n\n  I ask another question: Wouldn't it be easier to develop effective \nsolutions to gun violence in America if our Nation's top researchers \ncould actually do research on gun violence? We are facing an epidemic \nof gun violence. More than 33,000 people are dying in our country each \nyear from gun violence. It is a public health emergency, and we must \ntreat it that way. So shouldn't we ask ourselves: Why is it happening \nand what can we do to stop it? When disease and illness bring \nwidespread death, doctors, scientists, and public health researchers \nstudy the causes so that they can find solutions, and the Federal \nGovernment invests in those efforts. For diabetes, which kills almost \n76,000 people in the United States each year, the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention receive $170 million. For planning and \npreparedness against the flu, which leads to 57,000 deaths each year, \nthe CDC's budget is more than $187 million. For asthma, 3,600 people, \nthe CDC receives $29 million. For gun violence, which kills more than \n33,000 Americans a year, the CDC's budget is zero dollars--yes, zero \ndollars. That is because, beginning more than 20 years ago, an \nappropriations rider has prevented the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention from advocating or promoting gun control. Many interpreted \nthis provision as a ban, and it has chilled any research into the \ncauses of gun violence and how to prevent it. But in 2013, President \nObama directed the CDC to conduct critical public health research, and \nthe principal congressional author of the rider, former Republican \nCongressman Jay Dickey of Arkansas, has now disavowed it, recognizing \nit was a mistake and calling for Federal gun violence prevention to \nmove forward.\n  Just yesterday, the American Medical Association--the Nation's \nlargest association of physicians--voted for the first time in support \nof ending the so-called ban on CDC gun violence research. As AMA \npresident Steven Stack said yesterday: With about 30,000 people dying \neach year at the barrel of a gun, an epidemiological analysis of gun \nviolence is in fact necessary. So that is the question which I ask of \nSenator Murphy, that is the question which I ask of Senator Durbin, and\n\n[[Page S3913]]\n\nthat is the question which I ask of the Senate president: Why can't we \nfind a way to at least fund the research on the causes of gun violence? \nWhy can't we find a way of just putting $10 million a year into that \nresearch? Why can't we do that?\n  I ask Senator Murphy the question, but he knows the answer. The \nanswer is that the NRA does not want a single nickel to be spent on \nthat issue, and the NRA controls the agenda on the Senate floor with a \nvice-like grip, and it will not let it go. But we have reached a \ndefining moment. The American people have seen in this one incident how \ntightly the NRA controls the agenda of the Republican Party in our \ncountry. We should already have voted on this ban. We should already \nhave moved on to other gun control issues--but, no. Whether it be the \nterror watch list or it even be research at the CDC on gun violence, \nthere is no action. We can study how to prevent children from operating \npill bottles, from suffering from head injuries on bicycles, how to use \na cigarette lighter so they don't hurt themselves, but shouldn't we \nstudy how to stop kids from firing guns that can hurt them?\n  Let's give the medical, scientific, and public health community the \nresources they need. Let's ensure that if someone is going to buy a \ngun, they have to get a background check completed before they are \nallowed to do it. Let's make sure that we put in place all of the \nprotections that are going to be needed to protect ordinary Americans \nfrom this action.\n  So I say to Senators Murphy and Blumenthal from Connecticut, what you \nsuffered in Newtown, CT, is sadly just a preview of coming attractions \nunless we change the laws in our country, unless we put the preventive \nmeasures on the books, so we can avoid the worst, most catastrophic \nconsequences of this out-of-control gun epidemic in our country.\n  What the Senator is doing here today, along with Senator Booker, is \nforcing America to understand the cause of their problems and why we \ncannot ban a terrorist from buying a gun in the United States. All \nissues go through three phases: political education, political \nactivation, political implementation. What the Senators are doing today \nis forcing this political education and forcing people to understand \nthat this is not bipartisan. This is not the whole institution doesn't \nwork; this is a deliberate decision made by the Republicans to abide \nonly by what it is that the NRA--an outside party--wants to permit \nbeing debated on the Senate floor. But at 33,000 deaths a year, with \nterrorist activity after terrorist activity now occurring on our own \nshores--in Boston alone, we had Mohamed Atta and nine others who \nhijacked nine planes; we had the Tsarnaev brothers who detonated \nexplosives on Patriots Day at the Boston Marathon.\n  It is time for us to just stop here. It is time for us to start to do \nthe right thing so we can make it harder for these acts to take place. \nI don't think we should stop this discussion until that happens. That \nis why I thank Senator Murphy for taking this time--Senator Booker, \nSenator Blumenthal, and everyone who has participated. I am going to be \nwith you every step of the way until we get the votes the American \npeople expect from their elected Senators.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding for a question.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank Senator Markey very much. I think he has gotten \nto the root of why we are here. There are a lot of very important \nissues in this underlying bill.\n  As I said at outset, it is uncomfortable for those of us who began \nhere at the beginning of this time to postpone amendments and to put \noff debate on the underlying bill, the very important bill, the CJS \nbill. We feel like enough is enough, that this is the moment when this \nbody has to come together and find a path forward to try to address \nthis epidemic of gun violence and admit that it is within our power to \nmake the next attack less likely. This doesn't come easily, but at this \npoint, many of us think it is our only hope to really force action.\n  I know Senator Booker has a question. Before yielding to Senator \nBooker, I want to thank Senator Markey for his incredible leadership on \nthis issue of promoting research into gun violence. Unfortunately, \nscience has become politicized, and Senator Markey is on the frontlines \nof trying to address climate change. But there is no reason this \nCongress should be deciding what researchers at the CDC pursue by means \nof lines of inquiry and what they do not pursue. That should be left up \nto scientists. That should be left up to people who are professionals \nin the field of deciding what is worthy of research and what is not. We \nare politicians. I don't cower from that term. I am proud of the fact \nthat I and we have chosen to try to make this country better through \nthe political process. But we aren't scientists. We don't have medical \nbackgrounds. When we get into the field of deciding what is worthy of \nresearch and what is not, bad things happen routinely, whether it is on \nthe question of climate change or on the question of gun violence \nresearch.\n  The private sector simply cannot pick up the slack. Why? Because when \nthe Federal Government bans private research on a subject like gun \nviolence research, it chills private dollars from going into those \nresearch proposals as well. There is a fear on behalf of the private \nsector that if they get intermingled with public funds, there could be \na problem. That hasn't stopped some people in the private sector from \npursuing this research because they know it is critical.\n  Avielle Richman was one of the little boys and girls who were killed \nat Sandy Hook. Avielle was a beautiful young girl. As has been the case \nwith many of the parents following that tragedy, her parents have \ndecided to set up a foundation in her name. Maybe over the course of \nthe afternoon, we will be able to talk about some of the other good \nwork that has been done by these foundations because we think that, as \ndevastating as the tragedy was, Newtown and Sandy Hook are defined by \nthe response. The Richman foundation is all about research. The Richman \nfoundation is all about research trying to discover the linkages \nbetween mental illness and a predilection toward gun violence or toward \nviolence in general. We know there is not an inherent connection. We \nknow people who are mentally ill are much more likely to be the victims \nof gun violence than they are the perpetrators of gun violence. We know \nthere is an intersection, but the only money that is going into that \nintersection right now is private dollars that are being raised by two \nparents of a girl who perished at Sandy Hook. They are not professional \nfundraisers. They have other jobs. They are trying to scrape together \nwhat they can to perform this research. They know it is worthy. They \nknow it is worthwhile. But because of that ban Senator Markey is trying \nso hard to overturn, the public sector can't do research into that \nconnection, or it becomes very hard for the public sector to justify it \nbecause they fear violating that law.\n  I thank Senator Markey for being so persistent on this question of \nresearch dollars. There are so many different angles of this problem. \nThere are so many different ways to attack it. This is another example \nof a way in which we can come together. I think this is one of the ways \nin which Democrats and Republicans can come together.\n  I yield for a question from the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to thank the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nMurphy.\n  You have been on the floor for a little over 3 hours in the process \nof raising an important issue about gun violence in America.\n  I think it is important for us from time to time to remind those who \nmight be just joining this conversation why we are here. You are \ncertainly a leader in this, as are Senator Blumenthal, Senator Booker, \nand so many others, because we have each in our own ways been touched \nby gun violence--the terrible tragedy that occurred at Sandy Hook in \nConnecticut, the tragedies we see every weekend and every day in the \ncity of Chicago, in Newark, and all across the United States. I thank \nthe Senator for bringing this to our attention. Certainly, it is \nOrlando that our attention is focused on these days.\n\n  As I understood your earlier statement, you came to the floor because \nthere was no indication from the Republican leadership that we will \neven\n\n[[Page S3914]]\n\nhave a debate on the issue of guns, terrorists, and keeping America \nsafe.\n  Senator Murphy came to the floor saying that he would hold the floor \nin the hopes that we can move this to the point where there is an \nactual debate in the Senate. That would be historic--a real debate in \nthe Senate about an issue that really means something. In Orlando, we \nfound what really means something with these grieving families of 49 \nvictims and 53 more who were seriously injured.\n  I want to make sure there is clarity as to what we are trying to seek \nwith this group gathering in terms of the two proposals, the two \namendments we are seeking. I ask the Senator to clarify. One relates to \nwhether someone who is suspected of being a terrorist can buy a weapon, \nsuch as an assault weapon, which literally killed 49 people in that \nnightclub in Orlando and could have killed many more--more than 50 were \ninjured. So if we suspect that a person is a terrorist and a threat to \nthe United States, can we slow them down or stop them from purchasing a \nmilitary-style weapon?\n  I think the Senator from Connecticut was very prescient in noting \nthat we think of terrorists and bombs, terrorists and airplanes, not \nwith automatic weapons and semiautomatic weapons. These terrorists have \nthe capacity to kill dozens of people, if not more.\n  So the first question is, What can we do to stop those suspected of \nterrorism from buying assault weapons and threatening us? The second \nquestion is, If we cannot stop them through the ordinary process of \ngoing to a gun store, how are we going to stop them if they decide to \nbuy a gun on the Internet or to buy a gun at a gun show where there is \nno background check?\n  I understand the Senator from Connecticut has suggested we need to \nclose the loopholes so that the roughly 40 percent of firearms sold \nwithout a background check in the United States is reduced dramatically \nand so that we know who is buying a gun and we can guns out of the \nhands of those who misuse them.\n  So if the Senator would state with clarity what our goal and \nobjective is in this now 3\\1/2\\-hour debate. I credit him with leading \nit, but I ask him to state with clarity--a question from me--what is \nour purpose, what is our goal and the reason we have taken the floor?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator. I am reclaiming my time. I thank the \nSenator for asking that question because I think it is important for us \nto be clear about why we are here. We are here not to hold the floor \nfor holding the floor's sake but because we have had enough of \ncondolences and thoughts and prayers without action from this body.\n  We think we have identified two commonsense measures that are \nsupported by the vast majority of the American public: making sure that \npeople who are suspected of being terrorists cannot purchase weapons \nand making sure that the background check system applies to all of the \ncommercial venues in which guns are sold.\n  We think it is time for us to have a debate on those two measures on \nthe floor of the Senate and to be able to get a vote--something this \nbody used to do a lot of--on those two measures. We have selected \nmeasures that are not controversial to the American public. They are \nsupported by 80 to 90 percent of Americans.\n  So we are holding the floor and we are standing on the floor today in \nanticipation of Republican and Democratic leadership coming to us and \nsaying: We are ready to talk about how we can make this country safer \nby keeping guns away from suspected terrorists. If we can get an \nagreement to have a vote on expanding background checks and including \npeople on the terrorist watch list on the list of those who are \nprohibited from having guns, then this debate we are having can stop \nand we can move forward to a vote.\n  I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for a question without yielding \nthe floor, I know the answer to this, but I want to ask this question \nfor the record. We have had votes on both of those measures. After San \nBernadino, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California came forward and \nasked the Senate to vote on the simple proposition that if someone's \nname appears on a terrorist watch list, they would not able to buy \nfirearms, and her effort failed. Similarly, a bipartisan measure by \nSenators Manchin and Toomey to close the loopholes so that there will \nbe background checks failed as well.\n  I would ask the Senator from Connecticut--and I know his response--\nwhy would we revisit two issues that have already been voted on in the \nSenate?\n  Mr. MURPHY. These are measures that can save lives. Facts have \nchanged. We have seen over and over again the carnage that comes by \nallowing these loopholes to persist. Yes, we have had debates on this \nfloor, but we have had debates and taken votes on this floor before. \nBut our hope is that our colleagues' eyes have been opened to the \nepidemic that persists in the absence of legislative action.\n  Our job is not to send condolences; our job is to debate legislation. \nMy hope, through the Chair to Senator Durbin, is that there are \ndiscussions happening right now on ways to bring the two parties \ntogether around moving these two issues forward. Our job is to debate \nand to vote, to go on the record, to show our constituents where we \nstand on these issues, and to find ways to achieve common ground. Our \nhope is that by holding up consideration of the CJS bill, we will \nprompt both sides to come together and find a path forward on these \nissues.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for one more question.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The CJS bill, incidentally, is a bill that includes the \nDepartment of Justice appropriations. We are raising this issue on a \nbill which has real relevance to the question of our national security \nand law enforcement in keeping America safe.\n  I would ask the Senator from Connecticut--we think of the tragedy \nthat occurred in your State with those 20 beautiful children who were \nkilled in their classroom at Sandy Hook. We think of what happened in \nSan Bernardino and what has happened across America and now most \nrecently in Orlando. But the point I tried to make earlier was that \nthose are mass murders--more than four people killed in each instance--\nbut for many of us, the urban violence that every day, every weekend is \nclaiming even more lives should also be our concern.\n  I mentioned to the Senator earlier that when the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco, Firearms and Explosives took a look at the crime guns that \nwere confiscated in the worst, deadliest sections of Chicago, 40 \npercent of them came from gun shows in northern Indiana, where people \ndid not submit themselves to a background check; they just went in and \nbought guns in volume to come and sell them to gangbangers and thugs on \nthe streets of Chicago.\n  Our intention is to focus clearly on mass murder but even more so on \ngun violence in America to protect innocent people who are losing their \nlives to those who would abuse the use of firearms and those who would \nturn to these assault weapons, which have no purpose for the legitimate \nhunter or sportsman. I have said that if you need an AK-47 or AR-15 to \nhunt a deer, you ought to stick to fishing because that is not the \nweapon of choice of real sportsmen in my State or those whom I know.\n  I ask the Senator, when it comes to this general issue of gun \nviolence, even though we speak of terrorists as part of this, how will \nclosing the loopholes have value to the overall issue of gun violence?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank Senator Durbin for the question. Illinois and \nConnecticut have amongst the toughest background check laws in the \nNation, but our laws are no good if the State next door to us has \namongst the weakest laws in the Nation. Our Nation's system of State-\nbased background check laws is only as strong as the weakest link. If \nwe don't have a national commitment to ensure that individuals who are \ncriminals or who are potential terrorists don't buy guns, then it \nreally doesn't matter what each State does. That is why this background \ncheck proposal, which is a bipartisan proposal and which is supported \nby 90 percent of Americans and 85 percent of gun owners, is such a win-\nwin, because it speaks to the very real fear that Americans have of \ncontinued terror attacks but also addresses this catastrophe of \nregular, everyday urban gun violence.\n\n[[Page S3915]]\n\n  By the time we are done today, Senator Durbin, probably 80 people--\nsomewhere in that neighborhood--will be killed by guns, many of them in \ncities throughout this country. This is a means to both get at the \nquestion of terrorist violence and at the question of urban gun \nviolence.\n  I thank the Senator for joining us on the floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee for a question.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, without losing his right to the floor, I \nthank my distinguished neighbor in New England and ask through the \nChair if he is aware that the Senate Judiciary Committee pushed for \nyears to close the glaring loopholes in the background check system to \ntry to prevent criminals from buying guns.\n  Is the Senator aware that today you could have three murder warrants \nand a conviction for armed robbery and walk to a gun show and buy any \nkind of weapon you want without having to go through a background check \nor have a license?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, through the Chair, I am.\n  I yield to the Senator for another question.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for another \nquestion without losing his right to the floor, the Senator knows that \nthree years ago the Judiciary Committee reported out these commonsense \nmeasures. We actually had broad support for measures to stop illegal \ngun trafficking, provide for universal background checks, and provide \ngrants for schools to improve their security and ban assault weapons. \nThe Senate Republicans filibustered our effort, which a majority of \nAmericans supported, to make commonsense reforms that would make our \ncountry safer. I do not even want to think about how many Americans--\nalthough I do every day--have been killed since then.\n  I believe I speak for most Americans when I say we are tired of the \nstatus quo. Congress has to act to keep guns out of the hands of \ncriminals and terrorists. My question to the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut is, in order for background checks to keep guns out of the \nhands of criminals and terrorists, do we need to give law enforcement \nnew tools--in other words, the tools we have now are not enough--to \nstop a suspected terrorist, or somebody who has recently been under \ninvestigation for terrorism, from buying a gun?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the question. We \nhave given law enforcement new tools to find people who are \ncontemplating political violence against American citizens; yet there \nis this gap in which law enforcement has information about an \nindividual's potential or real ties to terrorist groups, and we are not \nable to prevent them from buying a weapon. They are prevented from \nflying, but they are not prevented from buying a weapon. It is an \nabsolute necessity to give them those new tools and also to expand the \nreach of our background system so we can make sure protection exists \nthat no matter where that individual goes to buy a gun--whether they \nwalk into a gun store or a gun show--they will be prevented from buying \na weapon. There is a large loophole that exists today.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator for a question without losing \nmy right to the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a question \nwithout losing his right to the floor, we know that a person can go to \na gun show or go online and buy a gun without being subjected to a \nbackground or identification check.\n  One of our local newspapers had an article about a reporter who \ncommunicated with an individual online--they had never met before--and \nthen met that person in a parking lot and bought an assault weapon for \ncash. The person selling the weapon insisted on cash. When the reporter \nwas asked if he had any identification, he said that he preferred not \nto give him any. The seller of the weapon said: OK. You look old \nenough. The seller sold the weapon to him for $500 from the trunk of a \ncar.\n  I ask the Senator from Connecticut, through the Chair, if we made \nuniversal background checks mandatory and made it illegal to sell guns \nwithout a universal background check, might that make a difference?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I say through the Chair to the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee that of course it would make a \ndifference. What the Manchin-Toomey bill has always contemplated is \nthat sales that were advertised would be covered by background checks. \nThere would be limitations on relative-to-relative transactions, but if \nyou are engaged in any sort of commercial business where you are \nselling a firearm, whether it is at a gun show, gun store, or out of a \ntrunk, you would have to go through a background check before selling a \nweapon.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I again ask through the Chair if the \nSenator will yield further without losing the floor.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I yield for a question.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I consider myself a responsible gun owner. \nI think common sense tells us that if we have assault weapons that are \ndesigned for the battlefield, they really have no place on our streets, \nin our schools, in our churches, or in our communities. I move to \nsupport an assault weapons ban. We do not even allow them for hunting \nin Vermont.\n  Does the Senator agree with me?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I do agree with the Senator. We are both \nmembers of New England States. We are both members of States where \npeople enjoy hunting. I run into very few hunters who believe they need \nan AR-15-style weapon in order to enjoy their pastime.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know that Vermont has very few gun laws, \nbut we at least restrict the number of rounds that one can put in a \nsemiautomatic gun during deer season. I would like to see as much \nrestriction and protection for the children who are walking our \nstreets, the people in our churches or our synagogues, and the people \ngathering for social reasons as we do to protect the deer herd.\n  My final question is one that I get from Vermonters all the time. \nThese Vermonters--many are gun owners and many are not--are all \nrepulsed and saddened not just by what they saw this past weekend in \nFlorida but by what they see with numbing consistency on our news. Day \nafter day after day they see people being gunned down in the streets of \nAmerica. They ask me: What is Congress doing? They ask me why Congress \nis not responding by giving law enforcement the tools they need. \nCertainly law enforcement wants to stop this. I suspect the questions I \nget asked in Vermont are similar to the questions that my friend from \nConnecticut gets.\n  How do we respond to these Americans--thousands in Vermont and \nmillions throughout this country--who say: What in heaven's name are \nyou doing in Washington to make life safer for us?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Leahy for being such an \namazing champion and the author of many of the underlying protections \nthat we are talking about expanding and making more effective today. He \nis an absolute giant on the issue of protecting Americans from gun \nviolence.\n  We don't have to dig deep to understand why this body has an approval \nrating that rivals venereal disease. They think we spend all of our \ntime fighting, and they see big problems in this Nation, and this \nCongress is doing nothing to even attempt to solve it. This is a \nparamount example.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield without yielding \nthe floor?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I ask through the Chair if the Senator from Pennsylvania \nwill wait.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, my only problem is that I will be in the \nChair at 3 p.m., at which point I will not be able to participate in \nthe discussion.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I know and fully \nrespect the passion that both Senators from Connecticut, as well as \nmany others, have about this issue.\n  I am of the view that it is time to get something done. We have been \ndoing a\n\n[[Page S3916]]\n\nlot of talking. We have two alternatives to this issue about what to do \nwith people we have very good reason to believe are terrorists and what \nto do when they attempt to buy a gun.\n  We had a vote on a version that I think was badly flawed. It was \nbadly flawed because it provided no meaningful process for someone who \nis wrongly on the list. Errors happen. Actually, they happen all the \ntime. One thing is for sure; innocent people and law-abiding citizens \nwill eventually be on a terrorist watch list.\n  What I think we need to do is everything we can to make sure that \nterrorists are not able to buy guns--at least not legally--and we also \nneed to have a meaningful mechanism for people to challenge their \nstatus of being on that list, and that is what we haven't put together \nhere.\n  I think the Feinstein approach doesn't provide any meaningful \nopportunity to appeal one's being put on this list erroneously, and, \nfrankly, I think the Cornyn approach doesn't give the AG the \nopportunity that an AG needs to make a case against someone who is \nactually a terrorist.\n  There is an obvious opportunity to work together and find a solution. \nI have been speaking with some of my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, and I think there is an interest in doing this. What I am \nsuggesting is that we get to work. Let's sit down together and figure \nout how to achieve this. I think everybody ought to be in agreement in \nprinciple. We don't want terrorists to be able to walk into a gun store \nand buy a gun, and we don't want an innocent, law-abiding citizen to be \ndenied his Second Amendment rights because he is wrongly on the list \nwith a bunch of terrorists. This is not rocket science.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding the floor. I will take my turn in \nthe chair, but I would love to continue this conversation.\n  I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for giving me \nthis moment.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, reclaiming the floor, I thank the Senator \nfor his comments. We are here for the explicit purpose of trying to \nbring this body together in a way that can advance both of these \nissues--stopping terrorists from being able to buy guns and them making \nsure that the law covers as many forms as possible to make sure that \nthat prohibition is effective.\n  The frustration for us is that we have had 6 months since we last \ndebated that provision. If there were ways to come together, then we \nhave had 6 months to find that common ground. I take the Senator's \noffer very sincerely, but my hope is that by taking the floor today and \nnot moving on the CJS bill until we resolve these issues, we will \nprovide the impetus for our sides to come together and find that common \nground.\n  I thank the Senator for his participation and his question.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Minnesota for a question \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for \neverything he is doing today on the floor.\n  My question for the Senator is whether he is aware that a GAO report \nrequested by Senator Feinstein was released yesterday and provides \nupdated data on background checks involving terrorist watch list \nrecords.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am familiar with that report.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator for another question.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, allow me to briefly share some of the key \ndata points from this, and then I will pose another question. The \nreport provides that during the calendar year of 2015, the FBI's data \ndemonstrates that individuals on the terrorist watch list were involved \nin firearm-related background checks 244 times. The report further \nprovides that of those 244 times, 233 of the transactions were allowed \nto proceed and only 21 were denied. GAO helpfully points out that this \nmeans that potential terrorists were permitted to buy guns 91 percent \nof the time in 2015. Further, GAO provides that since the FBI began \nchecking background checks against terrorist watch lists in 2004, \nindividuals on such watch lists were permitted to purchase weapons \n2,265 times out of 2,477 requests or, again, 91 percent of the time.\n  I ask my friend from Connecticut: If we are allowing over 90 percent \nof people on the terrorist watch list to purchase deadly weapons here \nat home, does that not suggest that we aren't even coming close to \ndoing everything in our power to combat terrorism and address gun \nviolence?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the question and \nfor specifically referring to the GAO report.\n  Over 10 years, 91 percent of people who were on the terrorist watch \nlist who tried to buy a gun was successful in buying a gun--9 out of 10 \ntimes. The reason this is such an important issue that the Senator \nbrings up is because, as he knows, people who are trying to commit \npolitical crimes against Americans, people who are trying to commit \nacts of terror against Americans, are increasingly turning to the \nfirearm--to the assault weapon rather than to the IED or the \nexplosive--in order to perpetuate their terror attack. So as studies \nhave shown us--studies I referred to earlier today--the weapon of \nchoice in homegrown domestic terror attacks is the firearm. Why \nwouldn't we do everything in our power to take that weapon of choice \naway from those individuals? We are making this country less safe every \nday that we allow for 9 out of 10 individuals who are on the terrorist \nwatch list who seek to buy guns to buy them.\n  By the way, as the Senator knows, that 1 out of 10 isn't denied a gun \nbecause he is on the terrorist watch list, that 1 out of 10 is denied a \ngun because he is on another list, because that individual has \ncommitted a crime that has caused him to be prohibited from buying a \nweapon.\n  I yield to the Senator for a question.\n  (Mr. TOOMEY assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. FRANKEN. My last question for Senator Murphy concerns Senator \nFeinstein's legislation.\n  As has been discussed, Senator Feinstein's terror gap legislation \nwould give the Attorney General the discretion necessary to deny known \nor suspected terrorists from purchasing firearms or explosives so long \nas there is a reasonable belief that such a purchase would be used in \nterrorist-related activities. I am a strong supporter of this \nlegislation as a commonsense measure to keep guns out of the hands of \npotential terrorists and to take a significant step toward keeping our \ncommunities safer.\n  So my last question is whether the Senator believes this legislation \nwould be likely to make a real and significant difference in preventing \nthose on the terrorist watch list from getting guns they could use in \nacts of mass violence?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank my friend for coming to the floor \nand asking these questions and making these important points. Yes, this \nwould make a difference. It would make a difference because we know \nevery month there are people on the terrorist watch list who are trying \nto buy weapons. Not all of them are buying weapons for malevolent \npurposes, but we know individuals from the Boston bombers to the \nOrlando shooter were in the network of those who were being watched and \nmonitored by the FBI, and they were able to buy weapons despite that. \nThis would make a difference. If we were able to pair it, as we are \nrequesting, with an examination of background checks, that would also \nmake a difference for the thousands of people every month who are dying \non the streets of America due to our inability to stop illegal weapons \nfrom flowing into our communities. So I thank the Senator for his \nquestions.\n  I yield to the Senator from Connecticut who has been with me since \nthe very beginning. I yield to him for a question.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. And proudly so, along with our colleague from New \nJersey standing with you as a team here, joined by so many colleagues. \nI thank the Senator from Minnesota. I see that Senator Murray of \nWashington State has joined us. Thank you so much.\n  I am going to ask a quick question, and then I have other questions I \nam going to ask afterward, but I want to pursue a point our \ndistinguished colleague from Vermont raised about the perception of \nAmericans who can't get that we can't get things done here. There are \nmany issues and problems beyond our control. There are many issues and \nproblems we cannot affect.\n\n[[Page S3917]]\n\nThe state of the economy, perhaps, we can impact. World problems seem \nintractable a lot of the time.\n  Here are commonsense, straightforward measures where the Senate of \nthe United States and the Congress can get the job done--at least save \nlives. It is really that important. We can save lives if we do the \nright thing. The Senate has been complicit by its inaction in the loss \nof those lives--30,000 every year. Some of them at least could be saved \nby saying and putting into law the very simple proposition that if \nsomebody is too dangerous to fly, if that person is on a watch list \nunder an investigation, then they should be deemed too dangerous to buy \na gun. They are at least as dangerous as a convicted felon who is now \nbarred from buying a gun.\n  I wish to ask my colleague from Connecticut--the two of us have \nspoken to so many people across the country, some of them survivors of \ngun violence, families who have lost loved ones to gun violence, and \nothers who are simply citizens who watch this carnage, not only in \nSandy Hook and Orlando but on the streets of Hartford, moms and dads \nwho have lost children and brothers and sisters. Isn't this issue of \ngun violence and terrorist attacks one of the signature issues of our \ntime in showing the American people our government can work? We have \ntalked about the message it sends to our allies. I asked a question \nabout that point. We have talked about the message it sends to law \nenforcement, such as the FBI, but to the American people the failure to \nact not only makes the Senate complicit in a moral sense in those lives \nlost but undermines the credibility and trust of the American people in \ntheir government to protect them, to achieve the most basic assignment \nthey give us, to make America safe and secure--safe and secure from the \nbad men like Adam Lanza, who killed 20 innocent children and sixth-\ngrade educators, or the homegrown terrorist inspired and supported by \nISIS or sent here by some foreign terrorist organization, or the \ntwisted haters who are bigoted against LGBT or some other group. This \nsignature issue is about keeping America safe and giving our law \nenforcement authorities and our protectors the powers they need to do \ntheir job.\n  So I ask my colleague from Connecticut--we have joined today in \nthis effort--is there a message to the American people here, that we \nare sending the message that enough is enough but also enough killing \nis enough, enough inaction is enough, we have seen enough, the time for \naction is now?\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator. I think the question is simply: Why \nare you here--you asked for this job--if you didn't want to confront \nthe big questions and the big problems?\n  Nobody denies that this is an epidemic of criminal proportions. \nNobody denies that this is happening only in the United States and \nnowhere else in the industrialized world. Nobody denies that crippling, \nnever-ending grief that comes with a loved one being lost. Yet we do \nnothing. We just persist this week as if it is business as usual. Why \ndid you sign up for this job if you are not prepared to use it to try \nto solve big problems?\n  I appreciate the hope of my friend from Pennsylvania that we can find \ncommon ground. We have had a long time to find common ground. We have \nhad 4 years since those kids were slaughtered in Sandy Hook to find \ncommon ground, but we haven't, which is why we are here today--to \ndemand that we are not going to go along with business as usual any \nlonger until we come together on at least two of the proposals that 90 \npercent of the American public supports.\n  I yield to the Senator from Washington for a question without losing \nmy right to the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a question, \nfirst of all, I thank the Senator for bringing attention to this \ncritical issue and for everything that he is doing to fight for more \nthan just thoughts and prayers but actually for action. Few Senators \nhave a better firsthand understanding of this issue and the impact it \nhas on our families and our communities and the urgent need to address \nit.\n  As we mourn for the victims and families who were impacted by the \nhorrific violence and terror against LGBT and Latino Americans in \nOrlando on Sunday, we are once again reminded that no one is safe from \nthe horrific epidemic of gun violence in our country--not even in our \nschools, which should be safe havens for our students.\n  I know the Senator knows this all too well. My home State of \nWashington is no stranger to this as well. In 2014, a man walked into \nan academic hall at Seattle Pacific University in Seattle, shooting \nthree students and taking the life of a freshman. Later that very same \nyear, a 15-year-old boy shot five other students, killing four, at \nMarysville Pilchuck High School in Marysville, with his dad's gun. \nThose shootings were devastating to parents, siblings, friends, and \nteachers--to our entire community. Those are just two examples in my \nhome State.\n  In Newtown, and across the country, there are too many shootings in \nschools to even name. According to a report from Everytown, from 2013 \nto 2016, we had 188 shootings at schools across the country. Not all \nwere mass murders; some just a gun going off in the air, other students \nwere wounded, others were attempts at self-harm. That is terrifying in \na school when a shotgun goes off; that noise, what happens to the kids \naround it, and it is frightening to me that this is not letting up.\n  It sickens me actually that in America today parents have to wonder \nif their children will be safe when they send them off to school or \nwhen they go to a movie theater or a mall or even on a street in their \nown neighborhood. Every time there is a new mass shooting, I get the \nsame question from the people I represent in Washington State: What is \nCongress going to do to stop this?\n  It is frustrating to me that every time I come back with the same \nanswer, ``We have been blocked from doing anything,'' in response to my \nconstituents and the people across the country. People are asking and \nbegging for us to do something--anything--to stop this scourge of gun \nviolence that has once again been splashed across the front pages of \nour newspapers and on our TV screens.\n  I say to Senator Murphy, I know you are talking about a number of \nissues around gun violence today. We all so appreciate it, but I wanted \nto come here today to specifically ask you: Can you talk a little bit--\nbecause you have seen it firsthand--about how this impacts our students \nin particular?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for that question in particular. I \nthink back to where I was--and I think we all can remember with \nspecificity where we were when we first heard about Sandy Hook, when we \nfirst heard that there were 20 dead children lying on the floor of \ntheir first-grade classrooms. I was with my little kids. I was with my \nthen-1-year-old and 4-year-old on a train platform in Bridgeport, CT, \ngetting ready to go down to New York to see the Christmas tree \ndisplays. They were so excited about that to go down. I remember having \nto tell them I had to go to work, and I left them and my wife on that \ntrain platform as we told them the trip was off.\n  I am here today, as I think all of us are, because this is personal \nto us. My oldest, who was 4 years old then, is this week in his final \nweek of first grade--first grade--the same year as those kids who were \nkilled in Sandy Hook. And so, I think in deeply personal terms about \nwhat Sandy Hook means to the kids who survived in addition to the \nfamilies who lost loved ones. There is no recovery for that community. \nIt is still a community in crisis. There are waves and ripples of \ntrauma that never end. I think about the reality of what it is to be a \nkid in school today, being increasingly in an environment that seems \nmore like a prison than it does a place of learning, going through \nmetal detectors, performing active shooter drills, and having to live \nin a perpetual state of fear that somebody is going to walk into your \nschool with a gun or there is going to be a gunfight that breaks out \nbetween students. That is no way to learn and that is no way to live.\n\n  So I think almost all of us on this floor, Republicans and Democrats, \nare either parents or grandparents, and we know what a horrific reality \nit must be to live with that fear as a child, and how little solace we \ngive parents when we do nothing. At least, as a parent, if Congress \nwere acting to try to make the next mass shooting less likely, you\n\n[[Page S3918]]\n\ncould maybe hold your head a little higher and your back a little \nstraighter when you are telling your kids it is going to be all right, \nbut there are a lot of parents who are so angry with us because they \ndon't think we are keeping their kids safe.\n  Senator Murray, I thank you for framing it in the eyes of kids \nbecause we think about it in terms of stopping someone from committing \na crime or about how a background check system works, but when we stop \nthese shootings, it is really about protecting those kids.\n  I yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I appreciate the Senator's response because, to me, \nthere are multiple layers, but certainly if we are not doing anything \nto provide that safety for our young kids in this country, we are not \nliving up to our responsibility as adults today. It is horrific for a \nparent to get that text home saying there has been a school lockdown. \nIt is even worse if the consequences are real. It seems to me, the \nSenator is right to be out here today discussing and bringing attention \nto it and doing more than just saying, ``Let's do something,'' but \nreally forcing us to make sure we are doing something, and I thank the \nSenator.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator from Washington.\n  Before yielding to the Senator from Michigan, let me note there are a \nnumber of House Members who have joined us on the floor. I thank them \nfor their support in our effort to force a debate and discussion on the \nfloor of the Senate today. I would note that of the House Members who \nhave joined today, there have been a number from different States who \nhave joined us. Representative Langevin was on the floor. I am \nparticularly proud of all five Members from Connecticut who have \nstopped by on the floor for these proceedings, and I know we will \nexpect more with that.\n  I yield to Senator Peters for a question without losing my right to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. PETERS. I would like to thank my colleague from Connecticut for \nyielding the floor for a question.\n  While I intend to ask my colleague from Connecticut shortly about the \ninteraction between closing the terror gap for gun purchasers and \nexpanding background checks, I would first like to take a moment to \nmourn the loss of the 49 people who were killed and recognize the \ndozens more who were wounded in the worst mass shooting our Nation has \never seen.\n  While my heart goes out to all the families and friends of the \nvictims, today I would like to honor two Michigan men who lost their \nlives that night. Tevin Crosby and Christopher Andrew Leinonen, who \nwent by the name of Drew.\n  Tevin was only 25. He was born in North Carolina, and he came to call \nMichigan home after finishing school and starting his own marketing \nbusiness in Saginaw. Total Entrepreneurs Concepts is the name of the \ncompany. Founded just last year, his business already employs about 20 \npeople and handles marketing for Fortune 500 companies. Tevin had \nrecently visited family in North Carolina to watch several nieces and \nnephews graduate before traveling to Florida to see friends and \ncolleagues.\n  Drew was 32, and grew up in metro Detroit before moving to Orlando \nwith his mother. He became a civically minded activist early in life, \nstarting a gay-straight alliance in high school before studying \npsychology and becoming a licensed mental health counselor. He recently \nwon the Anne Frank Humanitarian Award for his work in the gay \ncommunity.\n  Drew was at Pulse with his partner, Juan Guerrero, who also lost his \nlife that night. Now, instead of potentially helping them plan a \nwedding one day, their loving families are planning a joint funeral. \nThey want their sons to be side-by-side as their friends and family pay \ntheir respects and bid them farewell.\n  Orlando's events serve as a stark reminder that the fight for \nequality in this Nation for LGBT Americans must not end with marriage \nequality. We still live in a nation where Americans can face \ndiscrimination and even be killed simply because of whom they love. We \ncannot tolerate violence that targets any individual based on their \ngender, sexuality, race, or religion.\n  This horrific incident raises a number of questions. Was it a hate \ncrime, an act of terrorism, an outgrowth of ease in which individuals \nin this country can purchase deadly weapons with high-capacity \nmagazines or the heinous actions of a self-radicalized young man \ninspired by and swearing allegiance to ISIS? The answer to all these \nquestions is yes.\n  I urge my colleagues and Americans across the country to resist \npainting this tragedy in simple, reductive terms. This attack was a \nhate crime. This attack was an act of terrorism. Yes, this attack \nspeaks to the disturbing ease with which dangerous firearms can be \nacquired in our Nation. The problems that led to this tragedy are \ncomplex, but complexity is not an argument for inaction.\n  We need to start somewhere. Thoughts and prayers can be meaningful \nand are certainly powerful, but we need to do more than just offer our \nthoughts and prayers. Now is the time for action. As Senators, we have \nno higher duty than keeping the American people safe. This includes \ntaking the fight to ISIS overseas with our allies and vigilant law \nenforcement here at home. My colleague from Connecticut has been \ndiscussing two simple critical changes we can make to help prevent gun \nviolence in our Nation, including the acts of terror like we have seen \nin Orlando. We need to keep guns away from those who shouldn't have \nthem. This includes individuals who have been convicted of domestic \nviolence offenses, people with court orders related to stalking, and \nconvicted felons. These groups are already barred under Federal law \nfrom purchasing or otherwise possessing firearms, and this is enforced \nthrough background checks.\n  It is also painfully clear that we need to keep guns out of the hands \nof terrorists. This is why we need to close the terror gap and prevent \nindividuals on terrorist watch lists from purchasing firearms. \nUnfortunately, however, closing the terror gap and enforcing gun safety \nlaws cannot be effective without universal background checks. It \ndoesn't matter if we ban selling guns to people on the terror watch \nlist if large percentages of purchasers avoid background checks by \nbuying a gun at a gun show or over the Internet.\n  A story from our neighboring State, Wisconsin, haunts me as an \nexample of violence that could have been stopped. Recently, a Wisconsin \nman subject to a restraining order from his estranged wife--a man who \nwas barred under current law from purchasing a gun--was able to take \nadvantage of the private seller loophole and purchase a weapon without \na background check. He then confronted his wife at the spa where she \nworked. He killed her and two others, injured four more people, before \nturning the gun on himself.\n  Just like our current law bans gun sales to those convicted of \ndomestic violence or with restraining orders in place against them, \nclosing the terror gap will only be fully effective if we have \nuniversal background checks.\n  My question to the Senator from Connecticut is, Will closing the \nterror gap alone prevent the sale of weapons to potential terrorists in \nthe United States or will we need universal background checks to ensure \nthat these individuals are not able to exploit the loopholes in the \ncurrent law?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator from Michigan for asking the question \nthat is the crux of this debate. It is our responsibility to do \neverything within our power to protect Americans from terrorist \nattacks. The reality is, terrorist attacks can come in many different \nforms, but recently it has been coming through one form; that is, \nfirearms, and often very lethal, military-style firearms. So it is our \nduty to do everything possible to protect Americans from that new trend \nin terrorist attacks. The Senator is right. The answer to the question \nis, simply putting suspected terrorists on the list of those prohibited \nfrom buying weapons is not enough because 40 percent of gun sales today \nare not happening in places where background checks are conducted. We \nhave to do both.\n  It is not a secret that someone can go online to arms lists and \neasily get a weapon in minutes without having to go through a \nbackground check. It is full of holes like Swiss cheese. There is \nlimited utility in passing an inclusion for people on the terrorist \nwatch list for those prohibited from buying weapons unless we do the \nsecondary bill we\n\n[[Page S3919]]\n\nare asking for. As Senator Durbin and I have talked about a number of \ntimes this afternoon, expanding background checks also has a double \nbenefit of addressing this secondary epidemic of urban gun violence, \nwhich is often perpetrated by individuals who have illegal weapons. Law \nenforcement, police chiefs, and guys on the frontlines in our cities \nwill state that if we force every gun sale through a background check \nor virtually every commercial sale through a background check, we will \nhave fewer firearms on our street, and there will be less carnage on \nthe streets of Chicago, New Orleans, and Baltimore.\n  The answer to the question is, yes, we have to do more to protect \nAmericans from terrorist attacks, but we also have to address this \nongoing slaughter that often doesn't rise to the level of getting on \nnational news but is a reality in our cities.\n  I yield to the Senator from Michigan for a question, if he has a \nquestion.\n  Mr. PETERS. I don't, but I think that sums it up. I hope this body \nwill come together to take up this important legislation, this \namendment. If these two measures are separated into two potential \nvotes, as we hear may happen, I hope we all understand that we can't \nvote for one and not the other and think we are really dealing with \nthis issue. If we only block someone on a terrorist list but do not \nrequire universal background checks, it is basically a vote that may \nsound good but is simply not going to be effective in dealing with this \nhorrible situation and dealing with the incident I mentioned from \nWisconsin. These stories happen every day. It may not capture the \nnational media like the horrible, tragic event we saw in Orlando, but \nthe devastation to the families is every bit as real every single day. \nIt is the obligation of this body to step up. I appreciate that answer. \nI appreciate my colleague from Connecticut for standing up on this \nissue, and I look forward to working closely with you to address this.\n  Mr. MURPHY. The Senator from Pennsylvania is on the floor with an \nincredibly important and tragically on-point piece of legislation.\n  I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania for a question without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. CASEY. I thank the Senator from Connecticut who has taken the \nfloor to take a stand for those who lost their lives in Orlando and so \nmany other places. I know he has lived through that horror, \nrepresenting folks in Connecticut, who went through the horror in 2012.\n  I have a question about why we have to take action. I want to set \nforth a predicate first. The numbers here are just startling when you \nconsider in the context of just the last couple of days--49 dead and so \nmany others--so many others are grievously, and I hope not permanently, \ninjured and all the devastation that means.\n  Another number that we probably don't talk about enough and it is a \nmuch larger number. It is a number above 33,000--33,000 Americans lose \ntheir lives to gun violence every year. That is hard to comprehend. We \nhave lost numbers like that in wars that go over multiple years. So \n33,000 is the number. We have to ask ourselves why in the face of that \nwhether it is Orlando or Newtown or Aurora or Tucson or go down the \nlist of mass shootings. By the way, mass shootings were not a part of \nAmerican life when I was growing up in 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. This is \na rather new phenomenon--a very recent vintage. But when a tragedy and \na crime like this happens and the scale of it is so immense, we have to \nask ourselves, is there something we can do?\n\n  The answer by a lot of Democrats has been, yes, we can do a number of \nthings. We can say finally that we can ban military-style weapons so we \ndon't have to have them on our streets. We can take action instead of \njust debating and expressing solidarity and sympathy and mourning. That \nis appropriate, but in addition to that, we can take action. We can \ntake action on military-style weapons. We can take action on limiting \nthe amount of clips and the amount of bullets any one person can fire \nat any one time.\n  I am convinced, for example, based on the evidence we saw in Newtown \nat Sandy Hook Elementary School that the Senator from Connecticut \ntalked about--the most horrific way those children died--based upon the \nevidence, I am convinced that the killer, if he had more time, would \nhave killed hundreds of children and that number would have gone far \nabove the horrific number of 20. So we can take action on that and make \nsure that at least maybe that criminal, maybe that killer won't have a \nmilitary-style weapon and won't have an unlimited supply of ammunition.\n  We can also take action on background checks. We tried that. We got \nthe most votes of any of the three votes we took in 2013. But we should \ncertainly vote on that again and take action. That is a third way of \ntaking action. We have had bipartisan consensus on that but not enough. \nFrankly, there were not enough Republican votes to pass background \nchecks, which 90 percent of the American people support. It is hard to \ncomprehend why 90 percent support it and not enough Members of our \nSenate.\n  We can also take action on mental health reforms. That, too, has been \nbipartisan, but that hasn't happened. That is another way to take \naction.\n  What I am trying to do is to focus on the other aspect or at least \nthe additional aspect of this tragedy in Orlando, which is, as the \nPresident said, I said, and a lot of people said, this was an act of \nterrorism, but it was also an act of hate. Unless we begin to do \nsomething about the problem of hate in America, which infuses the \nhorrific actions killers take, unless we take action against that in \nsome fashion, we are not going to solve this problem.\n  One of the things we could do--again, we have a long list of things \nto do to deal with gun violence, to reduce that number of 33,000 \nAmericans dying every year because the Congress of the United States \nrefuses to take any action at all. But this is what my bill would do, \nand it is very simple. It would say: If you have been convicted of a \nmisdemeanor hate crime, in order to meet the requirements of this law, \nthere is a two-part test. It would have to be a misdemeanor hate crime \nthat fit this two-part test.\n  First, it would have to be either an act of violence that was part of \na conviction or an attempt to use violence or an action directed at \neither the attempt, the use, or the actual use of force or violence.\n  Second, in addition to that, the crime and the conviction would have \nto be a hate crime motivated by hate or bias against eight groups of \nAmericans who are in what we call the law-protected class.\n  First, if someone committed a hate crime against someone because of \ntheir race--and that is on the rise. We are told by the experts that \nthere are over 890--the number they put is 892--there are 892 hate \ngroups in the United States of America. Over 190 of them are the Ku \nKlux Klan. All of that is part of this problem, the rise of hate \ncrimes, the rise of hate groups. Hate groups who are directing violence \nand other actions against African Americans--that is on the rise. Hate \ngroups who are targeting Muslims--that is on the rise. Hate groups who \nare targeting people with disabilities--that is on the rise. And of \ncourse, as we saw horrifically in Orlando, hate crimes--in this case, \nthere were 49 people killed because of animosity toward LGBT Americans.\n  So you are engaged in hateful actions that rise to the level of the \ndefinition of this bill, and you are directing that at someone because \nof their race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual \norientation, gender identity, or disability. So if you are directing \nhateful actions against Americans who are in those classes, that would \nmeet the definition of a misdemeanor hate crime. The consequence of \nthat, the consequence of a conviction or the consequence of a sentence \nenhancement because of a hate crime, would be that you would be denied \na firearm. That is just one of many ways that we can make sure \nsomeone's hate is checked at a much lower level. I don't want to wait \nuntil that hate manifests itself in a felony conviction where there is \na much graver crime that has been perpetrated because of hate, because \nyou are directing your hate through violence against individuals \nbecause of their race or because of whom they love or because of some \nother reason. So this is one of several ways I think we can act.\n  The list gets longer. Obviously we are at a point now where we might \nbe able\n\n[[Page S3920]]\n\nto vote on finally taking action on the terrorist watch list. Why is it \nthat if you are too dangerous to be on an airplane, you are not too \ndangerous to have a weapon or to have a high-powered weapon, a \nmilitary-style weapon, with unlimited ammunition to shoot at anyone you \nwant?\n  There are a lot of things we can do, and that is why I pose the \nquestion to the Senator from Connecticut about what we can do and what \nwe should do.\n  I wanted to make a point as well before I pose the exact question. We \nknow that in Orlando three of the victims were from Philadelphia, my \nhome State. They were in that nightclub in Orlando when the gunman \nopened fire.\n  Eighteen-year-old Akyra Murray's family took her and two friends, \nPatience Carter and Tiara Parker, on vacation from Philadelphia to \nOrlando to celebrate Akyra Murray's graduation from West Catholic Prep \nHigh School. The Presiding Officer, my colleague from Pennsylvania, \nknows where that high school is, as I do. She had a full basketball \nscholarship to Mercyhurst University, which is at the other end of our \nState in northwestern Pennsylvania. She was third in her class. She \njust happened to be in Orlando and happened to be in that club when her \nlife was ended. They were there that night to dance and to laugh. She \nwas 18 years old and not even a resident of that area. Both Parker and \nCarter were injured in the attack, but Akyra Murray lost her life.\n  Our hearts break--everyone in this Chamber, I know--our hearts break \nfor her family. Our prayers are with Patience Carter and Tiara Parker \nas they recover.\n  Sadly, the LGBT community isn't alone in experiencing this hate that \nI spoke of a moment ago. One year ago this Friday marks the 1-year \nanniversary of the massacre at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, SC. At \nthis historically African-American church--the oldest AME church in the \nSouth, often referred to as ``Mother Emanuel''--a racist young man with \nhate in his heart opened fire and took nine shots.\n  We all know the very moving speech the President gave that day or in \nthe days after. One of the things the President said was that we have \nto recognize the uncomfortable truth of that tragedy, and that truth is \nstaring us in the face today. It still stares us in the face.\n  I think we must act. When we consider the 33,000 people who are \nkilled every year by gun violence, the 43,000 hate crimes committed \nwith a firearm over the course of just 4 years--43,000 hate crimes over \n4 years with a firearm--when we consider those numbers, we have a long \nway to go.\n  I ask my colleague from Connecticut a two-part question. Why is it \nthat when these things happen, these horrific events, we have some \npeople--and this is part of the debate--when we say we need to take \naction or ask ``Will you join us in taking action?'' their answer is \n``We just have to enforce existing laws, and that is as far as we can \ngo. We can't do anything more than that. We just have to enforce \nexisting laws.'' So I would ask that part of the question. The second \npart is, if we believe the answer to that question is ``No, we can do \nmore,'' what is it we should be doing?\n  I pose this because I have to only wonder and imagine, really imagine \nin horror, what if that was our answer? What if that was our answer on \nSeptember 12, 2001, and the days after that? What if we said at the \ntime ``You know what. This is a horrific event, what happened on 9/11. \nThree thousand people were killed, and the country was shaken to its \ncore. But terrorism is a difficult problem to solve. We will always be \ndealing with it. We should just enforce existing laws.'' No, we didn't \ndo that. We said ``No, we are going to stop this from happening. We are \ngoing to take action so that planes won't be flying into buildings and \nkilling thousands of people. We are going to take action to stop \nthat.''\n  Guess what. People came together in this country, from one end of the \ncountry to the other, and we solved that problem. It hasn't happened. \nNow, we have had other terrorist attacks. We know that. We know we will \ncontinue to fight terrorism. But we solved part of the problem because \nwe came together. We even opened up a new Federal Government agency, \nfor goodness' sake, the Department of Homeland Security, which has made \nour country safer.\n  We have a long way to go on this issue, but I am pleased that we \nanswered that question with a determined effort and with a consensus \nacross this city, this center of government, and across the country \nthat, no, we are not going to surrender to the terrorists. We are going \nto take action to stop them from getting on airplanes. Why is it that \nwe are not taking the same approach to gun violence? It is complicated, \nand it is difficult to solve this problem, but why not take a series of \nactions that in and of themselves will not solve the problem, but we \ncan at least take action?\n  I ask the Senator from Connecticut, why is it that the answer by so \nmany people who serve in Congress is that there is not much we can do \nexcept enforce the law? And if we can take these actions, which I \nbelieve we can, what is it we can do?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for his question, for his passion, \nand for his ability to articulate how complicated this issue is and the \ncomplicated nature of the motivations that led to the shooting in \nOrlando, which is why the Senator's legislation that would elevate the \ntreatment of hate crimes with respect to the prohibitions on gun sales \nis so critically important. I hope we have time to debate that as well.\n  It is imperative that we act right now, and it is within our power to \nchange the reality that exists every day on the streets of America and \nwith respect to these mass shootings. What we have is loads and reams \nof data from State experiences to tell us that when you take these \ncommonsense steps--such as applying background checks to a broader \nrange of gun sales--you have a dramatic reduction in the number of \nhomicides that are committed, you have a dramatic reduction in the \nnumber of people who are killed.\n  There is no doubt that we have the ability to do something. You are \nright that there is a panoply of measures we need to consider. We have \nsuggested starting with the two that are the least controversial. Start \nwith the two that have broad support of the American public. Start with \nan expansion of background checks to gun shows and internet sales and \nthe inclusion of people on the terrorist watch list, of those who are \nprohibited from buying guns.\n  There are the two on which there is no controversy outside of this \nbody, so that would be a nice start. Then we can get to working on all \nof those other measures that will truly end up in substantial change--a \nchange in reality for people who have lived with this epidemic every \nday.\n  I thank the Senator for his questions and for his passion on this \nissue.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I yield to the Senator from Oregon for a question without \nyielding control of the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague, Senator Murphy. I thank him, Senator \nBooker, and Senator Blumenthal for what they have done today.\n  Here is the bottom line for me, Senator Murphy and colleagues. Mass \nshootings are now happening like clockwork in America: Thurston, \nColumbine, Blacksburg, Tucson, Newtown, Aurora, Charleston, Roseburg, \nand Orlando. Communities are being torn apart like clockwork by \nunspeakable gun violence. In this building we come together now for \nmoments of silence honoring the victims of these shootings like \nclockwork, and, like clockwork, this Congress does nothing about it.\n\n  When I was home last month, I visited Umpqua Community College, just \noutside of Roseburg, which was the site of a horrendous shooting 8 \nmonths ago--one of the deadliest school shootings in our Nation's \nhistory. What I saw at Umpqua Community College, what I heard from \nthose at the school and the families in the community is, I am sure, a \nlot like what my friend from Connecticut hears about how the suffering \ndoesn't go away.\n  The 1-year anniversary of the shooting in Charleston, SC, is coming \nup soon. I am quite sure it is the same way for people in South \nCarolina. The trauma, the process of mourning, rebuilding, and then \ntrying to find a way somehow, some way to move forward\n\n[[Page S3921]]\n\nfrom the enveloping grief is a horrendous experience and a common \nexperience now that so many of our communities share. The reality is \nthe trauma doesn't just vanish into the vapor. The news cameras are \neventually going to leave Orlando, just like they left Roseburg. The \nbullet holes in the nightclub will get patched up. The families and the \nfriends of the victims will try to live their lives the best they can, \nbut it is going to be such a difficult, difficult task for the LGBTQ \ncommunity in Orlando. But the trauma--the trauma--isn't vanishing.\n  So there is no perfect solution, but trauma ought to be followed up \nin a very concrete way with some specific constructive steps that begin \nto lay out an answer. It just seems to me that in the Senate and the \nCongress, the idea of following up with more moments of silence, with \nmore inaction, just isn't enough. There are common steps, practical \nsteps the Congress can take now.\n  Those who have argued that the only possible response to the shooting \nin Orlando can come in a war zone thousands of miles away are looking \nfor excuses not to do something--not to do something meaningful here at \nhome. There are steps that can be taken now to curb this violence. It \nwon't stop every crime--a number of the ideas have been discussed \nbefore--but the victims of the shootings are owed a response.\n  First, I know my colleagues have mentioned this already this \nafternoon, but Senator Feinstein has put forward a proposal to close \nthe dangerous terrorist gun loophole. I thought that was a sensible \nstep--common sense. People shouldn't look at that as a partisan issue. \nAmericans want to know why anyone would vote to allow individuals \nsuspected of terrorist ties and motivations to purchase regulated \nfirearms.\n  Next, close the loopholes. Close the loopholes in the background \ncheck. It is way past time to do that and to stop allowing the purchase \nof a gun online or at a gun show without a background check. Certainly, \nthe background checks themselves have to be substantially improved. \nThere are holes that ought to be plugged, including those that keep \nguns in the hands of somebody who has been a convicted domestic abuser. \nI am not talking about being charged or something that is speculative. \nWe are talking about a convicted domestic abuser.\n  Once and for all the Congress ought to close the pipeline for illegal \nguns, straw purchases, and gun trafficking. These ought to be Federal \ncrimes.\n  The Senator from Connecticut and I have also been strong advocates of \nbeefing up the research into gun violence. There has been a prohibition \non doing that. Say that one to yourself--a prohibition on doing \nresearch into gun violence. It just defies common sense. It makes no \nsense at all to block the Centers for Disease Control from gathering \ninformation that can help our communities and our families be safe.\n  I am just going to wrap up by getting personal for a moment. My late \nbrother suffered from serious mental illness. Senator Murphy, not a day \nwent by--not a day went by--when I wasn't worried that my brother, who \nwas a schizophrenic, would be out on the streets and would either hurt \nhimself or would hurt somebody else. That was the case with my family. \nIt is time to establish once and for all a system through which \nindividuals who are found to be a potential threat to themselves or \nothers can get the treatment they need. I see my colleague from \nMichigan here. She has championed this effort year after year after \nyear.\n  I am not going to recap the proposals. Some of them have been \ndiscussed at length here on the floor. But a majority of Americans \nfinds these kinds of commonsense gun safety measures not to be ones \nthat infringe on the rights of responsible gun owners or violate the \nSecond Amendment or even come close to it. A majority of gun owners \nthink these proposals make sense.\n  So this is what I would like to ask my colleague from Connecticut, in \nterms of an update, because my colleague from Connecticut has been a \nleader in this effort. Senator Feinstein's proposal, of course, is \ndesigned to prevent those on the watch list from buying guns. Numbers \nhave been thrown around repeatedly about the number of people this \nwould actually impact. I know the General Accounting Office has looked \ninto this. Can the Senator tell me how many people on this watch list \nhave been able to buy a gun?\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank Senator Wyden for his question. It is a really \nimportant one because the number is certainly shocking for how high it \nis and how low it is at the same time. Let us take 2015. In 2015, there \nwere 244 individuals who were on the terrorist watch list who attempted \nto buy weapons, and 223 of those were successful in buying the weapon. \nSo in 90 percent of the occasions in which someone on the terrorist \nwatch list attempted to buy a weapon, they walked out of that store \nwith the weapon.\n  Now, it gives you, A, a sense of the scope of this. There are only \n224 people over the course of the whole year who were on the terrorist \nwatch list and who attempted to buy a weapon. But what we know from \nthis weekend is it only takes one with malevolent intentions to create \na path of death and destruction that is almost impossible to calculate. \nIt is just impossible for the American public to understand how that \nnumber persists--how we allow for 90 percent of the people on that \nwatch list to walk into a store and to successfully buy a weapon.\n  That is the number from 2015--223 out of 244 were successful.\n  I yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague, and I will just wrap up by way of \nsaying that it seems to me that what has been learned here is that \nwhile the investigation goes on, there may have been a terrorist \nattack, there may have been a hate-inspired attack. My question is \nthis: Aren't the steps I have outlined here today commonsense, \npractical steps, whether it is a hate-inspired attack? We have seen the \nhuman toll that discrimination takes against those who are targeted on \nthe basis of hate. We have seen what it means to families who have been \nstruck by terror. But aren't the steps that have been outlined here by \nyou and colleagues on the floor--Senator Casey, with his very valuable \nproposal--commonsense legislative efforts that make sense whether this \nhas been primarily a terror attack or a hate-inspired attack?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for his question. Of course they are \ncommonsense measures, and, importantly, they are measures that are \nsupported by the broad cross-section of the American public. What my \ncolleague is proposing is only controversial here in the Senate. It is \ncontroversial nowhere else in this country.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I see colleagues waiting, and I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts for a question, \nthrough the Chair, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Ms. WARREN. I thank my colleague.\n  Last Saturday, I was in Boston for our annual Pride Parade. They are \npractically an institution in Boston, and this marked our 46th annual \nmarch. I have gone to Pride for years, and when I go, I don't march, I \ndance. I dance with people--young people and old people, Black people \nand White people, Asian people and Latino people, gay people and \nstraight people, bisexual people, transgender people, queer people. The \nparade has everything. It has intricate floats, marching bands, \nelaborate costumes, and tons of onlookers.\n  One Boston reporter called our parade pure joy, and he is right. I \nlove Boston's Pride Parade. I love it as much as anything I have done \nas a Senator. For me, this parade is the tangible demonstration of what \nhappens when we turn away from darkness and division and turn toward \nour best selves, when we turn toward each other. It shows us what this \nNation looks like when we are at our best--inclusive, strong, united, \noptimistic, and proud. It shows us what this Nation looks like when we \nbeat back hate and embrace each other.\n  Early Sunday morning, at around 2 a.m., someone tried to take that \naway from us. It wasn't the first time. It was the most recent. It was \nextreme and horrible and shocking. Dozens of lives were lost, and \ndozens more were injured. All across our country we grieve for those \nlost and for their families and for their loved ones.\n  This is especially true in Massachusetts. Three years ago, the people \nof Boston came face-to-face with terror at\n\n[[Page S3922]]\n\nthe finish line of the Boston Marathon. The cowardly attack and its \naftermath took lives, injured people, and forever changed a beloved \ntradition. This week, two people with Massachusetts roots were killed \nin Orlando and at least two more were wounded.\n  Thirty-seven-year-old Kimberly ``KJ'' Morris, who was working the \ndoor at Pulse, had lived in Northampton, MA, for more than a decade, \nperforming in nightclubs and working at Amherst College and Smith \nCollege. She had recently moved to Florida to help take care of her \nmother and grandmother.\n  Twenty-three-year-old Stanley Almodovar, a pharmacy tech, spent his \nchildhood in Springfield, MA. He came out of the bathroom at Pulse just \nas the bullets were flying. He pushed people out of harm's way as he \nwas shot three times.\n  A third Massachusetts native who survived the massacre was also shot \nthree times. Angel Colon of Framingham, MA, was shot in the leg, the \nhand, and the hip. He is alive today, according to Colon, only because \nthe gunman missed his head as he shot those who were lying on the floor \nto make sure they were dead.\n  Thirty-seven-year-old Geoffrey Rodriguez, raised in Leominster, \nremains in critical condition now. Rodriguez was shot three times. As \nof Tuesday, he had undergone three surgeries. His family is optimistic \nhe will pull through, and all of us from Massachusetts and all across \nthe Nation are rooting for him.\n  Now, there are still things we don't know about the shooter. We don't \nknow about his planning, his motives--things we may never know. But \nhere is what we do know. We know the shooter called 911 and pledged \nallegiance to ISIS, declaring his intention to be known in history as a \nterrorist. We know he carried an assault-style weapon that was designed \nfor soldiers to carry in war. We also know that hundreds of people in \nOrlando went to the Pulse nightclub to continue their celebration of \nPride and that the shooter targeted them to die.\n  I woke up on Sunday morning still in the glow of the Boston Pride \nParade. That ended fast. But I thought about the history of Pride. In \nthe 1960s, the mere act of publicly associating with the LGBT community \nwas considered radical. That was true even in places where the \ncommunity came together to seek strength and protection, like New \nYork's Greenwich Village. Greenwich Village's Stonewall Inn was one of \nthe popular gay bars in New York, and it was regularly raided by police \nofficers who arrested patrons for any number of bureaucratic \nviolations, obviously designed to harass, embarrass, and abuse people \nwhose only crime was to want a place to be together. One night, in late \nJune of 1969, the bar's patrons fought back. The rioting continued \nintermittently for five nights, and it wasn't pretty. It reflected the \ndemands of the group for equality, for the same chances that other \nAmericans have to be themselves. A few months after that, LGBT \nactivists began planning for the first Pride march. It was set for the \nfollowing June to commemorate the Stonewall uprising. The idea was to \nuse that anniversary as an opportunity for the community to remind us \nall that they, too, are citizens, they, too, get to have some fun, and \nthey, too, are entitled to the same dignity and respect as every other \nAmerican. Over the years, the tradition expanded across this great \nNation, just as tolerance and acceptance expanded across this great \nNation. Pride both helped us move forward and showed us how far we have \nmoved together.\n  When terrible things like the Orlando shooting happen, we face \nimportant choices, as a country, as individuals, and as a community. \nWhen terrible things happen, we have to choose how we respond, and all \nof us will decide whether we are going to come together or splinter \napart. We have become a country that is defined by fear and hate--fear \nof each other and hatred for anyone who is different from ourselves. In \nthe America of fear and hate, we will alienate and isolate entire \ncommunities, creating even more fear and hate, and threatening further \nviolence. We will fracture as a people, splintering off into separate \ngroups, each fearing others and each seeking to serve only themselves. \nOr we can make the choice to come together. We can choose that no \ncommunity--no community of immigrants, no community of Muslims, no \ncommunity of young men--is isolated in this country. We can do this \nknowing that when we embrace each other and build one people out of \nmany, we become a stronger country--stronger because the bonds of \ncommunity prevent alienation, stronger because the bonds of community \nmake it harder to turn us against each other and break us apart, \nstronger because the bonds of community mean people can get help before \nit is too late.\n  We cannot ignore the fact that this massacre targeted an LGBT club, \nand we should learn from that and from the message of Pride. In \nOrlando, an act of terrorism was also an act of hate visited upon \npeople who came together in friendship and celebration. But the \npatriots at Stonewall showed us the way. They gave birth to a movement \nthat changed our Nation. They beat back hate. They showed us that \nchange is possible--that change for the better is possible. They showed \neveryone that love can triumph over fear and hate, that we can all come \ntogether. But, boy, they showed us that you have to work for it.\n  This is not an abstract idea. When it comes to our response to the \ntragedy in Orlando, we are already beginning to see the splintering of \nAmerica. One side shouts: It was a gun that killed all those people. \nThe other side shouts: It wasn't a gun; it was a terrorist that killed \nall those people. Through all of the shouting, we miss what should be \nobvious: It was a terrorist with a gun who killed all those people--a \nterrorist with hate in his heart and a gun in his hand who killed all \nthose people. It is time for us to acknowledge all of these truths and \nto come together to address them.\n  First, we must take the threat of terrorism seriously. We must \ncontinue to stop the flow of money to terrorist groups and to work with \nour allies to stop the movement of terrorists and disrupt hubs of \nradicalization abroad. Here at home, we need to make sure that our law \nenforcement agencies have the resources they need--funding, training, \nequipment. But we also need to make sure we have the resources to \nanalyze and counter radical propaganda. The war on terror is now fought \nonline, and we need to put our best forces online to fight back. We \nneed to work with people in our local communities--not isolate or \ndemonize them--to stop radicalization before it starts and to prevent \ntragedies before they occur and to show that nobody is kept out of the \nAmerican family because of how they look or talk or pray.\n  Second, we must take the threat from guns seriously. Our Nation is \nawash in the weapons of murder, and there are many things we can do to \naddress that. We can ban Rambo-style assault weapons. We can take these \nweapons of war off our streets. We can also close the terror gap.\n  The FBI should have the authority to block gun sales to anyone they \nbelieve is a terrorist. If someone cannot get on an airplane because \nthe FBI is concerned that they might be plotting to do harm against \nAmericans, then they shouldn't be able to walk into a store and buy a \nRambo-style assault weapon. We believe we can close the background \nchecks loophole. Anyone who cannot buy a gun because of a felony \nconviction or mental illness should not be able to go to a gun show or \ngo online and buy that same gun. We can act to make the next shooting \nless likely. We can act to reduce the likelihood that a disturbed \nindividual, a criminal, or a terrorist is again able to kill dozens \nwith a gun. If we fail to act, the next time someone uses a gun to kill \none of us--a gun that we could have kept out of the hands of a \nterrorist--then Members of this Congress will have blood on our hands.\n  But the truth is this is not just about Congress. It is about all of \nus. We all have choices. We have choices about how we are going to \ntreat our neighbors and our fellow citizens; choices about what we do \nwhen someone is targeted at a coffee shop because of their background \nor their looks or their race; choices about how we react when a friend \nor a coworker, a son or a daughter, tells us the truth about who they \nlove; and choices about how we treat our neighbors and fellow citizens \nwho don't look or talk or pray like we do. It is a scary world out \nthere. We all know that. Terrorism mutates into\n\n[[Page S3923]]\n\nnew and more dangerous forms. Terrorists have easy access to assault \nweapons that put us all at risk. And hate--plain, old-fashioned, naked, \nugly hate--still lurks in dark corners. It is a scary world. But \nAmerica is strongest when we work together, and all of us will decide \nwhether we come together or splinter apart.\n  We can keep weapons from those who would do us harm. We can make it \nharder for terrorism to take root in this country. We can drive the \nforces of hate out of our Nation. We can build a stronger, more united \nAmerica, and we can begin right here in the Senate. We can begin right \nnow.\n  With that, my question for the Senator from Connecticut is this: Do \nyou believe it is time for the Senate to act in the interest of the \nAmerican people and finally pass these commonsense, widely supported \nproposals to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for those \nincredibly powerful words making clear what our moral obligation is. \nOur moral obligation is to witness a crisis happening at our feet and \ndo something about it. Why have this job--one of the most powerful jobs \nin the world--if we are not going to exercise it to try to protect \nAmericans from harm?\n  So our choice--my choice, the choice of Senator Blumenthal, Senator \nBooker--is to say enough--enough of treating these mass shootings as if \nthey are just part of the American fabric and landscape, enough of \naccepting that 80 people will die every single day when there is no \nother country in the world in which this happens, enough of pretending \nlike there isn't anything we can do about it.\n  Senator Warren has outlined some basic commonsense bipartisan steps \nthat we can take to make this better, and the Senator is so right. This \nis our choice. There are only 100 of us. There are only 100 of us. We \ncan make the collective decision to do something about it.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I yield to the Senator from Oregon for a question without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  (Mr. GARDNER assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I begin by noting that the Senator from \nConnecticut and the Senator from Oregon have a common thread that runs \nbetween our two States. That common thread that runs between \nConnecticut and Oregon is that our two States have been the sites of \ntwo very deadly school shootings. At Sandy Hook in Connecticut, it was \nin mid-December 2012 when a madman armed for a war zone stormed into \nSandy Hook Elementary School and began a murderous rampage--a rampage \nthat ended with the death of 6 school staff and 20 little boys and \ngirls.\n  Not even 3 years later, a nightmare came to Roseburg, OR. Roseburg is \na quiet little town in southern Oregon. It is the town where I spent \npart of my childhood. It is a town where I went to first grade. It is a \ntown where I learned to swim in the Umpqua River. As I said last \nOctober, if this can happen in Roseburg, it can happen anywhere. But \nhappen in Roseburg it did. It was October 1, 2015. It was a beautiful \nautumn morning in the small town. There on the college campus we heard \nthe sound of gunfire. A disturbed individual charged into a classroom \nat Umpqua Community College with six guns, and within the space of just \na couple of minutes, he took nine lives, including his own. One of the \nlives he took was a cousin of mine, Rebecka Ann Carnes. Eighteen years \nold, she had just graduated from South Umpqua High School the previous \nJune. She was an avid hunter. She was a lover of four-wheeling. In the \npicture she posted online for graduation, she was holding her \ngraduation cap, which said on it: ``And so the adventure begins.'' She \nwas ready for the adventure of adulthood. She was ready for the \nadventure of going off to college. She was ready to explore the world. \nShe was excited. She was a beautiful spirit. But her adventure ended so \nshortly after graduating from high school, before she could really get \nstarted on the journey of the balance of life.\n  Our hearts break for Sandy Hook, our hearts break for Roseburg, and \nour hearts break for all those who are afflicted day after day after \nday all across this country as victims of gun violence. Now our hearts \nbreak for Orlando, the latest name to be added to a list that no town \nor city ever wants to join. In that occasion, 49 innocent were lives \ntaken--49 young Americans full of hope and promise--and 49 individuals, \neach with their own story, were cut down simply because of who they \nare, whom they loved, or whom they associated with.\n  A hate-filled individual targeted a place that was a sanctuary for \nthe LGBT community. He turned this place of solidarity, togetherness, \nand love into a place of fear, divisiveness, hatred, and bloodshed.\n  This unthinkable carnage leaves Congress--all of us here, all of us \nhere in the Senate--with a choice. It is a simple choice. We have two \nbasic options. One option is to take some action that might diminish \nthe odds of the next Sandy Hook or the next Umpqua or the next Orlando \nor the next assault--the type of assault that takes place day in and \nday out across this Nation. The second option is to do nothing. That is \nwhere we are. Option one is take some action--take some reasonable \naction. There is no perfect answer. But there are substantial things \nthat could make a difference. It will not make a difference in every \ncase; it will make a difference in some cases. Isn't that the case with \nevery law we consider? It will make a difference, at least part of the \ntime, to avert a tragedy.\n\n  I come from a gun State. I come from the beautiful State of Oregon, \nthe best State in the United States of America, where people love to \nhunt. They love to target practice. They believe powerfully in the \nindividual rights of the Second Amendment. But Oregon is also a State \nwhere the citizens believe that we should not put guns into the hands \nof felons or those who are deeply mentally disturbed.\n  It was in the year 2000 that Measure 5 was put on the ballot as a \ncitizen initiative--and it passed overwhelmingly in the State of \nOregon--to expand background checks to gun shows. The citizens did that \nin an initiative at the ballot. It is a State where our legislature \ntook action just last year in Senate bill 941, the Oregon Firearms \nSafety Act, to close the Craigslist loophole.\n  Why does this make so much sense? If you keep a terrorist from buying \na gun at a gun shop, shouldn't you also keep that terrorist from buying \na gun at a gun show? Shouldn't you also keep that terrorist from buying \na gun out of the classifieds or the online classifieds, the Craigslist \nclassifieds? Yes, of course. Each piece of this makes sense to keep \nguns out of the hands of felons or those who are deeply mentally \ndisturbed.\n  In Oregon, folks believe that people should buy their guns legally \nwith a background check and that process shouldn't be averted through \nstraw purchasers subverting the law by putting a different name than \nthe name of the person who is actually acquiring the weapon.\n  Hunters and target shooters in Oregon know you don't need a military-\ngrade, super-sized magazine to go hunting, and smaller magazine sizes \nmay give an opportunity to interrupt a killer during his shooting \nspree. When you hunt for ducks, you are allowed three shells in the \ngun--one in the chamber and two in the magazine.\n  My question for the Senator from Connecticut is this: When will \nCongress finally say enough is enough? How many lives have to be lost \nin one shooting for Congress to act? When will Congress join with \nresponsible gun owners across this country and support commonsense \nsteps to prevent horrific tragedies? When will we close the terrorist \ngun loophole? When will we close the gun show loophole? When will we \nclose the Craigslist loophole?\n  As we have seen in Sandy Hook and as we have seen in Roseburg, and \nnow as we have seen with Orlando, all too much tragedy has taken place.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator.\n  At this point, I yield to the Senator from Connecticut for a question \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I want to thank all of our colleagues who have come \ntoday and thank Senator Murphy, my friend and teammate in this cause \nand in so many other causes, and just bring us back to the issue of why \nwe are here today. Senator Murphy, Senator Booker of New Jersey, and I \nhave come to the floor to make three essential points. I am going to \nask my colleague\n\n[[Page S3924]]\n\nfrom Connecticut whether I have hit these points--the reasons that have \nbrought us here today, along with so many eloquent colleagues, I might \nadd. I am deeply grateful to them. We are here debating an \nappropriations bill for Commerce, Justice, and Science. But we are here \non a much larger issue.\n  Why is this debate different? Why is this day different? Orlando has \nhopefully brought us to a tipping point, changed the dynamic, and \nenabled us to break through the paralysis and the complicity by \ninaction that has characterized the U.S. Senate on the issue of \nstopping acts of terror and hatred in our country. Those acts may \nemanate from abroad. We have to fight the terrorism that is inspired or \nsupported by our enemies abroad, as well as people who are motivated by \nthe twisted, insidious ideology that may be inspired or supported \nabroad, the pernicious hatred and bigotry that may be exemplified by \nOrlando and mental illness or whatever the cause.\n  There are three simple points, are there not? There will be no \nbusiness as usual until there is action. Enough is enough. We are here \nto say the time for business as usual on a routine appropriations bill, \nCJS appropriations--that time is done. We are here to make a historic \npoint and seek to change the dynamic and seize this moment of national \ntragedy and demand action. That is what the American people want, and \nthat is the second point.\n  There is a national consensus that it is not only our opportunity but \nour obligation to protect the American people, to make our Nation \nsafer, to assure that whether it is twisted ideology, pernicious \nbigotry and hatred, mental illness, or any other cause, we can and we \nwill take steps to stop it.\n  Third, closing the terrorist loophole must be accompanied by \nuniversal background checks. For someone to be too dangerous to board a \nplane and still be able to buy a gun makes no sense. But beyond the \nintellectual, nonsensical quality of it, there are real, practical \nsafety implications. Somebody who is too dangerous to board a plane, to \ntravel by air, should be deemed too dangerous to buy a gun and as \ndangerous as a convicted felon already precluded by law from buying a \ngun. But that terrorist now, even if he were barred from buying a gun, \ncould easily go to a gun show and buy a gun because there is no check \nwhatsoever at those gun shows, not on the NICS system, let alone on the \nterrorist watch list. The two measures--closing the gun show loophole \nor the background check gap and closing the terrorist gap or loophole--\ngo hand in hand. They are a start. They are not a panacea. They are not \na complete solution.\n  We are going to be talking throughout the evening about other \nmeasures that can be taken. Those three points are essential: No \nbusiness as usual--enough is enough; a national consensus in favor of \ncommonsense, sensible measures to make our Nation safer from gun \nviolence and from acts of terror and hate, inspired and supported by \nforces of evil abroad and at home; and, finally, combining these two \nmeasures, closing the terrorist gap loophole and also making sure there \nare background checks on all gun sales in the country.\n  Are those not our essential points, I ask Senator Murphy?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for distilling the reasons for our \npresence on the floor down to those points.\n  We see this as possible. We see it as possible to get a concensus \nbetween the Democrats and Republicans to bring these two measures--\nclosing the terrorist gap and expanding background checks--before the \nSenate floor this afternoon or tonight. We think that is possible, and \nwe intend to hold the floor until we make significant progress on that \nfront.\n  I yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Those points really should be bipartisan. They should \nattract support from both sides of the aisle. There is nothing \nRepublican or Democratic about any of these points, is there?\n  Mr. MURPHY. There is not, Senator Blumenthal, through the Chair. That \nis the reason we posited these two proposals as a means forward on this \nbill. We know they are noncontroversial in the American public. They \nenjoy broad bipartisan support.\n  I yield to the Senator from New Jersey, Senator Menendez, for a \nquestion without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank my colleague for yielding for a question. I \nthank him and my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Booker, and also \nSenator Blumenthal for galvanizing the sentiment that has existed for \nsome time among many of us that enough is enough. It is outrageous that \nit took another mass shooting to bring us to this moment in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  On Sunday morning, I woke up, as did the Nation, heartbroken by the \nnews that 49 human beings were killed in another senseless act of \nviolence--49 people who were at a dance club, celebrating Pride Week. \nBy the way, most of them overwhelmingly were Latino. Forty-nine \nAmericans were celebrating in an environment that they felt was safe, \nand in an instant their lives were shattered, and families were broken.\n  I believe this was an attack on all of us, and we need more than \nanother moment of silence. Although we take a moment of silence to \nremember those lives that were lost, we need more than another moment \nof silence. We need more.\n  I am tired of saying that our hearts and prayers go out to the \nfamilies of those who lost a loved one or who were injured. We need \nmore than a vigil and a bouquet. We need action. We need commonsense \ngun safety laws. We need to stand together with one voice. I hope that \nwe can prick the conscience of the Senate to finally act.\n  I deeply appreciate my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Booker, who \nhas passionately described the ongoing threat of gun violence in our \ncommunities. We are galvanizing this moment because we had such a \nhorrific act, but, in many ways, those horrific acts take place every \nday in the streets and neighborhoods of our communities across the \ncountry. While they may not add to so many lives lost at a single \nevent, they add up to many lives lost, and they seem to go largely \nunreported. We have become desensitized to that reality. And he has \nseen the havoc that is wreaked by the Nation's lax gun laws when he was \nthe mayor of Newark, and I have seen it in the streets of our \ncommunities in New Jersey.\n  The threat of those who are prone to violence, those looking to vent \ntheir anger or their prejudices, those who would act on their own worst \ninstincts toward others, for whatever reason, have easy access to \nweapons of war. It isn't limited to Orlando. It isn't limited to \nAurora. It isn't limited to Newtown. It isn't limited to any State or \nany city. People travel. Guns are trafficked. The violence and the \ncarnage they create in the wrong hands know no borders. We need to act \nand say: No more, no more.\n  It is inexcusable in the midst of America's nonstop gun violence \nepidemic to not come together, hold commonsense center, and pass gun \nsafety measures that we know are supported by a vast majority of the \nAmerican people.\n  How in God's Name can a person on the terrorist watch list, unable to \nboard a plane--so dangerous that they cannot fly, so dangerous that \nthey are known to the FBI--how can they walk into a gun store and walk \nout with a semi-automatic weapon and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, \nand nothing is flagged?\n  What does it say when our Nation's laws are so wildly misguided that \na potential terrorist doesn't even have to go to a gun store? They can \nsimply open up their computer and click with a mouse on a Web site, or \nthey can go to a gun show and buy a deadly weapon or two or three or \nfour deadly weapons--military-style and designed for war--without even \na cursory background check. That is unbelievable. It defies logic, and \nit is time to do something about it.\n  I don't believe these are controversial proposals. A majority of \nAmericans agree with universal background checks. If you have nothing \nto hide, you can still have access to a weapon if you can pass those \nbackground checks. Even a majority of NRA members agree with universal \nbackground checks. It makes sense. It is a position upon which we \nshould all be able to agree. It is a position that holds the center and \ncan be a starting point for a larger discussion. The fact that we \nhaven't done this yet is, in my mind, a national disgrace. Frankly, it \nneeded to have happened already. It should have happened after Aurora \nwhen a madman ruined movie theaters for the\n\n[[Page S3925]]\n\nrest of us. It should have happened after Virginia Tech when gun \nviolence invaded our colleges. It should have happened after Sandy Hook \nwhen gun violence came to our elementary schools. I am reminded of that \nold Chinese proverb that says: ``The best time to plant a tree was 20 \nyears ago. The second best time is now.'' Let's at least have the will \nand resolve to do what is right now.\n  Do you know how long it takes to get an AR-15, the weapon used in \nthis horrific attack? Well, a Philadelphia Inquirer Daily News reporter \ndecided to find out. The answer is 7 minutes. It took 7 minutes. That \nis all the time it took to get a weapon that has a frightening number \nof similarities to the M-16 rifle used by the military. It was pointed \nout in that article that it could take more time to read the names of \nthe more than 100 people who were either killed or injured in Orlando \nthan to buy the AR-15. Of course, that model was just the base model. \nIf you go to a gun store, you can buy a variety of add-ons to make the \nweapon kill that much more--yes, kill. This isn't about hunting. If you \nneed something that has hundreds of rounds in it to hunt a deer, my \nGod, you are in trouble.\n  The prime example is the bump fire stock, which increases the gun \nrate of fire up to 800 rounds per minute. That is more than 13 per \nsecond. Maybe the NRA will claim these are cosmetic. It insults \nintelligence--if it is not completely absurd--to claim that \nmodification that allows a gun to fire 800 rounds per minute is merely \ncosmetic, but apparently to the NRA, 800 rounds a minute is normal and \ncovered by the Founders' language in the Second Amendment, when no one \ncould even imagine at the time the Second Amendment was being written \nthat there could be an instrument that could fire 800 rounds a minute.\n  We have seen how our Nation's laws have hurt our families and \ncommunities again and again. Every day, there are shootings that don't \nmake front pages of the newspapers, but they ruin lives, tear families \napart, and test the very fabric of our society. The Orlando shooting \nwas 1 of 43 shootings on Sunday that resulted in 18 deaths, including 5 \nchildren.\n  We can honor the Constitution, and we can honor the intent of our \nFounders, but I don't think I am alone in believing that we can enact \ncommonsense, realistic gun safety laws that respect the Constitution \nand also protect the lives of Americans.\n  I have heard my colleagues say many times that the government's No. 1 \nresponsibility is the safety and security of its citizens. Well, you \nhave abdicated that part in this regard.\n  In the case of Orlando, those in the LGBT community have always had \nto live with the threat of violence hanging. And 90 percent of the \nvictims were Hispanic. This is a horrible reminder that bigotry and \nhate are not dead and that the forces of evil have no compulsion about \nusing our Nation's lax gun laws against us.\n  Again, we need to come together and say: No more. We need to hold the \ncommonsense center and pass realistic gun safety measures that can \nrespect the Second Amendment and that can fully protect Americans from \na Second Amendment that has no limits, no common sense, and no \nrealistic restrictions.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleague from connect, through the Chair, as \nhe has helped us galvanize in this moment, isn't it possible to \npreserve those constitutional rights as were originally envisioned by \nthe Framers and protect our fellow Americans, which many of our \ncolleagues have said is the No. 1 responsibility of the government?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his passionate \nwords and advocacy on this issue. I refer the Senator to a conversation \nSenator Manchin and I had earlier today when we talked about the gun \nculture in West Virginia and how Senator Manchin hasn't run into anyone \nwho was passionate about gun ownership who believes that people on the \nterrorist watch list should be able to buy guns and believes that \nterrorists should be able to buy guns. The Senator from West Virginia \nargued passionately for the notion that my friend has proffered that \nthere is no choice to be made between upholding the Second Amendment \nand protecting our citizens from attack.\n  Justice Scalia himself said in a very controversial decision that not \neveryone agrees with that the Second Amendment is not absolute; that \nthe Second Amendment, even in the minds of those who hold that it has a \nprivate right of gun ownership inherent in it, believe that all the \nthings we are talking about--denying terrorists from getting guns, \nkeeping dangerous assault weapons off the streets, recognizing that \nthere is no place in civilized society for 100-round drums of with \nammunition--all of those restrictions are wholly in keeping with the \nSecond Amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from New Hampshire for a \nquestion without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut.\n  I am here, like everyone else on the floor, in the wake of horrific \nmass shootings, from Sandy to Orlando. Americans have come together \nunited as a family to grieve for the dead and comfort those left \nbehind. But we haven't come together to do anything to stop the next \nshooting, prevent the next series of funerals, and prevent future \ndevastation. That is why I want to thank Senators Murphy and \nBlumenthal, the Senators from Connecticut, and Senator Booker from New \nJersey, for leading us here today to demand action.\n  Let's be clear. Tears are not enough and expressions of outrage are \nnot enough. After Columbine, Virginia Tech, Aurora, Newtown, \nCharleston, San Bernardino, and so many shootings that have happened \nwith numbing regulatory, moments of silence and expressions of sympathy \nare just not enough. This Senate, this Congress, needs to pass \ncommonsense gun safety legislation--legislation supported by 9 out of \n10 Americans.\n  It is inconceivable that Congress would fail to act in the wake of \nthe Orlando tragedy. To do nothing would be an affront to all of those \nAmericans who have lost loved ones to senseless gun violence.\n  The distinguished Senators from Connecticut and the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey have been outspoken advocates of commonsense \ngun safety legislation. Senators Murphy and Blumenthal have wept with \nthe families of the 20 schoolchildren massacred at Sandy Hook \nElementary. In the subsequent 3\\1/2\\ years, working with the Sandy Hook \nfamilies, they have advocated for legislation to address the menace of \nwidely available automatic assault weapons--weapons that have only one \npurpose, and that purpose is to kill large numbers of people.\n  We are here today to demand action on commonsense measures to address \ngun violence. The first would be to deny guns to people on the FBI's \nno-fly list. Those people who are on the no-fly list because of \nsuspected ties to extremist organizations or ideologies should not be \nallowed to fly and they should not be allowed to buy a gun. It doesn't \nget more common sense than that. If a person is considered too \ndangerous to board an airplane, then that person is too dangerous to \npurchase a military-style assault weapon. Second, ensure universal \nbackground checks for gun buyers so we can keep dangerous weapons out \nof the hands of dangerous people. At least 9 out of 10 Americans \nsupport these measures. It is a no-brainer.\n  Enough is enough. It is time for us to say enough is enough. We get a \nsecond chance to vote on this legislation, and this time we must come \ntogether on a bipartisan basis to pass commonsense gun safety \nlegislation to end the violence.\n  As we contemplate this legislation, let's remember the photographs. \nWe have all seen them on television and in the newspapers. These are \nphotographs of so many wonderful young people--this time from Orlando--\nwho were killed by gun violence. The Orlando shooting was both a crime \nof terror and a crime of hate, and now it is time for us to honor those \nwho died, honor our friends in the LGBT community who are hurting, \nhonor our friends in the Latino community, and honor all of those \nAmericans whom we lost to senseless gun violence.\n  To my friend from Connecticut, I ask, isn't the best way to honor all \nof those people we lost to gun violence to act now to prevent future \ntragedies?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her question. I \nthink\n\n[[Page S3926]]\n\nabout the survivors. I think about the parents of those who were lost \nin Newtown, and I think about the additional layer of grief we \nintentionally place upon their shoulders by our inaction. There is some \nsolace--a small measure of solace--in knowing that the people for whom \nyou voted to run your country care so deeply about your dead child that \nthey are going to do something about it, but there is a next level of \ngrief when you realize they don't actually care enough to even have a \ndebate to protect other children like them.\n  This is our choice, I say to Senator Shaheen.\n  And my friend is very articulate in her challenge to us. I hope we \nrespond to it.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from New York for a question \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in \nquestioning why this body, after so many horrific tragedies over the \nyears, still refuses to pass laws that would make us safer from \nmassacres like what happened in Orlando.\n  I thank my colleague from Connecticut for leading this charge on the \nSenate floor. He knows too well what it is like to have his State fall \nvictim to a mass murder. He knows what it is like to have happy, \ninnocent lives cut short by gun violence. The massacre at the \nelementary school in Newtown took place more than 3 years ago, but it \nstill feels like it was yesterday. Sweet, smiling children were \nslaughtered by someone so evil and so hateful and who was allowed to \nhave easy access to an assault weapon, a weapon of war.\n  It happened again last year in Charleston. Churchgoers who were \npraying were slaughtered by someone so evil and hateful and who was \nallowed to have easy access to a deadly, powerful weapon.\n  It happened again in San Bernardino. Colleagues were in an office and \ncelebrating at the end of the year. They were slaughtered by two people \nso evil and hateful and who were allowed to have easy access to an \nassault weapon, a weapon of war.\n  The list goes on and on.\n  After all of these mass shootings, Congress must do something, right? \nThey must respond, right? No. Why didn't the Congress do anything? Why \ndo they stand silent? Why do they not look those parents in the eye and \nsay: This will not happen again.\n  After all of these mass shootings, in each and every case, someone \nwith no business handling a powerful deadly weapon has had easy access \nto that weapon and used it to kill people quickly, and now we have a \nnew tragedy to add to this book.\n  Like all of my colleagues here, I was devastated when I heard about \nthe attack this past weekend in Orlando, and my heart goes out to \neveryone who was affected by this awful, hateful crime--the family and \nfriends of 49 victims, the entire LGBT community, the entire Latino \ncommunity. These were 49 happy people dancing together, laughing, \ncelebrating who they are, in the middle of Pride Month, in a club that \nhas always been a safe haven for them. But, once again, an evil and \nhateful person, a citizen of this country who was angry, hateful, and \nradicalized, was allowed by this Congress to have easy access to a \ndeadly weapon of war.\n  Let's be very clear about the kind of weapon this man used. The \nweapon is an AR-15. It was not designed to hunt deer. It was not \ndesigned for target practice. It was designed to kill large numbers of \npeople quickly, at war. This is not a weapon used in hunting.\n  Why are we allowing private citizens to have access--such easy \naccess--to these weapons of war?\n  Something has to change. No one outside of our military, which is \ntrained to use these weapons, needs to have access to a weapon that can \nfire hundreds of bullets in a minute--hundreds of bullets in a minute.\n  The only people with the power to change this are the men and women \nwho serve in this Chamber--who serve in the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives. Is this slaughter not a wake-up call? Is it not enough \nto convince us to act? Where is our spine?\n  The gun industry is a rich and powerful lobby in this country, but we \nweren't elected to protect the gun industry's profits. We were elected \nto protect America and its safety.\n  We have to make it harder for hateful, angry, violent people to get \ntheir hands on a weapon--a weapon of war that is designed to kill as \nmany people as possible as quickly as possible. The only way we change \nit--the only way--is if Congress fulfills its responsibility to protect \nthe American people and passes new laws that keep us safe.\n  The people of Orlando, San Bernardino, Charleston, Newtown, New \nYork--the entire Nation--none of them should have to go through their \ndaily lives in fear of violence, in fear that an angry, radicalized \ncitizen can buy and use a weapon of war against innocent Americans.\n  We already have bipartisan reforms that are ready to go that are \noverwhelmingly supported by the American people--obviously, background \nchecks that are more effective so would-be terrorists could not buy a \nweapon of war. They won't be able to do that. The American people \nsupport that.\n  Let's stop allowing would-be murderers to legally buy weapons of war \nlike the AR-15 without scrutiny. Let's lift our irrational hold on the \nCDC and allow them to actually study the issue of gun deaths the way we \nare allowed to study any other cause of death in this country. The \nAmerican people support this as well. Let's stop the people who have \nbeen deemed too dangerous to fly an airplane from being allowed to buy \nguns. Let's stop tying the hands of law enforcement and preventing them \nfrom sharing crime data. Let's stop preventing ATF from requiring gun \nstores to conduct inventory and report any guns that have been lost or \nstolen, and let's stop blocking the ATF from preventing the dumping of \nnonsporting weapons into the American market from abroad. Let's finally \ncrack down on gun trafficking and straw purchasing. These are all \nmeasures the American people strongly support.\n  My State of New York suffers deeply from gun violence. Our biggest \nproblem is the amount of illegal weapons that flow into our State every \nsingle day from other States. The amount of guns--90 percent--used in \ncrimes come from out of State, and 85 percent of them are illegal. \nThese are weapons literally sold out of the back of a truck from \nsomeone in another State to a gang member. And how many innocent lives \ndo we have to lose because a stray bullet hits them while they are out \nwith friends? It is unconscionable that this Congress stands and does \nnothing.\n  I thank my friend from Connecticut for yielding the floor, and I will \nask him this final question: What do you propose we should do to \nprotect Americans from this type of senseless violence? What should we \ndo now as Senators and as Members of this body?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for her passion. It is not a \ncoincidence that sitting in this front row, in this section of the \nSenate, are three parents of young kids. We are friends, but we are \nalso involved in a common cause, and maybe we bring a little bit more \nof our gut to this question of what we do to protect children and \nadults because we think of our own children and we think of how at risk \nthey are.\n  To Senator Gillibrand through the Chair, we have proposed two simple \nmeasures to begin with. Let's bring to the floor a background checks \nbill that expands background checks to gun shows and Internet sales \nwhere the majority or the lion's share of sales have migrated to, and \nlet's make sure the terrorists can't buy guns; those that are on the \nterrorist watch list and no-fly list. Let's start there.\n  If we could get an agreement to bring those two pieces before the \nSenate in a bipartisan way, then we would gladly pack up our stuff and \ngo home, but we need to have bipartisan consensus on those two votes to \nmove forward and that is our hope and that is the reason we are holding \nthe floor here today.\n  With that, I yield to the Senator from Missouri, a great leader on \nthis issue, for a question without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I wish to read out loud verbatim a voice mail that \nwas left on my office phone this morning. I wish I could play it \nbecause if my colleagues hear the voice, they will understand more \ncompletely why I believe this particular voice mail was compelling:\n\n       I am 14 years old from St. Louis, 63011, and I've been \n     really looking a lot into the Orlando shootings and just \n     really gun control\n\n[[Page S3927]]\n\n     in general, and I was kind of thinking, and I thought, like, \n     I'll be a freshman this year, and I want to go to high \n     school, and I want to drive a car, and I want to go to prom, \n     and I want to graduate high school, and I want to go to \n     college, and I want to graduate college, and I want to get a \n     job, and I want to get married, and I want to have kids.\n       But since Missouri voted that those on terrorist watch list \n     can purchase guns, I'm scared that I won't be able to \n     do those things.\n       And I know that I'm young and I don't really know what \n     plays into your job at all, and I don't know all the \n     arguments and all the factors, but at this point I'm just \n     really scared and people are dying and I think something \n     needs to change.\n       And so, whatever that may take, please just take my \n     feelings into consideration and I would really, really, \n     appreciate it. So, thank you so much. Bye.\n\n  A little 14-year-old girl from St. Louis.\n  Now, she is a little confused about who has decided that people on \nthe terrorist watch list can buy guns. It is, in fact, the U.S. Senate \nthat made the decision in December on a vote that has been recounted \nover and over again, basically a party-line vote that we were not going \nto take the commonsense step of saying that if the most trusted law \nenforcement professionals in the world--the most professional and \nhighly trained--have put an individual on the terrorist watch list, \nthat we should not let them buy guns in this country. Pretty common \nsense, and a 14-year-old knows it, and she is scared.\n  One of the pieces of legislation that Senator Murphy is asking for \nbipartisan support for is the one that closes the gun show loophole and \nthe online loophole when it comes to background checks. What are we \nafraid of? What are we afraid of with a background check? Why should we \nhave massive categories of gun purchases in this country without a \nbackground check? Why do we require a background check for a small \nbusiness that is selling guns but we don't for somebody who wants to \noperate online? And we know for a fact that there has been terrorist \nmessaging sent to people in this country: You can weaponize yourself at \ngun shows with some pretty heavy artillery.\n  We are, in fact, pointed out in the rest of the world as the place \nwhere it is easiest, with no questions asked, to obtain weapons that \ncan kill and slaughter dozens and dozens of people in mere seconds.\n  Why is this so hard? Where is the invisible hand that is stopping \nthis? I don't want to be cynical about it. Is it the NRA? Is it the NRA \nthat is single-handedly stopping this? Is everyone so afraid of the \nNRA? Why are they so afraid of the NRA? Do they not have faith in their \nconstituents, that their constituents are right about this, because \nthere is no question the majority of constituents in this country want \nbackground checks, and the majority of constituents in this country \nwant us to not sell guns to people on the terrorist watch list.\n  Before I ask a question of Senator Murphy, I wish to cover one more \nsubject that is really bugging me as a former prosecutor; that is, the \nargument that has been presented: Well, we don't want to put--we want \nto make sure we don't somehow let the terrorists know that we are \ninvestigating them, so if we put them on a list and they can't get a \ngun and they go to buy a gun, then all of a sudden this terrorist is \ngoing to know we are on to them.\n  That is such hogwash, and let me explain why. We have a no-fly list. \nWe have other kinds of lists in this country. If the FBI is \ninvestigating, they have the discretion in this bill to remove someone \nfrom that list for purposes that would support pursuing that individual \nwithout his knowing that he was ever on the list. So all they would \nhave to do is if they are about to get intelligence or they think they \nare about to get intelligence or they think they are about to be able \nto uncover a larger plot or even if they think they are about to arrest \nthe terrorist in question, they are absolutely on top of it, they can \neasily remove the name from the list and continue to pursue that \nindividual, track that individual, and make sure that whatever gun they \nmight purchase is never used.\n  This bill, when it comes to the terrorist watch list, gives the FBI \nthat discretion. There is not going to be a terrorist that gets the \nheads-up that is all of a sudden going to send them into hiding or send \nthem, unfortunately--unless we pass the bill--to the Internet or to the \nnearest gun show.\n  It amazes me the kind of trust that I hear mouthed about law \nenforcement on the other side of the aisle. Yet they are not willing to \ntrust the FBI with the serious decision as to whether an individual \nbelongs on a terrorist watch list, and they are not willing to trust \nthe FBI as to whether they do what they need to do to continue to \npursue an investigation and arrest as it relates to this list.\n  I think this is a gut-check moment for this country. If you look at \nthe graph of where we lie with how many mass shootings we have compared \nto all the other developed nations in the world, some of which have lax \ngun laws like we do--maybe not quite to the extent that we do--we are \nway, way an outlier. That is not what we want to be an outlier on in \nthe United States of America--mass shootings. I think the American \npeople are rising up and are saying enough is enough.\n  I ask the Senator from Connecticut if he agrees that the legislation \nthat would restrict the ability of an identified terrorist to buy guns \nin this country contains the discretion necessary for the FBI to \ncontinue to protect America and continue to pursue investigations and \ncontinue to pursue arrests and intelligence because of the discretion \nwe have given the FBI in that piece of legislation?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for the question, and the answer is \nyes, so long as you pair it with an expansion of background checks to \nmake sure they are seeing these purchases wherever they take place. \nThat is why we have asked for this body to move forward on both of \nthose pieces of legislation, because we cannot ask the FBI to protect \nthis Nation from terrorist attacks if we don't give them the tools to \nkeep firearms from those who threaten us.\n  Before turning the floor over to the Senator from Virginia, let me \nunderscore the last point Senator McCaskill made. There is no other \ncountry in the world in which this happens. The rate of gun violence in \nthis country is 20 times higher than the combined rates of the 22 \ncountries that are our peers in wealth and population--20 times higher. \nMore people died in this country in the first 15 years of this century \nthan died in all of the wars in the last century combined. That is \nunique to the United States. Shame on us if we don't recognize that and \ndo something about it.\n  In the days after Sandy Hook, the Senator from Virginia was one of \nthe first to stand up intentionally to the national media and say that \nsomething had to change. He was one of the early signals that this \nNation has woken up in the wake of Sandy Hook. I am glad to yield to \nhim for a question without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, yielding for a question.\n  I am proud to join so many Members of the Senate. I want to echo the \ncomments of the Senator from Missouri, her comments about getting the \nsame kind of calls, notes, and questions.\n  I want to acknowledge as well that there have been Members of the \nHouse from Virginia and Louisiana who have come to show solidarity in \nthe effort being led so eloquently from mostly the Senator from \nConnecticut and the Senator from New Jersey.\n  I think we are all trying to wrap our heads around the fact that a \nsingle lone gunman was able to extinguish the lives of 49 Americans in \na gay nightclub in Orlando. Before we get to this legislation, I think \nwe also have to acknowledge that this was a crime of hate--a crime of \nhate that unfortunately targeted the Latino community and in particular \nthe LGBT community. And as the LGBT community grieves nationwide, we \nneed to make clear that the long fight for equality includes not only \nmarriage equality but equal protection in terms of public safety and \nliving in safety.\n  The Senator from Connecticut has made some comments about the number \nof deaths that take place in our country each year from gun violence--\n30,000 a year. I think about, just as the Senator from Connecticut \nacknowledged in the aftermath of Newtown how I rethought some of my \npositions on some of these issues. We all have to take a fresh look at \nthe challenges our country faces in providing a reasonable\n\n[[Page S3928]]\n\nframework of gun legislation that protects the rights as well of law-\nabiding gun owners.\n  One of the things that troubles me is I think virtually every Member \nof this body has probably stated or tweeted out their thoughts and \nprayers for the victims in Orlando. What I think I am hearing from the \nmedia, from those victims, and from Virginians across the board, is \nthey want to see more than thoughts and prayers; they actually want to \nsee us act.\n  There are a whole host of different proposals we could look at to try \nto deal with gun violence. I believe the Senator from Connecticut has \npicked two that are frankly the most reasonable, with the most common \nground that we should take on.\n  Like the Senator from Connecticut, I know the scourge of having a \nmass murder take place in your State. Until this terrible tragedy in \nOrlando, the deadliest mass shooting was at Virginia Tech in the \nCommonwealth of Virginia, where 32 lives were taken. I know how that \ncommunity grieves, how Newtown grieves, how Aurora grieves, how \nCharleston grieves, and now how Orlando is grieving. Quite honestly, \nday in and day out, how many other communities are affected by this \nscourge of gun violence?\n  As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I know the \nchallenges we face every day in dealing with the threat of violent \nterrorists determined to do our Nation harm. But if we are going to \ntalk about taking on terrorism--which we need to have a united effort \non--shouldn't we take this reasonable step of abiding by the judgment \nof law enforcement and saying: If you end up on a terrorist watch list, \nyou should not be able to purchase a firearm.\n  We have seen in recent days statistics that show that more than 90 \npercent of known or suspected terrorists who attempted to buy weapons \nsince 2004 have passed a background check and then have been able to \npurchase a firearm. To me, that is an internal contradiction that, by \ntaking action this week, we can turn around. If you are too dangerous \nto get on an airplane, aren't you too dangerous to be allowed to \npurchase a firearm?\n  The second solution my friend the Senator from Connecticut has put \nforward is to take up and pass the bipartisan proposal, which has the \noverwhelming support of the general public, to increase background \nchecks. Ninety percent of the public supports this effort. Over 70 \npercent of gun owners support this effort. Why? Because we know \nbackground checks work. Since 1994, 2.6 million people, by either \nevidence of criminal backgrounds or mental illnesses, have been \nprevented from purchasing firearms.\n  There are a host of other proposals that I know the Senator from \nConnecticut has put on his agenda, but what I want to do is thank the \nSenator from Connecticut for putting forward two of the most basic \nproposals, two of the proposals that have bipartisan broad appeal.\n  I would ask the Senator from Connecticut, with the overwhelming \npublic support that Americans express for this type of commonsense \nlegislation and with, unfortunately, the sometimes low regard this body \nis held, does the Senator believe that if we took these actions and \npassed them, not only could we send a strong signal of making America \nsafer, but we could once again show we will uphold our constitutional \nduties?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator from Virginia for his question. I \nthink that is the essence of this debate, why we are on the floor today \nand why we are lodging this protest. If you look at why the ratings of \nCongress are so low, it is because of the challenges we are ignoring. \nPeople are upset that we are fighting and bickering all the time, but \nthey are also deeply upset that there are these epidemics and public \nsafety crises and we are doing nothing.\n  I think our ability to respond to this in a bipartisan way to reflect \nthe support of 98 percent of the American public is about saving lives \nbut also about fulfilling our constitutional responsibility. Why did we \nsign up for this job? Why did we decide to be a U.S. Senator if we were \ngoing to ignore this epidemic of slaughter in this Nation? There is \nnobody who disagrees with the fact that this is a major problem. It is \nin the headlines in the papers on almost a weekly basis. Why become a \nSenator if you are going to ignore this?\n\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia for his remarks and the question.\n  I will yield to the Senator from Minnesota for a question without \nlosing my right to the floor. She has been such a leader in general on \nthis issue focusing on protecting victims of domestic violence. This \nhopefully will lead to one of the breakthroughs we are seeking in the \ncontext of this debate.\n  I yield to the Senator from Minnesota for her question.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask if the Senator from Connecticut \nwill yield for a question without yielding the floor?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I will yield to the Senator from Minnesota for a \nquestion.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his work, \nalong with the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Booker, Senator Blumenthal, \nand many others, in bringing people together today to call for \ncommonsense action to make our communities safer. I know Senator \nManchin was here earlier. He has been such a leader on the bipartisan \nbill with Senator Toomey about criminal background checks.\n  I extend my heartfelt condolences to all the families of those who \nwere massacred in Orlando and also those who lie injured--some very \nseriously, some critically injured--in hospital beds in Orlando today. \nMy prayers are with the victims and their families.\n  I look at this, first of all, and I look at the Senator from \nConnecticut and think of the people from his own State, whom he knows \nso well, the parents of those young, little children who were killed at \nSandy Hook.\n  I remember them coming to my office the day the background check bill \nwent down. They came to my office, and a number of us were telling them \nthat it was going to go down, that we didn't have enough votes to pass \nthis commonsense measure for background checks. What I was struck by \nwas that they knew that particular measure wouldn't save their babies, \nbut they were there because they had come to the conclusion that this \nwas the best way to save other children, to save other people from \ndying. And as they told me their stories--one of them told me the story \nof how their young son, who was autistic, who went to school that day \nhad looked up at the refrigerator and pointed to the picture of his \nhealth aide. It was someone who was with him all the time. He could \nbarely speak, but he pointed up at that picture in the morning. So as \nshe sat in that firehouse with the other parents waiting and waiting to \nsee if her child would come back, it became very clear that some \nchildren were never coming back, and hers was one of them. When they \nfound that little boy, he was in the arms of that health aide whom he \nloved so much, and they were both shot and they were both killed.\n  As she told me that story, I thought, these parents are so courageous \nthat they are coming today to try to advocate for something that they \nknew--they had come to grips with the fact that they wanted more, but \nthey knew the background check measure was the best they could do to \nsave lives at that moment. They knew the background check measure would \nespecially help in cases of domestic violence and suicide because they \nknew the statistics that in those States that had passed such measures, \nthey had seen improvements in the numbers for those kinds of deaths, so \nthey were advocating for it. That was why they were there. Yet this \nbody didn't have the courage those parents had to be there that day, to \npass that measure.\n  So here we are today. We are looking at, first of all, a dangerous \nloophole that allows terrorists to buy firearms here in the United \nStates. In Minnesota we have a little experience with this. We were the \nState that, before \n9/11, some citizens--flight instructors were able to detect something \nwas wrong with a man who cared about flying--Moussaoui--but not about \nlanding. So they turned him in, and no one was ever able to connect the \ndots, but there he was in a jail in Minnesota.\n  I know a little bit about this as a former prosecutor, and I know a \nlittle bit about this because of the cases we have had in our State. We \nhad dozens of indictments against people who had been trying to go join \nAl-Shabaab in Somalia or the terrorist group ISIS.\n\n[[Page S3929]]\n\nWe had three convictions in U.S. Federal court in just the last week. \nWe know about this in our State and how close it hits to home. We love \nour Muslim communities in our State. They are part of the fabric of \nlife. We have a big Somali community in the country. But we also know \nthat we need to keep our communities safe. By working with our \ncommunities, we have been able to bring these kinds of prosecutions. \nWhen it is that close, you know you don't want people who are on the \nterror watch list to get guns.\n  Incredibly, current U.S. law does not prevent individuals who are on \nthe terror watch list from purchasing guns. A total of 2,233 people on \na watch list tried to buy guns in our country between 2004 and 2014, \nand nearly 2,000--or 91 percent--of them cleared a background check, \naccording to the Government Accountability Office.\n  I am a cosponsor of Senator Feinstein's bill to close this loophole. \nDuring last year's budget debate, I joined 25 of my Senate colleagues, \nincluding my colleague from Connecticut, in offering an amendment that \nalso would have stopped these dangerous individuals from buying \nfirearms and explosives.\n  The background check bill--we know that this helps. That is why two--\nat the time--A-rated NRA Senators, Mr. Manchin and Mr. Toomey, joined \ntogether to try to put forward some commonsense legislation. Sadly, \nsadly, that bill did not pass, and I believe we should bring that bill \nup again for a vote.\n  The third piece of legislation that I think is possible to pass, as I \nlook at what has bipartisan support and what could make the biggest \ndifference, is a bipartisan bill with Senator Kirk. There is a House \nbill, as well, and that bill focuses on victims of stalking, victims of \ndomestic violence.\n  As we look at some commonsense measures, we know that not one bill is \ngoing to fix all these cases. Not one bill is going to make the \ndifference in every case, but combined they make a major difference.\n  My question for the Senator from Connecticut is about an area where I \nbelieve we should be able to find consensus, and that is also in \naddition to the important closure of the loophole in the terrorist \nwatch list for people buying guns, the background check bill--that is \nthis domestic violence area. Studies have shown that more than three \nwomen per day lose their lives at the hands of their partners, and more \nthan half of those killed are shot by their partners with a gun.\n  There is a simple bill that would first make sure that dating \npartners--the same rule that applies to those who are married would \napply to dating partners. Even the Republican witnesses at our hearing \nwith Senator Leahy and Senator Grassley embraced this portion of the \nbill. If people are dating partners as opposed to married, it should \nmake no difference in terms of how you look at their ability to go in \nand buy a gun if they have committed an act of domestic violence.\n  The second piece of this bill is about stalking. If someone is \nconvicted of a stalking crime, they shouldn't be able to go in and buy \na gun.\n  When I look at these types of commonsense measures, I always think \nabout my Uncle Dick. He loved to hunt, and he always would hunt deer. \nAnd I have to think to myself, would closing off the loophole in the \nterrorist watch list hurt my Uncle Dick in his deer stand? Not at all. \nWould putting the background check bills in place across the country \nhurt my Uncle Dick in his deer stand? Not at all. Would closing these \nloopholes on stalking and on dating partners in any way hurt my Uncle \nDick in his deer stand because our State loves hunting? We are a big \nhunting State, so I always have to do a gut check when I look at these \nbills.\n  To the Senator from Connecticut, I would like you to answer that \nquestion. Of these commonsense bills that we have been talking about \ntoday, which could save hundreds if not thousands of lives, do you \nthink they would in any way hurt those who are law-abiding citizens in \nour States and every State in this Nation that value their guns and \nvalue hunting?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for that question. You just have to \nlook to the data for the answer. We have had pretty robust survey data \non the question of support for expanding background checks or support \nfor denying access to guns for people on the no-fly list. It is \nuniversal. Everyone wants these changes. Republicans want them; \nDemocrats want them. Non-gun owners want them; gun owners want them. \nThe vast number majority of NRA members support the bipartisan \nprovisions that we are proposing for bipartisan action today.\n  I would suggest the same thing is true for protecting victims of \ndomestic violence. This has nothing to do with being a Republican or a \nDemocratic gun owner or a non-gun owner. When you tell people that \nsomebody who has a restraining order lodged against them shouldn't get \na gun, everybody nods their head.\n  I thank Senator Klobuchar for being such a leader on that particular \nissue because it is one in this basket of changes we are requesting \nthat is controversial only here. It is controversial only in \nWashington, DC, and in the political arenas of this country. It is not \nreally controversial out in the broader American public.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I thank the Senator for that. I also want to note for \nthe Members of the House here that Congresswoman Dingell is the leader \nof that bill on domestic violence in the House, so we have two \nbipartisan bills in both Chambers.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator from Minnesota yield for a question?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I yield to the Senator from Maryland for a question \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. First, joining you as a social worker, my question is, \nIs the Senator from Minnesota, with her vast experience as an attorney \ngeneral as well as her advocacy here in the Senate----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The question must be directed to the \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. To the Senator from Connecticut, most of the victims of \nguns in domestic violence are law enforcement officials responding to \naid a domestic violence victim. In my own State there have been \nwonderful men in blue who came to a home to rescue someone who was \nbeing held or something by their spouse--often off their meds. When the \npolice officer responded because it was domestic violence--not \nresponding as if it were an active scene--he was also killed. Has that \nbeen the Senator's observation?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator, the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee, for the question. That certainly is a big \npart of this story line, this toxic mixture of guns and restraining \norders. It puts everyone in jeopardy. It puts the individual who lodged \nthe restraining order in jeopardy, and it puts the law enforcement \nofficers who get in the middle of that conflict in jeopardy. It is hard \nenough for law enforcement officers to try to enforce a restraining \norder. This is a spouse who is angry and who often is at the peak of \ntheir fury. When you add a gun to that mix, everyone's life is in \ndanger. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield to the Senator from Ohio for a question without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN. To my friend from Connecticut, thank you. I so admire that \nwhen you came to the Senate, it was right after perhaps the most tragic \n2 hours in our Nation's recent existence with what happened to those \nkids--those young children in your congressional district.\n  I say to Senator Murphy, how do we go home--I just hear this--I \nwatched what happened at Sandy Hook, I watched what happened in \nColorado, and I watched what happened in California. Now we see what \nhappened in Orlando to those 49 mostly young men and women, mostly of \nHispanic descent--mostly gay, we think--what happened to them.\n  How do we go home and face people when this body fails year after \nyear after year to do the right thing? I admire so much what Senator \nMurphy did when he came here and just got in the face of so many \nMembers of the Senate and said: You have to do the right thing.\n  My question for Senator Murphy is, How do we go home, look people in \nthe eye, and say we failed again?\n  I think this body should stay in session until we do a number of \nthings, from confirming a Supreme Court Justice, to taking care of the\n\n[[Page S3930]]\n\nmineworkers' pension, to this legislation.\n  How do I go back to Cleveland and say: Well, we tried it again. We \ndidn't do it. It is not that big a deal. If people can't fly on an \nairplane, they still ought to be able to get a gun.\n  How do we possibly look people in the eye and answer that question?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for a question that is unanswerable.\n  The answer is we cannot.\n  As you know, there is a very real, palpable fear out there today. \nThere is no way to look at what happened in San Bernardino, to look at \nwhat happened in Orlando, and not be scared. Yes, it is an attack that \nis designed to elicit a fear that is disproportional to the actual \nthreat; that is what terrorism is. But people's fear is elevated when \nthey don't see us taking action.\n  Earlier today I think Senator Casey made this point. He said: Can you \nimagine doing nothing after September 11? Can you imagine if our \nresponse after that tragedy was to just do nothing, to just move on to \nthe next piece of legislation as if it didn't occur? That was 3,000 \npeople whose lives were taken. There are 30,000 people a year who are \nkilled by guns. If you add up those who have been killed in mass \nshootings, the numbers approach that of September 11.\n  So this is a moment in which I think it is impossible for us to go \nback home and once again say that we haven't done anything. I guess \nthat is the reason we are here. I know it is uncomfortable to stop the \nCJS process, to force and ask staff to stay beyond regular hours.\n  For many of us--and I think Senator Brown is amongst this group--we \njust couldn't pretend this was business as usual again. We couldn't go \nthrough another one of these shootings--this one the worst in history \nof this country--and just go back to our regular business. That is why \nwe are here today, to suggest that this time it has to be different.\n  I yield for a question.\n  Mr. BROWN. Through the Chair, if my friend from Connecticut will \nyield again, I was in a meeting yesterday with a group of Democratic \nSenators. I heard two of the youngest and most impressive Members of \nour caucus, Senator Booker and Senator Murphy, talk about the number of \ngun deaths in this country.\n  My wife and I live in the city of Cleveland. We live in the ZIP Code \nin Cleveland that in 2007 had more foreclosures than any ZIP Code in \nthe United States of America. We live in a nice neighborhood of about \n250 homes. Most of the rest of the neighborhood has suffered--some in \nour neighborhood and many outside that neighborhood--foreclosure after \nforeclosure and urban blight. Many nights we heard gunshots, and then \nwe heard police sirens.\n  I know Senator Booker said--and I think my friend from Connecticut \nheard him talk about what he sees in Newark and what we see. Just 3 \nweeks ago, we had a terrible, terrible number of deaths in southern, \nvery rural Appalachia, southern Ohio, where apparently one family \nmember killed a whole bunch of others with a gun.\n  I got a letter today or yesterday from a man in Toledo:\n\n       I am a gay man living in Toledo, OH, and I have never been \n     to a gay pride event. This year was going to be my year, and \n     I am scared.\n\n  Just as you talked about, the fear--I don't live in fear, but when I \nhear a gunshot and I hear sirens in my neighborhood--or not that far \naway from my direct neighborhood--I have grandchildren, and I have not \nheard those gunshots and police sirens when my daughters or \ngrandchildren have been there, but you think about that.\n  The question is, Why is it harder to obtain a driver's license than \nit is to buy a gun? Why do we not have the political courage to pass \nreasonable laws?\n  I have been in public office a long time, and I have seen so many of \nmy colleagues, mostly Republicans, just cower when the NRA calls or \ncower when they think about the whole idea of passing gun laws.\n  Yesterday a reporter told me that Republican Senators will not talk \nto her right now about any issue because they are afraid they might ask \nabout the NRA and the campaign dollars they have gotten from the NRA.\n  What is it? Fundamentally, why is it harder to obtain a driver's \nlicense than it is to buy a gun?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for the question. I just want to \nacknowledge we have had a number of House Members come to the floor of \nthe Senate today to support our effort.\n  Congressman Richmond, a good friend of mine and of Senator Booker, \nwho has just witnessed the ongoing slaughter in New Orleans--unabated \nbecause of inaction from this Congress--has joined us. I have seen a \nnumber of other Members from the House join us as well. I thank them \nand I thank in particular my friend Representative Richmond for being \nhere.\n  I think that is a great question, Senator Brown, especially in the \ncontext of the history of the NRA's advocacy in this body.\n  It used to be that the NRA actually supported expanding background \nchecks. In the wake of the Columbine tragedy, it was the NRA that was \narguing to close the loopholes in our background check system. So as a \nmeans of answering why we can't get agreements, you have to ask \nyourself and answer the question as to what has happened to the gun \nlobby.\n  The gun lobby used to come here. It originated, of course, as just a \ngun safety organization. It morphed into much more of an advocacy \norganization. But even as late as the Columbine massacre, they were \nstill arguing for changes in our laws to better protect individuals.\n  Today they are an absolutist organization. Today they broker no \ncompromise. Unfortunately, there is a large percentage of this body, \nenough to block commonsense legislation, that follows their lead. But \nthere has been a transformation in the advocacy of that organization.\n  Many of us are still hopeful that gun owners who are members of the \nNRA support what we are talking about today, right? The polls tell you \nthat NRA members support background checks to cover more sales and stop \npeople on the no-fly list from getting guns. We hope they might prevail \nupon their association to be more constructive.\n  I yield for another question.\n  Mr. BROWN. May I ask one more question and then I will turn it back \nto Senator Stabenow, who I know has some questions for Senator Murphy. \nI want to share a letter I received from a woman in Columbus:\n\n       I'm devastated by the events this weekend in Orlando. \n     Frankly, I have had to personally be retriggered with every \n     mass shooting that's occurred in the past three years.\n       My tragedy occurred 3 years ago this July. The love of my \n     life, best friend and man I was going to marry was murdered. \n     . . . He was shot to death by a prior felon--with a gun.\n       It can happen to anyone, anywhere, at anytime, for any \n     reason.\n       Change is needed now. We can't keep waiting. . . . Please \n     do something. Anything. Saving one person from feeling the \n     hell I've felt these past three years is worth it. My heart \n     hurts for the loved ones affected by this weekend, because I \n     know this pain.\n\n  I guess this is just a question, and maybe there is no answer. But \nwhy, when so many in our country have felt this pain--certainly, the \npain is felt more among poorer people and people of color because they \nhave been the victims far too often and, in the great majority of \ncases, are totally innocent, and far too many of them are children, \nwhether it is Sandy Hook or a random shooting in Cleveland or Newark or \nHartford or Detroit or New Haven. What do I tell this woman from \nCincinnati or from Columbus who says to me: Can't you do something? Why \nshould more people have the pain she has felt?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank Senator Brown. I think the answer is we have to \nlook at ourselves sometimes, and ask: Have we fought as hard as we \npossibly could to galvanize the American public around these changes?\n  The reality is--and I said this earlier on the floor--that the small \nhandful of individuals in this country who oppose these changes are \ncalling our offices sometimes with more frequency than the large \nmajority of Americans who support these changes, and they take cues \nfrom us.\n  So that is why we are here. We were about to come back to the Senate \nand just proceed with business as usual. As if Orlando didn't happen, \nwe were just going to start debating amendments to the Commerce-\nJustice-Science act. Those on the floor today--certainly, in particular \nmyself, Senator Booker, and\n\n[[Page S3931]]\n\nSenator Blumenthal--said: Enough. Enough. We have to give a signal to \nthe American public that we care--that we care so deeply about the \nconsequences of inaction that we are, at the very least, going to stop \nthis process from moving forward until we can't stand any longer.\n  Now that is a tiny, tiny sacrifice. But at least it shows we are \nwilling to put something behind the passion that letter writer and many \nothers have.\n  So there are a variety of answers to your question, I say to Senator \nBrown--the strength of the gun lobby, the misunderstanding about the \nnature of the Second Amendment, and the data that we have not done a \ngood enough job of getting out there that talks about the efficacy of \nstronger gun laws. But this exercise today on the floor is also a part \nof changing that reality.\n  With that, I yield for a question, without losing my right to the \nfloor, to just a great champion on this issue, the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Well, I thank the Senator, and I appreciate the junior \nSenator from Connecticut for yielding for a question.\n  I first want to thank Senator Murphy and the senior Senator from \nConnecticut, the Senator from New Jersey, and so many others who have \nbeen on the floor. Our Democratic caucus is united in saying: Enough is \nenough. I am very grateful to our Senators from Connecticut and New \nJersey who have come to the floor to lead us in that stand of saying: \nEnough is enough.\n  So I do have a question, but let me first indicate that when we look \nat this situation--whether it is Orlando or Sandy Hook or Tucson or \nColumbine or on and on and on or every day on the streets of our cities \nand communities across the country--it is time to stop just putting out \nstatements. I don't know about my colleagues on the floor, but I am \nsure they share with me this sense of frustration of constantly having \nto put out statements saying that our thoughts and prayers are with the \nfamilies, because, of course, our thoughts and prayers are with the \nfamilies, but our actions should be with the families. That is what we \nare here today to focus on. It is not enough to have words. They expect \nus to act and to make a difference.\n  I am so grateful for so many Americans from all walks of life and all \nreligions who have joined together. I am so proud of the powerful \nstatements coming from the Muslim community, standing in partnership \nand friendship with the LGBT community and the Jewish and Christian \ncommunity at large, and all of those who have said: Enough is enough. \nHate crime, act of terror--enough is enough.\n  I want to lift up, before asking my question, two young people from \nMichigan who were part of the horror 4 days ago. A 25-year-old who had \nbeen living in Saginaw, MI, was killed in the Orlando terrorist hate-\ncrime attack. By all accounts he was a wonderful young man. He owned \nhis own business, loved his family, and recently attended his niece's \ngraduation. His friends said:\n\n       Nobody can say a bad word about him. He always had a smile \n     on his face. He always loved to laugh.\n\n  Additionally, a Detroit native was also killed in the attack. He \nworked as a mental health counselor, and he had won awards for his work \nin the LGBT community.\n  We in Michigan have a long tradition of enjoying hunting, fishing, \nand outdoor activities. I grew up in northern Michigan. My family is \nvery involved in hunting and legal and safe gun ownership. But that is \nnot what this debate is about. My family--my brothers, my son, my \nnieces and nephews--and others look at me and say: What is going on \nhere? This is not about whether we can enjoy hunting or legal gun \nownership. My family is saying to me: Wait a minute; let me get this \nstraight. There is a terror watch list where you can't fly, but you can \nbuy a gun. What is that? They go into a gun shop, and they get a \nbackground check. But you can go to a gun show or on the Internet and \nnot?\n  So I ask my colleague, a great leader on this issue, because I think \nit is important now to explain a little more about these two things we \nwant to accomplish: What are the two things we want to accomplish? In \ngoing through all of this--stopping the regular business of the Senate \nand saying we have to act; we have to begin to address what we can do \nfor these horrors--what are the two things we are asking for?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank Senator Stabenow because I think it is important \nsometimes to reset the floor and talk about what we are asking for. \nThey are pretty simple, they are bipartisan, and they are \nnoncontroversial outside of this body.\n\n  One, we want a version of the Feinstein bill, which prohibits \nindividuals on the no-fly list from getting a gun to come before the \nSenate Floor for a vote. Second, in order to make that bill effective, \nwe want a version of the Manchin-Toomey compromise to expand background \nchecks to gun shows and Internet sales to come before the Senate for a \nvote.\n  Both of those measures are supported broadly by 80 to 90 percent of \nthe American public, and both are necessary in order to protect \nAmericans from terrorist attack. Why? Because we know last year 90 \npercent of individuals who were on the no-fly list and who tried to buy \na gun were successful in buying one. The only reason 10 percent weren't \nis because they were on some other list of prohibited individuals. So \nwe know every year there are individuals on the no-fly list who are \ntrying to buy guns and they are getting them. We know, unfortunately, \nthe individual--the shooter--in Orlando was at least for a period of \ntime on those lists, and he went and bought a gun.\n  In order to make it effective, you also have to make sure you are \ncapturing gun sales that happen online and at gun shows. We think what \nwe are asking for is pretty simple. Both those proposals have drawn \nbipartisan support. Neither are controversial outside this body. And, \nfrankly, it is about the lowest hanging fruit we could imagine in order \nto get this body on record as trying to stop the carnage in this \ncountry.\n  I yield for a question.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank my colleague. I wonder if I might just ask \nsomething, in addition to that. I understand our distinguished leader \non appropriations, Senator Mikulski, and Senator Nelson as well, have \nan amendment that would give law enforcement the resources necessary to \ncombat terrorism. We certainly came from a very important briefing \ntoday, and we are discussing how terrorism certainly is an all-hands-\non-deck operation. But without adequate resources, other things may not \nreceive the resources they need as well, in terms of law enforcement.\n  I wonder if the Senator might just talk about the importance of \nresources for law enforcement as well, and how it is our job, in the \ncontext of this appropriations bill, to make sure we are prioritizing \nthe fighting of terrorism as well as gun violence.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank Senator Stabenow for the question.\n  We are asking the FBI to do more and more to protect us from an \nincreasingly complex array of threats, and we are not giving them \nenough resources to do the job. The alternative that has been proposed \nto Senator Feinstein's legislation is laughable, in that it would \nrequire the FBI and law enforcement to go to court every single time \nthey want to stop someone on the no-fly list from getting a weapon. It \nwouldn't be automatic. Instead, they would have 3 days to scurry into a \ncourt, file a motion to deny the weapon, and have a hearing.\n  First of all, there is no way all of that could happen in 3 days, but \nit certainly can't happen with the resources we provide them. So they \ndo not have the resources they need right now in order to protect us \nfrom these myriad of threats that are posed from this desire of ISIS \nand others to inspire lone-wolf attacks. But the alternative to the \nproposal we have proposed just is unworkable on its face, especially \ngiven the resources the FBI has.\n  I yield for a question.\n  Ms. STABENOW. If I might just again clarify with the distinguished \nSenator, so we are all clear. Right now, an individual can be stopped \nfrom getting on an airplane----\n  Mr. MURPHY. Right.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Because they are on a terror watch list, but they can \nchoose, rather than getting on that plane, to go buy a gun and go into \na nightclub in Orlando and have carnage and terrorism occur.\n  That is basically what is happening now and that Republican \ncolleagues\n\n[[Page S3932]]\n\nare saying should continue. Not that they want the violence to continue \nbut they are not willing to act to stop people from getting a gun who \nare on the terrorist no-fly list.\n  Mr. MURPHY. That is correct. I am still waiting for one of our \nRepublican colleagues to come to the floor and suggest that the \nindividuals on the no-fly list have their right to fly restored, \nbecause if you are so worried about the wrong people being on that \nlist, then you should come to the floor and propose those individuals \nbe able to get on a plane.\n  But no one is proposing that because they would be tarred and \nfeathered by their constituents if they were to propose individuals who \nhave had intersection with terrorist groups be able to get on a plane \nat their local airport. Thus, it is hard to understand why there is a \nbelief that none of these people should fly, but all of these people \nshould be able to buy assault weapons.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I think the American people are scratching their heads \nat this moment. Hopefully, enough colleagues on the other side of the \naisle will join us to close this incredible loophole.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator.\n  My friend from Massachusetts was so eloquent earlier on the floor, \nand I yield to Senator Markey for a question without losing my right to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. MARKEY. I thank the Senator, and again I ask my colleague: Why \nwon't the Republicans allow for the debate and a vote on whether or not \nindividuals on a terrorist target list should be able to get a gun \nanywhere in America?\n  The answer to that question has not been forthcoming from the \nRepublican Party because the NRA, or the National Rifle Association, \ndoes not have a good answer to it, except that they do not want any \nexceptions to the rule that anybody should be able to buy a gun at any \ntime, even if they are on a terrorist target list in the United States.\n  So that is going to be our big challenge out here. What are the \nlimits to the power of the National Rifle Association over the \nRepublican Party; and, as a result, over the United States Senate? \nBecause the American people don't think we have to accept this epidemic \nof gun violence in our country. The American people do not believe it \nis preordained. They believe it is preventable.\n  Every week, 56 children die from gun violence. That is nearly three \nNewtown massacres every single week. Thirty thousand Americans shot and \nkilled each year is not inevitable. It is unacceptable, and it is \nimmoral.\n  We cannot wait any longer to put these commonsense gun laws on the \nbooks. We cannot wait any longer to make our streets safer.\n  I believe assault weapons belong in combat, not in our communities. \nWe need a ban on these military-styled assault weapons. We need to \neliminate the trafficking of guns into our communities across our \nNation. We need to ban high-capacity magazine clips that turn guns into \nweapons of war. There is no reason for an ordinary American to have \nthis in our neighborhoods, on our streets, or near our schools. We need \nbackground checks on all gun sales, including private sales and \npurchases made online and at gun shows. We need to crack down on straw \npurchasing. We need to ban gun sales on sites on the Internet like \nFacebook and Instagram. Right now, anyone can do a search for an AK-47 \nor AR-15 or even guns for sale on Instagram and find guns for sale. \nCould you be under 18? Yes. Could you get a gun without a background \ncheck? Yes. We should not allow Instagram to be used as ``Instagun,'' \nenabling the sale and purchase of deadly weapons in possible violation \nof State and Federal law.\n  We can do something here. We don't have to do all of it this week, \nbut the least we should be able to do is what the Senator from \nConnecticut just outlined, two steps; one, if you are on a terrorist \nwatch list, you can't buy a gun in the United States, and, two, you \ncan't get around the background check if you go to a gun show or you go \nto Instagram. You have to go through a background check. Leave all the \nrest of it off the table, banning assault weapons, all the rest of it. \nWe will not do that. How about just debating and doing those two \nthings, which overwhelmingly the American people want us to do.\n  Now, back on September 11, 2001, Mohamed Atta and nine others boarded \ntwo planes at Logan Airport. They hijacked those planes using box \ncutters to kill the flight attendants, to kill the pilots. We do not \nallow box cutters into the passenger section of a plane any longer. We \ndon't allow knives in the passenger section of planes any longer. But \nbelieve it or not, we actually had a debate at the time as to whether \nevery bag that goes onto a passenger plane should be screened. We had a \ndebate that lasted for 4 years as to whether the cargo, which goes into \nthe bottom of a plane, should be screened--4 years. The cargo industry \ndid not want it. The airline industry said it would be too much of an \ninconvenience. Who in America wanted to fly on a plane that had cargo \nunderneath their feet that had not been screened after 9/11, after \nMohamed Atta? Well, we finally won that issue, and everyone accepts the \nwisdom of ensuring that screening takes place on every single passenger \nflight in America because otherwise that is where the new Mohamed Atta \nwould find the aperture to create a disaster in the air. They are smart \npeople. They are cunning people. They are trying to find the opening. \nThey are trying to find the weakness. They are trying to find the \nAchilles heel in our system so they can kill Americans.\n  That is what is happening here. There is another Achilles heel, and \nthat Achilles heel is the fact that the NRA has a vice-like grip on the \nU.S. Senate and the U.S. Congress. They will not let it go. They will \nnot make it possible for us to have a straight up-or-down vote on \nwhether this latter-day Mohamed Atta on a terror target list can buy a \ngun, buy an assault weapon in the United States, whether this new \nMohamed Atta, this new terrorist group, can buy assault weapons at gun \nshows without any background checks whatsoever and then use those \nweapons to kill innocent American citizens. How can the NRA align \nitself with latter-day Mohamed Attas? With latter-day Tsarnaev \nbrothers? How can the NRA do that? How can the Republican Party align \nthemselves with the NRA if that is their agenda? These are the votes we \nshould be having.\n  It is very simple. If you cannot fly, you should not be allowed to \nbuy a weapon in America. If you are a terrorist and you are not \npermitted to fly in our country, how can we have a system that allows \nyou simultaneously to buy an assault weapon that can kill dozens of \npeople or more? We know what is at the top of the terrorist target list \nin our country. We know what they are trying to do. They try to bring \ndown planes. They try to find ways in which they can terrorize \notherwise innocent communities in our country to spread their terror, \nand we know where the Achilles heels are. We shut it down when it came \nto airlines. We can shut it down here when it comes to the purchase of \nweapons if you have already been identified as being on a terror target \nlist, a watch list. The FBI is looking at you, but you can still buy an \nassault weapon. It makes no sense. How many times do we have to learn \nthe lesson until we finally act? Is this not enough? Is what happened \nin Orlando not enough--49 people dead, gay, 44 out of 49 names Latino, \na hate crime, a terror attack, all of it. Do we really need more? Do we \nneed another and another and another? Because we know the day is coming \nwhen this law is going to change. The test of us is that we do it \nbefore more innocent lives are lost; that we have these two bills that \nSenator Murphy referred to brought out here onto the floor; that we \nblock this open door for terrorists to be able to kill in our country, \nto be able to purchase these weapons of mass destruction that kill at a \nlevel that is almost unimaginable.\n  Once again, I thank my friend, and I ask the question of the \nRepublican leadership: Why can't we have this debate? Why can't we have \nthese votes? Now, I know the answer. It is that the NRA--the National \nRifle Association--does not want those votes, but our job as elected \nofficials is to ensure that NRA stands for ``not relevant anymore'' in \nAmerican politics after Orlando, after this massacre. That is our \nhistoric challenge out here today.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut, the Senator from New Jersey, \nthe colleague of the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Blumenthal, and \nfor\n\n[[Page S3933]]\n\nall the Members who have participated in this debate, discussion, \nfilibuster. This is the issue. This is the time. This is the place. We \nare the people who have to resolve this issue. People will look back \nand they will ask: Did we try? Did we really try to put a ban on the \npurchase of these weapons by these terrorist list people in our own \ncountry? That is going to be the test for us. We can't fight the \nbattles over in Aleppo, we can't fight the battles over in Fallujah, \nbut we can fight this battle here on the streets of America. We know \nwhat has to be done. This body just has to have the courage to say to \nthe NRA: No, it is too much. Our country is bleeding. Families are \nhurting. We don't want to see it happen again. This is going to be the \nchallenge of this week and next week and every week until we have these \nvotes and until we close these loopholes.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for conducting this very \nimportant discussion.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for his remarks. I thank him for his \nfocus on assault weapons.\n  We are asking for two different proposals to come before the Senate, \nnot one on banning assault weapons, but it remains a passion of many of \nus. One of the most gruesome facts from the Newtown killings is that \nthere were 20 kids who were shot with that weapon, and not one of them \nsurvived. All 20 of them died. That speaks to the epic, life-ending \npower of an exceptional weapon.\n  I yield to the ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, the \nSenator from Delaware, for a question without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank my colleague from Connecticut for inviting us \nhere and encouraging us to have this conversation.\n  Many of our colleagues have come from a briefing by three of the top \nofficials in this country who deal with homeland security and law \nenforcement. One of the questions that was asked deals with the ability \nof someone who is on a terrorist watch list to be denied the \nopportunity to fly on an airplane and then whether that same person on \na terrorist watch list can be denied the opportunity to buy, for \nexample, an assault weapon. The answer is, I think, shockingly \ndisappointing. A person who is on a terrorist watch list can and will \nbe denied the opportunity to fly on an airplane. That makes sense. But \nwhat doesn't make sense is that same person who is denied the ability \nto fly on an airplane because he or she is on a terrorist watch list \ncan then go into a gun show or a gun store and buy a weapon, including \nan assault weapon. That just makes no sense to me. That makes no sense \nto me.\n  I would add maybe two other quick points, if I may, and then I will \nstop and yield to others, including the Senator from Wisconsin who was \nkind enough to allow me to say a few words. The number of people who \nwant to leave this country and go to link up with ISIS and be a \nfighter, that number has dropped and continues to drop dramatically, \ndown to one per month now. In the United States, it is down to one per \nmonth. The reason that number continues to drop, and drop dramatically, \nis because ISIS is on the run. ISIS early on was thought of as a \nwinning team. No more. They are being regarded, I think appropriately, \nas a losing team.\n  I asked the question of the Secretary of Homeland Security: Is it \ntrue that since 9/11 every American who has died in this country at the \nhands of a jihadist terrorist--have they died at the hands of someone \nfrom another country who has somehow slipped in secretly or covertly? \nThe answer is, every person who has died in this country since 9/11--an \nAmerican citizen--has been killed by someone who is a U.S. citizen or \nsomeone who is a legal resident here.\n  The Secretary of Homeland Security is pleading with us to give his \nDepartment the ability to create counterviolent extremism capability \nwithin the Department to improve it. That would enable us to establish \npartnerships with the Muslim communities, faith organizations, and \nother organizations to be able to reach out to work with them to reduce \nthe likelihood that folks who are already here and could be radicalized \nwill not be radicalized.\n  I appreciate the chance to share a couple of those takeaways from \nwhat I thought was a very important briefing. I again say thank you to \nthe Senator from Wisconsin for allowing me to slip in at this point in \nthe discussion.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator from Delaware who, earlier on the \nfloor, talked about this notion that ISIS is on retreat inside the \nMiddle East, and they have only a handful of motivations remaining for \npeople to join their movement. No longer is the inevitable geographic \nexpansion of the caliphate available to them as a reason for \nrecruitment, but the belief or the argument that the East is at war \nwith the West certainly is still available to them, especially if we \nreact in the wrong way to the threat that is presented to us. Frankly, \nwe have not gotten into a discussion thus far on this floor about what \none of the Presidential candidates is proposing, but part of the reason \nwe are demanding a vote on these measures is because this is the right \nway to respond. There is a latent fear in the American public that is \nunderstandable. There is a wrong way to respond to that that will, \nfrankly, make us less safe. There is a right way to respond, and I \nthink the American public gets that because of the 90-percent approval \nratings of the things we are proposing.\n  I thank the Senator, and I yield to the Senator from Wisconsin for a \nquestion without losing my right to the floor.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Through the Chair, I would like to ask a question about \nthe tragic massacre in Orlando.\n  I wanted to lead into that by first of all thanking and deeply \nappreciating the work and efforts of my colleague from Connecticut who \nhas come to the floor so many times to talk about the lives and the \nidentities and the legacies of the people who have lost their lives to \ngun violence and the families who are there to remember them.\n  I remember so profoundly the massacre at Newtown. Senator Murphy \nbrought photographs of all of the victims and their families and told \ntheir stories at length on this Senate floor.\n  As weeks and months persisted here in the U.S. Senate and no action \nwas taken to do commonsense things to make access to these weapons more \ndifficult, the Senator from Connecticut started coming to the floor and \ntalking about some of the people we don't read about because the media \ndoesn't rush to the scene when somebody dies in a drive-by shooting or \nin a place that doesn't garner the attention and the spotlight the way \nthe massacre and tragedy in Orlando has.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his perseverance, and I am \nso proud to join him this afternoon in this insistence for action. I am \nin such strong agreement with the Senator from Connecticut about the \nneed to close what we call the terror gap and strengthen our background \ncheck laws because what we have seen over the last weeks and certainly \non Sunday in the early morning is the nexus of hate and terror and easy \naccess to weapons of war by people who should not have them.\n  I can't tell you how many times I have penned the words ``You are in \nmy thoughts and prayers'' and spoken the words ``You are in my heart, \nin my thoughts, and in my prayers.'' I can't tell you how many times I \nhave joined--either in my former service in the House of \nRepresentatives or here in the Senate--in a moment of silence. Silence \nis not enough. Thoughts and prayers are important, but they are not \nenough. We have to act.\n  I join many of my colleagues here tonight in the effort toward \nsecuring a vote by this Senate to make it harder--just a little bit \nharder--for people who hate and people involved in terrorism to get a \nhold of weapons of war. We have an opportunity because we have a bill \nbefore us. It is the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill.\n  I have the honor of serving on the Senate Appropriations Committee \nand being a member of the subcommittee. This is the moment, this is the \nbill, and this is our opportunity. I am not saying that had this been \nin law a year ago, a month ago, a week ago, that this wouldn't have \nhappened, but our silence is unacceptable, and we must act.\n  We are better than this as a country. I can't tell you how many times \nI have woken up or heard midday of another mass killing--a crowd around \nthe television set, hungry for news, wanting to know about who \nperished, who is in the hospital, and when is it enough. When are we \ngoing to act?\n\n[[Page S3934]]\n\n  In the political world, we also, regrettably, fall into our--I don't \nknow what to call it--comfort zone. Let's only talk about this as a \nterrorist incident, or let's only talk about this as a hate crime, or \nlet's only talk about this in terms of gun violence. This is all of the \nabove. We have to come together. We have to be united. We have to be \nstrong in order to respond.\n  I also have to speak as a member of the LGBTQ community. This last \nFriday, I had the honor of going to the opening ceremonies at the \nPridefest in Milwaukee, WI. They were celebrating their 30th year of \nPridefest. In preparing for what I was going to say at that opening \nceremony, I reflected on how different things were 30 years ago, in \n1986. That was actually the year I was first elected to local office. I \ndidn't have a lot of colleagues who were in the LGBT community in \nAmerica, let alone the world, at that point in time. Boy, we have \nchanged. We have seen such progress. After celebrating the opening of \nPridefest in Milwaukee, I woke up on Sunday morning, as we all did, to \nthis horrific tragedy in Orlando.\n  A hate crime is a crime that targets a particular audience, a \nparticular group in order to send terror throughout that community--not \njust the victims but all who share characteristics with the victims. \nAnd in a month--June--which is Pride Month, when we usually celebrate \nhow far we have come over oppression, over discrimination, over hate \ncrimes, to wake up and see this was truly unspeakable.\n  Back to the legislating we do on the Senate floor, I will be \nsupporting a number of amendments on this appropriations bill--the one \nthat I came to ask Senator Murphy about but additionally an amendment \nthat would add resources to the Department of Justice to help prevent \nand investigate and enforce our Nation's hate crimes laws. I hope those \nalso will earn votes. I will be supporting the amendment of a \ncolleague, Senator Casey from Pennsylvania, relating to including \nmisdemeanor hate crimes in the list of offenses that should prohibit \nindividuals from being able to acquire or possess weapons of war.\n  Back to our focus right now, our focus right now is on getting a vote \non closing the terror gap, getting a vote on making sure that \nbackground checks occur with regard to every purchase so that you can't \nbe rejected from purchasing a weapon and then run to the Internet and \npurchase a weapon that way or run to a gun show and purchase a weapon \nthat way outside of the background check system.\n  One of the things that are so important is when the Senator from \nConnecticut came to the floor and showed the faces and read the names \nand told the stories of the victims of gun violence, massacres in \nConnecticut and in locations all over the United States. I have been so \nmoved as I have had the opportunity to see the media begin to share \nwith us information about the names and the lives of the 49 victims of \nthis hateful attack.\n  Through the Chair, I want to ask Senator Murphy a question about the \n49 victims of this tragedy.\n  Luis Daniel Conde was 39 years old, and Juan P.

He studied law at the Universidad del Este en \nCarolina.\n  Now, through the Chair, I would like to ask Senator Murphy a question \nabout the 45 victims of this tragedy. As someone who has come to this \nfloor and read the names, shared the images, and told the stories of so \nmany in our country who have lost their lives to gun violence, does the \nSenator from Connecticut agree that the time to act is now, and that \nour thoughts and prayers for their deaths are important, but not \nenough?\n  (Mr. SASSE assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the time she has \ntaken to talk about each of these beautiful individuals--these young \nmen and women who went to a dance club to celebrate their lives and \ntheir friends and Pride Month and who will never, ever walk the face of \nthis Earth again, and their friends and families will never get to \ncelebrate these individuals' lives. It is a reminder, as you talk about \nwho these people are individually, as much as we talk about \nstatistics--the 30,000 who have died--that this is about lives.\n  You could tell the story, for each one of them, of 20 other people \nwhose lives will never be the same because of this tragedy. You could \nput nearly two of those charts up every single day, and that is what is \nso scary. We are fixated on this tragedy because it is unique and \nhorrific, but we could put up that chart every day, and it is important \nto tell their stories--to tell who they were--because hopefully that is \npart of the imperative for us to act.\n  Senator Udall has been patient and on the floor, and I know there are \nothers who are waiting to speak. So let me yield for a question to \nSenator Udall, who has been a great friend on this issue, without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I really appreciate the leadership of \nSenator Murphy and his effort to see that the Senate addresses \ncommonsense gun legislation. It is probably around the hour when people \nare getting home, and they are wondering why we are here, why the \nSenator is choosing to hold the floor in this extended debate.\n  People should know that our Nation has seen a string of gun \ntragedies. The Senator's home State of Connecticut\n\n[[Page S3936]]\n\nsaw the horrific Sandy Hook shooting of young children. In San \nBernardino we saw an ISIL-inspired terrorist attack. This terrorist \nslaughtered his former coworkers--innocent people. In Orlando, a \ndisturbed man, perhaps inspired by ISIL, murdered 49 people in cold \nblood. This was an assault on the LGBT community--a hate crime. In the \nlast week, in my home State of New Mexico, we have seen some terrible \ngun tragedies. A man is now accused of murdering his wife and four \nchildren in Roswell, NM.\n  There are so many tragedies, and they all have different reasons. But \none thing that almost all of us agree on is that we must do more to \nkeep dangerous weapons out of the hands of people who mean harm to \nothers or to themselves. You should have to pass a background check to \nbuy a gun. If you are a risk to others because of a history of making \nthreats or because you may be affiliated with a known terrorist \norganization, law enforcement should be able to step in and prevent you \nfrom buying weapons.\n  The first thing I wanted to ask the Senator from Connecticut, for \npeople who are just tuning in right now, is this: What are the two \namendments that you are seeking to vote on today, and how would they \nhelp stem this tied of horrific violence that we are seeing across the \ncountry, and as you have continually pointed out happens every day?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the question. It \nis simple. We are asking for the two sides of the aisle here to come \ntogether and bring us votes on a bill that would prevent individuals \nwho are on the terrorist watch list--the no-fly list--from being able \nto purchase firearms and then, second, to expand out those purchases \nthat are covered by background checks to places where gun sales are \nmigrating, which is largely gun shows and Internet sales. These are \nboth measures that are supported broadly by the American people.\n  To the Senator from New Mexico, we are asking for more than just \nvotes on these measures. We think there is common ground on these \nissues. We can't think of any excuse why we can't come together and \nfigure out a way to get these passed.\n  We have taken votes in the past, and votes are important and would be \nimportant if we took them, but what would be more important is to \nbridge our differences. There are plenty of people who aren't on the \nfloor today who can make that happen so that we can pass legislation \nrather than just debate and vote on it.\n  I yield to the Senator for an additional question.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask the Senator this, through the Chair. \nMy offices in New Mexico today received many calls asking why Democrats \nare on the floor debating the Second Amendment. I would like to ask the \nSenator from Connecticut if this is an accurate assessment of today's \ndebate.\n  It is my understanding--and I believe most of my colleagues would \nagree--that the Supreme Court has settled this issue. Congress can't \ntake away that right. President Obama can't take away that right.\n  What we are doing here today is taking steps to ensure that dangerous \npeople are not able to buy a gun. Is that the Senator's understanding?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for this \nclarification. I, in fact, don't think there is anything about this \ndebate that we are having that, as they would describe it, is a debate \nabout the Second Amendment. There is no dispute that the Second \nAmendment now, in the wake of the Heller decision, guarantees the right \nof an individual to own a firearm. That is the law of the land. But \nthat same decision very explicitly makes it clear that it is within the \nright of Congress to put parameters around that right to make sure, for \ninstance, that criminals or would-be criminals don't get access to \nfirearms.\n  So this certainly is not a debate about the Second Amendment. The \nSecond Amendment is clear. Right now, as interpreted by the Supreme \nCourt, it guarantees an individual's right to a firearm, with \nreasonable conditions placed upon it by Congress. So we are simply \ndebating the extension of a widely accepted condition on the Second \nAmendment, which is the inability of criminals, and as we are debating \ntoday, individuals on the terrorist watch list.\n  I yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. UDALL. I would ask an additional question here. Last week, \nseveral of us announced a ``we the people'' government reform package, \nand I plan to introduce that bill tomorrow. The bill includes several \npieces. It has Senator Whitehouse's DISCLOSE Act, which would require \nmandatory disclosure of all special interest campaign donations. It \nalso includes my good friend Senator Bennet's legislation to strengthen \nlobbying laws.\n  I bring this up because I think it highlights the reason for \nCongress's inaction on gun violence. We have been here before after the \ntragedy in Connecticut at Sandy Hook. We stood here and debated many of \nthe same issues, including expanding background checks, closing the gun \nshow loophole, limiting the capacity of magazines--things that should \nhave been passed but weren't.\n  I wish to ask my friend from Connecticut: Do you think our inability \nto pass commonsense gun safety legislation is in any way connected to \nthe flood of money in our campaigns from special interests?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for the question.\n  I think the flood of special interest money into politics is the \nanswer for why lots of things don't happen here, and, frankly, it is \nalso the answer for why a lot of things do happen here. So I think you \nare spot-on, through the Chair to Senator Udall, that part and parcel \nof this conversation is a conversation about reforming the way in which \ninfluence is exerted in this place.\n  Something is wrong when 90 percent of the American public says that \nthey want expanded background checks, and something is wrong when 75 \npercent of the American public says they want people on the no-fly list \nto be prohibited from buying guns, and we don't act on it. I can't give \nspecific diagnoses as to why that is, but it certainly speaks to the \nneed for the reforms the Senator is talking about.\n  I yield to the Senator for an additional question without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL. I ask one additional question through the Chair.\n  Many New Mexicans live in very rural areas near the border with \nMexico. Carrying a gun is not unusual in those areas. It is a different \nway of life than in Connecticut or anywhere on the east coast. For \nexample, the entire State of Connecticut is about 5,500 square miles, \nwith a population of 3.5 million. Hidalgo County, NM, one of our 33 \ncounties in southwestern New Mexico, is almost 3,500 square miles and \nhas a population of fewer than 5,000. Many of the ranches there are \ntens of thousands of acres. They are in the remote boot heel area of \nthe State, a region that is divided by mountain ranges and that borders \nMexico on two sides. So I understand why many New Mexicans feel safer \ncarrying a firearm. They might be miles from the closest help. It might \ntake law enforcement a significant time to reach them. So I certainly \ndon't want to do anything to infringe on their right to protect \nthemselves with a firearm.\n  But I would ask my friend from Connecticut who has worked on this \nissue so long and understands this so well, would any of the proposals \nwe are asking to get a vote on take away their rights to purchase or \nown a firearm?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for the question. I will forgive the \ndisparagement of Connecticut's small size, but the answer is no. The \nonly limitation would be that if any of those individuals were not \npermitted to fly because they were on the terrorist watch list, they \nwould not be able to purchase a gun. In 2015 there were only 200-some-\nodd individuals who were on the no-fly list who attempted to buy a gun. \nOther than that limitation--and I imagine there are very few or no \nranchers who are on that list.\n  Mr. UDALL. I appreciate that answer, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator very much.\n  I yield to my good friend, the Senator from Colorado, for a question \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut, and \nI would say to the Senator from Connecticut, those attempting to \ndisparage the size of Connecticut--being from\n\n[[Page S3937]]\n\nColorado, I certainly won't do that, but I would ask you to share the \nbiggest concern you have heard about requiring universal background \nchecks on gun sales.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for that question. I talked to \nSenator Manchin about this earlier today. Much of the concern that I \nhear from individuals is that it is somehow a slippery slope that \neventually leads to the government confiscating weapons. That is a \nmythology that has been created out of whole cloth by individuals who \nhave something to gain from selling the story of perpetual fear of the \ngovernment.\n  Of course there is no evidence in the history of the national \ncriminal background check system that is the case. So I think the root \nof people's opposition is in a fear about a hidden agenda of the \ngovernment, which we know is simply not the truth. All the criminal \nbackground check systems do is protect the public by keeping guns out \nof the hands of violent criminals.\n  I yield for the question.\n  Mr. BENNET. I appreciate the answer to that question.\n  I will share some of the experiences of Colorado, and I will ask the \nSenator from Connecticut a question.\n  I want to say first to the people of Orlando and the people of \nFlorida how sorry I am for the tragedy that has befallen them. On \nSunday morning, I got up and opened the paper on my device and saw at \nthat time that 20 people had been killed, and then it quickly grew to \n50. I can only remember the shock when we had the shootings in the \nAurora movie theater, and I know the Senator from Connecticut had the \ntremendous shock of the killings of the elementary school children in \nNewtown, CT. I thought, as I always do when this happens, that my \nbrother or sister could have been in there, my mother or father could \nhave been in there, or my son or actually one of my daughters could \nhave been in there, and I thought of the feeling somebody must have \nwhen they know they are never going to see their loved one again.\n  I was fortunate, obviously, not to be in that circumstance, but on \nSunday morning, my wife Susan and I were taking my 11-year-old \ndaughter--my youngest daughter--to camp, and the only thing I was \ntrying to do before I got her there was to make sure she didn't see the \nnews, make sure she didn't hear about what happened, make sure she \ndidn't leave her parents feeling the anxiety they felt after Newtown \nhappened, the horror they felt after Aurora happened, the knowledge \nthat they are growing up in a country unlike the country we grew up in, \nwhere children have a reasonable fear that something like this could \nhappen to them.\n  Our experience in Colorado--as the Senator knows, on July 20, 2012, a \ngunman walked into a crowded theater in Aurora--people were there just \nto watch a show--and killed 12 innocent people, just like the innocent \npeople who were killed on Sunday morning or the children killed in \nNewtown. There were 58 wounded from the gunfire. We lost 12 lives, \npeople who were full of life and aspirations, loved by family and \nfriends. I have read their names on this floor. I have talked about who \nthey were on this floor.\n  But unlike Washington, in Colorado, our legislators rose to the \noccasion and made some tough decisions, which is why I am asking this \nline of questions to the Senator from Connecticut. They got together \nand they actually strengthened our background check system. Colorado's \nLegislature closed the gun show loophole and the Internet loophole and \nrequired a background check for every gun sale.\n  What has happened? Let me give an example. In 2015 the stronger \nbackground check system blocked 7,000--I want to be precise about \nthis--7,714 people from buying guns. That may sound like a lot, but \n350,000 people applied for guns in Colorado in 2015. That is just over \n2 percent of the people who applied for guns. Ninety-eight percent of \nthe people who applied got their guns.\n  By the way, I have a report from the Colorado Bureau of \nInvestigation, which on a monthly basis publishes all this data so \neverybody in Colorado can see what is going on. It has, among other \nthings, the average wait time, the average time it takes on the \nInternet to get this check done in Colorado. It takes 9 minutes to get \nthe background check.\n\n  More important than the percentage--that, of course, is a low \npercentage--is who is in the percentage. We have murderers who have \nbeen denied guns. We have rapists who have been denied guns. We have \ndomestic abusers in that 2 percent who have been denied guns. We have \nkidnappers who have been denied guns. Is there anybody who is going to \ncome to the floor of the Senate and say that Colorado is worse off \nbecause we have kept guns out of the hands of murderers and kidnappers \nand rapists?\n  This isn't mythical; this is the actual fact of what is going on in a \nwestern State that has background checks. Nobody can come here and \nargue that we are not safer because these people who shouldn't have had \na gun don't have a gun, this 2 percent.\n  But in stark contrast--this is why I came to the floor tonight--this \nis in stark contrast to what the Colorado Legislature did after the \nAurora shooting. This Congress did nothing after Newtown, after Aurora, \nafter Orlando--nothing. Time and again we return to this floor after a \nmass shooting and yet are unable to do the simple things, such as close \nthe gun show loophole once and for all. That is not about taking guns \nfrom people who already have guns; that is about keeping guns out of \nthe hands of people who shouldn't have guns. If your State is like my \nState, that is going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 percent \nof the people who can't get a gun or apply for a gun permit.\n  The least we can do is close the terrorism loophole that allows \nterrorists on the watch list or people who are on the watch list to buy \na weapon. That makes no sense at all. I think the American people \nclearly agree with that. The American people clearly support background \nchecks. Ninety percent of the American people believe we should \nstrengthen background checks.\n  I thank my colleagues who are here today. It is a particular \nprivilege to be here with my two colleagues from New Mexico, and I \nthank the Senator from Connecticut for his leadership.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator from Colorado for his passion on this \nissue and for the personal decisions we wrestle with, especially those \nof us with children.\n  I now yield for a question.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I would just like to add one thing, if I \ncould.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I will yield to the Senator from Colorado for a question.\n  Mr. BENNET. You know, it is Pride Month, and we have our Pride parade \nthis Sunday in Denver. For the last 10 years, that is how we have \ncelebrated Father's Day. Father's Day coincides with Denver's Pride \nparade, and my wife and children and I all go. This Sunday my phone \nrang. My oldest daughter was on a civil rights tour in the South with \nher choir, and we started talking about this, and she reminded me that \nwe missed last year's Pride parade because we were at the Shorter AME \nChurch in Denver worshipping with that congregation in the wake of the \nshootings in Charleston. She was the one who had to remind me of that, \nbut when she did, it was another reminder of how searing these \nexperiences are for the next generation of Americans.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank my colleague. He is right. Charleston was almost \na year ago to the day. But it is hard to keep track of when these year \nanniversaries occur because we are now having 1-year and 2-year and 3-\nyear and 4-year anniversaries and major, epidemic mass shootings almost \nevery month, and we are coming up on 4 years for Sandy Hook this \nDecember.\n  I thank the Senator, and now I yield for a question to the Senator \nfrom Hawaii without losing my right to the floor.\n  Ms. HIRONO. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for yielding his \ntime on the floor for a question, and I want to join all the people of \nHawaii in expressing our deep sadness and condolences to the families \nand friends of all those who lost their lives and who were injured in \nthis tragedy in Orlando. Our entire country shares in your grief.\n  Like everyone who has spoken today, I am saddened and outraged by \nwhat occurred in Orlando this past weekend. One of the victims, \nKimberly ``K.J.'' Morris, moved to Orlando from Hawaii\n\n[[Page S3938]]\n\njust 2 months ago to take care of her mother and grandmother in \nFlorida. K.J.'s grandmother Emma Johnson said:\n\n       Knowing her, she would be trying to help everybody get out \n     instead of running for her life. That is the type of person \n     she is.\n\n  The lives K.J. and others led were cut tragically short. Meanwhile, \nCongress has been unable and unwilling to act to keep guns out of the \nhands of people who shouldn't have them.\n  I commend my colleague from Connecticut for his leadership on this \nimportant issue. He has been on the floor of the Senate week after \nweek, month after month, calling on us to enact sensible gun \nlegislation to keep our communities safe and to save lives.\n  I shared a transition office with Senator Murphy in the days \nfollowing the Newtown attack, and I saw his dedication and passion on \nthis issue firsthand.\n  In his first speech on the Senate floor, the Senator from Connecticut \nsaid:\n\n       I never imagined that my maiden speech would be about guns \n     or gun violence. Just like I could never imagine I would be \n     standing here in the wake of 20 little kids having died in \n     Sandy Hook or six adults who protected them. But sometimes \n     issues find you.\n\n  We all share his heartbreak that, of all issues, this is the one that \nfound him. But I am proud to stand with him and with all my colleagues \nand with all the children, families, and communities affected by the \ngun violence epidemic in our country.\n  I agree with my colleague wholeheartedly when he says that it is no \nlonger the time for thoughts, for prayers, for reflection; it is time \nfor action.\n  In Hawaii, we have one of the lowest firearm death rates in the \nentire country. This is not an accident. Our elected leaders in the \nHawaiian community have recognized that our laws should balance the \ninterests of responsible gun owners with the interests of public \nsafety.\n  Of course, we need to do more--so much more--on the Federal level. I \nsupported the Manchin-Toomey bill to close the gaping loopholes in our \nbackground check system before guns can be purchased, and I strongly \nsupport Senator Feinstein's bill to prevent people on the terror watch \nlist from purchasing a gun.\n  Now is the time for action on these measures today, on this bill \nbefore us. Otherwise, the carnage in our country will continue. This \nyear alone, 6,093 people have been killed by guns in our country. This \nincludes 125 people who were killed by guns in the 3\\1/2\\ days since \nOrlando. So 125 more people have died since Orlando.\n  If we stood here and provided 6,093 victims a minute of silence, we \nwould be standing here for 4 days, 5 hours, and 33 minutes. Moments of \nsilence are not enough.\n  I wish to ask my colleague from Connecticut a question. What kind of \nmessage are we sending to communities around the country if we once \nagain do nothing to make our country safer?\n  (Mr. ROUNDS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for the question.\n  I think it is a very dangerous message. I think it is the complete \ninability of this body to deal with important questions of the day. \nThere is no doubt that we have disagreements. There is no doubt that \nthere is a different approach on this side of the aisle than there is \non the other side of the aisle. We have proffered the two policy \nproposals that are the easiest to find common ground on, but there is a \nhost of other things that we would like on that we know will be much \nmore difficult to get consensus on from the other side.\n  What is so damaging about not doing anything and, frankly, what is so \noffensive about not even scheduling a debate is that we are admitting \nthat this place doesn't have the capacity and the ability to deal with \nthe big questions that are on people's minds. People are scared right \nnow. They are scared, having watched what happened in Orlando and what \nhappened in San Bernardino. You heard the letter or the voice mail that \nSenator McCaskill transcribed for us by a 14-year-old who didn't know \nwhether she was going to be able to live out her dreams because she \nthought that gun violence was going to sweep over her community.\n  It is so damaging to this country to leave people exposed to this \npotential terror, but it is also damaging to the reputation of this \nbody, which is about as low as you can already get if we don't act.\n  I yield for any other questions.\n  Ms. HIRONO. I thank the Senator for his response. What could be more \nfundamental a job for government than to keep our people and our \ncommunities safe.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator, and I thank her for the questions.\n  I am thankful that my friend from New Mexico, Senator Heinrich, has \njoined us.\n  I yield to him for a question without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I have several questions I wish to ask Senator Murphy \nthrough the Chair today, but I want to start by thanking my friend, \nChris Murphy.\n  I am very proud to call him a colleague. I am proud of seeing him \ntake this stand. I am proud that is forcing us to have this \nconversation. We all get sent here by our constituents to make tough \ndecisions, to find the truth, and to find a path forward. I am very \nproud of him for not letting this go quietly with just another moment \nof silence and no action.\n  Since Sunday, I think most of us have been walking around feeling \nliterally sick to our stomachs, with a sickness that is not going away.\n  I know our whole country is just so weary of seeing shooting after \nshooting and not seeing action and change and something meaningful from \nall of us.\n  I was very proud to see my constituents fill Morningside Park in \nAlbuquerque, Pioneer Woman's Park in Las Cruces, the Plaza in Santa Fe, \nSt. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Roswell, and Orchard Park in \nFarmington--all to remember the victims in Orlando and to say to their \nfamilies that we are not going to forget them and to say to that entire \ncommunity that when the LGBT community is attacked, really all of us \nare attacked.\n  I came to the floor because I can't believe that we are going to let \nthis happen again and not change something. That goes to what I want to \nask the Senator from Connecticut about.\n  I am here because I know that we can take tangible steps to make our \ncountry safer again, steps that are not a burden to gun owners--to gun \nowners like me. Senator Murphy and I have talked about this at length. \nWe are friends, our families are friends, and our kids are friends.\n  This is not about creating a burden for law-abiding gun owners, it is \nnot about a threat to the Second Amendment. What has become clear is \nthat there are simply critical junctures where we have to be able to \nidentify those who would do us harm. Whether it is a young person \ndrastically losing their way or a potential terrorist who is intent on \ndoing harm to others, there are times when we have to be able to step \nin.\n  It is no secret that I have always believed that law-abiding citizens \nshould be able to own firearms for sport, for self-defense. A lot of \nNew Mexicans do just that and do it with incredible responsibility, but \nI simply cannot stand by and let this pass with just another moment of \nsilence.\n  It is personal. As the parent of a 13-year-old, as the parent of a 9-\nyear-old, and watching what happened at Sandy Hook in Senator Murphy's \nhome State--without believing there must be something more that we can \ndo--I find it so frustrating that kids today in elementary school, in \nmiddle school, have to do things that we never had to do when we were \ngrowing up--practice sheltering in place and what happens in an active \nshooter situation. Our kids simply shouldn't have to do that. We owe it \nto the American people to take real action, to reduce the violence in \nour communities. I truly believe that keeping guns out of the hands of \npeople who are, frankly, legally prohibited from having them is just \nsuch common sense.\n  The fact that we are arguing about this is a little bit unfathomable, \nbut that is all we are talking about with background checks. That is \nwhat background checks do. That is what closing the terror gap would \ndo.\n  I can't tell you how many times I have been through the background \ncheck process. Through the Chair, I ask Senator Murphy, if I have to \npass a background check to buy a deer rifle, why shouldn't firearms \nsales made on the Internet or at a gun show require\n\n[[Page S3939]]\n\nsuch a simple procedure that makes sure that law-abiding people have \naccess to firearms and makes sure that people who aren't law-abiding, \nwho have been convicted of a felony, who potentially could be on the \nterrorist watch list do not. We are going to talk a little bit about \nclosing that gap. Shouldn't we make sure that all of our firearms sales \ncut a clear and decisive line between the law-abiding and those who \nhave lost their rights through the actions they have taken?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for his question. I really appreciate \nhis outlining at the beginning of his question that not only is the \nSenator from New Mexico a gun owner but that he is a proud gun owner. \nHe is an active hunter and somebody who cares very deeply about Second \nAmendment rights.\n  His question is spot-on. Why would you have a system that requires \nSenator Martin Heinrich to go get a background check when he buys a gun \nat a gun store but not require an individual to get a background check \nwhen they buy a gun at a gun show? The reality is that when this law \nwas passed, the intention was for the background check to cover almost \nall commercial sales in the country, but it was passed at a time when \nalmost all commercial sales were being done in gun stores. What has \nhappened since that law was passed is that gun sales have migrated--for \nreasons that you can understand--away from bricks-and-mortar stores and \nonto Internet sales and to these gun shows. I guess really all we are \nasking for the text of the law is to basically re-up on the original \nlaw's intent.\n  The Manchin-Toomey bill, for instance, still doesn't contemplate the \nsale of a gun from a father to a son or from a neighbor to a neighbor \nto be subject to a background check, but if you were advertising your \ngun on the Internet or if you are going to an organized market and gun \nsale, then you should go through that background check.\n  I saw you nodding when Senator Bennet mentioned that the average \nbackground check takes under 10 minutes. Some people say: Oh, we can't \nhave background checks; it is so onerous.\n  No, everybody who has gone through a background check can tell you \nthat you are by and large in and out of there in a very short amount of \ntime. Frankly, as to the people who aren't in and out of there in a \nshort amount of time, sometimes that is for a reason, and that is \nimportant to remember.\n  I yield for additional questions.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Well, I want to get to a second question, but I want to \nsay that is absolutely accurate. I can tell you I don't think it has \never taken me more than 15 minutes to go through that process.\n  As a law-abiding gun owner, as somebody who has taught my kids how to \nbe responsible with firearms, I don't want criminals to be in \npossession of firearms. I don't want someone who has been convicted of \ndomestic violence to be in possession of firearms.\n  This is about separating the law-abiding from terrorists and \ncriminals. What could be more common sense?\n  If you look at Federal law, it literally identifies 10 categories of \nindividuals who today are prohibited from shipping or transporting or \nreceiving firearms or even ammunition, because we have made the \njudgment through our judicial system and through our laws that they \npresent a threat to public safety.\n  This list includes convicted felons, as it should. It includes \nfugitives. It includes drug addicts and people who are committed to \nmental health institutions. It includes undocumented immigrants. It \nincludes anyone who has received a dishonorable discharge from the \nmilitary, someone who has renounced their U.S. citizenship, or someone \nwith a restraining order for domestic violence or misdemeanor \nconvictions for domestic violence. Finally, it includes anyone who is \nunder a felony indictment.\n  To me, the second amendment that Senator Murphy was speaking of--the \nsecond amendment not to the Constitution but the second amendment to \nthis bill--speaks to whether it shouldn't be true that someone who is \nsuspected of terrorism should not be considered as unfit to own and use \na firearm legally as someone who has been dishonorably discharged or \nhas renounced their U.S. citizenship. We are talking about people who \nhave gotten on the no-fly list, for example, for some very real \nreasons.\n  Through the Chair, I ask Senator Murphy: If the FBI or intelligence \ncommunity believes that someone is such an imminent threat that they \nare so dangerous that we cannot allow them to board a commercial \nairliner, shouldn't they also be prohibited from buying a gun or \nshouldn't we at least let the Attorney General flag that sale and do \nsomething about it?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for the question. The amendment that \nhas been filed by Senator Feinstein is pretty plain in its wording. It \nsays that the Attorney General can deny the transfer of a firearm based \non the totality of circumstances, that the transferee represents a \ndirect threat to public safety based on a reasonable suspicion that the \ntransferee is engaged or has been engaged in conduct constituting, in \npreparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism or has provided \nmaterial support or resources thereof.\n  There is not a single Member coming to this floor and suggesting that \npeople who are on the no-fly list today should be taken off of it \nbecause their right to fly has been abridged or that there are names on \nthe list that shouldn't be. That would be ludicrous. No one is going to \nsuggest that we should allow people who meet that criteria to be \nallowed to fly in this country. So why on Earth would we allow them to \npurchase a gun?\n\n  I would hope that our colleagues would take a close look at this \nlanguage that Senator Feinstein has filed. It is different from her \ninitial amendment. It is very clear and straightforward. If you are \ndeemed to be a potential threat to the United States because of \nconnections to terrorists, you probably shouldn't be buying dangerous \nassault weapons.\n  I yield for a question.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. And is it not true, I ask Senator Murphy through the \nChair, that there are due process protections in this amendment so that \nif someone were to find themselves on a list, there is a right to \nredress so that we ensure not only that terrorists can't simply walk \ninto a gun store or go online and buy firearms but also so that there \nis due process?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for that question because that is \nkind of the red herring that gets thrown into this mix. Yes, we all \nagree we don't think people who are on the no-fly list should get guns, \nbut it is about the mistakes that are made.\n  No, in Senator Feinstein's amendment--I know she will speak to it \nover the course of the debate--there is a process for individuals to \nremedy any erroneous denial of a firearm. So there is going to be an \nexplicit process set up with which to do that.\n  I think Senator McCaskill said this earlier; she remarked that the \nbipartisan reference is showered upon law enforcement. It is wonderful \nthat we support our members of law enforcement, but then why don't we \ntrust them to make decisions when they have information that would make \nthem very worried about a specific individual buying a firearm? Why \ndon't we trust them to make that decision if we all agree that we trust \nthem to make other decisions to keep us safe?\n  I yield for additional questions.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I was looking at updated data from the Government \nAccountability Office that sort of leads to my next question, and it \nshows that known or suspected terrorists pass a background check to \npurchase a firearm or to purchase explosives 91 percent of the time. \nThe terrorists themselves have actually identified this weakness. They \nknow it exists. I sit on the Intelligence Committee, and we look at \nwhat they communicate to each other so that we can learn how to make \nour country safer.\n  There was an Al Qaeda video in 2011 that literally instructed \npotential terrorists to take advantage of our incomplete background \ncheck system.\n  There have been a number of terrorist attacks in recent years where \ngiving the Attorney General the authority to prohibit a suspected \nterrorist from purchasing a firearm could have at least thrown up \nmeaningful barriers. I think most notable was the horrendous Fort Hood \nshooting in 2009, where MAJ Nidal Hasan was able to pass a background \ncheck and buy a handgun, even though he was under an active FBI \ninvestigation for links to terrorism. He went on to shoot and kill 13 \npeople. He wounded 30 others.\n\n[[Page S3940]]\n\n  So if we are saying that whole categories of other people present \nsuch a public safety threat that they shouldn't have access to \nfirearms, I just can't believe we shouldn't at least give the Attorney \nGeneral the ability to put terrorists on the same do-not-buy list. Why \nwouldn't we do that, Senator Murphy?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I say to Senator Heinrich, it is hard to understand why \nwe wouldn't do that, especially when, as you noted, people on that list \ngo in and buy a gun and they are almost universally successful in \nwalking away with that weapon. It doesn't happen very often; let's be \nrealistic about what the numbers are. I think I read them earlier and \nfrom 2004 to 2014 there were 2,233 instances where suspected terrorists \nattempted to purchase a gun. And as my colleague mentioned, in 91 \npercent of those instances they were successful. So we are only talking \nabout 200 or so instances a year.\n  Now, of course, those are the only ones we know about because those \nare the ones that actually went through a background check. We don't \nactually know about all those people on the no-fly list who tried to \nbuy a weapon successfully online or at a gun show. We know about these \nthat rated about 200 a year.\n  The reality is that terrorists today who are trying to perpetrate \nattacks on American citizens have lately not been using a bomb or an \nexplosive device to carry out that attack. They have been using \nweapons--in the latest attack, an assault weapon. So we should just \nwake up to the weapon of choice of terrorist attackers and adopt this \ncommonsense measure.\n  I yield for a question.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I have one last question for my colleague from \nConnecticut, and this one is probably the hardest one. It is simply \nwhy? Why is this so hard?\n  I stand here as a gun owner. I have looked at each of these \namendments through the lens of what it means to be a law-abiding gun \nowner in this country, with both rights and responsibilities. That is \nwhy we have hunter safety before we ever go out into the field as a 12-\nyear-old or a 13-year-old.\n  I just don't see anything in these two amendments that is an \nunreasonable burden to someone like me. So why is it so hard to even \nhave this conversation on the floor of the Senate? Why is it so hard to \nget a vote? And more importantly, why is it so hard to change these \npolicies and these laws to try to make our country just a little bit \nsafer?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I guess, I say to Senator Heinrich, if I had the 100-\npercent correct answer to that question, we probably wouldn't be here \nbecause we would probably have figured out how to solve it.\n  It is such a unique issue in the American public sphere today, where \n90 percent of the American public wants something to happen and this \nbody will not do it. It is only controversial in the U.S. Congress. It \nis not controversial in people's living rooms. It is, frankly, not \ncontroversial in gun clubs. When you sit in a gun club and talk about \nwhether a person who has been suspected of being a terrorist should be \nable to buy a gun, there is a consensus there too.\n  We have talked about the cornucopia of reasons this doesn't happen, \nand it is part a story of the influence of the gun lobby; it is part a \nmisinterpretation of the nature of the Second Amendment; it is part a \nbelief that more guns make people safer, which the data does not show; \nit is part an answer in how voters prioritize the things they care \nabout--that the 10 percent that doesn't agree is calling in to Members' \noffices at a level the 90 percent aren't; and, lastly, in part, it is \nan indictment of us. It is an indictment of those of us who have just \nlet business as usual run on this floor, mass shooting after mass \nshooting.\n  The reason we have chosen to do something exceptional--which is to \nhold up work on the CJS appropriations bill until we get an agreement \nto move forward on these two issues--is that we have something to \nanswer for here as well. Maybe we haven't fought as hard as we should \nin order to get this done. And this may not get us there. We still need \nvotes from Republicans. We can call for a vote, but we ultimately need \nthem to vote yes on that. But at least we are showing the American \npublic that we care as deeply as we should about ending this slaughter.\n  I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I just want to thank Senator Murphy for everything he \nhas done on this issue and for not taking no for an answer.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator.\n  I am so glad to have my neighbor, Senator Whitehouse, joining us on \nthe floor, and I yield to him for a question without losing my right to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I am delighted to be here. And before I ask my \nquestion, I just want to thank my colleague for what he is doing. I \nguess my first question would be, How are you doing? You have been on \nthe floor for quite a while now, and I really appreciate it, but how do \nyou feel?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I say to Senator Whitehouse, when I was in my early 20s, \nI actually ruptured two discs in my back, and so I spent a lot of time \nreworking my back in my later 20s to make sure that wouldn't happen \nagain. That rigorous back work to repair my broken discs is paying off, \nI would say.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I will yield to the Senator from New Jersey for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. BOOKER. The Senator is not asserting he is still in his 20s, is \nhe?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I am no longer in my 20s, but I am saying that early \npreventive work has paid off in the long run.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I thank the Senator. I just wanted to clarify that.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I yield back to the Senator from Rhode Island for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. We have some obligations that we ought to meet and \nthat the American people would support us in meeting, and my question \nis, Do those obligations include not only strengthening our gun laws to \nmake sure that certain individuals who should not purchase firearms are \nlegally prevented from purchasing firearms--for instance, people \nconvicted of violent hate crimes?\n  I think Americans agree that is not a class of people whose defense \nof their right to purchase firearms we should be rushing to defend. \nThose who are suspected terrorists on the no-fly list, on the terrorist \nwatch list--that seems to be a very reasonable group of people to take \nout of the list of folks who are allowed to purchase firearms.\n  But if we just do those two things and we don't beef up the \nbackground checks, so that even if we do create a law that protects \npeople who have committed violent hate crimes from being able to buy a \nfirearm and even if we do pass a law that prevents people from the \nterrorist watch list or the no-fly list from being able to buy a \nfirearm--even if those laws are in place, is it not true that if all \nthey have to do is go online to buy a gun, if all they have to do is go \nto a gun show to buy a gun, then we have failed in our responsibility \nto protect the American people?\n  Mr. MURPHY. The Senator is correct. Today, the estimates are that 40 \npercent of all gun sales happen outside of brick-and-mortar stores. And \nthe secret is out that if you can't get a gun because of your criminal \nrecord--or in this case because of your inclusion on the no-fly list--\nthen just circle back and find another way. All it takes is a quick \nInternet search. All it takes is to plug in armslist.com, and you can \nget a weapon delivered to you in short order.\n  If we don't close that loophole--that Internet and gun show \nloophole--then simply denying terrorists guns at gun stores is a half \nmeasure.\n  I yield for a question.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. That problem applies to a convicted felon who can \nright now get around the conviction and go and buy a gun through either \nof those loopholes--online or from a gun show. It applies to a domestic \nviolence abuser who is ordinarily prohibited but can easily get around \nit by going to a gun show or buying a gun online. It applies to someone \nwho has been determined by a court to be dangerously mentally ill.\n  So right now we have a system, as I understand it, where if you have \nbeen determined by a court to be dangerously mentally ill, if you go to \na gun shop and go through the regular procedure, then your purchase of \nthe gun will be interrupted. But all you have to do is go to a gun show \nor go online, and you get around the restriction. Isn't that the state \nof play right\n\n[[Page S3941]]\n\nnow, even for convicted felons, domestic violence abusers, and people \nwho have been adjudicated to be seriously mentally ill?\n  Mr. MURPHY. That is the state of play, I say to Senator Whitehouse.\n  We had Senator Durbin on the floor earlier today, telling the \nhorrific tales of Chicago, for which the strong background check laws \nin Illinois make almost no difference on the streets of Chicago because \nthe weak background check laws of Indiana allow for individuals to go \nthere and buy guns online or at gun shows and then ferry them back onto \nthe streets of Chicago.\n  So without that Federal law that creates a uniform standard that you \nneed to go through a background check for whatever commercial means you \nattempt to buy a gun, then there are criminals every single day who are \ngetting their hands on weapons, separate and aside, as the Senator \nsaid, from this question of terrorist access.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I have some statistics here that I find a little \nsurprising, and I would love to ask my colleague for his explanation of \nthem.\n  The statistics that I have are that 76 percent of gun owners and 71 \npercent of National Rifle Association members support prohibiting \npeople on the terror watch lists from purchasing guns. Yet despite the \nfact that 76 percent of gun owners support putting people on the terror \nwatch list--on the list that doesn't allow them to buy firearms--and \ndespite the fact that 71 percent of NRA members support putting terror \nwatch list folks onto the ban list for buying firearms, nevertheless \nthe NRA has repeatedly opposed and attempted to block legislation that \nattempts to close the terrorist watch list gap.\n  Does the Senator have an explanation or a thought about why it is \nthat when three-quarters of gun owners and nearly three-quarters of NRA \nmembers take one position, the organization is taking a completely \ndifferent position from what their members support and from what gun \nowners support across America?\n  Mr. MURPHY. The Senator has asked the $64,000 question, in a way, and \nI can hazard a guess. My guess would be this: that the nature of gun \nownership has changed over the years. It used to be that over 50 \npercent of Americans owned guns. Most only owned one gun, but the \nmajority of Americans owned guns some 30 years ago. Today that number \nis rapidly decreasing. Now 30-some odd percent of Americans own guns. \nIt means the nature of the industry is changing. It means the industry \nnow has to sell a smaller number of individuals a larger number of \nweapons. So part of the marketing technique by the industry--and the \nindustry is essentially equated to the NRA. It is the industry that \nfunds the NRA in substantial part. Part of the marketing necessity of \nthe industry is to create this belief in the government any day \napproaching your house to confiscate your weapons. So every initiative \nto just try to enact commonsense gun laws is distorted by the industry \nas just another attempt to get closer to the day in which black \nhelicopters swoop down on your house and steal away all of your \nweapons. Of course, that is not what we are going at here. It has \nnothing to do with our agenda. We simply want people on the terrorist \nwatch list to not be able to buy guns and for criminals to not be able \nto buy guns. But because the industry needs this perpetual fear of \ngovernment in order to sell more weapons, I think there has been a \ndesire of the NRA to not listen to its membership and instead listen to \nits industry members and feed this sense of dread about the secret \nintentions of the Federal Government.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If the Senator will yield for another question, it is \nmy understanding that this position the NRA takes against any and \nevery, even very reasonable, gun safety measure--and very likely, I \nsuspect, for the reasons the Senator has identified as a marketing ploy \non behalf of the big industry that pays them to do this. But it is my \nunderstanding that applies to a variety of other issues as well. The \nissue I want to ask about is the issue of high-capacity magazines.\n  Now, I am a gun owner myself. I belong to a gun club in Rhode Island. \nIn order to get access to the range, I had to have a safety briefing by \nthe gun club saying what I could and could not do on the range, saying \nwhat the range rules are. One of the range rules that was imparted to \nme in the safety briefing is that they don't allow high-capacity \nmagazines on the range. They don't allow them for safety reasons.\n  I doubt this is the only one. If you have gun clubs around the \ncountry that will not allow high-capacity magazines on the range for \nsafety reasons at the range itself, and yet here is the NRA wildly \nopposing any effort to limit any high-capacity magazine restriction of \nany kind, does that follow as part of that same argument? Is the \nindustry as determined not only to sell more and more guns to a smaller \nnumber of people by creating fear that some imaginary black helicopter \nis going to come and take their guns away but also restricting the \nlimits on high-capacity magazines?\n  Mr. MURPHY. The margins involved for the industry in these very \npowerful weapons and these large-capacity magazines are big. So when \nyou are attempting to put together a portfolio in which you are going \nto make a substantial profit in return for your investors, you have to \ndouble down on things like 100-round drums and AR-15-style weapons. \nNow, I don't know every hunter in my State, but I have yet to talk to \none who feels like they need a 30-round clip in order to go into the \nwoods and hunt. It is not something hunters need. And the design of all \nof these weapons and the high-capacity magazines we are referring to \nwere originally for one purpose and one purpose only--to kill as many \nhuman beings as quickly as possible. They are military in nature and \ndesign and thus the reason many gun clubs around the country deny \naccess to this kind of ammunition. It certainly stands to reason that \nthe rationale for continuing to sell this is monetary in nature.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If the Senator will yield for a question, does the \nSenator recall that years ago there was an effort to prevent armor-\npiercing ammunition from being sold? Because our police officers who \nwear body protection for protection against armed assailants were very \nconcerned that selling people armor-piercing ammunition would make them \nmore effective at killing police officers. Whereas, it would make no \ndifference in hunting deer or elk or anything else. They customarily, \nas I understand it, don't wear armor, but police officers do. Police \nofficers have to go into dangerous situations with armed individuals. \nTherefore, there was considerable pressure to protect our law \nenforcement officers to try to put limits on the amount of armor-\npiercing ammunition that people could buy.\n  My recollection--if the Senator would confirm it, that would be my \nquestion--is that at the time, the NRA opposed any limit on armor-\npiercing ammunition and opposed the law enforcement forces, the local \npolice chiefs and police officers who come to these crisis situations \nand their desire to be safe and their desire to be able to tell their \nfamilies: It is going to be OK, honey. I have protective armor. It is \ngoing to help make me safe, and there is an armor-piercing ammunition \nthat people are allowed to shoot at me; that they took all that away, \nand this was an argument that they made and they succeeded, and right \nnow armor-piercing ammunition is available as a result of NRA lobbying.\n  Mr. MURPHY. That is certainly the way I remember the events as well. \nI remember one of the many chilling conversations I had in the 24 hours \nafter the shooting in Newtown. One was with a police officer who \nremarked that it was a good thing Adam Lanza killed himself and didn't \nengage in a shoot-out with police because they were not confident they \nwould be able to survive a shoot-out with an individual who had that \nmuch ammunition and that kind of high-powered capacity in a firearm.\n  Separate and aside from the question of armor-piercing bullets, law \nenforcement has stood with us in our calls to restrict the sale of \nassault-style weapons and high-capacity ammunition because even \nthat, without the armor-piercing bullets, puts them at risk.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Will the Senator yield for one more question? I see \nmy senior Senator Jack Reed on the floor. I am sure he wants to engage \nin a question-and-answer with Senator Murphy.\n\n[[Page S3942]]\n\nBefore that, may I ask one additional question?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The other question I want to ask is that in response \nto our effort to put people who are on the terrorist watch list into a \ncategory where they are not able to go and buy firearms in order to \ncommit the acts of terror for which they are on the watch list, our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle have suddenly come up with a new \npiece of legislation they say is designed to address this problem.\n  My question is, Do we know if this piece of legislation has ever been \nseen before? Do we know if it has been brought up in committee and \ngiven any kind of a review? Have they built a track record of interest \nand concern about this issue and built a legislative record to support \ntheir bill or does this appear to be something they whipped out of \ntheir pocket at the last minute to try to fend off the sensible \nprovisions we have long fought for to keep people on the terror watch \nlist from being able to go out and buy high-powered firearms?\n  Mr. MURPHY. It will shock and surprise you to know, I say to Senator \nWhitehouse, that it appears to be the latter. We had one of our \ncolleagues come down to the floor and suggest there is a way out of \nthis; that we could come together and work on a compromise. I think all \nof us--Senator Booker, Senator Blumenthal, and I--were happy to take \nthem up on that effort.\n  I have noted that we have had 6 months since the failure of the last \nmeasure to prevent terrorists or suspected terrorists from buying \nweapons to work on this. No one in the Republican caucus has approached \nus about trying to find common ground. It wasn't until we took the \nfloor this morning and shut down the process on this appropriations \nbill that we started to see movement on the Republican side about \ncoming up with an alternative. Now, they did pose an alternative back \nin December, but it was a miserable alternative that would require law \nenforcement to go to court in order to stop someone on the list from \ngetting a weapon and capped them at 72 hours to complete that whole \nprocess. It was ridiculous and ludicrous. They are probably going to \npresent another alternative. It is important to note that none of that \nhappened until we took the floor, and we have had 6 months since the \nlast vote, and, frankly, 3 days since the shooting in which we could \nhave been trying to work that out.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. To the point the Senator just made--if he will yield \nfor one final question. When the government would have to go into court \nwithin 72 hours in order to try to interrupt the sale, presumably that \nwould give the person on the terrorist watch list all sorts of notice \nabout the government's investigative activities and an opportunity in \ncourt to do further inquiry into the government's investigative \nactivities and in fact allow somebody who is on the terrorist watch \nlist to have a window into the government investigation that he or she \nmight be the subject of; is that not the way that would play out? It \ndoesn't seem to make much sense to me.\n  Mr. MURPHY. It doesn't seem to make much sense. For the question, we \ncan only imagine what that court process looks like. Who knows what \nrules apply, who knows what the rights to discovery are.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. There is no model for it.\n  Mr. MURPHY. There is no model for it. We have hamstrung the FBI and \nthe Attorney General by asking them to do more and more with the same \namount of resources. To ask them to go through dozens and dozens of \ncourt processes--remember, there were 240 people on these lists who \ntried to get guns last year. So we are talking about a lot of court \nprocesses they would have to undertake. It is just totally unrealistic, \ntotally unprecedented. It makes no sense at all.\n  I thank the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  I am glad to be joined by Senator Reed. I yield for a question \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. REED. First, let me commend the Senator for this extraordinary \nand principled discussion that the Senator has led, along with Senators \nBlumenthal and Booker.\n  I do have a question, and it stems from some of the comments I have \nreceived from the Chief of Police in the State of Rhode Island, Colonel \nSteven O'Donnell, a skilled professional. What Colonel O'Donnell said--\nand it goes to one of the issues that Senator Whitehouse discussed, the \naccess to high-capacity magazines for these assault weapons. Colonel \nO'Donnell said:\n\n       I've yet to hear a viable argument for high capacity \n     magazines, what the purpose is. I have friends that are \n     hunters. They use high capacity weapons, but not magazines. \n     They use several rounds to hunt, but they don't need 15, 30, \n     and 45 round clips to hunt an animal.\n\n  Is that some of the responses you are getting from some of your law \nenforcement professionals who deal every day with firearms?\n  Mr. MURPHY. That is the same response we get. I just reflect on one \nof my earlier responses to Senator Whitehouse, that I have also heard \nfear in the wake of Sandy Hook from law enforcement about their ability \nto combat an individual who has staked out in a school or a workplace \nwho doesn't engage in a suicide mission but then tries to confront and \ntake on police, that you have 30-round magazines, 100-round drums. That \nis very difficult to match from law enforcement's perspective.\n  I yield for additional questions.\n  Mr. REED. The Senator continually references military-style assault \nweapons. Frankly, I had the privilege of commanding paratroopers, and \nwe were armed with M-16s, which is an AR-15 military variance. It was \nclear to us--and this was 30 years ago--these are military weapons. \nThese are weapons that were designed to mass fire, rapid fire, even in \nsemiautomatic mode. These were not designed for hunting. In fact, back \nin those days, we replaced the M-14--which didn't have the same \ncapabilities, much more accurate--because what they were looking for \nwas just a sheer volume of fire that can inflict the most casualties \npossible, particularly in confined spaces, because of woods, because of \njungle, because of war, because you are in a building.\n  I think your points about military assault weapons are exactly the \nright points, and you, like me, have heard this not only from law \nenforcement professionals but also from military personnel about the \nnature of this weapon.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I think it is tragically instructive, I say to Senator \nReed, to think about what happened inside that school in Sandy Hook. \nThere were 20 kids hit, and 20 kids died. These are powerful weapons \nwith the capacity not only to discharge an enormous amount of \nammunition in a short period of time, but the force of it is \nunprecedented in the firearms world, and there is a reason why not a \nsingle child survived. These are powerful killing machines that, as you \nsaid, were not designed for hunting. They were designed to kill as many \npeople as possible, and that is why you see this epic rate of slaughter \nwhen they are used inside schools, inside nightclubs, inside churches.\n  Mr. REED. The Senator also commented, and I want to reconfirm it, \nthat one of the characteristics of these weapons is that even in \nsemiautomatic mode, there is a high rate of fire, and the velocity of \nthe rounds are such that they inflict extreme damage. So even if it is \nin a semiautomatic mode, you have the ability to deliver devastating \nfire, and coupled with a large magazine, you can keep this fire up.\n  The other point is that changing the magazine on one of these weapons \nis a matter of seconds. It is not a laborious task where you have to \nindividually load rounds into the weapon. That, too, I think increases \nthe lethality.\n  Again, if the Senator would comment and concur, the adoption by the \nmilitary had a logical military purpose--to increase the lethality of \nthe weapons that we are giving to the soldiers, marines, sailors, and \nairmen of the United States. That is not, I don't think, what you and I \nwould like to see in our civilian population--weapons for which the \nprimary purpose is increased lethality. It is not accuracy, \nnecessarily, not for a skill in terms of marksmanship, but simply \nincreased lethality. Is that the sense that you have?\n  Mr. MURPHY. It is, I say to Senator Reed. If you think about what we \nare doing today, the individuals who are contemplating lone-wolf \nattacks are\n\n[[Page S3943]]\n\nnot building IEDs in their basements any longer. They are going to the \nstore and buying assault weapons. We essentially are selling weapons to \nthe enemy. We are selling weapons to the enemy--powerful military style \nweapons. We are advertising them, and individuals who are contemplating \nthese lone-wolf attacks are buying them.\n  In fact, I have read quotes earlier today on the floor from terrorist \noperatives where they are calling on Americans to purchase these \nweapons and turn them on civilians because it is so easy to get access \nto them. This is a very deliberative tactic on behalf of these very \ndangerous international terrorist organizations, and that is one of the \nreasons why we think we have to wake up to the new reality of the \nthreat of lone-wolf attacks and change our laws.\n  Mr. REED. Will the Senator yield again for a question?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I will.\n  Mr. REED. Essentially, what our adversaries are doing is exploiting \nloopholes in our law, and they are doing it very deliberately, very \nconsciously. To date, we are standing by and letting them do that. They \nknow where the weak points are. The weak points are not only that you \ncan get these assault weapons, but another point is that a significant \nnumber of weapons were sold without a background check because they can \nbe done through the Internet, through gun show sales, et cetera. We \nhave taken this issue on before, and we failed to address those issues \ntoo.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Had we had in place a ban on individuals who were on the \nterrorist watch list to buy a weapon, it only would apply to brick-and-\nmortar stores. Even if Omar Mateen was on one of those lists and even \nif we passed a law saying that prohibited him from buying a weapon, he \nwould have gone into that store, be told that he couldn't buy a weapon, \nand then he could have walked right back to his house and gone online \nand bought one there or waited for the next weekend's gun show, of \nwhich there are many in Florida, and bought one there.\n  We don't know how it would have played out, but without an expansion \nof background checks to people on the no-fly list being prohibited to \nbuy guns, it is a half measure. I reiterate, these are the two things \nwe are asking for--to have consensus on these two issues because they \nare the right thing to do, as we are discussing, but they also have the \nsupport of the American public.\n  Mr. REED. I have one final question for the Senator. It would seem to \nme that this would essentially deny our fiercest adversaries, the \nIslamist jihadists who are using the Internet to radicalize people--not \nonly to radicalize them but, without directly controlling their \nconduct, suggesting to them the way they can get assault weapons \nlegally in the United States and can arm themselves. If we take these \nsteps, as you would suggest, we can deny our fiercest adversaries the \narms they seek to inflict harm on our families, our friends and our \nneighbors.\n  Mr. MURPHY. It stands to reason that in the wake of this latest \nattack, we should wake up to the new tactics of our enemy. This is the \nnew tactic of our enemy--to go buy these weapons and to use them \nagainst civilians. The genius of what we are proposing is that it keeps \nweapons out of the hands of would-be terrorists without affecting the \nSecond Amendment rights of anyone else.\n  We are talking about such a small number of sales. Over the course of \nthe year, we are talking about 200 some-odd sales. Think about that, \n200-some odd sales that would be affected, that would force someone to \nbe denied a purchase of a weapon because they were on the terrorist \nwatch list. It stands to reason that we should accept the new tactics \nof these groups and amend our laws.\n  Here is the Senator from New Jersey. We have had such a long run of \ncolleagues coming to the floor that we haven't gotten to hear from the \nSenators from New Jersey and Connecticut. I yield to the Senator from \nNew Jersey for a question without yielding control of the floor.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I appreciate the Senator yielding for a question. I have \na number of questions for Senator Murphy.\n  I think you bring up a good point. We have now been at this for about \n8\\1/2\\ hours, and we have seen colleague after colleague. We have \nworked now through the majority of the Democrats in this caucus who \nhave stood up and asked Senator Murphy question after question.\n  I want to start, before I even give a question, by giving my respect \nand gratitude to Senator Murphy. In Isaiah, it talks about those who \nwait on the Lord, running and not getting weary, walking and not being \nfaint. I see the consistency of his efforts, which is not just manifest \nduring this filibuster. He has been on his feet now for 8\\1/2\\ hours, \nand it is not just today. Senator Murphy, in his maiden speech here in \nthe Senate, stood right there--I know this because at that time I was \nstill mayor of the city of Newark--and gave, still to this day for me \nof all the Senate speeches I have heard, probably one of the most \neloquent, moving, factual, compelling speeches on gun violence that I \nhave heard.\n  I am grateful today because just yesterday, in a caucus meeting that \nI think my colleagues who are here will agree got very heated, very \nemotional, in which he spoke with passion, as did other colleagues, he \nand I began talking about making sure that this was not business as \nusual and that we didn't go through the same routines in this body \nevery single time there was a mass shooting. There are mass shootings \nwith greater and greater routine.\n  You have heard it from my colleagues. It is an insufficient response \nthat our elected leaders should simply pray and share condolences. To \nparaphrase one of my heroes whose picture stands on my wall, Frederick \nDouglass said: I prayed for years for my freedom, but I was still a \nslave. It wasn't until I prayed with my hands and prayed with my feet \nthat I found my salvation. Faith without works is dead. Prayer is not \nenough.\n  I stand here first and foremost to express my gratitude to Senator \nMurphy. We talked during the day, we talked into the night, and we \nchose to be here. I am grateful for his senior Senator, who has been \nhere for the entire duration. These two partners from Connecticut went \nthrough the unimaginable when they shared the grief of a community \nwhere child after child--20 children--were gunned down and murdered. \nThese two men have been dedicated and determined--not yielding, not \ngiving up, not surrendering to cynicism about government or this body \nbut continuing to fight and to fight so that we would do something \nabout this problem.\n  This is the first question I have for Senator Murphy. There is this \nidea that is deep within the history of our Nation, that when there is \ninjustice--and there is no greater injustice than the savage murder of \nour fellow citizens, the murder of innocents. I have seen you time and \nagain--and today is a model of courage as well as a model of \nendurance--take on a Senate that was prepared to move on, a Senate that \nwas prepared to go on with business after the greatest, largest mass \nkilling in this Nation's history. We were going to go on with business \nas usual. In my conversations into the night last night with Senator \nMurphy, I saw his determination not to let the business as usual go on \nin this Senate.\n  I have a number of questions for you. But the first one, Senator \nMurphy, is that there are a lot of people who are surrendering to \ncynicism about government, a lot of people who are showing frustration. \nBut yet, you are still going on with this in a way that reflects those \npeople who didn't give up on the idea of civil rights in the 1940s and \nthe 1950s and kept pushing legislation--pushing legislation before the \n1965 Voting Rights Act, before the 1964 Civil Rights Act, before the \nconsciousness of the country caught up. But this must be frustrating to \nyou. I have been here for 2\\1/2\\ years. You have been here longer. We \ncame here tonight--today--for a reason. I say today because we are \napproaching the ninth hour. We are about a half-hour away from the \nninth hour. Can you frame one more time why you are expending your \nenergy doing this now, here, in the Senate, especially because I know \nthat perhaps there are people talking about: Well, they don't have a \nshot; they don't have a chance. There are cynics, there are critics, \nand there are pundits probably saying they may not get a vote. The \nmajority of Americans, the majority of\n\n[[Page S3944]]\n\ngun owners, the majority of NRA members might agree with Senator \nMurphy, but the NRA has too much of a hold on the Senate. Why are you \nhere right now doing this on this day?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator. I want to thank Senator Booker and \nSenator Blumenthal for being here from the very beginning. This has \nbeen miraculous in its own regard, not just being able to spend this \ntime with the two of you but to have had the majority of our caucus \ncome to this floor and express their support for our determination to \nmove forward this debate and, at the very least, to get votes, but \nreally to try to bring consensus around this issue.\n  I don't think I am breaking confidences to share that both Senator \nBooker and I spoke at our meeting yesterday of Democrats in which \nSenator Booker shared an immensely powerful series of stories about his \nexperience as mayor of a grief-torn city, his direct personal \nintersection with friends, with neighbors who had lost their lives. I \nknow how deeply and personally this has affected him.\n  I tell you why I am doing this as maybe a means of telling you why \nSenator Blumenthal and I are both doing this, and I tell you through \nthe prism of a story from the awful, awful series of days following the \nshooting in Sandy Hook.\n  Senator Blumenthal and I went to the first of what were umpteen wakes \nand funerals. We were standing in line at the first wake about to talk \nto the first set of parents who had lost, in this case, their young \ndaughter. I remember being so uncertain about what we were supposed to \nsay to these parents--not just what you are supposed to say to provide \nsome measure of condolence, but we were their elected representatives. \nWe had some additional obligation to show them that we were ready act, \nbut was it too soon to make that offer? Was it not the right moment to \nsuggest that there was a public policy response to the slaughter of \ntheir children? It was Senator Blumenthal who very gently and \nappropriately said to the mother and father as we walked by the closed \ncasket: Whenever you are ready, we will be there to fight. The father \nsaid: We are ready now. This was probably not 48 hours after the death \nof their 6- or 7-year-old daughter.\n  We have been thinking about this necessity, this imperative of \naction, since that moment. It gets harder and harder to look into the \neyes of those parents and surviving children and explain to them why \nthis body has not acted. It gets harder and harder to defend the \ncomplete silence from this institution in the face of murder after \nmurder.\n  Franklin Delano Roosevelt wasn't confident that everything he \nproposed was going to solve the economic crisis of the 1930s and 1940s, \nbut he was damned if he wasn't going to try something. He and his aides \ntalked unabashedly and unapologetically about trial and error. If we \ntry one thing and it doesn't work, we will try something else. Why \ndon't we do that? Why don't we try one thing, and if it doesn't stem \nthe violence, try something else? But doing nothing is an abomination \nand makes it impossible for those of us who have lived through these \ntragedies to look these families in the eye.\n  I remember that it took 10 years from the attempted assassination of \nPresident Reagan and the maiming of his press secretary, James Brady, \nfor the Brady handgun bill to be signed into law. It took a decade of \npolitical action, and it probably took many nights like this when \nlegislators or advocates stood out at a rally or maybe stood on the \nfloor of the Senate or House and argued until they had no more energy \nleft, knowing they weren't going to get the victory the next day.\n  As I said to my friends in the movement back in Connecticut and \nthroughout the country--I know the Senator has said versions of this as \nwell--every great change movement is defined by the moments of failure, \nnot the moments of success. Every great change movement in this country \nis defined by the fact that there were times in which you could have \ngiven up, but you didn't; you persisted. The changes that never happen \nare the ones where the movement, once they hit that brick wall, said \n``It is too hard'' and went home. That is the reason we are here, and I \nthink I am speaking in some way, shape, or form for the three of us. We \nwant to get votes on these measures, and we will stand here until we \nget those votes. But even if we don't, it is important to continue to \nengage in the fight.\n  Mr. BOOKER. That is the first part of the framing that is very \nimportant--this determination that we will not do business as usual and \nthat this fight will not stop. We will take this fight to the Senate \nfloor, we will take this fight to legislators, and we will take this \nfight to neighborhoods and communities. It is not a physical fight. It \nis a fight, in my opinion, of love. It is a fight that says we can be a \ncountry that affirms people's right to own weapons. We heard from one \nof our closest friends in the Senate, Mr. Heinrich, who is an ardent \ngun owner. He is a hunter. As a vegan, I have seen some pictures of \nwhat he has shot and killed, and he takes great pride and joy in that. \nWhat we are talking about--and this gets me to the next area of \nquestioning--is that it is not about hunters, it is not about people \nwho want guns for self-defense, and it is not about people who want \nguns because they love the sport. Senator Bennet took me out skeet \nshooting when I was in Colorado. It is not about the folks who want \nguns for that. This is about something very narrow, and that is the \nquestion that I have, which is the second part of this framing. I have \nheard some people talk about this in partisan terms. The truth is that \nthis may be a partisan issue in Washington-speak, but when I go back to \nNew Jersey--I go to communities like the ones I grew up in, where a \nmajority of the community is Republican, and communities like the one I \nlive in, where the majority is Democrat--I hear the same thing from \nmembers of both parties. They say that there is a lack of understanding \nin this country. How can we be at a point where our country is at war \nwith terrorists, with our enemy in places such as Iraq and Syria \nliterally trying to egg on and radicalize young people, saying ``Go to \nAmerica''? Al Qaeda and others are instructing them that this is the \ncountry to go to and buy guns because it is so easy to get access to \nguns, thanks to these massive loopholes. That is the point that brings \nus here.\n  Senator Murphy and I probably share beliefs about gun safety that are \nnot shared by the majority of gun owners, and there are things I heard \nbrought up tonight, frankly, that, hey, I might like. People have \ntalked about magazines and research on this issue. I heard a lot of \nsubjects brought up, but what brought Senator Murphy and Senator \nBlumenthal to the floor for almost 9 hours now, with me standing here \nthis entire time, is to say: Hey, we as Americans can agree that \nsomeone who is a suspected terrorist and under investigation and might \nbe on a no-fly list--that person should not be able to buy not just a \nweapon or handgun but an assault rifle. When you look at this issue, it \nis not controversial with Americans. This is not controversial with \nRepublicans. This is not controversial with NRA members because the \noverwhelming majority of them agree that we should not be a country \nwhere a person can't get on a plane in Newark, NJ, but they can drive \nto a private seller or a gun show or go on the Internet and buy a gun.\n  The second of three questions I have is that this not a radical thing \nthe Senators from Connecticut are asking for. Senator Murphy is not \ncalling for something controversial. This is something that, at this \npoint, is common sense and is agreed upon by over 70 percent of gun \nowners. I am not sure if there is an elected official in the Senate \nthat has a 70-plus percent approval rating. Rarely do you see people \nagree that greatly.\n  Could the Senator please explain why he is taking a stand on this \nissue right now and what it is that he thinks we should be able to \nachieve on this common ground for the common good?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator talking about \nwhat a limited ask we are making here. Let's talk about the scope of \nthe limitation on gun ownership. We are asking that those people who \nare on a terrorist watch list and on a no-fly list be added to those \nwho are those prohibited from buying guns. We have data that tells us \nhow many of those individuals are buying guns every year because they \ncan match one list to the other, even though they don't intersect in a \nway that prohibits the purchase. What we know is that there are only \nabout 200\n\n[[Page S3945]]\n\nsales at gun stores every year from people who are on those lists. So \nwe are talking about a minuscule limitation on the right, which is to \ntake a small handful of individuals who have been placed on a terrorist \nno-fly list, and saying that they shouldn't be able to get a weapon and \nbuilding into it a process to grieve that limitation so if there is a \nmistake that is made, you can have your right restored. We are talking \nabout a few hundred sales a year. You could say: Oh, it is a few \nhundred sales, so why does that matter? Well, if you get it wrong once, \nit is a mass slaughter. It is a small number of sales, a minuscule \nlimitation, with potentially enormous reward when it comes to public \nsafety.\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I said one more question, but I have two \nmore questions. This is sort of a progression. My friend is here today \nbecause of a commitment Senator Murphy made in his maiden speech in the \nU.S. Senate--a consistent sense of belief that my friend will never \ngive up until we have commonsense gun safety in America. After the \ngrievous act that we saw in Florida, where 49 innocent people were \nslaughtered, Senator Murphy, Senator Blumenthal, countless Senators, \nand I--at least half of our caucus has come down here and said the same \nthing: Enough is enough. We can't let business as usual happen.\n  No. 2, and the reason my friend stood up and has been holding the \nfloor for 9\\1/2\\ hours, has been in order to say: Hey, the terrorist \nloophole should be closed. There is one more element to this \nprogression--an indefatigable Senator with a noncontroversial element \nin terms of the terrorist loophole, but now there is this other piece, \nwhich is just common sense, and I want to take that one step and ask \nthat my friend go a little deeper with it. That last step is this: If \nyou just have the terrorist loophole closed but don't have universal \nbackground checks--in other words, if you close the terrorist loophole \nso that anybody who goes to a Federal firearm licensed dealer or goes \nto a NICS check, that stops that terrorist, but if you still have these \nInternet and private sales, that terrorist, who probably will not even \ngo to that Federal arms licensee, will go to the back doors that are \nstill wide open for people to get guns. So what the Senator from \nConnecticut is saying is that he is not giving up. No. 2, 70-plus \npercent of NRA members agree with me on what I am asking for. This last \nstep, where the majority of gun owners in America agree, why is it \nimportant to also make sure that if we want to stop terrorists from \ndoing what they did in Orlando--if we do nothing, it may happen again, \nGod forbid. Why is this universal background check element the second \nthing my friend is standing up for today, along with his colleagues?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, when I go to bed at night, I lock the \nfront and the back doors. It doesn't do much good to lock only the back \ndoor and leave the front door open or vice versa. That is what we are \nproposing. If we believe in a commitment to stop individuals who are \nassociated with terrorists from buying guns, then you have to lock both \ndoors. You have to stop them from buying guns when they walk into a \nbrick-and-mortar store, but then you have to acknowledge that it is \nfrankly easier for individuals to just type in one of the main online \narms sellers and buy a weapon that way because it is faster, it can get \ndelivered right to your door, and you don't have to go through a \nbackground check.\n  If you really want to make a commitment to preventing terrorists from \ngetting guns, then you have to do both. You have to put them on the \nlist and then you have to reconcile the fact that 40 percent of sales \ntoday are happening outside of that pathway. By the way, the added \nbenefit of that is that you are shutting down the pathway that \ncriminals have been using for a decade in order to get these weapons, \nand you will have a dramatic effect on the slaughter that is happening \nin our cities, as well, by limiting the flow of illegal arms into the \ncities.\n  Mr. BOOKER. So the last question--and I know the senior Senator from \nConnecticut would like to ask a question. But this is where I have to \nsay it becomes deeply personal to me, because what you are talking \nabout there is your persistent, unyielding fight for commonsense gun \nlegislation from the second you walked into the U.S. Senate, to the \nnoncontroversial idea that terrorists in America--people who are \nsuspected terrorists--should not be allowed to buy assault weapons, \nperiod. And your comment that that affects a very small universe of \npeople, that in order to make that ironclad--again, nothing is going to \nstop everybody, but this is doing something that will constrict access \nto terrorists--you have to do a universal background check, so you \nclose the back door, as you said.\n  Now, this is what gets personal to me even more so because it is more \nthan all this. When you do that, you are not affecting sports people; \nyou are not affecting Second Amendment right believers who believe that \nI need to have my right to bear arms; you are not affecting folks who \nare worried about self-defense and want to have a gun to defend \nthemselves; who you are affecting when you do that is not just \nterrorists, but you actually have a collateral benefit when you tighten \nup the system that you then stop criminals of all categories from \ngetting guns.\n  We live in a nation where women are victims of violence at \nastonishing rates. You close down that system for terrorists, you are \ngoing to make it much harder for someone who seeks to engage in \ndomestic violence with a firearm--you are going to shut down their \naccess. You are going to shut down criminals from getting guns.\n  This is really what I experienced as a U.S. mayor. I looked at all of \nmy shootings and murders as too many in Newark when I was mayor. I \ncould only find one case--one case--where a law-abiding citizen used a \ngun in violence. The problem we saw overwhelmingly in our city was that \ncriminals who should have been stopped were using these loopholes to \nbuy lots of weapons and engage in criminal activity. So much of the \ncarnage in our communities is happening when criminals can easily get \naccess to guns.\n  You and I have had this conversation privately so many times. I have \nsat with you in Connecticut cities. We have seen the impact and the \npain and the agony of murder after murder after murder after murder in \nour cities. And this commonsense terrorist loophole closure--would the \nSenator please explain how that will also constrict the ability for all \ncriminals committing murders at rates not seen anywhere on the planet \nEarth, because someone who has restrictions on them for buying guns for \ndomestic violence, stalking, threatening a woman, can go get a gun; \nsomebody who is an ex-con for a violent crime can go get a gun. Why is \nthis also important because of the collateral benefits that would come \nabout from this commonsense constricting and closing of the terrorist \nloophole?\n  (Mr. GARDNER assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. MURPHY. I say to Senator Booker, there is nobody better than you \nin making people understand the human consequences of inaction and the \npotential for human benefit of action, so I am not going to try to \ncompete. Let me give the statistics. Let me tell my colleagues what \nhappens in States that impose rigorous systems of background checks.\n  There are 64 percent fewer guns trafficked out of State, there are 48 \npercent fewer firearm suicides, there are 48 percent fewer police \nkilled by handguns, there are 46 percent fewer women who are shot to \ndeath by intimate partners, and there are 17 percent fewer aggravated \nassaults with guns. Those numbers could be even better if there was a \nnational commitment to the same concept because, as Senator Durbin has \ntold us, as tough as Illinois' laws are, all it takes is for a criminal \nto go across the border into Indiana and buy guns at a gun show or buy \nthem online or get them from an unregulated dealer and bring them back \ninto Chicago. And what every police chief will tell you is that the \nfewer illegal guns on the street, the fewer crimes there are. The \nharder you make it for an individual at a moment of passion or a moment \nof frustration or whatever that moment may be to get a gun, the less \nlikely you are to have a homicide.\n  Senator Blumenthal and I went to a meeting of activists on this issue \nin Hartford, CT, a few weeks after the Newtown shooting, and they were \nfurious. They were furious that the world had woken up to gun violence \nbecause of Newtown after it had been a reality to them for so long.\n  That is the genius of what we are proposing. Without taking away any\n\n[[Page S3946]]\n\nSecond Amendment rights, Senator Booker, we are able with this proposal \nto both extend protections to Americans who might be the victim of a \nterror attack but also individuals who right now are living with the \neveryday slaughter that happens in our cities.\n  I am happy to yield to my friend from Connecticut for a question \nwithout relinquishing the floor.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Senator Murphy's very eloquent reference to a family \nwe met just a day or so after the loss of their child brings back a \nmemory that always evokes an almost indescribable emotion from me. My \nheart goes to my throat whenever I think of that couple saying to me: \nWe are ready now, ready to help, ready to take action. And that has \nbeen the story of the Newtown and Sandy Hook families who lived through \nthat loss. They came here and told their stories to our colleagues, \nnearly achieved--or helped us achieve--a victory. We came within four \nor five votes of that outcome. And from the Gallery of the Chamber, \nwhen we failed came the cry ``shame,'' and it was indeed shameful that \nthe Senate failed to move forward.\n  My colleague from New Jersey, Senator Booker, has described the real-\nworld impact in such graphic and powerful terms that I hesitate to \nfollow him, but I want to make two points and ask my colleague from \nConnecticut whether he agrees with them. The first is that those \nfamilies from Connecticut in a sense represented the community as a \nwhole--the Newtown community, the Connecticut community--through \norganizations like Sandy Hook Promise and the Newtown Action Alliance \nand others around the country--Everytown, Americans for Responsible \nSolutions. They are doing what proponents of sensible, commonsense \nmeasures have done for much longer, which is to organize and to \ngalvanize and educate and raise awareness. And that, in the end, will \nbe the way we win. I pay tribute to them tonight. I thank them and the \nfamilies for their courage and strength again.\n\n  I want to bring this issue home to Connecticut, where my friend and \ncolleague Senator Murphy and I live and where we went through the \nsearing experience of the Newtown tragedy. I had been involved for two \ndecades in gun violence prevention, helping to advocate and then to \ndefend in court our ban on assault weapons--one of the first State laws \nin the country. But that experience transformed many of us in our \nState, and it impacted people of all ages to be more vigorous advocates \nand more articulate advocates.\n  I want to read a letter from a young man who lives in Danbury, CT.\n\n       I am a constituent of yours and I became a victim of gun \n     violence when my 7-year-old cousin, Daniel Barden, was \n     murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012. I am no \n     longer ``saddened'' by recent mass shootings; I am instead \n     angry and frustrated by the inaction of this Nation's leaders \n     to implement obvious and basic safeguards to gun ownership \n     such as universal background checks, CDC research into gun \n     violence, limiting magazine capacity, restriction of gun \n     ownership to domestic abusers and people on terrorist watch \n     lists, to name a few. One of the most infuriating aspects of \n     the continued mass shootings in this country is that they are \n     so eminently preventable. We can't do much about earthquakes \n     or hurricanes, but it is pretty simple to just NOT SELL \n     military grade weapons to civilians or just NOT SELL AR-15s \n     to domestic abusers who have been investigated by the FBI for \n     terrorist connections and threats.\n       I am furious and feel powerless. I beg you to stand up for \n     me, my family, everyone who has ever lost family or friends \n     to senseless gun violence, and for our society as a whole, \n     which we are currently failing to protect. Enough is enough.\n\n  That is from a young person who lives in Danbury, CT. It summarizes \nthe feeling of powerlessness and helplessness and fury that Americans \nall across the country feel.\n  Just to give one example, I understand that in the last 96 hours, \n500,000 people have signed a petition in favor of banning assault \nweapons--half a million people in just 96 hours, a petition circulated \nby MoveOn.org.\n  Assault weapons are designed for one purpose: to kill as many people \nas possible as quickly as possible. They are combat hardened and tested \nand used. They are military-style assault weapons--AR-15s. As some of \nour colleagues have said, most hunters would not use them to shoot deer \nor other animals. Yet they are sold freely.\n  Our request is a much more limited one than even assault weapons, as \nmuch as they need to be banned in terms of new sales. We are simply \nsaying don't sell those weapons to somebody who is on the terrorist \nwatch list, somebody who is under investigation for potentially being \nsupported and funded and maybe educated and trained by one of our \nadversaries, our enemies abroad, like ISIS. And don't sell those kinds \nof weapons or any others to anyone without a background check because \nthey may fit that category or the other prohibited categories that are \nalready in the law. It is simply a means of enforcing the law.\n  These proposals are really relatively modest, and so are the others \nthat this young person has advocated that we adopt--``obvious and basic \nsafeguards,'' to quote him or her, ``to gun ownership such as universal \nbackground checks, CDC research into gun violence, limiting magazine \ncapacity, restricting gun ownership to domestic abusers and people on \nterrorist watch lists, to name a few.'' All of them should be adopted. \nWe are asking for two. We are asking for votes. We are asking for \naction. And we are saying: No more business as usual.\n  Connecticut also had a connection to Orlando--a 37-year-old young \nwoman named Kimberly Morris, educated in Torrington, CT, at the \nTorrington High School and then at Post University in Waterbury, CT. \nKimberly Morris was known as a ``scrappy player,'' according to Charlie \nMcSpiritt, the Torrington High School's former athletic director. He \ncan still remember Morris because she ``played the game to her \nfullest.'' She was ``a tenacious'' small forward on the basketball team \nas well at Post University in Waterbury. Her teammate Narvell Benning, \nwho played for the men's team, said: ``She didn't let nobody push her \naround.'' She was 37 years old. She is among the older victims who were \nkilled in Orlando.\n\n  What is so striking about the biographies of these men and women is \nhow young they are and how much life they had ahead. They were not as \nyoung as the 6-year-olds gunned down in Sandy Hook, those 20 beautiful \nchildren, but Kimberly, like those children, had her whole life ahead.\n  So my question to my colleague is whether Connecticut still feels the \nimpact, and whether Connecticut wants us to act at a national level as \nwell, as the Nation?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for the question. Connecticut is \nstill dealing with this tragedy to this day. Newtown is a community \nthat has not recovered. Connecticut wants us to act not just because \nthey don't understand the inaction of this place but they have seen the \nbenefits of stronger gun laws. Connecticut responded in a bipartisan \nway. Republicans and Democrats came together and passed legislation to \nban major assault weapons and extended background checks to more sales, \nand we have seen an immediate diminution in the number of gun crimes in \nour State. We have seen an immediate impact on the safety of residents. \nSo people in Connecticut want us to act because they acted like grown-\nups in Connecticut.\n  The minority leader of the State senate, who wanted to run for \nGovernor, put his political future in peril by sitting down at the \ntable and negotiating a compromise. He stands by it today because that \ncompromise saved lives. So the people of Connecticut want us to act, \nSenator Blumenthal, and that is the reason we are here today.\n  Senator Blumenthal, if I could, I would just note for a moment, \nbefore I hand it over to Senator Casey, that when one of our colleagues \nhad a moment to hold the floor for an extended period of time, he read \na story to his kids who were at home. I actually didn't know this was \ngoing to occur, but my oldest little boy just showed up in the gallery, \nand, A, you are supposed to be in bed, and, B, I am sorry that I missed \npizza night, and, C, I hope that you will understand some day why we \nare doing this, why we have been standing here for 8 hours trying to \nfight to make our country a safer and better place, and why, sometimes, \neven if you don't get everything that you want, trying hard, trying and \ntrying and trying to do the right thing is ultimately just as important \nas getting the outcome in the end. So go to bed.\n  But this is, for those of us who are parents, deeply personal. This \nis about protecting not just every kid in this country but our kids \npersonally.\n\n[[Page S3947]]\n\n  I yield to Senator Casey for a question without losing control of the \nfloor.\n  Mr. CASEY. I want to thank Senator Murphy.\n  Mr. MURPHY. My wife is up there, by the way, too. He didn't come \nalone, by the way.\n  Mr. CASEY. For anyone within the sound of my voice related to Senator \nMurphy, my question is a basic one, but I think it is fundamental to \nhis efforts. I will address Senator Murphy and say that your efforts \nand the efforts of those you have worked with, not only today but on \nother days--Senator Blumenthal, who is with you today, has been working \nso hard on these issues, and Senator Booker. The three of you have \nbeen--if there is a way to express inspiration beyond just using that \nterminology, I would like to hear it, because it has been so--an \ninspiration.\n  My basic question is this, and I will ask you to hold your answer for \njust a couple of minutes. My question is this: How do you stay focused? \nHow do you stay inspired to continue this fight, which for you hasn't \nbeen just hours long or days long or weeks, but it has literally been \nfor years? I will ask forbearance for just a couple of minutes to give \nyou a sense of part of the motivation that I have.\n  I am holding here--it will be difficult to see from far away, but \nthis is a one-page tear sheet from the Wall Street Journal dated \nMonday, December 17, 2012. It says at the top: ``Connecticut School \nShooting.'' The headline below that, in larger letters, says: \n``Shattered Lives.'' I, obviously, won't read it all, but this has been \non my desk since that week. We can see it is a bit yellowed, and every \nstory here has an element of inspiration that is almost unimaginable. I \nmention that because I am from Pennsylvania. I don't represent the \nState of Connecticut, but this tragedy in Connecticut, at Newtown's \nSandy Hook Elementary School, stays with all of us for different \nreasons--maybe because some of us are parents, maybe because we were \nstruck by the gravity of the enormity and brutality of that crime on \nwhat so many of us have called that awful day. But, I will tell you, I \ndon't think I have been as affected by a news event other than 9/11 in \nmy life, and certainly not one that ever affected in the way that it \nhad a connection to what I would do and how I would vote. So this \ntragedy in Newtown in 2012 directly affected the way I would vote. It \nchanged my thinking in so many different ways. I won't walk through all \nof that tonight. But as much as these stories of these children \ninspired me then and continue to inspire me, I don't want to add \nanother set of stories to my desk or keep adding to the chronicle of \nsuffering and the chronicle of murder and destruction that gun violence \nwill leave with us.\n  Today the Washington Post--and I will just open this up for \nillustrative purposes--had one page and then another page, and they \nneeded two pages of it, obviously, because of the number of victims. I \ndidn't count, but if that is not 49, it is close to 49. Each of them \nhas a story as well. So just as the children whose stories were \nsummarized in the Wall Street Journal in 2012, today's Washington \nPost--and I am sure many other papers--have these stories.\n  We don't have time to go through every story, but I was inspired by \nthe lives of those children, what they meant to their families and what \ntheir life meant to their community, and how in their very young lives \nthey had already begun to achieve significant things in their life, \neither by making their sisters or brothers happy or by comforting their \nsisters and brothers and family and friends. I am sure the same will be \nsaid of those who lost their lives in Orlando.\n\n  Let me give you two examples in the interest of time. This is on page \nA-11 in the Washington Post today. It is one of the many vignettes. I \nmentioned Akyra Monet Murray, 18 years old, who happened to be from \nPhiladelphia. I talked about her earlier today. She was third in her \nclass and on her way to a basketball scholarship, and she happened to \nbe in Orlando, FL. She was killed. She was a remarkable young woman. I \nwish I knew her, but she had just graduated from West Catholic in \nPhiladelphia.\n  Here is someone as well who died in Orlando. Brenda Lee Marquez \nMcCool, 49 years old, is one of the oldest on these 2 pages. Many of \nthem listed, as many people here know, were 25 and 21 and 18 and 24 and \n22, and on and on. But here are the first two lines of this vignette \nabout Brenda Lee Marquez McCool. A two-time cancer survivor, McCool was \nfirst diagnosed with cancer about 8 years ago. This is what her ex-\nhusband Robert Presley said: ``The doctor gave her a year to live. She \nlived eight, until this nonsense.''\n  She lived 8 years after a diagnosis of cancer. So her life and her \nfight to overcome cancer should be a reminder for us that this is a \nlong fight. She lost her life ultimately, but she beat cancer for a \nlong time, even though she lost her life this weekend.\n  I will give you one more. There are so many more, but we just don't \nhave time tonight to go through all. Shane Evan Tomlinson was 33. He \nwas working that night, playing in a band, and he left there to go to \nthe club, to be able to relax a little bit after working. He was a \nmember of an all-male gospel choir at the House of Blues in Orlando. \nAgain, he was 33 years old.\n  So I don't want to keep adding to this chronicle. None of us want to. \nWe all want to figure out a way to make progress on this issue, to \nfinally say to ourselves that as Americans we can come together and \ntake even incremental steps. But, I think, for this week that would be \nsignificant. As all three Senators--Senator Murphy, Senator Blumenthal, \nand Senator Booker--have reminded us, what we are asking for here is a \nmodel of reasonableness. We are asking for a simple solution to a very \ndiscreet but horrific problem. If you are too dangerous to get on an \nairplane, if we have made that determination, why would you be allowed \nto have a firearm? Why would a terrorist or potential terrorist be \nallowed to have a firearm? Let's solve that one problem.\n  Then, of course, there is the problem that we have tried to solve in \n2013--background checks, which, at last count, was about a 90-10 issue \nin the United States of America. This is a reasonable and sensible set \nof requests, just two in number. I can go on with others, but I won't.\n  Let me just conclude with Sandy Hook for a moment. We all know the \nhorror of what happened there and the impact it had on all of our \nlives, but Senator Booker reminded us yesterday that in so many \ncommunities and in so many inner cities in America they have large \nnumbers of gun deaths every single week, and in some communities every \nsingle day. I won't mention a list of cities or communities, to not be \nexhaustive, but I think people know them. We have to figure out a way \nto stay focused on those communities even as we focus on the horror and \ngravity and dimensions of what happened in Orlando or Newtown or Sandy \nHook or so many other places.\n  Let's think about this just for a moment, before I, at long last, ask \nmy question or ask for the answer to Senator Murphy. How about school \nshootings since Sandy Hook? What do we find there? Since Sandy Hook, a \ngun has been fired on school grounds nearly once a week for a total of \n188 school shootings, including several in my home State of \nPennsylvania, according to data compiled by Every Town For Gun Safety. \nThis has happened weekly since Newtown. It is not as if we have these \nevents and we focus on them and then the problem recedes as we recede \nin our action or lack of action, in our focus, in our determination, in \nour sense of urgency. The problem does not go away. The problem is not \ngoing away. If anything, it is growing in dimension.\n  Just look at the data on how this problem has grown since the 1960s \nand 1970s. It just didn't happen in those days. It didn't even happen \nmuch in the 1980s, but if you look at 1990 forward, you see incident \nafter incident. In 2000 and forward, it goes on and on. So if anything, \nit is accelerating at a pace that no one--no one in this body--should \nbe content about.\n  So that means that every week--every single week--there is some \nschoolchild or school student. This goes all the way, obviously, to \ncolleges and universities. So every single week some group of Americans \nwho happen to be children or young adults are in a school setting of \none kind or another, and they are either the direct victim or the \nvictim who lives through that horror and has the imprint of that horror\n\n[[Page S3948]]\n\nfor the rest of their lives. That is the reality.\n  So to anyone who thinks this is just a random occurrence, go to a \nschool in a lot of places and talk to people in schools and go to our \ncities. I think we could all learn a lot.\n  I want to just mention a few more statistics because we were talking \nabout children. Numbers don't ever paint the right picture, but they \nare instructive on a night like tonight.\n  I live in a State which has a proud tradition of support for the \nSecond Amendment--and I mean really strong, like maybe no other State \nin the country, maybe one or two others but not many--a strong \ntradition of hunting and sport. Hunting is almost a part of not just \nthe culture of our State but part of family life. Fathers and sons go \nout and hunt, and I am sure fathers and daughters or mothers and \ndaughters. It is part of growing up in some communities. They go out \nand hunt, they participate in a tradition, they work to do it safely, \nthey do a lot of training, and they pass on from one generation to \nanother not just the experience but the rules and the way to do things.\n  We have as strong a tradition as any of the country. By some \nestimates, there are about a million gun owners. I don't know where \nthat puts us in the rankings, but it is no lower than second or third \nor fourth in the country.\n  We have a lot of people in our State that not only value the Second \nAmendment, but the benefits of that amendment for their lives are \nsignificant because they get to own a gun to hunt and in some cases \nobviously to protect themselves or their families.\n  This is what the numbers tell us about just gun violence in a State \nlike Pennsylvania as it relates to children only. According to the \nPennsylvania Trauma Systems Foundation, every year about 400 children--\nmeaning individuals under the age of 20. That is the cutoff. They don't \nsay under 18. This is under 20, so children, and I guess you could say \nyoung adults. Four hundred are treated for firearm injuries in the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania. This number does not count the children \nwho die at the scene, like most firearm suicide victims, so it doesn't \neven count some young people.\n  In 2013, there were 1,378 firearm-related injuries in Pennsylvania. \nAlmost half of these were persons under the age of 25 years old. In \nthat same year of 2013, the same year as Newtown, 1,670 children under \n18 died by gunshot and an additional 9,718 were injured. So in just 1 \nyear in one State, 1,670 children died by gunshot, 9,718 were injured.\n  That is the reality. When we consider the gravity of this problem in \nour cities, in communities of all kinds, and most tragically in \nOrlando, FL, we know it is a problem of great significance, dimension, \nand complexity. We know this is not easy to solve, but we know our \ncountry has faced huge challenges in the past. We are the country that \nwon World War II. Without our participation, the Allies could never \nhave won. That is who America was. That was a pretty tough problem, \ntrying to defeat the Axis powers and trying to take on these powerful \nmilitary machines, but we figured out a way to do that as a nation. We \nall came together.\n  We all came together after 9/11. It is a complicated problem \ninvolving rights, having to stand in line and say: I am going to \nparticipate in this process to make our airlines safe so we don't have \nairplanes flying into buildings.\n  That was a big problem, but we did not surrender to the terrorists \nafter 9/11. We came together and figured out a solution to a problem. \nWe haven't solved the terrorism problem. We have certainly solved the \nproblem of preventing terrorists from taking an airplane and flying it \ninto a building, not only to kill thousands of people but to create \nuntold kinds of fear.\n  Where does that leave us with the children of Sandy Hook? Well, I \nwill take another day to read some of the stories, but let me just \nleave you with one thought. I want to ask Senator Murphy a question \nafter I read this.\n  One of the children killed that day--and every child's story is \nworthy of mention, but in the interest of time I will highlight, and it \nwill be a highlight of one, Caroline Previdi. Caroline was 6 when she \nlost her life at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\n  Among other things they wrote:\n\n       Caroline loved to draw and dance. Her smile brought \n     happiness to everyone she touched.\n\n  That is what her obituary read at the age of 6.\n  She will be remembered for accompanying a nervous kindergartner on \nthe schoolbus. Caroline, a first grader, sat with Karen Dryer's son \nLogan on the bus each day. This is what Mrs. Dryer said about Caroline: \nShe sat with her son Logan so that he wasn't scared. That is what a \ngrateful mother said about little Caroline and about what she did \nbefore she died.\n  What does that mean for tonight? If little Caroline, at the age of 6, \ncould comfort someone younger than she was on the bus every day, \nknowing he was afraid, knowing he was scared or worried about what was \nhappening in his life, a kindergartner on a bus--if Caroline could do \nthat and show not just a measure of courage but really a measure of \nresponsibility--she took responsibility in her young life to help solve \nthe one problem that one of her classmates or ``almost'' classmate, \nthat one of her friends was having--I think we should take inspiration \nfrom Caroline's sense of responsibility. She thought apparently it was \nher duty to help someone younger than she was and to give them comfort, \nto give a measure of security. In her young life, in that little world \nthat she was, she figured out a way to be responsible.\n  I hope that people across this Chamber will do more than just kind of \ncasually review these amendments, casually think about this issue, and \njust stay in your lane, which the lane is, for a number of people here, \nthe usual response is no laws will change this. I am glad we didn't say \nthat after 9/11, by the way. It is a good thing we didn't do that as a \nnation--no laws will change us, no policy will change us. I hope in \nlight of what Caroline has taught us that we will all be responsible, \nserious, and sober about what we do here, and we will examine our \nconscience, to use an old expression.\n\n  Is there something you can do with your vote this week, next week, \nnext month, or next year that will help solve a part of this problem? \nBecause this is a big problem which has not gone away, and every one of \nour lives is going to be affected by it in some way or another going \nforward. Many of us have seen too much of this in our States and in our \ncommunities.\n  Finally, Senator Murphy, I will ask you this question. I will not \nguess at the answer. In light of those stories--and you know the \nstories, you know the families personally, I do not--how do you stay \nfocused on a goal, the goal that you are pursuing and we are talking \nabout tonight, and how do you stay inspired in the midst of and in the \nabsence of significant progress?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Thank you, Senator Casey, for that question. I thank you \nfor how you have conducted yourself since the shooting in Sandy Hook. I \nwas remarking to Senator Warner on the same topic, but it was really \nyou and Senator Warner who, in the days following the shooting, came \nout and said we need to engage, we need to change something, and we are \nwilling to change our minds or our level of advocacy. You were one of \nthe most persuasive voices on behalf of the families of Sandy Hook in \nthe days and weeks following, and you have been so generous to meet \nwith them, as have many of my colleagues when they come here.\n  In answer to your question, I go back to those families. Probably the \nworst day that I have had legislatively while I have been here was the \nday in which that background check bill failed. Remember, it didn't \nreally fail. It got the majority of this Senate to vote for it, but it \nfailed because of a Republican-led filibuster.\n  I thank Representative Swalwell and Representative Gabbard for \njoining us on the floor today. I really appreciate our friends from the \nHouse being here.\n  I remember standing with them after that bill failed. They whispered \nto me some version of a very simple idea. They said: We aren't \nadvocates for 4 months. We are advocates for 40 years, right? A tragedy \nlike Sandy Hook, like Orlando or like Aurora, it fundamentally reorders \nthe lives of those who are affected. The reason I think this Congress \nhas been focused on this question perpetually since Sandy Hook is \nbecause those families continue to come here, continue to show up at \nour doors, and continue to press.\n\n[[Page S3949]]\n\n  The simple answer to your question is as long as those families \naren't going to give up, then we are not going to give up. There is no \nmore articulate spokesman in the Senate for children than you, Senator \nCasey.\n  I have a feeling that so long as children's lives are at risk because \nwe are choosing to allow for dangerous criminals and potential \nterrorists to get weapons, that you are not going to stop either. I \nappreciate you being a big part of our effort on the floor today.\n  With that, I yield the floor for a question, without relinquishing \ncontrol of it, to Senator King.\n  Mr. KING. I say to the Senator, I have a series of questions and some \ncomments.\n  First, I come from a predominantly rural State with a very high \nnumber of gun owners, a very low rate of gun crime.\n  What you are talking about here today, adding the terrorist watch \nlist as one of the elements of the background check and covering the \nnoncovered parts of gun sales, online gun shows, will that have any \npractical effect on the gun owners in Maine?\n  Mr. MURPHY. It will not have any practical effect on the law-abiding \ngun owners in Maine, and that is whom you and I are talking to. The \nonly effect it would have is upon criminals or felons who are \nattempting to circumvent our laws and get weapons by avoiding \nbackground checks. The only effect it would have is if there were \nindividuals in Maine who were the subject of terrorist investigations. \nThey would be prevented from buying weapons, but of course even those \nindividuals--if they thought they were on the list for the wrong \nreasons--would have a process to grieve that. But for law-abiding \ncitizens in Maine or Connecticut or Pennsylvania or New Jersey, this \nlaw has no impact on them.\n  Mr. KING. It will have no practical effect. They will still be able \nto buy guns in either place. They would have to go through the instant \nbackground check and the law as if they were a felon or something like \nthat. Then they would be prevented. But other than that, this isn't \ngoing to have any practical effect on the practical law-abiding gun \nowners in Maine?\n  Mr. MURPHY. It will have no effect on law-abiding gun owners in Maine \nor anywhere else. This has nothing to do with those individuals.\n  Mr. KING. I want to take a slightly different view than I have heard \ntoday on the issue of terrorism.\n  I am on the Intelligence Committee. Every Tuesday afternoon and \nThursday afternoon that we are in session we meet upstairs in a closed \nroom. Ever since I have been here in January of 2013, the subject in \none way or another has been terrorism, has been the threats that this \ncountry is facing around the world.\n  What has happened in the last 4 years is a subtle change in the \nnature of that threat. When we first came, we were talking about Al \nQaeda. We were talking about plots. We were talking about people coming \nhere using airplanes, otherwise penetrating this country from abroad.\n  What has happened is that the terrorist threat has become homegrown. \nIn fact, there is even a term for it of homegrown extremists or local \nterrorists.\n  ISIS is here. Every place there is a computer with an Internet \nconnection, ISIS is there, and people like the shooter in Orlando may \nnever go to the Middle East. I think he actually had traveled, but many \nof the people involved in this threat to our Nation never leave the \nUnited States.\n  So here is what we are doing, and here is why your amendment makes so \nmuch sense. We are spending millions of dollars--in fact, billions over \nthe past 15 years--to counteract this terrorist threat, and it suddenly \noccurred to me, as I was thinking through it, we are spending millions \nof dollars to bomb ISIS's weapons supplies in Syria and Iraq, and they \ncan buy their weapons here. How much sense does that make? It is just \ncrazy that we are spending millions of dollars to interdict their \nweapons supply and yet the people who are here, who are under their \nthrall, who are thinking about terrorist acts and whom they are \ninspiring to these acts, can walk out and get a gun without any \nhesitation as long as they do not violate one of the terms of the \ncurrent law.\n  The other piece of this that I think is important is that the current \nlaw that has the list of prohibitions--mental illness, felony, domestic \nviolence, and there are nine--was passed in 1993. The world is \nenormously and fundamentally different than it was in 1993. In 1993 we \nhad barely heard of Al Qaeda. There was no ISIS. There was very little \nthreat or acknowledgment or understanding of domestic terrorism \nwhatsoever. But now we are in terrorism 2.0. What happened in Orlando \nis exactly what we have been hearing about in the Intelligence \nCommittee, what has been predicted by all our intelligence officials, \nand what many of us have been talking about. It is the nightmare \nscenario of an American who is radicalized online, who goes out and \ngets a gun and kills 50 people. That is the hardest threat to stop \nbecause there is no plot, there is no email trail, and there are very \nfew phone calls. There is nothing. It is hard for our intelligence \ncommunity to track someone like that. But if we have some knowledge of \nthem, if they are in our database--to me, it just makes common sense \nthat should be added to the list of disqualifications for buying guns.\n  This is no threat to anybody who is not on such a list. And I \nunderstand--and the Senator can please comment--the legislation we are \ntalking about has a constitutional escape hatch for people who are \nwrongly on the list or whose names are mixed up, and they will have an \nopportunity to protest that list and to have their names expunged if \nthey can make the case that there was something wrong with their being \non the list; is that correct?\n  Mr. MURPHY. It is correct. It is correct, and that is an important \nfacet of the amendment Senator Feinstein has submitted.\n  But it is also important, as we remarked earlier--perhaps when you \nwere on the floor, Senator King--to understand the scope of this. We \nare talking about a very small number of sales that actually would be \naffected. In 2015, thanks to a report Senator Feinstein released, we \nknow that in that year there were only about 215 sales at gun stores to \nindividuals who were on the terrorist watch list. So it is a very small \nnumber of sales we are talking about in the first place.\n  Mr. KING. But if someone says: Well, if that is such a small number, \nwhy are we bothering? Because it only takes one to kill a number of \npeople.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Correct.\n  Mr. KING. And that is really the essence of what the Senator is \ntalking about.\n  As I understand it, there are two parts of what we are talking about \ntoday. By the way, the Senator is not talking about an assault weapons \nban or magazine control or any of those things; we are really talking \nabout two things. The first is the terrorist watch list. If you are on \nthe list, you can't buy a gun. No fly, no buy. The second is to fill \nthe loophole in the background check system because, as I understand \nthe Senator's argument, if we say ``If you are on the watch list, you \ncan't buy a gun,'' but there is this gaping 40 percent loophole where \nyou could get a gun without any check whatsoever, then it doesn't \nmatter. Anybody--a felon or anybody--could get a gun under that \ncircumstance. Is that the logical progression?\n  Mr. MURPHY. That is exactly right. And I think my colleague very \nsmartly referred back to the initiation of the background check system, \nwhere no one was contemplating a terrorist watch list or a no-fly list \nexisting. It is the same thing with Internet sales, it is the same \nthing with armslist.com, and it is the same thing with gun shows. Back \nwhen we passed the background checks law, the vast majority of gun \nsales were done in bricks-and-mortar stores. What has happened is that \nsales have migrated into other forms, especially online.\n  So in all of these respects, as the Senator is accurately pointing \nout, all we are really seeking to do is to have the law and the initial \nintent of it catch up with the trajectory of time.\n  Mr. KING. And I find it hard to believe that if we were debating that \nlaw in 1993 under the current circumstances, that some cognizance \nwouldn't have been taken of the risk of domestic terrorists.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I don't think there would have been any question that \ncategory would have been included. That\n\n[[Page S3950]]\n\nis probably why 80 percent of Americans support the adoption of this \namendment or some version of it.\n  Mr. KING. By the way, I would mention that since the Senator has been \non the floor today, 10 people have been murdered with guns. It is about \none an hour. Since the Orlando shooting, 100 people--twice as many as \nin Orlando--have been murdered with guns.\n  So we are talking about Orlando, but we are also talking about people \nall over the country, mostly innocent people, sometimes people who are \nvictims of domestic violence. We are not talking about taking guns away \nfrom people; we are just talking about keeping people who shouldn't \nhave them from getting guns. And I have never met a gun owner who \ndoesn't agree that is just a commonsense restriction. Does my colleague \nview this in any way as a violation of the Second Amendment?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Senator Udall was on the floor earlier, and he said \nsomebody called his office earlier today asking why we were debating \nthe Second Amendment today, and of course the answer to that is we are \nnot debating the Second Amendment. There is actually nothing about this \ndebate relevant to the Second Amendment because the Second Amendment is \nclear. As the Supreme Court has stated, an individual has a right to \nown a firearm. But, as that same Court very clearly stated in an \nopinion by Justice Scalia himself, that right is not absolute. The \nCongress has the ability to say there are some weapons that should be \nout of bounds and that there are some individuals who are so dangerous \nthey shouldn't own weapons. So even the most conservative jurists on \nthe Supreme Court have held very plainly that the Second Amendment \nallows for the Congress or State legislatures to decide there are \ncertain individuals--felons, people who have been convicted of violent \ncrimes, or individuals we suspect of terrorist activities--who \nshouldn't buy a weapon.\n  Of course, as we remarked earlier, if you go into any gun club in \nMaine or Connecticut, that is what people in those forums believe as \nwell. They believe law-abiding citizens should be able to get any \nweapons they want, by and large, but they do not believe criminals \nshould be able to buy weapons. That is a view held by gun owners and \nnon-gun owners alike because everyone accepts that that is in keeping \nwith the Second Amendment.\n  Mr. KING. Don't you think one of the problems with this debate as it \nhas evolved over the past few years is that it has become a kind of \neither/or?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Right.\n  Mr. KING. If you are for the Second Amendment, there are no \nlimitations whatsoever, and if you talk about limitations, you are \nagainst the Second Amendment. Do you accept that characterization?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I think you are exactly right. I think this has become an \neither/or debate in so many different perspectives.\n  I am so glad we are bringing together this question of how we respond \nto terrorism and how we protect Americans from the consequences of \nloose gun laws because there is also this juxtaposition in which these \nterrorist attacks are either about the fight against ISIS or they are \nabout our loose gun laws, and they are about both. And this shooting in \nOrlando is about a whole host of other subjects as well.\n  So I think we have tried to stay true to the complexity of this \nquestion on the floor during this time. We are not suggesting that what \nwe are proposing is going to solve the problem, but we do have to get \nout of this paradigm in which if you are a supporter of the Second \nAmendment, you can't support any restrictions on individuals, whether \nor not they are on a terrorist watch list, to obtain guns.\n  Mr. KING. Well, this solution being proposed, even if it only \nprevents 1 person, that could mean 50 lives or 100 lives. I think that \nis important.\n  By the way, it is a dirty trick, Senator, to quote Justice Scalia on \nthis subject. He did make it clear in the Heller decision, as you point \nout, that the Second Amendment, as the First Amendment or any of the \namendments, is not absolute. People say the First Amendment says \nCongress shall make no law respecting speech, but you can't yell \n``fire'' in a crowded theater. That is established law. And Justice \nScalia, in the Heller decision, said the same thing about the Second \nAmendment. It is not absolute. There are limitations that can be placed \nupon it, particularly in the transfer of firearms, and I think that is \nwhat we are talking about here.\n  So I commend the Senator, and I believe what we are talking about--\nand let me go back to the Intelligence Committee for a minute. It took \nme 2 or 3 months--maybe I am a slow learner--but as I was sitting in \nthe Intelligence Committee, I finally had two really visceral insights. \nOne was that we are the only people watching the intelligence \ncommunity; that we have this large apparatus, and we have these small \ncommittees in the House and the Senate, and we are the only people \nwatching. That is not relevant to this debate, but that was an \nimportant realization imposed upon me, and what I thought was an \nextraordinary responsibility to pay close attention to what these \nagencies are doing.\n  The second insight was that the fundamental role of the Intelligence \nCommittee and, I would argue, the fundamental role of this body is to \nconstantly monitor and calibrate the tension that exists between two \nfundamental provisions of the Constitution--in this case, three. The \nfirst is in the preamble--the fundamental reason this government was \nformed in the first place--to insure domestic tranquility and provide \nfor the common defense. That is the essence of any government, the \nfundamental, sacred responsibility.\n  Then we have the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, and the \nFourth and Fifth Amendments that have issues of privacy and issues of \ngun ownership, and we have to constantly balance and calibrate those \nprovisions based upon technology and reality, circumstances, and facts.\n  We have a new set of facts. We are facing a threat today in the \nUnited States that is different from what we have ever faced before, \nwhere we have people who are being motivated from abroad mostly but are \nin our society, in our country--this fellow in Orlando was an American \ncitizen, was born here--and we have to take cognizance of that. We have \nto take account of that reality. If we don't, we are failing, it seems \nto me, our fundamental responsibility under the preamble of the \nConstitution to provide for the common defense. That is what the \nAmerican people expect us to do--to keep them safe--and this is simply \none piece of the armor we can provide to keep the people of America \nsafe.\n  I would conclude with a question to the Senator. Is there any hope of \ngetting this accomplished? Where are we? Why is this so hard? This \nseems to be a commonsense response. I read a quote from the NRA today \nthat said: We believe that terrorists should not have guns. So is there \nroom for discussion, for compromise? Does my colleague feel there is an \nopportunity here to get to a place where we can respond to this new \nthreat that is facing us without in any way compromising the values of \nthe Second Amendment?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for guiding us toward that compromise \nbecause it has to be there. On this issue, we are speaking the same \nlanguage. Frankly, on background checks, we tend to speak the same \nlanguage. We both say--Republicans and Democrats--that we don't want \ncriminals to get guns. We both say we don't want terrorists to get \nguns. Yet we have been unable to meet in the middle.\n  My understanding is that the majority has a concern about the ability \nof individuals who shouldn't be on these lists to get off the list. So \ndo we. We have no less interest in due process than they do. So we want \nto bring these issues to a vote on the floor. Our preference is to \nbring a compromise measure that can pass and get the support of both \nsides.\n  I know we have had Senator Toomey and some others come to the floor \ntoday and suggest there is some work to be done to get a compromise. My \nhope is we can get there. If we can't, then let's at least take the \nvote and let the American people see where we stand.\n  Mr. KING. But my understanding is the amendment as proposed does \nprovide a specific process whereby a person who believes they are \nwrongfully on the list, wrongfully denied the opportunity to purchase a \nfirearm, has the opportunity to contest that, to have it litigated, and \nhave it resolved in a reasonably prompt manner.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I think that has been the difficulty in finding a \ncompromise.\n\n[[Page S3951]]\n\nThe existing text gives the ability already for anyone who believes \nthey are on the list wrongly to get off that list. That is why I said \nthat we are just as concerned with that, and the underlying amendment \nthat we have proposed and Senator Feinstein has proposed does exactly \nthat. It gives an escape hatch for anyone wrongly on that list.\n  Mr. KING. One of the odd things about this debate is that if this had \nbeen 15 years ago, I don't think we would even be having this debate. \nBackground checks were generally uncontroversial. If we had would have \nhad the terrorist threat, I couldn't believe--we have domestic violence \non there. How about terrorism violence? That should be a part of this \nas well. That is all you are really proposing. Is that correct?\n  (Mr. SCOTT assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. MURPHY. That is correct. It is only controversial here; it is not \ncontroversial out in the American public. By and large, they want this \ndone. So we have created a controversy that doesn't really exist in the \nliving rooms and social halls of this country.\n  Mr. KING. I thank the Senator. I thank him for his answers and thank \nhim for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator. I think it is really important that \nwe have the diversity of our caucus represented as part of this \ndiscussion today. Senator King and Senator Donnelly are both strong \nsupporters of the Second Amendment. I am glad to yield the floor for a \nquestion, without losing my right to the floor, to Senator Donnelly.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Will the Senator from Connecticut yield for a question?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I will.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Like all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I \nwas sick when I learned of the tragic shooting in Orlando. Since \nSunday, like so many people, my thoughts have been with the families \nand with the friends of the victims, with the LGBT community, with the \npeople of Orlando, and with all Americans who are mourning the loss of \nloved ones at the hands of senseless gun violence. My thoughts are also \nwith the parents across our Nation. We have to explain to our kids, how \ncan something like this happen in our country?\n  We were elected in this Chamber to do a job--to discuss issues, to \ndebate them, and to vote on legislation that makes our communities and \nour country safer. I came to the floor tonight to participate in this \ndiscussion because we have a job to do and we have action to take. I \nthank Senator Murphy for leading this.\n  I am a supporter of the Second Amendment. I am also someone who \nbelieves it is reasonable for all of us to consider smart and \nresponsible ways to reduce gun violence. Those things are not in \nopposition to each other. Since I have come to the Senate, we have \ntalked about mass shootings in Orlando, in San Bernardino, in \nCharleston, and in Newtown, CT, the Senator's home State. The truth is, \nthere is gun violence across this country every single day. No State is \nimmune, including my home State of Indiana. Every victim of gun \nviolence is someone's mom or someone's dad or someone's sister or \nsomeone's brother or someone's son or someone's daughter or someone's \nhusband or someone's wife, and those lives are destroyed.\n  There are bipartisan proposals we can consider today that can make a \ndifference. They will not solve every problem, but we can save lives. \nWe can start by considering the bipartisan proposal by Senators Joe \nManchin and Pat Toomey that strengthens our background check system to \nhelp prevent criminals and individuals with serious mental illnesses \nfrom getting guns. This legislation requires background checks for all \ncommercial gun sales, whether they are at a store or whether they are \nat a gun show or whether they are online.\n  We should also debate and pass bipartisan legislation that denies \nfirearms sales to known or suspected terrorists. This is simple \nAmerican common sense. This is what the American people expect of us. \nThis is what we were elected to do. If a person is on a terrorist watch \nlist, they shouldn't be able to buy a gun. It is that simple and that \nuncomplicated. It is time to do our job--to do our job as Members of \nCongress to confront the serious problem of gun violence in our \ncountry, to debate our options, to work to find solutions to help keep \nall Americans safe, and to protect our individual rights. As Members of \nthis body we have differences, but we shouldn't have differences on \nthis.\n  We have also demonstrated that we can find common ground at critical \ntimes. I am confident that every Member of this body agrees we should \nkeep weapons out of the hands of criminals, terrorists, and people with \nmental illnesses. This should not be controversial. I urge all my \ncolleagues to come together on behalf of the American people who have \nblessed us with this opportunity to serve here and to stand up for them \nand to vote on these proposals. It is the very least we can do for \nthose families, for the people we represent, and for the serious \nobligation and responsibility they have given us to do these things. \nThey expect us to do our job. It is time for us to step up to the \nplate.\n  With all that in mind, I have a question for my good friend, the \nSenator from Connecticut. The question is this: Don't we owe it to the \nvictims of Orlando, the victims from Newtown in your home State, the \nvictims of Charleston, and the victims of gun violence in all our \nStates to have a vote on these proposals, which are bipartisan in every \nsingle way?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I think that last phrase is the most important. They are \nbipartisan in every single way. We have had bipartisan support for \nthese proposals on the floor of the Senate. But, frankly, more \nimportantly, in Indiana and Connecticut there is bipartisan support. \nWhether talking to progressive Democrats or rock-ribbed Republicans, \nthey all are of the consensus position that if you can't fly because we \nhave deemed you to be a terrorist threat, then you probably shouldn't \nbe able to buy an assault weapon, and that if you are a criminal, it \nshouldn't really matter whether you walk into a gun show or a gun \nstore, you shouldn't be able to buy a weapon.\n\n  So I think the Senator put it perfectly, which is that in every way \nthese are bipartisan proposals. At the very least, it is incumbent upon \nus to show the American people where the Senate stands on these issues. \nLet's show the people of Indiana and Connecticut and Illinois where \nSenators stand on these two simple questions that have bipartisan \ngrassroots support in this country.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. I have one more question. Does the Senator think we are \nunderestimating in this body--that Senators are underestimating the \ncommon sense of the American people; that they know terrorists \nshouldn't be allowed to have these weapons; that they know it is a \ndanger to our kids, to our families; that we would do great credit to \nthe American people to have faith in them, to believe in them; that \nthey are ready to take these steps; that they are ready to see their \nSenators take these steps and to stand with us? We all love our \nchildren. We all love our families. We all want to make sure that when \nthey go out to be with their friends, they come home safe that night. \nFor all of our families--whether Republican or Democrat--most \nimportant, we are not red or blue. We are red, we are white, and we are \nblue. We are all Americans. We are one team. We are in this together.\n  Doesn't it seem to make sense that we ought to be able to reflect the \nwill of the American people? I think the American people are ready for \nthis. Don't you?\n  Mr. MURPHY. It is a political issue here; it is not a political issue \nanywhere else. The Senator talked about, I think, a very apt \ndescription of our underestimation of the common sense of the American \npeople. I also think we underestimate our ability to fundamentally \naddress the fear that exists today about the next terrorist attack. I \nthink if we were able to come together and pass these two simple \nmeasures, it would be a show of faith for the American people that we \nget it--that we understand how anxious they are, how fearful they are, \nhow angry they are, and there is a salve to the wound that could come \nif we were able to come together and act. It is not just that it would \nmake a practical difference in stopping potential terrorists from \ngetting guns, but it would have a psychological impact on people.\n  So I think the Senator is right that we underestimate the common \nsense of\n\n[[Page S3952]]\n\nthe American public. But I think we also underestimate our ability to \ndo something meaningful, to address what is a very legitimate anxiety \nin the public, having watched San Bernardino to Orlando.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  I yield to Senator Durbin for a question without losing my right to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to direct a question to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  First, I would like to acknowledge that the Senator from Connecticut \ntook the floor about 10 hours ago and has stood here with his \ncolleagues, the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Booker, and many others \nwho have joined him during the course of the day. Senator Blumenthal of \nConnecticut was also here.\n  I would like to ask a few questions and then ask the Senator to react \nto a news story that just came out. I think it is important for us from \ntime to time to remind those who are just starting to follow this \ndebate why we are here and particularly why the Senator has been on the \nfloor for 10 hours straight. This is unusual in the Senate. It is \ntechnically known as a filibuster, when one Member takes the floor and \ndoesn't yield the floor. It is done for a variety of reasons. It has \nbeen done throughout the history of this Chamber. But I hope we can \nmake it clear from the outset why we are doing it today, why the \nSenator is leading it, why we are joining him today, and why this is an \nimportant message that we are trying to send across America from one \ncoast to the other, including the islands of Hawaii.\n  We are dealing with this because what happened in Orlando has really \nfocused America on gun violence and the terrible tragedy that occurred \nthere, with 49 deaths and over 50 who are seriously injured as a result \nof this gunman who turned his guns loose on these poor people who \ngathered at this nightclub.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Connecticut, at the risk of \nrepeating himself--which is part of what we do here, making sure that \nthose who are following the debate--if he would tell us the two issues \nthat he believes bring us together in this common effort late this \nevening on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for continuing to focus us on why we \nare here. Frankly, we are not here just to talk; we are here to bring \nsome resolution to this debate and to move on to consideration of the \nCJS appropriations bill.\n  We are asking for two votes on what could be consensus measures with \nrespect to protecting Americans.\n  One, we want to make sure that if you are on the terrorist watch \nlist, if you are on the no-fly list, then you cannot buy a gun. You are \nprohibited by law from buying a gun. There is no controversy about that \nin the American public. It would make a tremendous difference.\n  Second, in order to make that provision truly effective, we need to \nmake sure that no matter where you buy a gun--whether you buy it at a \nbricks-and-mortar store, online, or a gun show--you are subject to \nbackground checks. One of those provisions without the other doesn't \nprotect us. Both of them together protect Americans from terrorist \nattacks, protect the flow of illegal guns into communities like Chicago \nwithout having any effect on individual Second Amendment rights. If you \nare a law-abiding citizen in this country, the two measures that we are \nproffering for a vote on the Senate floor will have zero impact on you.\n  If we can get agreement to move forward in a consensus way on those \ntwo measures, my hope is that we could come together and find language \nthat both sides could agree with. At the very least, we should have a \nvote on these measures so we could see where people stand. Then we \nwould gladly relinquish the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Connecticut, without asking him to \nyield the floor, if he will yield for a question.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Our colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, has \nfiled an amendment. I believe she is making slight changes to it, but \nthe amendment addresses the first issue. It enables the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States to deny a request to transfer a firearm to \na known or suspected terrorist. The Senator from Connecticut said \nrepeatedly, and I would like to repeat it myself, this is something the \nvast majority of Americans say: You mean a terrorist can buy a gun in \nAmerica and you can't stop him? So, overwhelmingly, Democratic, \nRepublican, Independent, gun owners, non-gun owners believe this is \ncommon sense. The Senator from California in this amendment says:\n\n       Hereafter the Attorney General may deny the transfer of a \n     firearm if the Attorney General determines, based on the \n     totality of circumstances, that the transferee--\n\n  Purchaser of the firearm--\n\n     represents a threat to public safety based on a reasonable \n     suspicion that the transferee is engaged, or has been \n     engaged, in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid \n     of, or related to terrorism, or providing material support or \n     resources therefor.\n\n  So in the first sentence of about a six- or seven-sentence amendment, \nthe Senator from California, in a few words, says exactly what the \nSenator from Connecticut has said. We want to give to the Attorney \nGeneral the power to stop a suspected terrorist from buying a firearm \nin this country.\n  Today we had a briefing, and I know the Senator couldn't attend \nbecause he was here on the floor with this important responsibility. \nThe briefing came from the leader of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, Jim Comey, and Jeh Johnson, the head of the Department \nof Homeland Security. They talked about what happened in Orlando. Some \nof the things they told us cannot be repeated outside of that closed-\ndoor briefing and some of it will come out as the investigation \nunfolds, but here is something they told us that can be shared.\n  This man who went into the Pulse nightclub at 2 o'clock in the \nmorning in Orlando had two firearms with him. Before that tragic \nevening ended, he had shot hundreds of rounds into that crowded \nnightclub--this one man, hundreds of rounds. What I asked him was to \nplease put this in perspective for me. Since 9/11, we have focused on \nwhat happened that terrible day when 3,000 innocent Americans died \nbecause terrorists took over airplanes and crashed them into the World \nTrade Center and the Pentagon and might have crashed them into this \nbuilding had the brave passengers and crew not stopped them over \nPennsylvania.\n  What we do every single day is to spend hundreds of millions of \ndollars for safety on airplanes and airports because we don't want to \nrun the risk that a passenger will get on board a plane and endanger \nthe lives of passengers, up to 200 passengers or more, with a bomb or \nsome other means. We go to elaborate lengths. Think about it. How many \ntimes have you taken off your shoes, opened your bags, put things on \nthe conveyor belt? We have done that now for 15 years so we don't have \nto relive the tragedy of 9/11.\n  Think about this for a second. If that same terrorist decides not to \nuse an airplane but to use a semiautomatic weapon, the kind of weapon \nused by this man in Orlando, that person can endanger the lives of \nhundreds of people and killed 49 in that tragic situation.\n  So my question to the Senator from Connecticut is this. As we are \nfocusing on the use of these military-style weapons, are we not \nreflecting the new reality of the terrorist threat to America--not just \nairplanes and the other means they have used but now what appears to be \na more common weapon of choice, commonly purchased at gun stores by \neven suspected terrorists. Is that not what you were focusing on and we \nare focusing on as the first thing that needs to be changed in the law?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Senator Durbin, let me read to you the transcript of a \nvideo from one of Al Qaeda's most important operatives, an American by \nthe name of Adam Gadahn. He is deceased now, but here is what he said \nin a video that he sent to potential converts in the United States:\n\n       In the West, you've got a lot at your disposal. Let's take \n     America for example. America is absolutely awash with easily \n     obtainable firearms. You can go down to a gun show at the \n     local convention center and come away with a fully automatic \n     assault rifle without a background check and most likely \n     without having to show an identification card. So what are \n     you waiting for?\n\n  This is an Al Qaeda operative, an Al Qaeda recruiter, specifically \ninstructing their potential followers in the United States to go to gun \nshows to\n\n[[Page S3953]]\n\nbuy assault weapons in order to carry out lone-wolf attacks. This isn't \ntheoretical. We aren't making this up on the floor of the Senate. This \nis a clear, strategic decision on behalf of these groups. They are \nlosing territory inside Iraq and Syria. They are more dependent on \nlone-wolf attacks than ever, and they have figured out that the \nquickest pathway to massive death and destruction is not to hijack an \nairplane, is not to construct an explosive device but to buy an assault \nweapon.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a further question without \nyielding the floor?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Despite the worst mass shooting in the history of the \nUnited States of America that occurred in Orlando, FL, despite the \nnational reaction and international reaction to this tragedy, there was \nnothing scheduled this week in the U.S. Senate on the issue of firearms \nand terrorism, nothing--not until the Senator from Connecticut took the \nfloor 10 hours 20 minutes ago and said: I am not going to sit down \nuntil there is an agreement that we are going to debate this issue on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate. It was not even on the schedule of things \nfor us to discuss this week until this Senator from Connecticut and his \nfriends and colleagues decided to make an issue of it.\n  I ask the Senator if he is aware of the fact that the American \nMedical Association put out a press release in Chicago. I think it is \nhistoric and I would like to read a story about it if my colleagues \nwill bear with me for a minute. This is from the American Medical \nAssociation.\n\n       The worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history has prompted \n     the American Medical Association to call gun violence a \n     `public health crisis' and urge that Congress fund research \n     into the problem.\n       The AMA, which lobbies on behalf of doctors, said on \n     Tuesday it will press Congress to overturn 20-year-old \n     legislation that blocks the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention from conducting research on gun violence.\n       A 29-year-old gunman slaughtered 49 people at a gay \n     nightclub in Orlando, FL, before dawn on Sunday.\n       The AMA adopted the policy at its annual meeting in \n     Chicago. It called U.S. gun violence a crisis that requires a \n     comprehensive response and solution. ``With approximately \n     30,000 men, women and children dying each year at the \n     barrel of a gun in elementary schools, movie theaters, \n     workplaces, houses of worship and on live television, the \n     United States faces a public health crisis of gun \n     violence,'' Dr. Steven Stack, AMA president, said in a \n     statement.\n       ``Even as America faces a crisis unrivaled in any other \n     developed country, the Congress prohibits the CDC from \n     conducting the very research that would help us understand \n     the problems associated with gun violence and determine how \n     to reduce the high rate of firearm-related deaths and \n     injuries.''\n       Congress placed restrictions on CDC funding of gun research \n     into the federal budget in 1996 at the urging of gun rights \n     supporters who claimed the agency was biased toward gun \n     control.\n       AMA has several long-standing gun safety policies including \n     support of legislation that calls for a waiting period before \n     the purchase of any form of firearm in the United States. It \n     also supports background checks for all handgun buyers. \n     (Reporting by Susan Kelly in Chicago; Editing by Caroline \n     Humer and Matthew Lewis)\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to complete the question to the Senator, and \nthen I will be happy to yield.\n  The point that we are getting to is this is the beginning of an \nimportant national debate brought on by the tragedy in Orlando. It is a \ndebate which would not have occurred this week had the Senator from \nConnecticut and his colleagues not taken the floor with this filibuster \non the Senate floor. I thank the Senator for his leadership on this. I \nask the Senator if we can reach a point where we have a statement by \nthe Republican leadership of the Senate that they will give us the \nvotes on these two key issues that we raised over and over again; is \nthat the purpose and intent of your filibuster?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for his question. That is exactly why \nwe are here. Let me reiterate the supposition, the premise of his \nquestion.\n  Senator Booker, Senator Blumenthal, and I--and I know you share this \nview as well--just couldn't come back here and debate amendments on the \nCJS bill that had nothing to do with this epidemic of gun violence \nwitnessed most recently by the worst mass shooting in the history of \nthis country. I simply couldn't come back here and pretend that there \nis nothing we can do about it because of course we can come together \nand find a path forward. Yes, we are on the floor demanding a vote \nbecause it would be unconscionable to leave this week without having a \nspecific debate on these measures and without trying to find a path \nforward.\n  I will say to my friend that my greatest hope is that we can find \ncommon ground on these measures, but in absence of common ground, in \nabsence of a willingness on behalf of the majority party to actually \nsit down and negotiate this, then let's have the vote. Then let's have \nthe vote and see where Members of this body stand, up or down. Let's \nsee what Members choose to do a week after the worst mass shooting in \nthe history of this country, when they are proffered with the question: \nDo you want terrorists to be able to own guns in this country? Do you \nwant individuals who have known connections to terrorist organizations \nto be able to buy military assault-style weapons?\n  Let's put that question on the floor of the Senate and see what \neveryone's answer is.\n  I thank the Senator, and I yield to Senator Brown for a question \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN. I will ask my question through the Chair.\n  First of all, I so appreciate, as Senator Durbin said, the Senator \nbeing here this evening. I so appreciate the work that Senator Murphy \nhas done. I appreciate so much the work he has done and the work \nSenator Booker and Senator Blumenthal have done.\n  I welcome others of my colleagues to the floor. I heard the Senator \nfrom Maine, Mr. King, say something. We know what happened with this \nterrible shooting in Orlando with 49 innocent people killed. We know \nwhat happened in Sandy Hook. We heard Senator Kaine talking earlier \ntoday about what happened at Virginia Tech. We heard what happened in \nDenver when they shot the Planned Parenthood clinic. We know what \nhappened in San Bernardino. We know what happened in southern Ohio, in \na rural Appalachian area of my State where there were a number of \npeople who were killed, and it didn't get quite as much attention. We \nknow what happened to Tamir Rice in my city of Cleveland, a 12-year-old \nboy who was gunned down.\n  What Senator King said was so interesting because we see these awful \nmassacres of 5, 10, 20, or as many now as 49 people murdered in cold \nblood, but what he said was, on average, every hour a person is \nmurdered in this country. Two or three people die from gun violence. \nSince the Orlando massacre, about 100 people have been killed by \ngunfire--twice as many as were killed in Orlando.\n  We had an intelligence briefing from the FBI, as Senator Durbin said, \nabout this mass killing. We all get together and talk about these mass \nkillings, but we don't talk about the day-by-day gun violence. I think \nthe American people know of the mass killings. They always write our \noffices and tell us to do something, and then interest tends to \ndiminish as it becomes news that is 1, 2, 3, 4 days old. But what \nSenator King said was so important that this just happens every day. As \nSenator Booker says, it is often a poor kid who is murdered.\n  I was on the floor earlier tonight, and I mentioned how my wife and I \nlive in ZIP Code 44105 in Cleveland. In the first half of the year in \n2007, that ZIP Code had more foreclosures than any ZIP Code in the \nUnited States of America. It is a ZIP Code where there is a lot of \npoverty. There is a lot of violence.\n  The other night when I was in Washington, my wife heard gunshots and \nthen heard a police siren. That has happened far too many times when I \nam home. If my grandchildren are there, you are alarmed. The gunshots \nare usually maybe a quarter mile away, half a mile away, but we know \nthat each time it might be somebody who is badly injured or worse.\n  We see what is happening. We see maybe the Members of the Senate who \nhave been at the beck and call of the gun lobby, maybe they are \nlistening now. My question is, How do we make sure we remind them and \nremind the American people because I don't think the American people \nthink about what Senator King said. There is roughly\n\n[[Page S3954]]\n\none murder an hour on average in this country, 24 hours day, 7 days a \nweek. There are two or three people who are victims of gunfire hour \nafter hour, day after day. All we really read about, all we really \nreact to are these terrible mass shootings but not the day-by-day \nviolence. How do we bring that to people's attention so people in this \nbody go home and do their job?\n  This Senate is not doing its job in confirming a Supreme Court \nnominee. It is not doing its job for the mine workers whom Senator \nDonnelly, Senator Durbin, and I have in our States or the pensioners \nwith the Teamsters Central States Pension Fund. They are not doing \ntheir job there either.\n  But on this one, until this Senate actually does the right thing, \nSenator Murphy, how do we keep attention on this issue when people's \nmemories fade and we go back to work and do nothing? That is why you \nare standing on this floor hour after hour. You can understand, anybody \nwho is watching--and I know we are not speaking to the country here, \nbut this is a Senator from Connecticut who has not sat all day, has not \nbeen able to eat, just stands here and leads this debate and leads this \nfilibuster, pleading to this Senate. Most of our colleagues are out for \ndinner or home by now, but Senator Murphy is here pleading for our \ncolleagues to stand up and do the right thing. I give my friend so much \ncredit for that.\n\n  How do we sustain this until we get our colleagues here to finally do \ntheir job?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I give credit to Senators Booker and \nBlumenthal, who have also been here. I think Senator Booker has been \nphysically standing for the exact same amount of time that I have been \nstanding as well. Hopefully, we are answering that question right now.\n  Let me just give the evidence of what is happening in social media \ntoday. This filibuster has been the No. 1 trending topic on Twitter all \nday long. So there is nothing that is being discussed more on the most \npopular social media application in the country than our effort to \nbring light to this epidemic of tragedy that exists in our cities every \nday.\n  The Senator from Ohio probably doesn't know this, but last year there \nwas a mass shooting, on average, more than once a day. If you \ncategorize a mass shooting as four or more people being shot at any one \ntime, there were mass shootings in Cleveland, Baltimore, New Orleans, \nBridgeport, and Chicago on a regular basis.\n  I hope this effort is not just in the service of trying to bring a \nvote and a debate to the floor on these two measures but on opening of \nthis country's eyes to the epidemic of gun violence that exists.\n  Second, I think we need to do more of what Senator Baldwin did \ntonight. We need to come to the floor and go out in our communities and \ntell the stories of who these victims are. We need to tell the story of \nwho these young 17- and 18-year-olds are who died in your cities and my \ncities. We need to tell the stories of their moms and dads who were \nleft behind. We need to personalize this in a way that is not real \nright now for most Americans.\n  I have been asked a number of times tonight: Why haven't we been able \nto move this debate? I think some of it is on us for not being as \nrelentless as we can on the floor of the Senate and out in our \ndistricts on commanding attention to this issue of the routineness of \ngun violence in our cities.\n  Frankly, it warms my heart to look around the room today and see 8 or \n9 or 10 Senators still sitting on the floor at 10 p.m. at night. Maybe \nthis is a means for us to recommit ourselves to bringing the message of \nthe reality of everyday gun violence in our cities to every single \ncorner of this country.\n  I thank the Senator from Ohio and will yield for any further \nquestions.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will my colleague from Connecticut yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I yield for a question without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I just came from the Sandy Hook Promise \nDinner, a dinner put together by the parents in his State. These are \nfamily members who have lost loved ones in that horrible tragedy of \nSandy Hook. They were so inspired by the actions of their two Senators, \nwho are also chairs of this organization, the Senator from New Jersey, \nand so many others who have taken to the floor tonight. When I \nmentioned what was going on here, they rose up in a standing ovation. \nThey inspire us, and I know they have inspired our good friends from \nConnecticut. They are amazing people.\n  When something like this happens and a loved one is taken from you, \nas so many loved ones were lost in Orlando--as the good Senator from \nWisconsin so eloquently documented earlier this evening--the natural \ninclination is to curse the darkness, to ask ``why me,'' to be angry, \nto turn inward and say: I don't want to live life anymore. For those \nwho can light candles to try and prevent this from happening to others \neven though their losses will never, never, never be extinguished--the \nholes in their hearts will never been gone--is an amazing thing.\n  Before I ask my question, I wanted to convey to my good friend how \nhis activities and the activities of his colleague from Connecticut and \nthe Senator from New Jersey and so many others here today have inspired \nthis group just as they have inspired us. I think the Senator is \ncorrect. If we can have a virtuous cycle of being inspired by others \nand then trying, through our small efforts, to inspire others, we will \nwin this fight. I have every confidence that we will.\n  Dr. King said: The arc of history is long, but it bends in the \ndirection of justice. That is something that we are all mindful of. It \nwill bend in the direction of justice, and my colleague from \nConnecticut has helped to bend it a little bit more, and for that, we \nare so, so, so thankful.\n  I wish to ask my colleague a question about what we have heard from \nsome on the other side, which is about the Second Amendment and the \nkind of proposals that we have seen by the Senator from Texas and the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, as they seek a compromise and talk about the \nSecond Amendment. To them, it almost seems that the Second Amendment is \nabsolute.\n  I, for one, believe in the Second Amendment. I believed there was a \nright to bear arms even before the Heller decision. I believe that it \nis not fair to read the other amendments of the Constitution in such an \nexpansive way and then say that the Second Amendment means just \nmilitia. Some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle will agree, \nand some will disagree.\n  The question to my colleague is very simple. Even if he has a strong \nbelief in the Second Amendment, no amendment is absolute. The First \nAmendment is so dear to us, but you can't falsely scream ``fire'' in a \ncrowded theater. That is a limitation on our First Amendment rights. We \nhave laws against child pornography, as we should, and that is a \nlimitation on our First Amendment rights. We have libel laws. If you \nsay something that is false that hurts or damages someone, you can be \nsued. That is a limitation on First Amendment rights.\n  Isn't it true that just as we have limitations on First Amendment \nrights, there are reasonable limits on Second Amendment rights? It \nwould seem to me that one of the most logical limitations is to say \nthat someone who is totally dangerous or might be totally dangerous and \ncan wreak the kind of tragedy that we saw in Orlando, Newtown, Aurora, \nand in other places across the country, such as San Bernardino, should \nnot have an absolute right to a firearm. Another point here--before I \nget to my question--is that I find it ironic that so many of my \ncolleagues who are so meticulous on the Second Amendment in terms of \ncivil liberties and due process don't really seem to care about it on \nall the other amendments. That is the sort of inverse. We don't hear \nrousing speeches from some of the Senators who have gotten up in the \npast few days to say something like: Let's make sure we don't make a \nsingle mistake when it comes to the criminal justice system. We have a \nnumber of Senators from New Jersey and Illinois here tonight who have \nworked hard on criminal justice relief, but we don't hear from the \nother side about the need for making sure due process is followed when \nit comes to the criminal, except for the Second Amendment.\n\n  Let's try to be consistent here. Let's believe in all the amendments, \nbut let's\n\n[[Page S3955]]\n\nrealize that every amendment has a limitation. That a balancing test \nhas always been the watch word of the Supreme Court from the founding \nof the Republic.\n  I ask my colleague to explore this contradiction about the idea from \nsome that the Second Amendment alone is the only one that should be \nabsolute. Would my colleague talk a little about that? We have talked \nabout this together in the past. Would my colleague talk about the need \nfor reasonable limitations on every amendment, including the Second \nAmendment, as we are attempting to do here with two pieces of \nlegislation we seek a vote on--a simple vote?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his question. I \nwill just remind him and others that this concept of the Second \nAmendment that my friend has offered is embedded in the Heller \ndecision. The Heller decision itself--and Senator King chided me for \nreferring to the majority opinion in that decision by Justice Scalia \nearlier--says very specifically that though the majority holds that \nthere is an individual right to own a gun, that right is absolutely not \nabsolute. He actually gives specific examples in the majority decision \nof ways in which you can condition that right in order to affect the \npublic safety, like for instance, restricting the types of weapons that \nare bought or restricting guns and firearms from individuals who are \ndeemed dangerous. This isn't theoretical. This is the law and the \ninterpretation of the Second Amendment as determined by this Court.\n  On this question of inconsistency, let's just keep it packed into the \nquestion of the terrorist watch list. I have not heard one of my \nRepublican colleagues come down to the floor and defend the right of \nthose on that list to get into any airplane they want and travel \nanywhere in the world. There is no one who has done that, nor will \nthey, and that is because of this inconsistency--this inconsistency in \nwhich the absolute protection of Second Amendment rights is treated in \na fundamentally different way than the protection of other rights.\n  It is no less dangerous for an individual to pick up a dangerous \nassault weapon that can kill hundreds of people at a time than it might \nbe in order to get on a crowded airplane. You could conceivably kill \nthe same number of people with an assault weapon as you can with an \nairplane. Yet, those two rights--the right to travel and the right to \nown a gun--are treated differently.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York, and \nthrough the Chair, I yield for a question from the Senator from \nMinnesota without losing my right to the floor.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask if the Senator from Connecticut will yield for a \nquestion without losing his right to the floor.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I will.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. One of our \nfellow Senators noted that maybe not many people are watching. I have \nbeen around talking to people tonight, and I can tell you that a lot of \npeople are watching this. The country is watching this because people \nhave been waiting for action.\n  Many of us here have been involved in law enforcement. For me, it is \nabout a series of pictures. It is the picture of those victims in \nOrlando, and with every picture, there is a story. Everyone killed in \nthat massacre was someone's brother, someone's son, someone's loved \none.\n  I think of the little girl with the blue dress with stars, walking \ndown a sidewalk to a church. Her dad had been murdered by a madman, \nsomeone who was mentally ill, someone who was a perpetrator of domestic \nviolence. Her dad was a police officer in Lake City, MN. It is a \nbeautiful little town on a beautiful lake. He was just doing his job \none day when he was called to a home. He went to the front door and had \non a bulletproof desk, but the guy shot him in the head.\n  There we all were at the funeral, at the same church where only a \nweek ago the children had been in a Nativity play and their dad was \nsitting in the front proudly watching. A week later, that same family \nwas walking down the center aisle of the church. The little girl was in \na blue dress covered with stars.\n  I think about those Sandy Hook parents--the ones Senator Murphy knows \nso well--who were in my office, as well as in many other Senators' \noffices, the morning of the vote on the background check bill. I told \nthis story earlier this afternoon. There was a mom sitting there. They \nwere all so sober and so glum because they actually thought there was a \nchance that the people in this Chamber would respond after they lost \ntheir little children in another senseless act of violence.\n  The mom in the office looked at me and said: You know my story? She \nsaid my son was severely autistic and could hardly speak. Every morning \nhe would point up at a picture on the refrigerator. It was a picture of \nhis help aide, the woman who was with him every day. The next thing she \nknows, she gets a call, goes to the school and sits in that fire hall \nwith those parents. Some kids come in, and all the parents who are left \nknow that they are the ones whose babies are never coming back. As she \nsat in that fire hall, she kept thinking about, of course, her son, but \nshe also thought about the woman who was with him and sacrificed her \nlife for him. She was found with her arms around him in that school. \nBoth were shot dead. Those are the images that I think about--the \nlittle girl in the blue dress at the funeral, her daddy, a police \nofficer, shot dead at the door; that mom in my office, her son and her \nson's faithful aide shot dead in that school. Then you think of all \nthese young people killed in this massacre right in our midst in \nOrlando, FL.\n  (Mr. PERDUE assumed the Chair.)\n  We all know that one solution won't fit all. We all know that in some \ncases it is about an assault weapon and in some cases it is about \nbackground checks. In some cases it is about getting someone off a \nterror watch list who shouldn't have a gun. Every solution may be \ndifferent, but when we start doing the right thing, we start saving \nlives.\n  Tyesha Edwards was a little girl who was shot at her dining room \ntable while doing her homework. Her mom said: You get your homework \ndone, you can go to the mall. A gang bullet right through the house. \nMelissa Schmidt, a Minneapolis police officer--young, excited to do her \njob--was shot in a bathroom by someone who was mentally unstable. These \nare the images I think about. And Senator Booker has pointed out so \nmany times that this isn't just about the massacres, it is also about \nthe individual cases that happen every single day, the domestic \nviolence cases that happen every single day.\n  So while it is so important to focus today on this bizarre situation \nwhere you can have thousands of people on a terror watch list who can \nstill get access to firearms, there are other things we can do as well. \nWe can put sensible background checks in place. Think about Senator \nManchin and Senator Toomey coming together at a time--two A-rated NRA \nlegislators who were able to come together and put that background \ncheck together. And think about those parents from Sandy Hook who knew \nthat bill would not have saved their babies but looked at the thing \nthat could most likely get done in this body, what is the thing that \ncould pass that would save the most lives, because they know that \nbackground checks, when done right and thoroughly, have saved lives. \nThey mostly help in cases of suicide and in cases of domestic violence. \nThey had the courage to come to this Chamber, to come to our offices \ntime and time again to advocate for something that they knew wouldn't \nsave their babies' lives, but they did it because they knew it was the \nright thing and they had the courage to do it--the courage that many \npeople did not have in this Senate Chamber.\n  Domestic violence, background checks help. Do we know what else helps \nwith domestic violence? Going after stalkers. Right now you can be \nconvicted of stalking and still get a gun in this country. That is why \nwe have a bipartisan bill in the House and in the Senate that would \nstop that.\n  We also bizarrely don't include dating partners, even though in many \nparts of the law, they are included. You don't have to be married to \nsomeone if you have a domestic violence conviction and you are dating \npartners. A Republican witness at a Judiciary hearing\n\n[[Page S3956]]\n\nagreed that that part of the law could change, but we cannot get that \nsimple thing changed in the law because people are not willing to take \njust the slightest risk to vote for it, even when their own \nconstituents favor it. As Senator Murphy has pointed out over and over \nagain, we have a situation where the majority of gun owners support \nthese changes. We have a situation where the vast majority of people \nwant to see these changes.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut and ask him just one question \nfocused again on the terror watch list. I know Senator Feinstein \nreleased updated information from the Government Accountability Office \njust yesterday which showed that roughly 91 percent of known or \nsuspected terrorists who attempted to purchase a firearm were able to \nclear a background check in 2015. I think people would be pretty \nshocked if they knew that statistic, and obviously one of the reasons \nwe are talking all day today is that people understand how bizarre this \nsituation is, that we can't even close that loophole.\n  I ask Senator Murphy, what does that mean to you when you hear a \nstatistic like that, that you have 91 percent of known or suspected \nterrorists who can purchase a firearm but are still able to clear a \nbackground check?\n  Mr. MURPHY. It shows, I say to Senator Klobuchar, that we are \nintentionally putting our constituents in danger, that we have data \nwhich tells us that when people on the terrorist watch list are walking \ninto gun stores, they are getting approved at a 90-percent rate. By the \nway, the 10 percent who aren't getting approved because they are on the \nterrorist watch list--it is because they are on some other list. But \nthat is a chilling statistic. If you play it out over the course of 10 \nyears, it is the same percentage. Over the course of 10 years, 90 \npercent of individuals who walked into gun stores who were on the \nterrorist watch list have been handed a gun that they could walk out \nwith. It is a small number on a year-to-year basis--200 people--but it \nonly takes one of those individuals in order to commit a mass atrocity.\n  I thank the Senator for coming back to the floor here tonight and \nmaking this very clear case because what we are asking for is eminently \nreasonable. We are asking, Senator Klobuchar, as you know, for debates \nand votes on two commonsense, bipartisan amendments to the underlying \nbill: first, legislation that would make sure that if you are on the \nterrorist watch list, if you are on the no-fly list, that you cannot \nget a weapon, that you are prohibited from buying a weapon, just like a \ncriminal; and second, that background checks be extended to gun shows \nand to Internet sales so we make sure we have a net wide enough to \ncapture these terrorists wherever they are trying to obtain weapons. \nThat will, as Senator Durbin has said over and over again for the last \n10 hours, have an ancillary effect on the gun violence that is plaguing \nhis city, my city, and your city, Senator Klobuchar, because many of \nthe weapons that flow into Chicago and Hartford and Minneapolis come \nthrough sales that happen outside of gun shows and that aren't subject \nto background checks.\n  So it is thrilling to me, frankly, to have a floor that is full of \nSenators at 10 o'clock at night. It is thrilling to me, as I stated \nearlier, that we have been--our collective effort has been the No. 1 \ntrending topic on Twitter over the course of the entire day. It is \nthrilling to me that, as I just heard, our phone lines in our office \nare still ringing off the hook right now as we speak with people all \naround the country who are demanding that we continue to stand on this \nfloor as long as we can, as long as I can, until we get these votes.\n\n  I thank the Senator for bringing this issue back to the floor.\n  I would be thrilled to yield for a question, without losing my right \nto the floor, to the Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I want to thank the Senator from Connecticut for his \ntremendous leadership out here tonight and all through the day. I think \nfor Senators, if you have never led a filibuster, up until that point, \nyou probably don't know for sure that you are ready for this task, but \na moment occurs in which you know you must act, steel is inserted into \nyour spine, and you come out here and you give it your all.\n  Before asking a question, I want to thank the Senator from \nConnecticut and his colleague, the Senator from New Jersey, for showing \nsuch steel in making sure America hears our response to the events that \nhave happened not just this past weekend but for so many weekends and \nso many days and so many incidents. I say to our colleagues that we \ndeserve to have a vote on these two issues.\n  I know my colleague is impressed that there are other colleagues out \nhere, but we so admire your courage, in the face of such tragedy in \nyour State, to not forget the effort that needs to happen in the United \nStates of America, to let the American people know that policies they \nwould like to see debated and discussed are getting bottled up. That is \nwhat tonight is all about. It is all about saying don't bottle up these \nissues and, yes, if you want to test the fortitude of a human being to \nsee how long they can stand on their feet, we will find out the answer \nto that.\n  But the real question is: ``Are you going to let us vote on important \npublic safety issues that the American public wants us to do something \nabout?'' That is what is so ironic about the fact that we can't have \nthese votes. The American people want us to have these votes and are \nfully supportive.\n  I thank my colleague who was just here who was a prosecutor herself, \nso she knows what this is all about. She knows on a day-to-day basis \nwhat it is about.\n  So this issue of voting on whether an individual on the terrorist \nwatch list can purchase firearms--we say to people: If you are on the \nterrorist watch list, we are not going to let you on an airplane, and \nyou cannot get a gun if you are on that list.\n  According to a 2015 poll, 77 percent of the American voters supported \nbanning sales of guns to people on the terrorist watch list. So we know \nthat the majority of Americans support us in this effort. Yet we cannot \nget the support to make that happen here on the Senate floor.\n  I also want to bring up public safety because I am reading a \nstatistic here that Washington is one of just 14 States where more \npeople die by gunfire than by motor vehicle accidents. We also have a \nstatistic that 61 percent of perpetrators who killed police officers \nwith guns in Washington between 1980 and 2013 were prohibited from \npossessing guns but were still able to get them.\n  This issue, for us, is something that we spend a lot of time here \ndebating. There are other colleagues who have led the battle on trying \nto have background checks and closing the loopholes that exist in \ncurrent law. I thank them for that. I thank them for their battles and \nefforts.\n  I wanted to ask the Senator from Connecticut if he is aware--and I am \nsure he will be somewhat aware--that this issue being neglected by the \nU.S. Senate is being taken up by citizens of the United States through \nevery measure and vehicle available to them?\n  In the face of growing violence in our State, Washingtonians demanded \nchange, and in 2014 voters in our State overwhelmingly passed a ballot \ninitiative to require background checks for all firearm sales, \nincluding online sales, sales at gun shows, and sales between private \ncitizens. That is what we passed by initiative in the State of \nWashington.\n  Is the Senator from Connecticut aware that States are taking up this \neffort?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I am aware, and I wish that weren't the case. I wish that \ncitizens through referendum didn't have to take up this cause on a \nState-by-State basis because of utter inaction from this body.\n  I will cite statistics in a moment, maybe, Senator Cantwell, but when \nStates act, it makes a difference. When States act, it results in an \nappreciable decline in gun homicide rates, but it is much better and \nmuch more effective if the Federal Government acts.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I so appreciate the Senator, and I wanted to ask him \nbecause his comments are right in line with the comments that I think \nare so important for people to understand.\n  This past March, we got the first hard numbers from the impact of \nthis law that we passed in Washington State. In addition to the nearly \n4,000\n\n[[Page S3957]]\n\nfelons who were caught illegally trying to buy a firearm in Washington \nthrough a licensed dealer--another 50 felons were prevented from buying \nguns from private sellers because of the provisions of the new law. \nAccording to data from the FBI, nearly 8,000 private sale background \nchecks have occurred that otherwise would not have without changes in \nthe law.\n  So the fact that we now have this law in place in our State and are \nnow seeing the results that we are actually stopping felons from \ngetting firearms says to me that these are results that the rest of my \ncolleagues and their States should look at. But we should do U.S. \ncitizens a favor by, as you said, not continuing to have this be done \nState by State, but do it at the Federal level.\n  I ask my colleague from Connecticut how aware he is of this movement \nand how important it is that the American public continue to demand \nthat we deal with this issue.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Let me just respond by giving some statistics about what \nhappened in States with strong background check laws that they require \nfor every gun purchase. We know what the numbers are. This is \nunequivocal; this isn't guesswork or conjecture. We know what they are \nwith universal background check laws and States without them.\n  In States that have universal background check laws, 64 percent fewer \nguns are trafficked out of State. There are 48 percent fewer firearms \nsuicides, 48 percent fewer police officers are killed, and 46 percent \nfewer women are shot to death by intimate partners. That is in States \nthat have universal background checks, and those numbers would be even \nbetter and even stronger if we had that law applied nationally because \nwhat we know is that those intimate partners who are buying a gun in \nthe midst of their fury, those criminals who are trying to traffic in \nillegal arms--all they have to do sometimes is cross a simple State \nline in order to find those weapons of destruction and bring them back \ninto a State that has universal background check laws. So there is no \ndoubt that stronger background check laws lead to fewer gun deaths. \nThat is what the data shows. Washington is proving that, Connecticut is \nproving that, and it is absurd that the U.S. Congress with 90 percent \nof the American public supporting this proposition doesn't assure this \nprotection for everyone who lives under the umbrella of security of \nthis Congress.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I would just say to the Senator from Connecticut--and I \nthank him for his leadership--that we need to come together and \nconsider ways in which to stop gun violence. We need to improve the \nmental health system, and I know people have talked about that this \nevening as well. But I want the Senator from Connecticut to know that \nin the State of Washington we are looking at an additional ballot \ninitiative to prevent gun tragedies involving mental illness. So I \nthink people are going to continue to explore all the ways in which we \ncan make sure that our citizens can become safe, and if it takes that \ninitiative process, I think people are going to see the results. But \nlet's have a vote. Let's at least know where your representative, where \nyour Senator is on these policies that are important.\n  If you are on a terrorist watch list and you can't get on a plane, \nyou shouldn't be able to get a gun. Let's have a good law like this \ngood law that has been enacted in the State of Washington and \nbackground checks that produce results like catching felons and \nstopping them from having access to guns.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut for answering those questions \nand, again, for his leadership tonight on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator from Washington, and I thank her for \nthe work she did to allow the citizens of Washington to pass that \nreferendum. That was a bright spot, and it was a reminder that when you \ntake this question out of the political morass that is Washington, DC, \nand you give it to voters, you give it to citizens, they choose the \nprotections that we are asking for votes on here.\n  I would note that Senator King is still on the floor. There are \nreferendums planned in Maine; there are referendums planned in Nevada. \nThis campaign of citizen-based activism, demanding change in gun laws \nto reflect the overwhelming majority will of the public, is happening. \nIt is inevitable. It is not stopping; it is marching forward. We would \ndo well to listen to that tempest and adopt these measures.\n  I will at this point yield for a question, without losing my right to \nthe floor, to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to appear \ntonight, and I share my praise for my colleague, the Senator from \nConnecticut. We came to the Senate together. His leadership on this \nissue is something I admire, but more than leadership on the issue, I \nadmire his heart and his compassion. He has suffered because his \ncitizens have suffered. And if you suffer and you don't try to change \nthings--if you don't try to do things differently--then you are not \nfully alive. I honor that in the Senator, that he is willing to be \nvulnerable and in his suffering is trying to find help for others.\n  I have a little scar tissue on this issue. I would love to describe \nthe Virginia experience and my own personal experience on this and then \nask a series of questions of my colleague from Connecticut.\n  I was elected to office--to the Richmond City Council--for the first \ntime in May of 1994. At the time I was elected, Richmond had the second \nhighest homicide rate per capita in the United States. I was sworn in \non July 1, 1994.\n  On October 14, 1994--I will never forget that day--in my city council \ndistrict, in a public housing community, Gilpin Court, which is the \nlargest between Washington and Atlanta, a 35-year-old guy walked into \nan apartment and gunned down a family of six, from a 35-year old woman, \nto her younger sister, to tiny little babies and children. I got a call \nas a city council member. I raced to the scene, and it was chaos. That \nhas begun a 22-year experience of being too intimate with this problem. \nThat funeral of the family in the Arthur Ashe Center in Richmond with \n3,000 people and six little white coffins at the front of the room is \nsomething that I will never, ever forget.\n  A number of years later I was Governor of Virginia. I had just taken \na trade mission to Japan and had landed, had checked into the hotel, \nand had fallen asleep. Someone knocked on my door. It was April 16, \n2007, and my security detail said: You have to call home. Something \nhorrible has happened in Virginia, and it is still underway.\n  I called to find that a shooting was still taking place at Virginia \nTech University in Blacksburg that eventually killed 32 people and \ninjured dozens of others. At that point--at that point, it was the \nworst shooting incident in the history of the United States, but no \nlonger. That was the worst day of my life, and it will always be the \nworst day of my life--comforting the families of the victims, talking \nto the first responders who went into a classroom where bodies littered \nthe floor and who heard in the pockets of deceased students and \nprofessors cell phones ringing as parents who had seen it on the news \nwere calling their kids, just knowing they were at Virginia Tech to ask \nthem if they were all right--calls that would never be answered. This \ntraumatized some of the most hardened first responders whom I know. I \nknew priests and ministers in that community who had seen a lot and \nwere traumatized in the days to follow.\n\n  The Senator from Connecticut has a reasonable proposal on the floor \nwith respect to background record checks. The deranged young man who \nhad committed that crime and then killed himself was not supposed to \nget a weapon. He was federally prohibited from getting a weapon because \nhe had been adjudicated to be mentally ill and dangerous, but the \nweaknesses of a background check system--gaps in the background check \nsystem--had created the ability for him to buy this weapon and create \nthis unspeakable carnage.\n  We learned everything we could learn from that tragedy; we fixed what \nwe could fix. To my everlasting regret, I could fix part of the \nbackground record check system, but I went to the legislature and said: \nLet's have universal background checks so this will not happen again. \nEven in the aftermath of the worst shooting tragedy in the United \nStates, I couldn't get my legislature to do the simple thing that the \nvoters, that gun owners, and that NRA members said they should do.\n\n[[Page S3958]]\n\n  Then, a year ago--it was in August of 2015--in the same community, \nthe Blacksburg-Roanoke community in Virginia, a young woman I know who \nwas the TV reporter at WDBJ television, Alison Parker, who covered \nSenator Warner and me--we know her parents--was shooting a live piece \nin the morning about the anniversary of a local chamber of commerce, \nand a mentally ill former employee of the station came up, live on \ntelevision, and videoing himself, killed Alison and Adam Ward, her \ncameraman, and ultimately took his own life later that day.\n  We have scar tissue in my town. We have scar tissue in my \nCommonwealth. We have scar tissue in this country. We have scar tissue \npersonally. And after every one of these instances, we resolved to be \nbetter, and we resolved to do more. Why do we need to be passive? Why \ndo we need to do nothing? We resolved to do better and do more. Yet \nhere in this body, we can't.\n  We were together here, my colleague from Connecticut and I. I talked \nabout the worst day of my life at Blacksburg, but the worst day in the \nSenate was standing here on the floor in April of 2013 and having a \ndebate about this very piece of legislation about background record \nchecks, and we were surrounded in the gallery by the victims and the \nfamilies from Newtown, and they were watching us. There is a line in \nthe Letter to the Hebrews that talks about being surrounded by a great \ncloud of witnesses, and we were surrounded by a great cloud of \nwitnesses. With them were Virginia Tech families, and they were \ntogether, and they were watching us, and they were praying, I know, for \nus to do the right thing. Yet, even with the family members who had \nsuffered from the State of Senator Murphy and Senator Blumenthal, even \nwith those family members hoping we would do the right thing, we \ncouldn't get there.\n  As surely as night follows day, there have been other tragedies. And \nnow--something I hoped would never happen--a shooting tragedy has \neclipsed even the horrific tragedy in Blacksburg in 2007.\n  So the question that has to be asked is, What will it take and when \nwill we act?\n  So I would ask the Senator a series of questions because I am not \njust grappling with this as a legislator; I am grappling with this as a \nperson, as a parent, as a friend, as somebody who has scar tissue.\n  I have an organization, the National Rifle Association, that is \nheadquartered in my State and that says we can't do anything because of \nthe Second Amendment.\n  Let me ask a couple of questions of my colleague. The Senator would \nagree with me, would he not, that the Second Amendment is in the \nConstitution, so of course it is important. It is important, as the \nFirst Amendment is important, wouldn't the Senator agree with me on \nthat?\n  Mr. MURPHY. It is in there for a reason.\n  Mr. KAINE. It is in there for a reason. And it has been in there \nsince 1787, and Virginians were the drafters. So it is in there for a \nreason, and it is important, just like the First Amendment.\n  Let me ask the Senator about the First Amendment. The First Amendment \nsays there is a right to free speech and a right to freedom of the \npress. Does that mean that constitutionally I can go out and slander \nand libel anyone, and there is no consequence for that? Is that what \nthe First Amendment means?\n  Mr. MURPHY. The First Amendment is as important as the Second \nAmendment, but it comes with conditions and responsibilities. One of \nthem is that you can't slander your fellow citizens. You can't yell \n``fire'' in a crowded theater. There have been important limitations \nsince the beginning of the Republic built around the First Amendment \nwhich, frankly, are as sacred as any of the individual rights that are \nencompassed in the Bill of Rights.\n  Mr. KAINE. There is another part of the First Amendment that says you \nhave a right to assemble.\n  My understanding--and the Senator is a lawyer, so he can tell me if I \nam wrong about the right to assemble. You have a right to assemble, but \na government can condition that. It can say you have to get a permit or \nyou can assemble here, not there. It cannot discriminate among points \nof view, but the common constitutional provision is that there can be \nreasonable restrictions on the time, place, and manner of assembly \nunder the First Amendment, and that is completely constitutional. Is \nthat the Senator's understanding of the clause?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Another qualified right of the Bill of Rights.\n  Mr. KAINE. I can do the same thing on the Third Amendment, and I can \ndo the same thing on the Fourth Amendment, and I can do the same thing \non the Sixth Amendment and the Seventh amendment, the right to trial by \njury in civil matters. And each of these rights are important just as \nthe Second Amendment is important, and in each of these rights we \ncommonly accept--actually, we demand, not just accept--that consistent \nwith constitutional rights there be reasonable limits so that we can \nlive together in peaceable harmony as citizens.\n  Would the Senator agree with me that there is nothing about those \nreasonable restrictions in the First or the Second or the Third or the \nFourth or the Sixth or the Seventh Amendments that is at all \ninconsistent with the constitutional framework that we take an oath to \nuphold when we come into this body?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I haven't memorized portions of the Constitution as well \nas Senator King has, but he very eloquently stated for us the preamble \nof the Constitution, which commits us first and foremost to preserve \ndomestic tranquility and to protect the common defense. So at the very \nbeginning of the Constitution is this obligation to take the issue of \npublic safety as a sacred duty upon inheriting the mantle of preserving \nand defending the Constitution.\n  So, as he has stated, all of those rights in the Bill of Rights come \nwith conditions and responsibilities demanded by the American people, \nand when we talk about the Second Amendment, it is educated by that \nvery important preamble which commands all of us to do whatever is \nnecessary to protect the safety of our citizens.\n  Mr. KAINE. Am I not right that the Second Amendment even has the \nphrase ``well regulated'' in it and even acknowledges the notion that \nthis particular right is one where regulation is contemplated?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Whereas the First Amendment doesn't place the condition \ninto the text--they are read into it--the Second Amendment has \nconditions in the literal text.\n  Mr. KAINE. So the organization in Virginia that makes this argument \nabout the Second Amendment--I think we can clearly demonstrate it is \nspecious.\n  The Second Amendment is critically important. We all take an oath to \nuphold it, and we do uphold it, but there is nothing inconsistent with \nthe Second Amendment in terms of the provisions you are talking about \non the floor.\n  Let me ask you this. Here is an argument they make, and I hear them \nmake this all the time: What these guys who are advocating these \npropositions want to do is they want to take away all of your guns.\n  You were in the House a while before I got here. To your \nrecollection, has there ever been, in your time here, a proposal that \nhas been put in place in Congress to take away the guns of American \ncitizens?\n  Mr. MURPHY. It is a wonderful subtext to all of the rhetoric that \ncomes from the gun lobby and the NRA that there is this secret agenda \nto essentially get the camel's nose under the tent through an expansion \nof background checks or a restriction on individuals who are on the \nterrorist watch list as far as buying guns, because the ultimate goal \nis to eventually parachute into people's homes and take away all of \ntheir weapons--gun confiscation.\n  Of course, that is a mythology that has been created by the gun lobby \nin order to sell more weapons and in order to make people scared of \ntheir government so they have to arm themselves. There is no logic to \nit.\n  As you state in reference to your question, there has never been a \nproposal before the U.S. Congress to engage in any of the widespread \nconfiscation efforts that have been imagined out of thin air by these \nadvocacy organizations.\n  Mr. KAINE. I thought that was the case. I am a gun owner, I am a \nsupporter of the Second Amendment, and I\n\n[[Page S3959]]\n\nhave been unaware of this body or any State legislature putting in a \nproposal to take away folks' guns, as advocates would suggest.\n  Let me ask the Senator this one. Here is a position this organization \nused to advocate all the time: We don't want to have things that \nrestrict law-abiding citizens; we just want to keep guns out of the \nhands of the bad guys.\n  For a very long time, that was the NRA's position--don't restrict \nlaw-abiding citizens; keep guns out of the hands of bad guys. As far as \nyou know, is there any way to enforce the existing laws and keep the \nguns out of the hands of the bad guys pursuant to the Federal laws that \nhave been in place for a very long time and that prohibit nine \ncategories of people from owning weapons? Is there any way to do that \njob and keep the guns out of the hands of the bad guys without a \ncomprehensive background record check so that somebody who is selling \ncan determine whether somebody who is buying is a bad guy?\n  Mr. MURPHY. When we passed the background checks law initially, I say \nto Senator Kaine, it was pretty good at keeping guns out of the hands \nof bad guys because at that time the vast majority of gun sales \noccurred in brick-and-mortar gun stores. But what has happened, as you \nknow, is that sales of guns have transferred from brick-and-mortar \nstores to online sales and to sales in gun shows. Because the law has \nnot caught up, there are quite literally thousands of criminals and \nconvicts and felons who are now walking into gun stores are just typing \nin armslist.com online and buying guns with no background check because \nthe law has not kept up.\n  So if you are truly sincere about stopping the bad guys from getting \nthe guns, then by definition you have to expand the number of sales \nthat are subject to background checks to those that are happening in 40 \npercent of the sales, which occur now online and in gun shows--never \nmind the fact that the baddest of the guys are probably the ones who \nhave had known connections and communications with terrorist groups and \nwho are not on that list today of those who are prohibited from buying \nguns.\n  Mr. KAINE. May I ask the Senator this since we have started to talk \nabout this question. Has anybody come up to you and said: Hey, people \non the terrorist watch list--we just shouldn't be worried about them. \nWhy would we worry about people on the terrorist watch list?\n  Have they tried to argue that those are good guys?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Quite the opposite. They would rise to the highest level \nof concern for most of our constituents.\n  Mr. KAINE. Here is where I am puzzled. For an organization that says \nthat they are about the Second Amendment, they advocate a position that \nhas no support in the Second Amendment. An organization that shakes \ntheir fists and says we are trying to take their guns away--that has no \nbasis because there are no such provisions that are on the floor and \nthat have been introduced. An organization that says they want to keep \nguns out of the hands of bad guys--the only way to do that is to have a \nbackground record check. So doesn't it seem like the organization's \nprinciples are really--well, let's start with this: It seems to me they \nare at odds with the point of view of not only most Americans but also \nmost gun owners. Most gun owners support the commonsense provisions \nthat you are describing on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I assume you have gun clubs in Virginia, just as we have \nthem in Connecticut.\n  Mr. KAINE. Absolutely.\n  Mr. MURPHY. If you walk into a gun club in Connecticut, there is \ngoing to be pretty solid consensus that criminals shouldn't buy guns. \nAnd those law-abiding gun owners who sit in those gun clubs on \nSaturdays and Sundays have absolutely no problem with sales online or \nsales at gun shows being subject to background checks because they have \ngone through background check. They know that on average a background \ncheck takes less than 10 minutes. They know that it is nothing more \nthan a 9-minute, on average, inconvenience for someone who is buying a \ngun, and they support it further. Frankly, those guys in the gun clubs \nare amongst the loudest in their concern that terrorists have the \nability today to buy dangerous weapons and commit mass murder like we \nsaw in Orlando.\n  So this consensus that exists out there in the American public is not \na consensus amongst progressive Democrats; it is a consensus amongst \ngun owners, non-gun owners, Democrats, Republicans, moms, dads, \nconservatives, liberals, Georgia, Connecticut, California. There isn't \na cross-section of the American public that doesn't support keeping bad \nguys from getting guns and thus the two reforms we are asking for here \ntoday--a law that prohibits people on the terrorist watch list from \ngetting guns and a law that expands background checks to all of the \nforms in which guns are sold today.\n  Mr. KAINE. I would go one further. Not only is it consistent with \nwhat the American public wants in virtually any ZIP Code in this \ncountry, I think the notion of keeping guns out of the hands of bad \nguys, which for a long time has been the stated principle of the \nNational Rifle Association--I think that is in accord with the opinions \nof the members of the National Rifle Association. As I have seen \npolling by NRA members, the members of the organization overwhelmingly \nsupport background record checks because they want to keep guns out of \nthe hands of bad guys.\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Senator Kaine, they support it. NRA members support it at \nthe exact same rate that non-gun owners and non-NRA members support it. \nIn fact, NRA members, frankly, have been historically those who have \nbeen most supportive of provisions that would prevent guns from getting \ninto the hands of criminals because by and large NRA members are law-\nabiding gun owners. Historically, they have had some of the greatest \nconcern about this, which is why it is so hard to understand this \ndisconnect between where their members are, where gun owners are, and \nwhere the advocacy organization is.\n  Mr. KAINE. That is talking about outside this building. How about the \ndisconnect between what our citizens, gun owners, and NRA members want \nand expect us to do and the complete lack of action and, frankly, \ncounterproductive action.\n  Let's talk about that. Congress has given gun manufacturers a unique \nform of liability protection that virtually nobody else in this country \ngets. We have put a number of restrictions in place to stop research \ninto causes of gun violence, to stop the ability to trace weapons in \ngun violence. These are not only not doing the right thing but doing \nthe wrong thing in the sense of the thing that seems completely \ncontrary to the wishes of the constituents who send us here to \nrepresent them.\n  Mr. MURPHY. When you present these issues to the American public, \nthey scratch their heads, or they scratch their heads because they \nassume already that individuals on the terrorist watch list cannot buy \nguns. They think it is absurd that we passed a law that subjects toy \nguns to a greater standard of negligence than real guns. I mean, that \nis what that law effectively did. That law said that if you sell a toy \ngun, then you are going to be subject to a higher standard of \nnegligence if that gun misperforms than a gun company is going to be \nheld to if its gun--its real gun--misfires. When you explain that to \nsomebody in your State, whether you are in a red State or a blue State, \nthey scratch their heads. It doesn't make sense to them.\n  Mr. KAINE. Finally, Senator, if I could do this, I know as part of \nstanding on this floor, you are not standing here over words in draft \nlegislation, you are standing here because of people. I sat with you, \nand we talked about people in your community who had been affected. I \nwould love to tell you the story about just one Virginian, if I could, \nand then I would love to have you comment on the story I am going to \ntell you. I could tell a lot of stories about a lot of different \npeople, but one just epitomizes to me so plainly this challenge, and it \nis a story of a man named Liviu Lebrescu.\n  Liviu Lebrescu was one of the people who were killed at Virginia \nTech. He was a professor of aerospace engineering. He was an amazing \nprofessor. On April 16, 2007, when Seung-Hui Cho came into Norris Hall \nand started shooting people, he stood in front of\n\n[[Page S3960]]\n\nthe door and told his engineering students to try to get out of the \nwindow so that they would be safe. He blocked the door, and Seung-Hui \nCho was shooting bullets through the door. He kept saying: Hurry, \nhurry, hurry. Until the last breath he took, he told students to hurry. \nEveryone in his class got out the window except one other student, \nMinal Panchal, who stayed behind and encouraged others to go ahead of \nthem.\n  Professor Lebrescu was one of the 32 killed that day. Here is the \namazing thing about Liviu Lebrescu that I just find myself continuing \nto contemplate. Liviu Lebrescu was 76 years old. He was born in the \n1930s as a Jew in Romania. When Hitler and the Nazis started to sweep \nacross Europe, he and his family were put into labor camps and \nconcentration camps. But this amazing survivor, who was a young boy and \na teenager, survived the Holocaust. Most of his family was killed. He \nsurvived the Holocaust, and he was a teenager with a lot of his family \ngone. A lot of people who had been through that experience in Romania \ndecided to leave, they were so shattered, but he said: This is my home. \nMy family is gone. This is my home. I am going to stay in Romania.\n  Then the Soviet Union took over Romania, and they asked that he \nrenounce his Judaism, and he wouldn't do it. Then they asked that he \npledge allegiance to the Communist Party, and he wouldn't do it.\n  He had gotten a Ph.D., and he was a well-recognized engineer, but \nsuddenly, first, he couldn't travel to go to academic conferences, and \nthen second, he was going to lose his job.\n  This Holocaust survivor had to live under Soviet communism and be \npersecuted, but he wouldn't give up his faith, and he wouldn't give up \nhis moral integrity. He kept trying for a better life.\n  Finally, in 1977, when he was past 40, he was allowed to immigrate to \nIsrael, and he moved to Israel. That had been his dream. And he was a \nteacher in Israel.\n  In 1985, he got a 1-year teaching fellowship at Virginia Tech in \nBlacksburg to teach engineering. He came in 1985 for a 1-year \nfellowship, and he kept renewing it year after year after year because \nhe found in Virginia, he found in America, he found in Blacksburg a \ncommunity that he loved and a community that he cared about.\n  So somebody who survived a holocaust of the Nazis and who survived \nthe Soviet oppression of his native land couldn't survive the holocaust \nof gun violence in this country.\n  There is one more thing about Liviu Lebrescu. It is about the day he \nwas killed because it was a very different day for him than it was for \nhis students. It was a Monday. It was April 16, 2007. That day was a \nspecial day in the Jewish faith for somebody who was Jewish. It was Yom \nHaShoah from sundown on April 15, 2007, until sundown on April 16. It \nis the day to remember the Holocaust. For Jews worldwide and people who \ncare about Judaism worldwide, it is a day to remember the Holocaust.\n  When you remember the Holocaust, well, it is one thing to reflect \nupon it, but it is another thing to reflect upon it as a Holocaust \nsurvivor. What you reflect upon is the perpetrators and the gravity of \nthe tragedy that they perpetrated. You reflect upon the victims who \nlost their lives, and you reflect upon the survivors. You reflect upon \nthe heroes, and you also reflect upon the bystanders.\n  So while the students who went into that class on the morning of \nApril 16 weren't thinking about Yom HaShoah, Liviu Lebrescu was.\n  I have to believe that when that shooting started on that day where \nhe was thinking about what he had been through, then he was faced with \nan existential--am I going to be perpetrator? Am I going to be a \nvictim? Am I going to be a survivor? Am I going to be a bystander? Am I \ngoing to be a hero? He chose to be a hero, and he lost his life. He \nchose to be a hero, and he lost his life.\n  Would I do that? Would I stand in front of a door, block it, take \nbullets, and tell my students to get out the window? Would I do that? I \ncannot honestly stand here and say that I would. I can't say that I \nwould have the courage of Liviu Lebrescu. He was a hero. I can't say I \nwould be a hero.\n  But in this body, we don't have to be heroes; we just have to not be \nbystanders. We have been bystanders in this body. We have been \nbystanders in this Nation as this carnage of gun violence has gone from \none tragedy to the next. To cast a vote, that is not heroic. To stand \nup and say, ``We can be safer tomorrow. We can protect people's \nlives,'' that is not heroic. That is just saying I will not be a \nbystander. And that is all we have to do--stop being bystanders.\n\n  Mr. President, I would just ask my colleague from Connecticut if he \nhas any close on that, and I appreciate the chance to engage in this \ndialogue with him.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator from Virginia. That is as compelling \na case as can be made.\n  Before I yield the floor for a question from Senator Blumenthal, who \nhas been here with me and Senator Booker for every one of the now 12 \nhours we have been standing here, I want to put that challenge to stop \nbeing a bystander to the body in very personal terms. This, for Senator \nBlumenthal and me, is rooted in our history as well.\n  I was not more than 30 days from my election to the Senate--a \ncelebratory moment in my life--when I was sitting on a train platform, \nwaiting to go to New York City with my then-4-year-old and 1-year-old \nto see the Christmas lights, when I got the call about the shooting at \nSandy Hook, and Senator Blumenthal and I were there hours later. And \nthere are certainly days when I wish I wasn't there and I didn't \nwitness the things I saw and connect with the tragedy that was \nevidenced that day. But our challenge from those families is to stop \nbeing bystanders, and there are similar stories of heroism that maybe I \nwill get the chance to tell later tonight from inside those classrooms, \nbut a letter I keep with me is from a mother whose child survived Sandy \nHook.\n  So let me just read an excerpt from it before yielding the floor to \nSenator Blumenthal, to make this challenge real from a mom who thinks \nabout this every day. She said:\n\n       In addition to the tragic loss of her playmates, friends \n     and teachers, my first grader suffers from PTSD. She was in \n     the first room by the entrance to the school. Her teacher was \n     able to gather the children into a tiny bathroom inside the \n     classroom. There she stood with 14 of her classmates and her \n     teacher, all of them crying.\n       You see, she heard what was happening on the other side of \n     the wall. She heard everything. She was sure she was going to \n     die that day. She didn't want to die for Christmas.\n       Imagine what that must have been like. She struggles \n     nightly with nightmares, difficulty falling asleep, and being \n     afraid to go anywhere in her own home. At school, she becomes \n     withdrawn--crying daily, covering her ears when it gets too \n     loud, and waiting for this to happen again. She is six, and \n     we are furious.\n\n  I want to read the rest of this to challenge us to stop being \nbystanders.\n\n       [We are] furious that 26 families must suffer with grief so \n     deep and so wide that it is unimaginable. Furious that the \n     innocence and safety of my children's lives has been taken. \n     Furious that someone had access to the type of weapon used in \n     this massacre. Furious that gun makers make ammunition with \n     such high rounds, and our government does nothing to stop \n     them. Furious that the ban on assault weapons was carelessly \n     left to expire. Furious that lawmakers let the gun lobbyists \n     have so much control. Furious that somehow someone's right to \n     own a gun is more important than my child's right to life. \n     Furious that lawmakers are too scared to take a stand.\n\n  This mother of a child who survived one of those Sandy Hook \nclassrooms finishes by saying:\n\n       I ask you to think about your choices. Look at the pictures \n     of the 26 innocent lives taken so needlessly and wastefully, \n     using a weapon that never should have been in the hands of \n     civilians. Really think. Changing the laws may inconvenience \n     some gun owners, but it may also save a life--perhaps a life \n     that is dear to me or you.\n       Are you willing to risk it? You have a responsibility and \n     an obligation to act now and to change the laws. I hope and I \n     pray that you do not fail.\n\n  This was written by the mother of a girl who survived the massacre at \nSandy Hook.\n  I yield to my colleague from Connecticut--who has been here with me \nand Senator Booker since the beginning, 12 hours ago--for a question, \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Thank you. And I will ask a question of my colleague \nand friend from Connecticut, but first I want to thank all my \ncolleagues who\n\n[[Page S3961]]\n\nhave been here over these 12 hours off and on, speaking so powerfully, \nas our friend from Virginia just did about his experience.\n  Every one of us has this kind of experience that brings us here and \nbinds us together in this cause because we have seen the flesh and \nblood and emotional impacts. And I want to read a letter also from a \nNewtown survivor--another. I read one earlier. This is from someone who \nlived through Newtown and wrote me after Orlando, and she said:\n\n       As a Newtown teacher who was in lockdown at the Middle \n     School on 12/14, this work is particularly important to me. \n     That could just have easily been my classroom, and I find it \n     abhorrent that we have chosen as a nation to be complacent in \n     the face of mass shootings. It is incumbent upon us, our \n     elected officials to enact meaningful change in order to save \n     lives.\n\n  I urge and implore citizens around the country, people who are \nwatching this proceeding, who are listening to the powerful words of my \ncolleagues--most especially Senator Murphy--to let us know that you \nhear us, and equally important to let the other side of the aisle know, \nwhich right now is vacant--completely empty. This side is full, the \nother side is empty. Let them hear how you feel, the same way this \nteacher who lives in Trumbull, CT, let me know how she feels.\n  There is a lot of talk these days in our politics about the need for \nchange--on the Presidential campaign, in the Senate campaigns, at every \nlevel of our elected process. Politicians are telling people they will \nchange things in Washington. Well, we can give people change in our \nlaws, in our enforcement practices, in our culture. It all has to \nchange for lives to be saved. It isn't only new laws, there has to be \nmore resources for the enforcement of that law.\n\n  The background check is actually an enforcement tool. Expanding that \ncheck gives law enforcement the ability to stop people already \nprohibited by law from buying guns. The terrorist watch list and the \nAttorney General's discretion based on evidence to stop people engaged \nor preparing for terrorism to be barred from buying guns is an \nenforcement tool. It protects people. So people should demand changes \nnot just in the abstract and in general terms but in the way we deal \nwith guns.\n  This day has been enormously meaningful because of the reaction it \nhas provoked across the country in our offices, the phones that have \nrung, the tweets that have emanated, and the messages we have received \nin every form, but it must be followed by action. In this Chamber we \nhear words. This place is filled with words. It is what we do in this \nplace--we talk. But actions speak louder than words. Now is the time \nfor action. Enough is enough.\n  Give us the votes. Give us the votes on these amendments. Let us \nvote. That is the reason we are here. Let us act to fulfill the \nexpectations and the wishes of the American people who are begging for \nus to take meaningful action. We need to do our job. That is our job--\nto act and to protect the American people.\n  I would ask my colleague from Connecticut whether he believes we can \nreach a resolution here that will permit us to act, whether reasonable \nminds can come together, whether we can forge consensus involving the \nother side of the aisle, whether we can bridge the partisan gaps and \ncome together in a meaningful way--as we have done on veterans issues, \non immigration reform, and on other issues, where we may not have \ncrossed the finish line in the House of Representatives but, in the \npast, we have succeeded in bridging our differences. Is that possible?\n  I want to hear from the American people that they think it is not \nonly possible but necessary, and it is our job.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for that question, and I guess we \nboth agree that of course it has to be possible. There just aren't many \nmoments in which the American public is so resolute in their belief \nthat we should do something and this place is so resolute in its belief \nit should stay on the outside of consensus. There just aren't many \nissues where the American public has decided at a 90-percent rate that \nwe should act and we refuse to do so.\n  So my belief is, democracy doesn't allow for this condition to \npersist for very long, but I will be honest with my colleague. The \nburden is not so much on us. The burden is on our Republican friends to \ncome to the table with proposals that mirror those that are supported \nby the American public.\n  Today, the proposals we are asking for votes on enjoy the support of \n90 percent of Americans--increasing the range of background checks and \nmaking sure terrorists don't get weapons. So given the fact the \nAmerican public supports our position, frankly, it would be \nirresponsible of us to agree to something that is an abandonment of \nthose fundamental beliefs on behalf of Americans.\n  Our frustration is that we have had lots of time to work out a \ncompromise. It was 6 months ago when we last had a vote on the issue of \nterrorist access to weapons, and we still have not had any effort, any \noutreach from the Republican side of the aisle, to try and find common \nground. So the answer is, of course, yes, we can find that common \nground, but there has to be another party to work with.\n  I would commend my Republican friends to take a look at the language \nSenator Feinstein filed today. It is not her original bill that was 18 \npages long. The bill she filed today is a simple bill of about 2 to 3 \npages, which simply gives to the Attorney General the ability to put a \nsystem in place whereby individuals who have demonstrable connections \nto terrorist organizations cannot buy weapons and a clear exit ramp for \nindividuals who are on that list wrongly to be able to purchase \nfirearms.\n  So I think that amendment has addressed the concerns Republicans have \nraised, and I hope, if we can get an agreement to bring that amendment \nto a vote, they will see it as that consensus product and allow us to \nadopt it.\n  I thank Senator Donnelly again for joining us, and I yield to the \nSenator from Indiana for a question without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. I have a question for the Senator from Connecticut, and \nit is, Is this vote as simple as it appears?\n  We are all moms and dads--all of us in the Senate and the Gallery--\nmany of us, all of us, and these 49 beloved people in Orlando all had \nmoms and dads who today are absolutely crushed. The unthinkable has \noccurred, the same as at Virginia Tech, in my colleague's State, the \nsame as at Charleston, the same as the little children from Newtown, \nCT, in the home State of my two colleagues here. As I said, every one \nof these is a precious child.\n  Is there any mom or dad anywhere on this floor or in our Senate who, \nwhen you look at this, wouldn't say: We can avoid this, these \ntragedies, by saying someone on the terrorist threat list shouldn't be \nable to buy a gun or that we expand background checks to online sales \nor gun shows so they are just the same as if you buy them at the local \nstore in town? These two bipartisan proposals are what we are talking \nabout.\n  My question is, Are these as simple as they appear? And why on earth \nnot only would any mom or dad be against them but anyone on the Senate \nfloor?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I think this is a wonderfully simple question which a lot \nof people are probably asking: What is the problem? Is there a catch? \nWhy isn't there consensus? The simple answer is that there is no catch, \nand there is no secret agenda. There is no alternative story line. This \nis about saying that if you are on the terrorist watch list, you \nshouldn't buy a gun, period, stop. And if you want to buy a gun in a \ncommercial sale, you should prove that you are not a criminal first, \nperiod, stop. Those are the only two things that we are asking for a \ndebate and a vote on--no secret agenda, no hidden prefaces. That is it.\n  I thank Senator Donnelly, and I yield to my great friend who has been \nwith us for a majority of the evening here on the floor. He has not yet \nposed a question. I yield to my friend from Hawaii for a question \nwithout losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I thank the Senator from Connecticut and the senior \nSenator from Connecticut for their leadership. Before I ask my \nquestion, I want to read something I received just about a half hour \nago from a constituent:\n\n       Dear Senator Schatz, I am following the filibuster online \n     and though I know you don't need more convincing about what \n     we\n\n[[Page S3962]]\n\n     need to do, I thought to reach out to you anyway. Like many \n     Americans I felt so paralyzed since Sunday's shooting in \n     Orlando. On Sunday afternoon I brought my 4-year-old to the \n     [University of Hawaii] campus for a film screening and I \n     found myself, for the very first time, strategizing about \n     where to sit and what I would do if there was an active \n     shooter and how I could best cover my son's body if we \n     couldn't escape. I am not an anxious person by nature but I \n     refuse to accept that powerlessness to gun violence must be \n     our accepted ``new normal.'' I work diligently at my job and \n     as a mom to care for my own kids and the community of \n     students I work with and am intentional in trying to create \n     opportunities for their growth and learning. So it seems \n     completely insane that in 2016 we have nothing more inspiring \n     to offer a nation of families other than hoping that loved \n     ones are not ``in the wrong place at the wrong time.'' That \n     is totally unacceptable to me and I am willing to help with \n     any community or national efforts to bring about necessary \n     change. . . . I have personally sent postcards . . . to every \n     Senator who voted against background checks. Please let your \n     supporters in Hawaii know what we need to do. I will show up. \n     #notonemore\n       Your constituent, Vanessa Ito.\n\n  I really want to thank Senator Murphy for his leadership in this. \nThis is really moral leadership. I was in the Presiding Officer's \nchair. Both Senator Murphy and I were new to the Senate under very, \nvery different circumstances, in a lot of ways both tragic \ncircumstances. But I was in the chair and Chris Murphy gave his maiden \nspeech. He was my friend. We had sort of just met and become fast \nfriends. The first speech he gave was on this topic, and I understood \nhis personal passion. But what he is doing now is bigger than that. He \nhas displayed physical courage, emotional courage, and political \ncourage that I think we couldn't imagine even at the beginning of the \nweek. And even though all of us are committed to this issue, he shocked \nour conscience in that caucus room and laid down a marker for all of us \nto do better and to do more.\n  I just want to say one thing before I go into a sort of preamble to \nmy question, and that is this: My instinct about this is that our \npolitical opponents absolutely rely upon our being despondent. I think \nthey absolutely rely upon the idea that we will give up by the end of \nthe week--that we get our memo that this week is the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, next week is the Commerce-Justice-Science \nappropriations measure, and every week it is a different topic. Donald \nTrump will say something and distract the national media, and everybody \nwill move on.\n  But here is why I am so hopeful about what has happened today. It is \nnot just that we have a bunch of Members of the Senate on the floor \npretty late at night. It is very difficult to get any of us together \nfor anything other than lunch--for anything--and yet here we are. \nSenator Murphy did some recruiting through staff and everything else, \nbut this was organic. We saw what was happening, and we wanted to offer \nour moral support--and not, frankly, to him as a friend and a colleague \nbut to everybody across the country who deserves people who are going \nto fight on this issue.\n  The other really exciting thing that is happening is outside of the \nSenate, and that is more important. The gallery doesn't usually get \nmore and more crowded through the day. People visit, people do their \nCapitol tour, and they come and check out the gallery--and we are \nyammering at each other or we are voting and we are shuffling around--\nand then they leave. But what is happening in the gallery physically is \nthat people are actually coming to see that something meaningful has \nhappened. Senator Murphy's phone lines are ringing off the hook. Chris \nMurphy himself is the No. 1 trending topic on Facebook. And it is not \nabout Chris Murphy. It is about the sense that maybe we can actually do \nsomething here. Maybe we can actually do something here.\n  So for all of the people who are watching this online or observing it \non Twitter or hearing about it for the first time, I want people to \nunderstand that this is the continuation of a movement, but this is an \ninflection point. This is a point at which we are not going to accept \nthat if 90 percent of the public is demanding that we take action, the \nSenate and the House won't. That is unacceptable to me.\n  Since I got to the Senate alone, there have been nearly 1,000 mass \nshootings. That is not 1,000 people killed. That is 1,000 mass \nshootings. Over 40,000 Americans have been killed by guns, and there \nare zero changes to our gun laws. The shooting in Orlando was the worst \nmass shooting event that our Nation has ever seen in one night--49 \npeople killed and 53 shot and injured. Those numbers are shocking, but \nhere is what I think is even more shocking--and Senator Booker \nmentioned this both in public and in private: Since then, more than \nthat many people have been killed as a result of gun violence. This \nhappens all of the time.\n\n  Now, the Orlando situation was uniquely shocking because of the \npublic dimension, because of the homophobia, because of the awful, \ngraphic, shocking violence in one place at one time for one purpose--to \nstrike terror in people's hearts and to strike terror in the hearts of \npeople who are gay. So that was uniquely shocking. But in terms of the \nnumber of people killed, this was actually pretty similar to any other \nday in the United States.\n  So my first question for Senator Murphy is--you haven't taken a \nbreak, you haven't had a meal, you haven't been able to interact with \nyour son or your wife except in the gallery and at your podium. I guess \nmy question for you is this: Do you feel momentum now? Do you feel \nmomentum now?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for that question, and I appreciate \nyour talking about how this happened organically. We didn't decide to \ndo this until this morning. We certainly had been talking about the \nneed to show that we were sick and tired of the normal trajectory of \nthoughts and prayers being sent out and then a dissipation into \nnothingness, as is the trend line after these tragedies. We knew we had \nto do something different. But what is wonderful about this is that \nmuch of this is organic. This is now a dozen colleagues who are on the \nfloor at close to midnight this evening, and the gallery is increasing \nin numbers at this very time. I think the last I saw, 100,000 people \nwere talking about this right now on Twitter. It has been the top \ntrending topic all day long. Thousands of calls are coming in to our \noffice. I hope this is a moment in which we all get to remind ourselves \nthat this change will not happen without vigilance--that it is not just \ngoing to be this moment. It is going to have to be repeated moments in \nwhich we engage the consciousness of this Nation.\n  So I do feel momentum here. We are hopeful we will be able to proceed \nto at least votes on these measures so we can show the American public \nwhere everybody is. If we don't win those votes, we will live to fight \nanother day. But these are galvanizing moments, and it is heartwarming \nto know that there are so many colleagues who have stepped up to the \nplate to take part.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I would like to ask \na question specifically about the terrorist gun loophole. It seems \nobviously straightforward to everyone that we would want to prevent \nterrorists from getting guns, and yet we can't get the other side of \nthe aisle to even show up, let alone to vote to close this loophole. As \nwe know, last year 53 Senate Republicans voted against closing the \nterrorist gun loophole that allows known or suspected terrorists to get \nguns. They had several excuses. But I kind of want to go through the \nmain complaint, and that is that there was not enough due process for \nthese individuals. That is just plain false. There are several layers \nof due process, starting with the procedures that are available to \nanyone who does not pass a background check when trying to buy a gun. \nAnyone denied a firearm transfer has the right to find out the reason \nfor the denial, submit correcting information to the Attorney General, \nand even bring a civil action against the government.\n  The bill that Senator Feinstein has introduced--of which I think \nevery Member of the Democratic conference is a cosponsor--provides \nadditional due process. A person denied a firearm transfer because he \nor she was determined to be a known or suspected terrorist can \nchallenge the determination in court. According to the FBI:\n\n       A range of quality control measures are used to ensure that \n     the Terrorist Screening Database contains accurate and timely \n     information. This includes regular reviews, periodic audits, \n     and post-encounter reviews conducted by the Terrorist \n     Screening Center\n\n[[Page S3963]]\n\n     and the agencies that nominated the record to ensure the \n     information continues to satisfy the applicable criteria for \n     inclusion.\n\n  Just yesterday, the majority leader stated the obvious--that nobody \nwants terrorists to have firearms. But what is really being proposed? \nThe bill being proposed by Senator Cornyn--a very skilled and good \nlegislator--is just not viable. The Republicans who would vote for this \nbill over Senator Feinstein's proposed legislation would keep the \nloophole wide open, because this bill is unworkable. It will require \nlaw enforcement officials to prove to a court that a gun buyer has \nalready committed an act of terrorism instead of stopping likely \nterrorists ahead of time. Or the government would have to prove to a \ncourt that there is probable cause that a gun buyer will commit an act \nof terrorism.\n  So in order to stop somebody from buying a gun, you have to show that \nthis person is going to commit an act of terrorism. Now, I am not the \nlawyer--and I am looking around and seeing a number of lawyers on the \nfloor. But my instinct is if you have probable cause that someone is \nabout to commit an act of terrorism, you don't allow a database to be \npinged and say: I'm sorry, sir; we can't give you your gun today. You \nwould arrest that person. You would detain that person.\n  So my question for Senator Murphy is first about this proposal from \nSenator Cornyn, and whether you think it would be workable. And then, \nif you wouldn't mind fleshing out--even if we are able to solve this \nso-called terror gap issue, if you would talk about straw purchases and \nthe gun show loophole and how we have to be complete in our strategy--\nthat even if we solve this problem legislatively, there are gaping \nholes in our security when it comes to this issue. I would like you to \ntalk us through how all of these issues work together. Because one \nthing I know about Senator Murphy is that he is deadly serious about \nactually solving this problem. You don't want to run on this problem. \nYou don't want to tweet on this problem. You want to actually fix it \nbecause you feel it in your gut.\n  (Mrs. CAPITO assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator for bringing up this bogeyman issue \nthat continues to come up about due process. Let's first be clear that \nthere is a double standard here. There is not a single Member of the \nRepublican majority who decries the lack of due process when it comes \nto individuals who are denied the right to fly because of their \ninclusion on this list. Nobody stands up and says that there isn't the \nability to grieve the fact that you are on the list of those \nindividuals who are prohibited to fly. Yet there is some special \nconsideration that is supposed to be given to an individual who is \ndeemed to have an association with a terrorist group who wants to buy \nan assault weapon. It would seem almost the opposite. Maybe that \nindividual should be given extra consideration.\n  Of course, this idea that has been proffered in the Cornyn amendment \nthat we voted on in December is laughable. It is not a serious attempt \nto solve this problem in that it would provide for a court \ndetermination and a court process before anybody on that list would be \ndenied a firearm. That individual would have to walk into a gun store. \nThe gun store would say, no, you have been flagged by the Department of \nJustice, and we are going to call them to see if they would like to \ntake you to court over the next 72 hours in a process that no one knows \nwhat it would look like. There would be potential discovery, the \nability to rebut the claim that you were a terrorist. It would be a \nlaughingstock, a mockery of the judicial process.\n  I think those who have supported the amendment probably know that. \nThey are voting for it so they can claim that they supported something \nother than the piece of legislation that the majority of Americans \nsupport, which is the simple addition to the list of those who are \nprohibited from buying weapons of individuals who are on the terrorist \nno-fly list.\n  I will state very quickly as to your second question, yes, of course, \nif you are serious about solving this problem, you can't just put those \nindividuals on the no-fly list, on the list of those who are prohibited \nfrom buying weapons. You actually have to also close that loophole that \nallows for thousands upon thousands of gun sales to occur at gun shows \nand online because a terrorist or a would-be terrorist may get denied \nat the bricks-and-mortar gun store, but then they can later that day go \nonline or that weekend go to a gun show at the convention center and \nbuy a weapon. So you have to do both, which is why we are asking for \nboth of these votes.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I believe firmly--\nand I really appreciated the conversations between him and Senator \nKaine about the Second Amendment. I am a Second Amendment Democrat. A \nlot of us are. I believe firmly that as Senator Schumer said, you can't \npick the amendments you like and pick the amendments you don't like. I \nbelieve that we can protect the Second Amendment while protecting \ncommunities from gun violence.\n  As stated by the late Justice Scalia, ``Like most rights, the Second \nAmendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry \nany weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever \npurpose.''\n  To Senator Murphy, I would like to ask him, how does he view the \nSecond Amendment fitting into this conversation? Speaking of bogeyman, \nI think that there is this sense that if you are for reasonable \nrestrictions on purchasing a gun, that you are against guns. It seems \nto me, at least in the State of Hawaii, that people who are the most \nconcerned with gun safety, the people who impart gun safety to their \nchildren, the people who do this right are gun owners, are hunters, are \npeople who even have a gun for protection.\n  So the question I have for the Senator is, What is the right balance, \nboth under the law and from the perspective of keeping our people safe?\n  Mr. MURPHY. This may sound strange, but you look to Justice Scalia \nfor that balance. He writes in the majority opinion in Heller, a \ndecision that a lot of our friends disagree with, that the Second \nAmendment right is not an unlimited right, just like all of the other \namendments that Senator Kaine and I spoke about.\n  In an interaction that I had with Senator Udall earlier in the day, \nwe were remarking that neither of us believe that this really was a \ndebate about the Second Amendment. This has nothing do with the Second \nAmendment because the Second Amendment very clearly, as interpreted by \nthe Supreme Court very recently, is a right that comes with conditions. \nThere are certain weapons that civilians shouldn't be able to own, and \nthere are certain individuals who shouldn't be able to own any weapons \nat all if they have lost that right through, for instance, the \ncommission of a felony. We just shouldn't accept this juxtaposition \nthat gets made between those who say that you either support the Second \nAmendment or you want to stop criminals from getting guns at gun shows. \nThese two goals are not mutually exclusive.\n  Every single one of us can be a supporter of the Second Amendment and \nrecognize, as the Supreme Court has very clearly, that there are \nlimitations on that right; for instance, your ability to lose that \nright if you committed a crime or if you have had known association \nwith terrorist organizations.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Thank you. I believe the Senator from Wisconsin has a \nquestion for the Senator.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I yield to Senator Baldwin for a question without losing \nmy right to the floor.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Thank you. Through the Chair, I would like to ask the \nSenator from Connecticut a question, actually about a number of \nthings--about the need for us to stand united as a country in the fight \nagainst hatred and terrorism and easy access to what are really weapons \nof war. It is about 6 hours ago that I came to the floor to participate \nin this very important discussion.\n  Mr. MURPHY. That was 6 hours ago?\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Yes.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Wow.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. One of the things I did was read through the names and \ntell a little bit about each of the 49 victims of the shooting in \nOrlando. I am not going to do that again, but I do want to display \ntheir beautiful faces because I do think telling these stories is such \nan important part of creating the resolve we need as a nation, as a \nnation united to take action. Not to repeat too much of what I said \nearlier\n\n[[Page S3964]]\n\nthis evening, but our thoughts and prayers are no longer enough.\n  It gets me thinking about what will it take, how many mornings do we \nhave to wake up to news of a shooting in an elementary school or \ncollege campus, a theater where people are gathering for a chance to \nescape and enjoy a movie, or as we learned last Sunday morning, a \nnightclub during June, which is Gay Pride Month, where people were \ncelebrating the accomplishments of a movement and enjoying themselves \nand recognizing that we still live in a world with discrimination but \nfeeling safe among friends, colleagues.\n  It was an act of hate. It was an act inspired by terrorists and \nterrorism, and it couldn't have happened without such easy access to a \nweapon of war. We offer our thoughts and prayers, but our thoughts and \nprayers simply are not enough. Again, it makes me think of what will it \ntake? I am ashamed it has taken us this long.\n  Earlier I read some names. Now I am going to share a list of \ncatastrophic events. Each one brought terror to a community, brought \ngrief and sadness to families, and they have been reduced to ways of \nreferring to them much in the way that we decided to call the terrorist \nattacks on September 11, 2001, \n9/11.\n  If you just look back a decade, and this is not a database of all of \nthem, but it is a database of many of the mass killings in our country: \nthe Amish school shooting in Lancaster County, PA, in 2006, killed 6, \nwounded 5; the Trolley Square shooting in Salt Lake City, UT, in 2007, \nkilled 6, injured 4. You heard Senator Kaine talking moments ago about \nthe Virginia Tech massacre in Blacksburg, VA, in 2007, 33 dead, 23 \nwounded; the Crandon shooting in Crandon, WI, in 2007, 6 dead, 1 \nwounded; the Westroads Mall shooting in Omaha, NE, in 2007, 9 dead, 4 \nwounded; the Kirkwood City Council shooting in Kirkwood, MO, in 2008, 6 \ndead, 2 wounded; the Northern Illinois University shooting in DeKalb, \nIL, in 2008, 6 dead, 21 wounded; the Atlantis Plastics shooting in \nHenderson, KY, in 2008, 6 dead, 1 wounded; the Carthage nursing home \nshooting in Carthage, NC, 8 dead, 3 wounded; the Binghamton shooting in \nBinghamton, NY, in 2009, 14 dead, 4 wounded; the Fort Hood massacre, \nFort Hood, TX, in 2009, 13 dead, 30 wounded; the Coffee shop police \nkillings in Parkland, WA, in 2009, 4 dead, 1 wounded; the Hartford beer \ndistributors shooting in Manchester, CT, in 2010, 9 dead, 2 wounded; \nthe Tucson shooting in Tucson, AZ, 6 dead, 13 wounded, including my \ndear former colleague in the House of Representatives, Gabby Giffords; \nthe IHOP shooting in Carson City, NV, in 2011, 5 dead, 7 wounded; the \nSeal Beach shooting in Seal Beach, CA, in 2011, 8 dead, 1 wounded; the \nSu Jung Health Sauna shooting in Norcross, GA, in 2012, 5 dead, 0 \nwounded; the Oikos University killings in Oakland, CA, in 2012, 7 dead, \n3 wounded; the Seattle Cafe shooting in Seattle, WA, in 2012, 6 dead, 1 \nwounded; the Aurora theater shooting in Aurora, CO, in 2012, 12 dead, \n58 wounded; the Sikh temple shooting in Oak Creek, WI, in 2012, 7 dead, \n3 wounded; the Accent Signage Systems shooting in Minneapolis, MN, in \n2012, 7 dead, 1 wounded; the Newtown school shooting in Newtown, CT, in \n2012, 28 dead, 2 wounded; the Mohawk Valley shootings in Herkimer \nCounty, NY, in 2013, 5 dead, 2 wounded; the Pinewood Village Apartments \nShooting, Federal Way, Washington, in 2013, 5 dead, 0 wounded; the \nSanta Monica rampage in Santa Monica, CA, in 2013, 6 dead, 3 wounded; \nthe Hialeah apartment shooting in Hialeah, FL, in 2013, 7 dead, 0 \nwounded; the Washington Navy Yard shooting in Washington, DC, in 2013, \n12 dead, 8 wounded; the Alturas tribal shooting in Alturas, CA, in \n2014, 4 dead, 2 wounded; the second Fort Hood shooting--I can't believe \nI have to say that--in Fort Hood, TX, 3 dead, 12 wounded; the Isla \nVista mass murder in Santa Barbara, CA, in 2014, 6 dead, 13 wounded; \nthe Marysville-Pilchuck High School shooting in Marysville, WA, in \n2014, 5 dead, 1 wounded; the Trestle Trail bridge shooting in Menasha, \nWI, in 2015, 3 dead, 1 wounded; the Charleston church shooting, \nCharleston, SC, in 2015, 9 dead, 1 wounded; the Chattanooga military \nrecruitment center shooting in Chattanooga, TN, in 2015, 5 dead, 2 \nwounded; the Umpqua Community College shooting in Roseburg, OR, in \n2015, 9 dead, 9 wounded; the Colorado Springs shooting rampage in \nColorado Springs, CO, in 2015, 3 dead, 0 wounded; the Planned \nParenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, CO, in 2015, 3 dead, 9 wounded; \nthe San Bernardino mass shooting in San Bernardino, CA, in 2015, 14 \ndead, 21 wounded; the Kalamazoo shooting spree in Kalamazoo, MI, in \n2016, 6 dead, 2 wounded; the Excel Industries mass shooting in Hesston, \nKS, in 2016, 3 dead, 14 wounded; the Orlando nightclub massacre in \nOrlando, FL, this past Sunday, 49 dead, 53 wounded.\n\n  What will it take? How many times do we have to wake up to these \ntragedies?\n  I have the honor of representing the State of Wisconsin, and as you \nheard me read through that list, you heard that my home State, which I \nlove, is not immune to these acts of violence. I just want to talk \nabout some of the mass shootings in Wisconsin in recent years.\n  In November of 2004, during hunting season in Sawyer County, six \nhunters were killed and two were wounded.\n  In March of 2005, a gunman burst into the Church of Living God \ncongregation during church services and fired 22 rounds, killing 7, \nincluding the pastor and his family.\n  In June 2007, five people were killed by a gunman, including twin \ninfants, their mother, and two other victims in Delavan, WI.\n  In October of 2007, six young adults were killed during a party in \nCrandon, WI.\n  In August of 2012, a gunman killed six and wounded four, including an \nOak Creek police lieutenant, when he opened fire at the Sikh Temple of \nWisconsin during Sunday morning services. He had a semiautomatic \npistol, and as I mentioned, murdered worshippers before he was killed \nby the police. He also injured four others, including one of the \nresponding police officers, whom he shot 15 times.\n  The victims of the Sikh Temple shooting were Satwant Singh Kaleka, \nage 65, and founder of that Sikh Temple; Paramjit Kaur, 41 years old; \nPrakash Singh was 39 years old; Sita Singh was 41 years old, Ranjit \nSingh, age 49; Suveg Singh, age 84.\n  Just a couple months after the Sikh Temple shooting in Oak Creek, WI, \na gunman killed three and wounded four when he opened fire inside a \nsalon and spa in Brookfield, WI. The shooter was the estranged husband \nof an employee and entered the Azana Spa in Brookfield armed with a \n.40-caliber handgun and murdered three people, including his wife, and \ninjured four others, including a pregnant woman.\n  The victims of the Azana Spa shooting were Zina Haughton, age 42, the \nshooter's estranged wife. According to witnesses, she heroically tried \nto stop her husband from harming others before being killed. Cary \nRobuck, age 32, and Maelyn Lind, age 38, were also victims.\n  In June of 2015 in Wisconsin a gunman killed three, including two men \nand an 11-year-old girl, on the Trestle Trail bridge in Menasha, WI.\n  We also had some success in thwarting what could have been horrendous \nmass killings in our State.\n  In late January 2016, a plan for a mass shooting at a Masonic temple \nin Milwaukee was thwarted by the intensive work of the FBI, and the \nplotter was arrested and criminally charged. I think it is important to \nnote that while I have talked about these mass shootings, these mass \ncasualty events, we lose so many Americans on a daily basis to violence \nin our communities, and it is an epidemic. Since those shootings in \nOrlando on Sunday morning, throughout the country we have seen at least \nthat many deaths due to gun violence.\n  In Milwaukee, the local newspaper has taken to creating a homicide \ntracker. They are literally counting the homicides because they are so \nrampant. So far this year, their homicide tracker notes 51 homicides. \nThis is just in one city in Wisconsin. Eighty-two percent of those \nhomicides were caused by people using guns rather than other means.\n  I just want to tell you one more name and one more story. In May, \nlast month, a little girl in Milwaukee named Zalayia Jenkins approached \na patrol officer and asked if they could keep her safe. The next week, \n1 day before Zalayia's tenth birthday, she was shot by a stray bullet \nwhile watching television inside her house. She died 11 days later.\n\n[[Page S3965]]\n\n  Whether these murders were perpetrated in violent communities, \nwhether they are the acts of terror and terrorists, whether they are \nhate crimes, the fact remains that we have to tackle this. When will be \nthe time? The time is now.\n  It is amazing for me to see so many of my colleagues on the floor of \nthe Senate as the hour nears midnight in Washington, DC. We have a bill \nbefore us in the Senate that is the appropriate opportunity to take up \nthis measure offered by my colleague from Connecticut and another \ncolleague, Senator Feinstein from California. It is the Commerce-\nJustice-Science appropriations bill. We can't let another moment pass \nwithout a vote, without doing everything within our power to make the \nworld a little safer, to do more than hold these victims and their \nfamilies in our thoughts and prayers. Thoughts and prayers are no \nlonger enough.\n  Earlier today my colleague from Connecticut talked about the power of \nthis moment and how people are taking to social media and urging their \nelected officials to listen and act. I want the people's voice to be \nheard. I want it to be so deafening that our colleagues who suggest \nthat the American public for some reason isn't behind this--we know the \nopposite to be true. We know how much support there is for universal \nbackground checks and for doing something as common sense as making \nsure that people who are on the terror watch list are not eligible to \npurchase guns, something as simple as allowing the FBI to deny a \nfirearm sale to somebody who is not able to fly on a commercial plane \nbecause they are being investigated for terror. In addition to \ntweeting, I ask Senator Murphy, what would he urge people to do right \nnow to help us act?\n  Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I thank the Senator for this question, \nwhich is at the center of this moment. This can't just be about the 30-\nsome odd Senators who have taken to the floor over the last 12 \nhours. And by the way, we have now been on the floor for over 12 hours.\n\n  This has to be about something bigger. This has to be about a \nnational movement that commands this place to act. It has happened \nbefore, and it has to happen here. It means voters have to elevate this \nissue on their priority list. It means more people have to start asking \nquestions about why their Members of Congress, why their Senators, are \nvoting in a way that is contrary to the vast majority of their \nconstituents. It means everyone in this country deciding not to accept \nwhat exists today as the status quo.\n  And let's remind everyone, as Senator Durbin has over and over again, \nthat what exists today is not just a regularity of mass shootings; that \nprior to 2008, it happened at the pace of one per every 2 months--these \nare the big shootings--that now happen once every single month. It is \nalso the regularity of gun violence that happens in our cities, such \nthat kids in Hartford, CT, explained to me a year ago that police \nsirens and ambulance sirens are their lullaby at night because it is \njust a regular facet of their existence. The American people can't \naccept that either.\n  Let me just say before I turn the floor over to Senator Merkley how \nproud I am of all of our colleagues, not just for joining in but for \nthe way in which we have conducted this debate over the last 12 hours. \nWe are angry at a lot of people, but I am really proud that this debate \nhas been on the level and that we have tried to remain as dispassionate \nas we can about the path forward.\n  Let me add one statistic to the mix. I just heard that my office has \nreceived 10,000 phone calls today. I actually have no idea how my \noffice could handle 10,000 phone calls, so I asked to double and triple \ncheck that number. We only have two phones up front. But we have \napparently received 10,000 phone calls today encouraging all of us to \ncontinue on this mission.\n  I appreciate the work that is being done by the staff on the floor. \nThey are staying and laboring extra hours. We know that is not in their \njob description. This is the professional staff who man the desks and \nalso the political staff within both caucuses and the personal staff. \nThere are a lot of people who didn't know they were going to be staying \nthis late tonight, including those who are reporting our words, and I \nthank them as well.\n  I want to acknowledge that there is progress being made as we speak \non trying to find a path forward. So I want to thank those on both \nsides of the aisle who are working to try to find a way forward to take \nthese votes.\n  We are hopeful at this hour. We still have more to say, and at this \npoint I will yield for a question to Senator Merkley without \nrelinquishing my right to the floor.\n  (Mr. ROUNDS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity to ask a \nquestion of my colleague from Connecticut.\n  Earlier I came to the floor and I was reflecting on the connection \nbetween Connecticut and Oregon in terms of the shooting in Sandy Hook \nand the shooting we had last year at Umpqua Community College, the 10 \nindividuals who were killed at Umpqua Community College. But as I was \npondering during the day, my head was going further back in time to \n1998 when I was running for my first race for State legislature. Our \nprimary was held May 19 of that year, and I was immersed in this \nprimary. I was running a race against two former State representatives \nand the head of the water district, and I was the individual who had \nnever run for office and never held office, and I assumed I would lose. \nBut on May 19 when the results came in, I had won the primary.\n  Two days later, on May 21, a young man who had been expelled from his \nschool--his name was Kip Kinkel--Thurston High School in Springfield, \nOR, took the guns from his house. He murdered his parents. He proceeded \nto go to Thurston High School. He had with him a 9mm Glock. He had a \n.22-caliber semiautomatic rifle, he had a .22-caliber Mark II pistol, \nand he had 1,127 rounds of ammunition. His goal was to shoot as many \nstudents, to kill as many students as he could. He shot a lot of \nstudents. Two died and twenty-five were wounded. As he exhausted the \nammunition in his semiautomatic rifle, he had to reload the magazine, \nand as he did that, he was tackled by one student who was already \nwounded, six others piled on, and the carnage ended. But he had only \nbegun to tap into the 1,127 rounds of ammunition he was carrying. Thank \ngoodness that individual, that student, Jacob Ryker, succeeded in \nstopping him when he was reloading that rifle.\n\n  The year went on. November was the general election. I was elected to \nthe Oregon House. The Oregon House came into session in January of \n1999, and we said: It is time to fix the background check system we \nhave in our State. It is time to close the gun show loophole.\n  What makes no sense is to have this background check system when you \ngo to a gun store and then no background check system when you go to a \ngun show. And we knew that many people who had felony backgrounds were \nseeking to acquire guns. We knew that many people who were deeply \nmentally disturbed were seeking weapons. They were being turned away at \nthe gun store, and they were going to the gun show or they were going \nto the classifieds. So we tried to pass that bill to close that \nbackground loophole, the gun show loophole, and we failed. We could not \nmuster the majority, just as this body has not been able to muster the \nmajority to address the complete illogic of this situation.\n  Then the citizens of Oregon took this into their own hands. They \npetitioned for an initiative. They put it on the ballot, and the \ncitizens of Oregon voted overwhelmingly--by a huge margin--they voted \noverwhelmingly to close the gun show loophole. But it would be many \nyears later--not until 2015--that the legislature would take the \nadditional step of closing the classified ads loophole, or the Craig's \nList loophole, as it is often called.\n  So in Oregon, if you go to a gun store or a gun show or to a Craig's \nList listing, you have to go through a background check. But someone \nwho is turned away in Oregon can go to any of a number of States across \nour country, bypass that background check, buy those guns, and come \nback to our home State.\n  It makes no sense to have a national system without national \neffectiveness. And I so much appreciate my colleagues being here \ntonight to talk about this, to talk about the fact that those who are \non a terrorist list should be on a list to deny guns, and that\n\n[[Page S3966]]\n\nthose who are denied guns--to have it effectively, you have to have a \nbackground check system.\n  My State is a State that loves guns. We are a State with incredible \nwilderness. People love to hunt. They love to target practice. They \nlove to just shoot guns. And they love the Second Amendment and nature. \nBut they voted for the background check system because they knew it \ndidn't make sense to have guns in the hands of felons or deeply \ndisturbed individuals because of the carnage that comes from that.\n  There is another story I wanted to share that is related to 1998. \nThis story fast-forwards from the primary election in May to the \ngeneral election in October, November. So it was as we were approaching \nthat first Tuesday in November, the general election, which would be \nheld November 3. The day was October 6, so roughly a month away--a \nmonth before--a young man named Matthew Wayne Shepard was offered a \nride home by two other young men, Eric McKinney and Russell Henderson. \nThey didn't give him a ride home. They took him out to a very rural \narea near Laramie, WY. They tied him to a fence because he was gay. \nThey robbed him, they pistol-whipped him, they tortured him, and they \nleft him there to die. It was 18 hours later that a bicyclist riding \npast saw this young man still tied to a fence. The bicyclist thought \nthat Matthew Wayne Shepard was a scarecrow but went to investigate, \nrealized it was a young man, and proceeded to get help. Matthew was \nextremely damaged. His skull was fractured, his brain stem absolutely \ninflamed. He never regained consciousness. He died six days later.\n  It was a hate crime that rocked the Nation. It was a hate crime that \nshocked the conscience. These crimes were happening with some \nregularity--these hate crimes against our LGBT community--but this one \ncaught the attention of the Nation, and a bill was crafted, the Matthew \nShepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act. That bill was championed by my \npredecessor in office, Gordon Smith, but it didn't get passed until I \ncame to the Senate in 2009--not because I came but because it took that \nlong to build the support on the foundation that others had laid in the \nyears before. So we passed that hate crimes act, but the hate crimes \nact doesn't stop the discrimination against the LGBT community. It \ndoesn't stop the promotion of hate.\n  I am going to be submitting a resolution, and I thought I would read \nit tonight. It is a resolution that Senator Mark Kirk has agreed to \ncosponsor, that Senator Baldwin has agreed to cosponsor, that Senator \nCory Booker has agreed to cosponsor, and I hope many others will join \nus in this. It says the following:\n\n       (1) Equal treatment and protection under the law is one of \n     the most cherished constitutional principles of the United \n     States of America.\n       (2) Laws in many parts of the country still fail to \n     explicitly prohibit discrimination against lesbian, gay, \n     bisexual, and transgender . . . individuals.\n\n  The failure to actively oppose and prohibit discrimination leaves our \nLGBT individuals vulnerable based on who they are or whom they love; \nvulnerable to being evicted from their homes; vulnerable to being \ndenied credit or other financial services; vulnerable to being refused \nbasic services in public places, such as restaurants or shops, or \nterminated from employment or otherwise discriminated against in \nemployment.\n\n       (4) To allow discrimination to persist is incompatible with \n     the founding principles of this country.\n       (5) Failure to ensure that all people of the United States \n     are treated equally allows a culture of hate against some \n     people in the United States to fester.\n       (6) This hate culture includes continuing physical assaults \n     and murders committed against LGBT individuals, and \n     particularly against transgender individuals, in the United \n     States.\n       (7) The events that transpired on June 12, 2016, in \n     Orlando, Florida, were a horrifying and tragic act of hate \n     and terror that took the lives of 49 innocent individuals and \n     injured 53 more. The victims were targeted because of who \n     they were, who they loved, or who they associated with.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is time to end discrimination against LGBT \n     individuals and stand against the culture of hatred and \n     prejudice that such discrimination allows;\n       (2) it is incumbent on policymakers to ensure that LGBT \n     individuals benefit from the full protection of the civil \n     rights laws of the Nation; and\n       (3) Congress commits to take every action necessary to make \n     certain that all people in the United States are treated and \n     protected equally under the law.\n\n  That is the philosophy embedded in our Constitution--equal treatment \nand equal opportunity. It is the spirit of anti-discrimination that is \nour higher self that we should treat each individual with respect, each \nindividual with dignity. It is the principle of opportunity for all \nthat cannot take place when discrimination interferes. It is the spirit \nthat we have carried along a long journey--a journey in which we have \nreached out to embrace individuals who were excluded.\n  Our original practices in this Nation operated under the vision of \nfull opportunity for all, but it was a flawed vision. It was a vision \nthat didn't include Native Americans. It was a vision that at that time \ndidn't include individuals who were minorities. It was a vision that at \nthat time didn't include women. But over time we have reached out and \nstarted to make that incredible picture portrayed in our founding \ndocuments and in the hearts of our Founders a reality. We have done so \nin step by step along an arc. It was Martin Luther King who said that \n``the moral arc of the universe is long but it bends towards justice.'' \nBut that bending takes place because ordinary mortals say they are \ndetermined to make it happen. They apply themselves to that effort, \nwhether in their everyday life with the individuals they encounter and \nwork with and live with and worship with and recreate with or in the \nlives of legislators who work within their institutions to say: We are \nchanging hearts, but let's change our laws as well.\n  We have the 1964 Civil Rights Act as a foundation, a milestone, an \nanchor, a foundation of laws against discrimination, but when you read \nthe 1964 act, you don't see any protections for our LGBT community. Now \nmany of us have put forward a law called the Equality Act that would \nremedy that, that would use the foundation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act \nto extend full equality for the LGBT community.\n  It is unbelievable that today in America you can get married to \nsomeone you love in the morning and announce it in the afternoon and be \nfired from your job--legally fired from your job or evicted from your \napartment before nightfall because your marriage demonstrates that you \nare gay or lesbian or transgender or bisexual. Some States have \nremedied that, but we haven't done it as a nation. And when you have a \nlegal structure that embraces discrimination, that fosters a culture of \ndiscrimination among some. Let's end that. Let's end that structure of \nlaw. Let's pass the Equality Act.\n  I am sure it will be sometime before they call up the act in hearing \nin committee. That shouldn't be the case on something so profound, so \nimportant. It should have had a hearing right after it was introduced, \nand we will keep pushing for that hearing. We hope it can get to the \nfloor, but in the meantime, let's stand behind a sense-of-the-Senate \nthat it is way past time for us to address this issue of discrimination \nthat fosters this culture of hatred. We saw that culture in full \ndemonstration the night of October 6, 1998, when Matthew Shepard was \ntied to a fence, brutally assaulted, tortured, and left to die. We saw \nthat culture of hatred in Orlando, FL, with the deaths of so many \nbeautiful young people on that tragic night.\n  So we have before us two challenges. Let's address simple measures \nthat can make a difference--that terrorists shouldn't have access to \nguns and that we should have a background check system that actually \nworks, so gun shows and classified ads are treated the same as a \npurchase at a gun shop.\n  Let's decrease the size of the magazines. When Kip Kinkel took 1,127 \nrounds of ammunition and 3 guns to his school to kill as many of his \nschoolmates as he could, he was stopped because he ran out of \nammunition and had to reload, and those 2 seconds gave a fellow \nstudent, Jacob Ryker, an opportunity to tackle him. He probably saved \ndozens of lives that day.\n\n  We have the challenge before us of these simple improvements in our \nbackground check system, in our terrorist list, and in our gun \nmagazines, but we also need to end the discrimination that is embedded \nin the law that treats millions of Americans as second-\n\n[[Page S3967]]\n\nclass citizens and can foster among some, unfortunately, and contribute \nto a culture of hatred against those individuals. So let's do both.\n  Tonight I am so honored to be here with my colleagues sharing in this \njoint effort to say enough is enough. Let's not hide from these issues. \nLet's have a vote on these issues. Let's be accountable to our \nconstituents on these issues. That will not happen if my colleague from \nConnecticut cannot get a vote on the proposal he is putting forward.\n  I wish this room right now had every desk filled. The beautiful \nspeeches my colleagues have been giving, the reflections, the insight, \nthe wisdom, the earnestness, the grief. But the room is not full. We \nneed our colleagues in the majority to join us in this conversation \nthat affects the lives of so many people in America.\n  What happened in Orlando, FL, not only killed 49 individuals, but it \nshattered their families, it shattered the community, and it shattered \nand reverberated throughout this Nation. And this--perhaps not to the \nsame degree, but this type of violence goes on and on and on.\n  I believe my colleague from Connecticut has said that a major event \nof this nature, of multiple deaths, occurs every month. If you look at \nthe events of person-on-person violence, if you look at what happens in \nour cities across this country, our rural areas across this country, \nevery day there are acts of violence. Every day there are acts of hate \ncrimes against our LGBT community. So let's do both of these.\n  We ask and we hope that citizens across the country will weigh in \nwith those Senators who may not be here tonight and may not have been \nhere this afternoon and may not have been here when this conversation \nstarted over 12 hours ago; that they might hear at least a \nreverberation, that the thoughts issued here reverberate back through \nthe country and come back in those phone calls and in those letters to \nour colleagues' offices; that they might be aware and they might read \nthe stories so many citizens could tell of an incident that might have \nbeen averted if we had a better system of laws on background checks and \nif we got rid of the discrimination embedded in our laws in this \ncountry.\n  So I ask my colleague from Connecticut, is it your hope, is it your \naspiration that this body will indeed embrace and have a full \ndialogue--not just one side of the aisle but on both sides of the \naisle--and that will lead to votes on these very significant proposals \nso that we can act to make America a better place?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator from Oregon for his passion on both \nof these topics and for laying out the challenge for us, which is to \nmove forward on these consensus proposals to close the terrorist \nloophole, to expand the number of sales that are subject to background \nchecks, and to make sure everybody who buys a gun through a commercial \nsale has to prove they are not a criminal, but linking together what I \nwould call doubling down on inclusiveness that has to happen in the \nwake of Orlando.\n  An incident like this has a tendency to pull a community apart. Yet \nwhat we know is that the way to prevent this kind of tragedy from \nhappening again is for to us recommit ourselves to inclusiveness and to \ntolerance and to fighting discrimination.\n  I can't say anything more than the Senator said with respect to that \ncommitment as it applies to LGBT Americans. I do hope we are able to \nmove the Equality Act through this body. I think we are in a long and \nfrustratingly slow transition to a place that we all know we are going \nto get to, which is the full right to individuals no matter their \nsexual orientation.\n  I also know that coming off this tragedy, there is going to be a \ntendency to marginalize another community, and that is the Muslim \ncommunity in this country. As we talk about our efforts to build an \ninclusive society, we have to remember that the way in which we make \nour Nation safe is by building these inclusive communities where Muslim \nAmericans feel a part of the whole, not feel excluded, because it \nbuilds and plays straight into the recruiting rhetoric of these \nterrorist groups if we are divided, if we push people out to the \nextremes.\n  So I think this is a very important message for us all to hear, that \nfighting terrorism, whether it be hate-based crimes or politically \nbased crimes inspired by terrorist groups--we combat it best, yes, when \nwe tailor our gun laws to make sure that those who are thinking about \nthese crimes, these horrific murderers, don't get guns, but also when \nwe build these inclusive communities, which acts as a pretty strong \nprophylactic to terror.\n  I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania for a question without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. CASEY. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. The question I pose \nwill center on not just why we are here, what the two measures are we \nare hoping to get a vote on, but why we seek to have support for \nthose--first, to have support to get a vote in and of itself, and then \nto get support from our colleagues.\n  I want to take us back to two scenes, one I referred to earlier today \nbut one that I had just remembered tonight that is a painful memory for \na lot of people in Pennsylvania.\n  I did want to say this first as well. I had mentioned earlier a \nPennsylvanian who had lost her life in Orlando in the terrible incident \nof this weekend. What I did not mention was a second Pennsylvanian, and \nI should have. The second person from Pennsylvania who was killed in \nthat murderous rampage at the nightclub was a graduate of McCaskey High \nSchool in Lancaster, PA.\n  Ortiz-Jimenez, 25, known to his friends as ``Drake,'' was a native of \nSanto Domingo in the Dominican Republic, according to his Facebook \npage. It also says he studied law in Puerto Rico. It goes on from there \nto talk about his life, but I did want to pay tribute to him as well. \nHe was one of the 49 killed in addition to Akyra Murray, who I \nmentioned before. She was only 18 years old and lost her life as well.\n  The two scenes I wanted to bring us back to include, of course, \nCharleston, SC. We are remembering that day of horror as well. We had \nan incident this weekend in a nightclub. In Charleston it was in a \nplace of worship, and in Sandy Hook it was in a school, a school \nclassroom. All of these settings were where people, I think, should \nhave some reasonable expectation of some measure of safety, but even \nnow that is at risk because of the horror of gun violence.\n  Today, I mentioned earlier as well: Let's remember the national \nnumber. By one estimate, 33,000 lives are lost each year through gun \nviolence. That is why when you add up all the well-known incidents, it \ndoesn't add up to anywhere near 33,000 because as the Senator from New \nJersey, Mr. Booker, reminded us, there are a lot of places in between \nwhere the numbers go not just into the thousands but literally the tens \nof thousands, because of what happens on our streets day after day.\n  But here is the reason I raise Charleston.\n  We know that took place at the Emanuel AME Church, often called \n``Mother Emanuel,'' in Charleston. Nine people were shot in their place \nof worship by a young man with hate in his heart. That was a hate crime \nmurder--certainly an act of domestic terrorism. It had no connection to \nanything international, nothing about ISIS or international \nconnections.\n  The second incident I will mention has that same characteristic, hate \nand murder domestically, nothing having to do with some inspiration \nfrom a terrorist organization.\n  But here is the remarkable feature of what happened after Charleston, \nwhat some of the family members did. They were so courageous, just like \nso many others of these families who have lived through this. After the \nmassacre, the relatives of those killed attended a bond hearing where \nthe accused shooter appeared. They didn't attack him, they didn't yell \nat him, they didn't scream at him, they didn't convey their justifiable \nanger, even outrage, which we all would consider a justifiable feeling \nof vengeance, of score settling. However you want to call it, they \ndidn't do that. Instead, what did they do? They forgave him.\n  Nadine Collier, the daughter of Ethel, who had been killed in the \nchurch that day, said to the killer:\n\n       You took something very precious from me. I will never talk \n     to her again. I will never, ever hold her again. But I \n     forgive you. And have mercy on your soul.\n\n\n[[Page S3968]]\n\n\n  So said Nadine Collier, a remarkable testament to forgiveness, to \nmercy, which is almost superhuman.\n  I am not sure I could have done that. I am not sure many people could \nhave.\n  She wasn't the only one. Other relatives took their turn one after \nanother expressing pain but always showing grace and praying for mercy.\n  None of us or very few of us--and I count myself among those who \ncould not--could do that in that circumstance. That was Charleston, SC.\n  Let me take it back in time. I was so moved that Senator Baldwin \nmentioned, when she was doing that chronology, that she started in \n2006, 10 years ago. I mentioned Lancaster County before, Lancaster, PA. \nThe first incident she mentioned was so-called Nickel Mines, a small \ncommunity in Lancaster, this Amish community. It is this great \ncommunity of faith of industriousness people and a community that is \nbonded together by their work ethic, by their faith, and by their \nfamilies.\n  Even that tranquil community--that community which has enjoyed for \ngenerations a kind of tranquility that many other communities would \nnot--was subjected to violence.\n\n  Ten years ago, this coming October, a man entered a one-room Amish \nschoolhouse in Nickel Mines, PA, with a cache of weapons, including a \n9mm pistol, two shotguns, a stun gun, two knives, two cans of \ngunpowder, and 600 rounds of ammunition, into this small community of \nthe Amish community.\n  He executed five girls and wounded six others before taking his own \nlife. It is hard to comprehend the horror of that scene, just like so \nmany others we talked about.\n  Yet on the very same day, as the shooter committed this heinous act, \na grieving grandfather told young relatives: ``We must not think evil \nof this man.'' ``We must not think evil of this man.''\n  I mentioned both of those scenes, scenes of the kind of bloodshed, \ntragedy, and horror that we cannot even imagine. I certainly cannot. \nBut in both instances you had very close relatives in the immediate \naftermath of the killings expressing mercy and forgiveness. Nadine \nCollier saying:\n\n       But I forgive you. And have mercy on your soul.\n\n  And the Amish grandfather said: ``We must not think evil of this \nman.''\n  We are not asking anyone in this Chamber to do anything like that. We \nare not asking anyone here to forgive someone who just murdered one of \ntheir family members. We are not asking someone in this Chamber to do \nsomething which is, in a sense, superhuman. We are just asking people \nto support two votes.\n  In this place, when you are a U.S. Senator you are judged on a number \nof scales, but you are mostly judged on how you vote. That is what we \nare supposed to be doing here--how you vote. And that becomes the \nscorecard of your work. That becomes one of the measures against which \npeople will make a judgment about you. So we are not asking people to \ndo something that is all that difficult. I know there might be some \npolitical difficulty to it but, come on, this isn't like having to \nforgive someone who just murdered your loved one and you are standing \nin front of them. This isn't as difficult as what the families of all \nthese places mentioned went through--Nickel Mines, PA, all the way \nthrough Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT, and all the way to \nOrlando, FL. We are not asking people to do anything very difficult. \nAll you have to do is put your hand up and then put it down twice if \nyou are going to vote for it. And if you want to vote against it, so be \nit.\n  But at least put your hand up to allow a vote on two simple measures \nthat will begin--just begin--the long journey to rectify a substantial \nnational problem that takes 33,000 people every year. All we are asking \nfor is a start, a foot in the door, maybe even a toe in the door--but \njust a start to do something about this problem we have to reduce this \nnumber.\n  No one can convince me that the greatest country in the history of \nthe human race cannot begin to tackle this problem. This idea that \nthere is nothing we can do, that all we need to do is enforce the law \njust doesn't make sense anymore. It really, really doesn't if you look \nat the facts.\n  In essence, there is nothing we can do, some say in Washington, other \nthan enforce the law and just hope that good law enforcement every day \nof the week is going to save 33,000 lives. That is not logical. It is \nnot tenable based upon the facts. To me, it is unacceptable.\n  So I would ask the Senator from Connecticut, a very simple question. \nWhat are we asking people to do, Members of the Senate, in the next \ncouple of days and asking them as well as we are asking Members of the \nSenate to do something which puts them in any risk beyond political \nrisk?\n  If you could just reiterate for us what is at stake here, why we need \nto take at least these two actions, and how we can best begin to solve \nthis problem.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his comments \nand the question. Of course, the answer is that there is absolutely no \nrisk involved in the votes that we are hopeful to bring forward in the \nSenate. Why? Because these are propositions that are supported by the \nvast majority of the American public. There is no controversy over \neither of these issues.\n  The risk is in doing nothing. The risk is in continuing to allow for \nthis very large loophole for would-be terrorists to walk through.\n  I won't read it again, but several times on the floor today I have \nread this quote from a now-deceased Al Qaeda operative in which he very \nclearly advertises to recruits here in the United States:\n\n       You can go down to a gun show at the local convention \n     center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle, \n     without a background check. . . . So what are you waiting \n     for?\n\n  This is one of Al Qaeda's top operatives, directing individuals in \nthe United States to take advantage of this loophole. We have seen this \ntrend line away from other means of terrorist attacks to the assault \nweapon, to the firearm. So we should pay attention to this trend and do \nsomething about it.\n  The real risk is doing nothing, Senator Casey. There is no risk in \nvoting for this. You will be celebrated by the American people. After \ntonight, I hope there will be even more who will join our call.\n  The real risk is in standing pat and allowing for ISIS to recruit \nstraight into the loophole that we have created. Think about what we \nare doing. We are selling guns to the enemy knowingly if we allow our \nset of laws today to persist. That is why we have to move forward and \nenact these commonsense measures.\n  With that, I yield to Senator King for a question, who has been great \nto be with us for the majority of this late evening, without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. KING. I wish to discuss with the Senator and bring back the point \nwe were discussing some 4 hours ago. It is hard to believe that it was \nsome 4 hours ago, but this is really a national security discussion. \nThis is really a national security discussion because of the changed \nnature of our adversaries and the changed strategy that they have for \nattacking us.\n  But first I want to go back to the Constitution, and purely by \ncoincidence today I am wearing the Constitution. My daughter bought me \nthis tie at the Library of Congress, and it is the handwritten version \nof the Constitution. You can see ``We the People'' in very large \nletters.\n  Why are governments formed, why are constitutions written? Going back \nto the earliest human societies, the fundamental function of bestowing \npower on the government is to protect you. Security is the fundamental, \nmost sacred obligation of any government. And our Framers recognized \nthat because in the preamble to the Constitution--the heart of the \ndocument, why we are doing this--the Framers were explaining to \nposterity, and two of the fundamental purposes, among several others, \nare to ensure domestic tranquility and provide for the common defense--\nthe basic function of any government and the explicit function of our \ngovernment.\n\n  Now, here are three important dates: 1812, 2001, and 2016. There is \n1812 because that was the last time an adversary violated our shores. \nThat was when Washington was burned by the British. It was the last \ninvasion of America until 2001, but 2001 and 1812 have some \nsimilarities because 2001 was, in effect, a foreign invasion. It\n\n[[Page S3969]]\n\nwas plotted abroad, it was planned abroad, and people came here from \noutside of our shores and attacked our country.\n  Now, in response to that attack in 2001, we mobilized a number of \nresources. We developed ways of protecting our aircraft, we developed \ngreat intelligence, an ability to determine when people were plotting \nagainst us, and indeed we sent our blood and treasure and young people \nto Afghanistan because it was a haven for terrorists. That was the \nreason we went there and in fact are still there--to keep that country \nfrom becoming an incubator for terrorists to attack this country, and \nwe have been effective. We have been effective in preventing an attack \non our country from abroad.\n  So as is always the case with warfare, our adversaries have developed \na new strategy, and that is why the third date I mentioned is 2016. It \nwas in the last few years, particularly in the last year, as ISIS has \nbegun to be beaten back and to lose its territory in Syria and Iraq, \nthat they have developed a new strategy which doesn't involve sending \npeople here. It doesn't involve sending arms here or bombs or anything \nelse. It involves using the Internet to radicalize people who are \nalready here--often they are U.S. citizens--and then turn them against \nus. That is the new nature. This is terrorism 2.0. That is the nature \nof the struggle we are in now, and that is why the amendment that is \nbeing proposed makes so much sense from the point of national security.\n  If we discover an arms cache in Syria, we bomb it, but if ISIS wants \nto attack us here with terrorism 2.0, we sell them weapons. It makes no \nsense. The first rule of warfare is disarm your enemies, if you can, \nand that is exactly what we are talking about.\n  I think a lot of people just say: Well, this is just another gun \ncontrol debate. We are talking about gun control. We are talking about \nnational security. We are talking about defending ourselves from a \nstrategy that relies upon people being able to acquire guns easily in \nthis country--people who are terrorists or who are inspired by the \nterrorists or who want to be terrorists. And we can't have a bill that \nsays you have to have probable cause to show you have already committed \na terrorist act. That is too late. It has to be prevented, and that is \nwhat we are talking about here today.\n  So I think it is very important to remind ourselves that this is \nreally a national security bill, and it makes no sense to close the \nterrorist loophole unless you close the gun show loophole because the \nterrorists aren't stupid. The terrorist APB they send out from \nsomewhere else in the world to tell somebody to get a gun and kill \npeople will also say, by the way, do it at a gun show or do it online \nbecause they will not check you.\n  My colleague already read a quote from the Al Qaeda operative who \nexplicitly told people to do that. So if we don't do both things, it \nreally is a false security. We are kidding ourselves. So we have to, \none, close the terrorist loophole. I would venture to say 90 percent of \nthe American people agree to that. If you were to walk up to people on \nthe street and say: Do you think people should be prevented from \ngetting on airplanes but they should be able to buy guns, they would \nlook at you like you were crazy. That doesn't make any sense.\n  Yes, there are constitutional provisions built into the amendment we \nare talking about that allow people who are wrongfully on that list to \nhave an opportunity to get off the list and to contest that \ndesignation. So this isn't some kind of wholesale violation of the \nSecond Amendment. This respects the Second Amendment and is based upon \nthe premise that due process is available in this situation.\n  Then we have to close the gun show loophole and the online loophole \nbecause otherwise doing the first thing just isn't going to be \neffective. So the two things together, to me, are national security and \npersonal security because of all the other tragedies that we have \ntalked about tonight that don't involve Al Qaeda or ISIS or al-Nusra or \nal-Shabaab or any of the other terrorist organizations but involve our \nindividual citizens being killed in just stunning numbers. Since we \nhave started talking here today--since the Senator took this floor--a \ndozen people have been murdered by guns--one an hour, 24 hours a day, \n365 days a year.\n  So we have a national security reason to do this, and we have also--\nremember, the preamble, and I will finish with my question. The \npreamble has two pieces: provide for the common defense. That is what I \nhave been talking about--national security. Insure domestic \ntranquility. That means keeping people safe here, not from enemies \nabroad but from criminal elements within our own society--again, the \nmost fundamental and sacred obligation of ``we'' as a government. If we \ndon't do this, we are committing constitutional malpractice. We are not \nabiding by the most sacred obligation in our Constitution--to keep our \npeople safe. It can be done consistent with the Second Amendment, \nrespectful of the Second Amendment, but in a way that will \nfundamentally realize the promise the Constitution makes to all \nAmericans; that their government will protect them from foreign attack \nand from domestic unrest.\n\n  So I ask the Senator: Does he view this as, in large measure, a \nnational security issue?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator from Maine, especially because, as he \nmentioned in his previous comments, he sits on the Intelligence \nCommittee and so he is, frankly, privy to information he likely cannot \nstate on the floor but is directly on point, which is this notion these \nterrorist groups, whether it be Al Qaeda or ISIS, now are more \ndependent than ever on inspiring and launching lone-wolf attacks. Why? \nBecause they are losing ground in Syria and in Iraq, and this notion \nthere was going to be an inevitable caliphate that was going to grow \nand prosper and control large amounts of territory in the Middle East \nis no longer a reality.\n  As someone earlier today said on the floor, there is a record-low \ntrickle of American citizens today going abroad--maybe it was my \ncolleague from Maine--to join Al Qaeda, which suggests how their pull, \nhow their gravitational pull has been greatly reduced.\n  It means there are right ways and wrong ways to engage in this second \nfront, this effort to try to launch lone-wolf attacks. The wrong way is \nto marginalize Muslim communities in this country by telling them they \nare less than, by telling them they are threats, by nature of their \nethnicities or their religion, to the United States.\n  Mr. KING. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. KING. On February 15, 2015, Dabiq, which is the sort of public \nnewspaper of ISIS, published an explicit strategy for what they hope \nwill become a worldwide conflict. The strategy is that westerners will \nfall into the trap of persecuting Muslims and drive them into the arms \nof radicals. That is the strategy.\n  So to the extent that we persecute and marginalize these \noverwhelmingly peaceful citizens who want to be citizens of our country \nor citizens of other countries in the world, we are doing their job. \nThey said that is what we want to do and indeed some people in our \nsociety have fallen into that trap and are doing it. This is exactly \nwhat they want because they want this to be a war between Islam and the \nWest. Do we really want to radicalize 1.6 billion people and 3.3 \nmillion here in this country, the vast majority of whom want nothing \nmore than what the rest of us want, which is to raise our families and \nlive our lives and enjoy the benefits of this wonderful country.\n  So I agree with the Senator and would ask him if he concurs that if \nwe are marginalizing people of any faith, then in this particular case \nwe are driving them into the arms of our adversaries.\n  Mr. MURPHY. The name Dabiq itself, which is the name of the \npublication this organization--that ISIS sends to the rest of the world \nis rooted in a spot that is representative to this terrorist group of \nthe historic clash between East and West. So the entire orthodoxy of \nISIS is based on this idea that we convince would-be converts that this \nis a fight between the Muslim faith and the Christian faith, which just \nagain speaks to the fact that there are right ways and wrong ways to go \nabout fulfilling the mission my colleague has articulated in the \npreamble of the Constitution.\n\n[[Page S3970]]\n\n  The wrong way is to blame these attacks on everyone who shares the \nMuslim faith. The right way is to target the very small subset of \nindividuals of any faith who have connections to terrorist groups. The \ngood news is that because of a network of surveillance we have \nendorsed, we can do much better than before in finding what individuals \nhave that contact with terrorist groups, and when we find that out, it \nsimply makes sense that we shouldn't sell them weapons.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KING. I thank the Senator for his answers and for his leadership \non this issue.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I would say in yielding to Senator Durbin for a question, \njust personally, it has meant so much to me to have Senator Durbin on \nthe floor for almost the entirety of the now 13-plus hours. He is \nfrankly a hero to those of us who showed up relatively late to this \nfight for justice on the issue of combating gun violence. I am so \nthankful to Senator Durbin for being here consistently with us, and I \nyield to him for a question without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to propose a question to the Senator from \nConnecticut, but before I do, first I would like to thank the Senator \nwho is presiding at this early morning hour. I thank him and his fellow \nSenators who made this possible.\n  A special thanks to staff. They have been thanked before, but they \nshould be thanked again for their diligence and patience during this \nconversation and debate on the floor of the Senate.\n  And a special thanks to the pages who stayed late, late tonight and \nwill have stories to tell about that night when the Senate went into \nthe morning and we were there. So you will be able to tell those \nstories when you get back home to your families and friends, but it is \na historic debate and it is an important debate and it is one that will \naffect your lives and the lives of the many people you treasure on this \nEarth.\n  We come to this floor at this early morning hour--a quarter to 1 here \nin Washington, DC, as the Senator from Connecticut noted, more than 13 \nhours after he first took the floor--to discuss the critically \nimportant issue about the safety and security of America.\n  When I think about what we are facing here, as has been said by the \nSenator from Maine, we are dealing with a new strategy by terrorists. I \ncan remember the day of 9/11, 2001, in the room just a few feet away, \nwhen a little after 9 in the morning we quickly turned on the \ntelevision to see that planes were crashing into the World Trade Center \nin New York. By the time the second plane went in, we knew it wasn't an \naccident. Then there was a crash at the Pentagon, black smoke billowing \nover the mall, and we were quickly advised to evacuate the Capitol of \nthe United States. We did. We raced for the exits and went outside, we \nstood on the lawn and didn't know which way to turn, feeling that the \nnext plane was headed for the Capitol dome. That was the threat we \nfaced and the reality of that threat right here in this building, that \nsome terrorists--unimaginable--would use an airplane to attack us. That \nwas the weapon.\n  Well, it was a bitter lesson, and 3,000 innocent Americans died. We \nchanged America. Osama bin Laden changed America. The way we went to \nthe airport, when we arrived, how we arrived, what we carry, what we \nwore became part of our defense of America, and for 15 years it has \nbecome a routine. Our children and grandchildren have grown up with it. \nThey couldn't imagine a day when you didn't go through intense security \nat an airport. But before 9/11, it virtually never happened, and when \nit did it wasn't very reliable.\n  What we are talking about is a new strategy, a new tactic by \nterrorists. That is why this debate is about more than just this \nhorrible tragedy at Orlando. It is about a pattern that is emerging of \nthose who are radicalized and marginalized and turn to guns that they \ncan buy legally in the United States to threaten us. How serious are \nthese guns? In an earlier meeting, I made a mistake of calling it an \nautomatic weapon. The weapon that was found to have been taken in by \nthis man in Orlando is a semiautomatic weapon. The difference, of \ncourse, is with an automatic weapon, you hold the trigger and it bursts \nall the cartridges in the magazine, as many as you have. With a \nsemiautomatic, you literally have to pull the trigger each time. But \nlet me give an idea of what that meant.\n  In the early morning hours at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, a brief \nvideo was uploaded to Snapchat by one of the victims, Amanda Alvear. It \nwas the last video she ever shot because she died. What the early \nmoments of the massacre sounded like came through on the Snapchat \nvideo: a frantic drumbeat of shots, 17 or more shots in 9 seconds, one \nshot per trigger pull in a continual barrage. Today the FBI told us \nthere were hundreds--hundreds of shots fired.\n  So when we talk about a potential terrorist with a gun, it is a \nterrorist with the capacity to kill hundreds of people. That is the new \ntactic. And that is why this conversation is not just about the Second \nAmendment in theory; it is about keeping America safe in fact from the \nnew wave of terrorism.\n  When the Senator from Connecticut took the floor, it was for two \nreasons. We said them and we should say them again--to make sure that \nif someone is suspected of being a terrorist, they cannot legally \npurchase a weapon in America, and particularly not this kind of weapon \nthat could create such carnage and kill so many innocent people. \nSecondly, that this terrorist, once realizing he is stopped by the \nlegal process, can't go through the extraordinary process of going to a \ngun show. I have been by these gun shows in the armories and gymnasiums \nacross Illinois. They all come piling in to show their weapons and sell \ntheir weapons, and people buy them in bulk. And rarely--in some States, \nin Indiana for example, for many sellers there is no background check. \nDo you want to buy more than one, a Glock pistol? How much money do you \nhave? Do you want to fill up the trunk of your car and take them in to \nthe city of Chicago? Be my guest. This is exactly what happens. Of \ncourse, now the Internet is another source.\n  Are we so certain of the security of America that we are not going to \nprotect our families and our friends and the people we love from the \nnext attack, from the next would-be terrorist? I don't know if this man \nin Orlando was truly associated with a terrorist organization. The \ninvestigation is underway. Some of the things he said were nonsensical \nwhen it came to identifying himself with these terrorist groups. I \ndon't want to dismiss that possibility. Let the FBI investigate that in \nits full range to find out whether he was associated. But then who is \nthe next one? And will the next one have access to some weapon that can \nkill so many innocent people at once? That is what this conversation is \nall about. It isn't about some age-old debate on the floor of the \nSenate. It is about the new world we live in. The Senator from Maine \nmade it clear. The Senator from Connecticut read directly from \nterrorists who were instructing those who would kill Americans how to \nget it done most efficiently. That is what we are trying to stop. That \nis what this is all about. It will be great if at the end of this we \nnot only get these amendments called, but maybe even a bipartisan \nagreement on stopping terrorists from buying guns in America to \nthreaten innocent people in Orlando, in Connecticut, in Illinois, in \nMaine, in New Jersey.\n  I would close by first thanking Senator Murphy and Senator Booker, \nwho has been a stalwart supporter and friend throughout this debate. I \nbelieve he has tried to stand by Senator Murphy literally throughout. I \nsay to Senator Booker, thank you for bringing to our attention at our \ncaucus lunch yesterday the fact that this is about more than mass \nmurder. It is about the murders of Americans that go on every day, \nevery hour. In the cities that we love, innocent people die because of \nit. It is all part of the same conversation and the same debate. I \nthank the Senator for bringing that message home. It touched me because \nof what we are enduring in my State of Illinois and the city of \nChicago.\n  I say to Senator Murphy, it has been a long day. Here we are, a new \nday. I hope it is a new day for our country--a new day when we start \nlooking seriously at putting an end to this gun violence and this \ncarnage and doing a\n\n[[Page S3971]]\n\nsmart, sensible, commonsense thing to make sure that those who would be \nterrorists don't have access to the most lethal killer weapons \navailable in gun stores and gun shows across America.\n  My close is a simple question. At the end of this battle there are \nmore to be fought, not just on this issue but on the issue of military-\nstyle weapons being sold to civilian populations. But let's save that \nfor another day. I would just ask the Senator in closing what he is \nfeeling as he watched his colleagues give up their time during the \ncourse of yesterday and the early hours of this morning in terms of the \nintensity of feeling and the stories that he heard that I hope have \ninspired him as they have me.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator from Illinois. I thank him for \nsetting an example of how to speak truth to power in this body. We have \ntalked over the course of this afternoon about the influence of special \ninterests and how they have affected this debate. There is simply no \none in the U.S. Senate who, over a period of time, has ignored special \ninterests and money and power and just done and said and fought for the \nright thing over and over again. To the extent that people like Senator \nBooker and I made the choice to run for this body even amidst its \nreputation for dysfunction, it is because we hoped that when we got \nhere we could maybe--we could maybe--equal some portion of the example \nthat the Senator has set. So personally--and I think I can speak on \nbehalf of Senator Booker and Senator Blumenthal and myself. Certainly, \nfor me it has meant so much that the Senator has been here for the \ntotality of this debate. I say to Senator Durbin, thank you.\n  It has meant just as much to me to have all our colleagues here \ntoday. It has meant the world to me to have Senator Blumenthal, my \npartner, engaging in this together and to have Senator Booker, as was \nmentioned, in an act of wonderful sympathy, make the decision to stand \non his feet for the duration of this time as well.\n  This has been organic. We sent out the word that we thought this was \nsomething important, but this really happened of its own volition. \nEverything that has happened outside of this Chamber today and tonight, \nwith the hundreds of thousands of interactions, the ten thousand phone \ncalls that have just come into our office alone speak to the wellspring \nof desire there is in this country to act--to act on the issue of the \nepidemic of gun violence.\n  Of course, what we have proffered here are two simple measures that \nwe think we are on our way to perhaps getting votes on. But we don't \nwant votes; we ultimately want agreement. Hopefully, the momentum that \ncomes from today and tonight and the 13 hours that we have been on the \nfloor will get us there.\n  I will yield for a question at this point, without losing my right to \nthe floor, to Senator Booker.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I thank Senator Murphy very much for what I think has \nbeen one of the more remarkable exhibitions of grit and toughness. \nSenator Murphy has not only been on his feet, not only has not left the \nfloor to use facilities, but he has stood in the saddle and has been \nfor this entire time--as our colleagues have flowed through this \nChamber, he has been answering question after question after question \nafter question on a topic that he is passionate about, on a topic about \nwhich he feels deeply and personally. I just want to thank him for his \nleadership because it has captured the attention of our Nation.\n  This filibuster right here--I know a little bit about social media. \nThis filibuster right here has been the focus trending on Twitter, the \nfocus of Facebook. It has created media attention on a problem because \nin a sense the Senator is giving hope. His very intention of coming \nhere has met the urgent need that the public has seen that this \nauspicious body, this greatest deliberative body on the planet Earth, \nthis Senate, designed by the Constitution to deal with the biggest \nproblems of our land--this body would not just go on with business as \nusual. What the Senator chose to do is to say: Enough. Stop. We are \ngoing to have a discussion about an issue that is not just on the minds \nof the American public but is grievously affecting the hearts and the \nspirit of our Nation.\n  Tens of thousands of people since Sunday have been standing around \nour country in vigils, in solidarity, expressing their pain and \nexpressing their sorrow but expressing the feelings they have that we \nshould be better than to allow such grievous, terroristic, hateful acts \nto happen on our soil. While the American public has been stepping up, \nthis body today had a different plan--to move on a piece of \nlegislation, to barely acknowledge this.\n  So before I want to really reframe this, I just want to say to the \nSenator, thank you for the courage that you have put forth to say: \nEnough is enough. No business as usual; we are going to stop, and we \nare going to push for two commonsense amendments that cannot end gun \nviolence in America, cannot stop terrorist activity here and abroad, \nbut they can take a step--a constructive step--toward beginning to \nchoke the flow of commonality of these incidents on American soil. As \nhas been said time and again, as has been said by a number of Senators \ntoday, what reason was our government organized in the first place? We \nheard Angus King--wearing the Constitution on his tie--talk to that \npreamble: common defense, domestic tranquility.\n  So I want to frame this again. But the first frame, I just have to \nsay--the Senator and I talked about it after caucus lunch yesterday, we \ntalked about it during the day, and we talked about it last night. I \nsay to the Senator, you are not talking about it today; you are doing \nit--no business as usual. For that, I am grateful.\n  It is merited that we also thank the many people who are involved. \nWhen the Senate is open past midnight, hundreds of people have to be \nhere as well--not just the people you see here on the floor. The pages \nare in their first days, and this is one of their seminal experiences. \nNot the folks who are working behind the dais there, not the great \nRepublican colleagues who have had to man that chair, but there are \nsecurity guards and subway operators and the people who are seating \nfolks in the gallery.\n  I want to say thank you, and I want to point out the fact that Chris \nhas helped to pay for food for not only a lot of the folks here but \nincluding the Republican cloakroom. I appreciate you, Senator Murphy.\n  Now I want to get to the framing of what this is about because there \nhas been a lot talked about tonight, most of which I agree with, a lot \ndiscussed, a lot far afield, but you came here with a purpose around \ntwo issues that are common sense; one is that in the United States of \nAmerica, if our investigatory authorities see people as threats, are \ninvestigating people because they are believed to be desirous of \ncommitting acts of terrorism on American soil--people who have already \nbeen banned, in some cases, from flying on airplanes--we should take a \nstep, we should make it the law of this land that the person who is a \nsuspected terrorist, that person who can't get on an airplane, that \nperson also should not be able to buy an assault rifle.\n  That is so commonsense that as you said earlier today, perhaps 4, 5 \nhours ago, many people in America are shocked when they realize that a \nterrorist loophole actually exists. What you are fighting for, Senator \nMurphy, is not radical. It is not out of the box. It is common sense.\n  What is even more important is that in this day and age, when \npartisanship does cripple this body from time to time on big issues, \nthis issue is actually not partisan. Study after study has shown, \nsurvey after survey, poll after poll says overwhelmingly Americans \nagree with this. In fact, over 80 percent of American gun owners say we \nneed to close the terrorist loophole. In fact, over 70 percent of NRA \nmembers say we should close the terrorist loophole.\n  What nation when they are at war--where your enemy is actually trying \nto incite terrorism in your country, when your enemy is explicitly \nsaying exploit this loophole--would keep that loophole wide open, where \nit is easy for someone with terroristic aims to hurt, injure, destroy, \nand kill? But you took it one step further, and I was happy this \nmorning to work on an amendment with you that says you can't just close \na terrorist loophole and leave open, as you called it hours ago, a \nbackdoor for those terrorists to use. That means if you do background\n\n[[Page S3972]]\n\nchecks, they need to be universal because if it is just the brick-and-\nmortar gun retailers, you go there and you are going to have to do a \nbackground check.\n  By the way, those background checks stop people every single year, \nnot just people who may be suspected of terrorism. Frankly, they stop \ncriminals, but we now know that we are a nation of change, where the \nbuyers of weapons have migrated from the brick-and-mortar stores now to \nanother market, often online or gun shows. Unless we close those \navenues for terrorists to use, they are going to use them--so very much \ncommon sense again. The second thing that you were saying today is that \nwe need to close the terrorist loophole, and we need to make sure we \nare doing universal background checks. That is the reason we are here--\nthe grit of a Senator and the common sense of two amendments that are \nvery critical.\n  For a moment, I want to tell you what was perhaps the most touching \ntime for me in this 13, 14 hours. I actually checked the rules, and you \ncan't acknowledge people who are in the Gallery. They are not here now, \nso I am not acknowledging anybody who is here, but your wife and child \nshowed up. When I heard you talk as a parent about the love of your \nchild and how you did something that is so important for us as \nAmericans--in fact, I think it is at the core of who we are that this \nis what our country calls us to do, which is to take courageous steps \nof empathy and say, when other people's children are dying, that is not \ntheir problem. It triggers empathy in me. I think of my own child. I \nthink about my niece. I think about my nephew. I think about my family.\n  There is a privilege in this country that is a dangerous type of \nprivilege. It is the type of privilege that says if something is not \nhappening to me personally, if a problem is not happening to me \npersonally, then it is not a problem. It is not a problem if it is not \nhappening to me personally.\n  That is contrary to what we say about ourselves as a country. The \nspirit of this country has always been we are all in this together. We \nall do better when we all do better. If there is injustice in our midst \naffecting another family, another State, another neighborhood, then \nthat is an injustice that is threatening the whole.\n  Senator Murphy, this is one of your core values. It is expressed by \ngreat Americans. It was expressed by Martin Luther King in perhaps one \nof the greatest pieces of American literature, the ``Letter from a \nBirmingham Jail,'' this idea that if something is going on wrong in \nConnecticut, if a tragedy happens there, if children are murdered \nthere, that is not Connecticut's problem, it is our problem. Dr. King \nsaid:\n\n       Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We \n     are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a \n     common garment of destiny.\n  So, to me, that is a core element of our Nation. It is what our \nFounders understood when they said we are in this together. The very \nDeclaration of Independence ends with a nod toward that \ninterdependence, toward that interwoven nature. It was said by our \nFounders on the Declaration of Independence, right at the end, that in \norder for this Nation to work, we must be there for each other. We must \ncare about each other. We must invest ourselves in each other. If an \ninjustice happens to my brother or my sister, it is affecting me. That \nDeclaration of Independence ends with those words: ``We mutually pledge \nto each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred honor.''\n  Now we see these tragedies, and I don't want to believe that we are \nbecoming numb to them. We see them as some distant reality and not as a \npersonal attack because when you attack one American, you attack us \nall. When you have an avenue where you can make a difference to \npreserve and protect life and you do not claim it, to me, that is a \nsin.\n  There is a great writer, great thinker, Nobel laureate, who once said \nto the effect that the opposite of love is not hate, it is \nindifference. The opposite of love is not just hate, it is inaction--\nlack of caring, lack of compassion.\n  What gets me upset about this issue is that we have commonsense tools \nthat have been enumerated by wise colleagues of mine. We have legal \nscholars in our caucus who understand clearly that there is no absolute \nright when it comes to freedom of speech. As has been quoted many \ntimes, the majority opinion in the Heller case, there is no absolute \nright to bear arms. It has been said by multiple Senators, just closing \nthe terrorist loophole doesn't infringe on the rights of any American \nto bear arms, of any American sportsmen, any American seeking self-\ndefense. This is just saying that if you are someone who is believed to \nbe a terrorist, you should not be able to purchase a gun. If you are \nsomebody on that no-fly list, you should not be able to purchase a gun. \nEven with that, as you pointed out, there should be due process so that \nif you have to grieve that, there is a process for you to grieve being \non that no-fly list.\n  When I see the Senator's child come here to listen to her father, \nwhen I see parents--many of my colleagues have children. I hope that \nwhen we hear about a mass shooting, we don't just say I am praying for \nthose families but begin to think that what is happening to my fellow \nAmerican is a threat to me. It is happening to us all. We all are \nlesser as a result of it. We have to think to ourselves, ``How would it \nfeel if I fail to act, to do what is right, to close a terrorist \nloophole?'' What if right now that person our enemy is working to \nradicalize, what if right now that person in our country whom our enemy \nis working to inspire, what about that person who right now is seeking \nto do harm to Americans, what happens if they exploit that loophole \ntomorrow, next month, next year? What happens if they exploit that \nloophole, and this time they go to a playground, a train station, a \nmovie theater, a school, a church, and it happens to be your \nplayground, your movie theater, your school, your church, your child?\n  If you know there is something we can do to stop our enemy from \ngetting arms and doing us harm--and we have seen now from San \nBernardino to Orlando, FL, the terrorists are looking to do us harm--\nand we can stop our enemy with a commonsense amendment that is believed \nand supported by the majority of Americans, the majority of \nRepublicans, the majority of gun owners, the majority of NRA members, \nyet this body can't do that, then we are setting ourselves up for \nfuture acts of violence and terror that could have been prevented. What \nif it is our child or our family or our community or our neighborhood?\n  There is one more step I have to mention, I say to Senator Murphy. \nThere is one more step that is important to this because if you close \nthe terrorist loophole and make sure those terrorists cannot exploit \nthe backdoor, if you make sure those background checks are universal--\nagain agreed to by the majority of Americans, the majority of \nRepublicans, the majority of gun owners, the majority of NRA members--\nyou are also going to benefit by creating a background check system \nthat stops criminals from getting guns, that better undermines their \nability to get their hands on weapons that they want to carry out \nviolence in our neighborhoods, communities, and our cities. That is \nwhere it gets deeply personal to me. As the Senator has for his child, \nevery American has for their kids. We have big dreams. This is a nation \nof dreams. We have something called the American dream, which is known \nacross the globe. It is a bold dream. It is a humble dream that this is \na nation where our children can grow up, have the best of \nopportunities. Our children can do better than us. It is the American \ndream.\n  But the challenge I see with American reality, where we have such \nliberal access to weapons by people who are criminals, what that has \nresulted in--I have seen it myself--is so many children taken, killed, \nmurdered, time and time again, every day, every hour. Time and time \nagain, another dream destroyed, another dream devastated, another dream \nmurdered. And those are not just my words. I have seen it across my \nState. I have seen it in our cities and on our street corners where \nshrines with candles and Teddy bears are set up, marking place after \nplace and street after street where children have been murdered. I have \nstood on too many street corners looking down at bodies--13-year-olds, \n14-year-olds, 16-year-olds murdered in our Nation with a regulatory \nthat has not been seen in\n\n[[Page S3973]]\n\nwars past. I have been to funerals with parents begging us to do \nsomething about the violence in our country. I have seen children who \nare living, yet live with trauma and stress because they hear gunshots \nin their neighborhoods.\n\n  We have the power to stop this, and we can't assume that these \nproblems are not ours. Langston Hughes said it so poetically: ``There \nis a dream in this land with its back against the wall, to save the \ndream for one, we must save the dream for all.'' How many children's \ndreams must be destroyed by gun violence before we do the commonsense \nthings we agree on to begin to shrink those numbers?\n  It is written in Genesis that when Joseph's brothers see him \napproaching, with murder in their eyes, they said, ``Here cometh the \ndreamer, let us slay him, and see what becomes of his dreams.'' We have \nlost so many, and so many have been slain, but the dream of America \ncan't die. There are people who want to take it from us. They want to \ninject it with fear and hate. The dream of our country cannot die.\n  There are rules and loopholes that allow madmen, terrorists, and \ncriminals to get their hands on assault weapons. We cannot let the \ndream of our country die and be dashed and killed. We can do something \nabout it, and it is unacceptable, when you have the power, to do \nnothing.\n  We, those of us elected to this body, are the caretakers of that \ndream. We are the torch with the light, the hope, and the promise of \nthis country that still attracts so many. Hundreds of millions of \npeople in our Nation believe, as do so many people outside of our \nNation, that we must make sure that we form a more perfect union, where \nwe see that unfinished business, the work to be done, and answer the \ncall of our citizens.\n  I return to where I began. There have been literally thousands of \nAmericans who have taken to the streets this past week. I saw them in \nNew Jersey. I read about them in California and Florida. I see them in \nWashington, DC, here in our Nation's Capital.\n  Today I am proud that my friend has decided that that dream was worth \nfighting for, that the call of our Nation had to be answered, that that \ndream demanded something more than business as usual. Senator Murphy \nhas stood on this floor for 13-plus hours.\n  I don't know how long it will take, but I know that closing the \nterrorist loopholes and closing the avenues for terrorists to go online \nor to gun shows is just doing what makes common sense to keep us safe. \nI know we will win this battle. It is not a matter of if, it is a \nmatter of when.\n  As the hour grows later and later and this filibuster drags on, I \njust wish to address one more item. Senator Murphy and I both know from \nthe thousands of calls to his office that one of the problems we happen \nto have is that we allow our inability to undermine our determination \nto do something; that when you have a majority of people who believe in \nsomething, often the only thing that stops us from achieving it is not \nthat we can't--it is not a matter of can we, it is this: Do we have the \ncollective will?\n  I know from scanning social media that there are thousands of people \nwatching this right now. As Senator Murphy speaks to our colleagues and \nspeaks to the Chair, my question is, Can my friend speak to those \npeople tonight, many of whom were cynical about this body but found a \nlittle bit of hope by your action? Can my friend take a moment to speak \nto them about how we can keep fighting this fight and what they can do \nto press forward and how we can make the dream of our Nation stronger, \nmightier, and more just so that a week or a month from now, we are not \ngathered together and mourning our Nation about dreams that were dashed \nby violent terrorists?\n  (Mr. DAINES assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I thank my friend for the question, and I \nthank him for standing, quite literally, with me every second of these \nlast 13-plus hours. I thank my friend from Connecticut as well, who is \nabout to speak, for doing the same.\n  It is nice to have friends. It is nice to have friends who are \ncommitted to the same thing as you are, but it is just nice to have \nfriends.\n  It doesn't have to be like this. There are so many things in this \ncountry that we accept as inevitable, true, and unchangeable, and we \nare right on the precipice of getting to the point in this country \nwhere we accept this level of gun violence and gun homicide as just a \nnormal facet of life in this country. I know it because I heard the \nkids in the North End of Hartford tell me that the sound of ambulances \nand police sirens is their goodnight lullaby. They are used to falling \nasleep to the response of the next shooting.\n  I knew it at the beginning of this week, when, as the news was filled \nwith not just another mass shooting but the worst mass shooting in the \nhistory of this country, this body signaled that it wasn't going to \ntake up any measures to combat the epidemic of gun violence in the wake \nof the worst mass shooting in the history of this country. It has felt \nlike we have fallen upon the precipice of accepting this as the new \nnormal in this country.\n  All we are doing tonight is standing here and talking. We are asking \nfor a vote. And I think, as I will speak to in a moment, we have gotten \nto a place where we are going to get votes on these important \namendments, but all we are doing here is talking.\n  Senator Booker was right when he said that what has happened this \nafternoon and this evening is a platform for sustained and collective \naction that demands that this not be just a one-time phenomenon, that \nthis passion you heard from dozens of Members of the Senate who came \ndown here organically just because they cared sustains throughout the \nday, the months, and the years.\n  As I said earlier on this floor, great change movements are defined \nby their obstacles and failures, and we have already had a bunch of \nfailures when it comes to our fight for gun violence measures. We lost \na big vote on the floor of the Senate in 2013. There are State \nlegislatures that have gone in the other direction and made it easier \nto get weapons. We lost a vote here in December when we tried to expand \nour background check system to make sure that people who are on the \nterrorist watch list are captured by it. We have had our share of \ndefeats and losses.\n  As it turns out, we will get to have votes on these amendments, and \nmaybe we will lose those too. But every great change movement in this \ncountry is defined by persistence in the face of obstacles and \nfailures, and this change movement isn't defined by what we do here, it \nis defined by the 90 percent of Americans who believe in the \nrighteousness of what we are proposing.\n  Frankly, we aren't in the business of changing the minds of millions \nof Americans; we are in the business of changing the minds of a few \ndozen Members of Congress. It doesn't sound that bad when you put it \nthat way, right? We don't have to convince the broad electorate that \nsomething has to change; we just have to convince a few people here. \nAnd that can happen--it can--but it won't happen through Senator \nBooker, Senator Blumenthal, and me coming down here and doing this week \nafter week; it will happen because members of the public decided to \nmake those 10,000 phone calls that somehow plausibly fit themselves \ninto the phone lines to my office today. Those phone calls need to go \nto every other office in the Senate and House over the course of the \ncoming days, weeks, and months as we lead up to these meaningful votes. \nThis is an issue that voters prioritize when they go to the voting \nbooth. They need to pay attention to whether their Member of Congress \nis voting with or against them when it comes to commonsense issues like \nexpanding background checks to cover gun shows and Internet sales and \nmaking sure terrorists don't get guns. It is a commitment to never lose \nthat sense of empathy which has to be at the root of this.\n  Luis Vielma was 22 years old when he was shot and killed late Sunday \nnight in Orlando in the largest mass shooting in American history. He \nhad been so excited that night because he was hosting a friend of his \nwho was visiting from Miami. He wanted to show him this wonderful \nnightclub that he had found, this place where the community could come \ntogether and celebrate themselves. His father Jose suggested that the \ntwo of them come over to his house for some homemade Mexican food, but \nLuis was so excited to have a great time that night with his visiting \nfriend that he put off his dad and said:\n\n[[Page S3974]]\n\nI am going down to the club. I am heading downtown.\n  On his way to the club, he texted to his dad: ``I love you.'' Those \nwere the last words Jose ever heard from his son.\n  His family said that he went to the club that night to dance. ``Oh, \nand he can dance and get down,'' a family friend said. ``Yes, he can.''\n  He was born in Florida, but he loved the Mexican national football \nteam, adored his family, liked to play tricks on his younger brother, \nand was a huge Harry Potter fan. He had a job at Universal Studios. He \nworked on the Harry Potter ride, and that was a big deal to Luis.\n  Upon hearing of his death, J.K. Rowling tweeted out a tribute to him. \nHis job at Universal was a passion for him because he loved Harry \nPotter, but it was also paying for his education. He was studying to be \na physical therapist at Seminole State College.\n  His friend Will Randle said:\n\n       Luis was by far the best person I knew. He inherently made \n     us all better people by simply existing around us. Part of \n     him will always live on in every good decision that I make.\n\n  Kelly, a friend of his on Facebook, asked: ``How could this happen to \nsomeone so kind?'' How could this happen to anyone?\n\n  In December of 2015, Jonathan Aranda was shot and killed in the \nmorning hours of December 8 in New Haven, CT. He was 19 years old. He \nhad just graduated from Eli Whitney Technical High School in Hamden, \nCT. In a statement, the superintendent of schools talked about the \ndevastation in the entire educational community because of the loss of \nthis beautiful young man. His cousin said he was hard-working, and he \nwas well-liked. He worked at Brook & Whittle, a packaging company in \nGuilford. He was getting out of work. He had stopped at a friend's \nhouse to talk about cars, and then, bam, this senseless act of violence \nhappened.\n  His friend said that he was quick to lend a hand when you needed help \nand he wouldn't ask for anything in return. He worked the third shift \nand he came home, and then he helped his friends and his family. His \nyounger sister said that he was a humble and loving person, and he \nnever picked fights. A very, very likeable kid, said his cousin. He \ndidn't have a problem with anybody.\n  Luis Vielma was 22 years old when he was killed on Saturday night in \nthe worst mass shooting in the history of this country. This shooting \nhas gotten a lot of publicity, and it has prompted us to come down to \nthis floor and demand change. But nobody in this country knows about \nJonathan Aranda. He was killed in December of last year on the streets \nof New Haven, and his family and friends and his educational family \nmourn for him, but he didn't make headlines. There are the 80 others \nthat day on December 8 who died didn't make headlines either, but their \ndeaths are just as meaningful, just as impactful, and just as \nunacceptable as the 50 people who died late on Saturday night, early \nSunday morning in Orlando.\n  It doesn't have to be like this. That is why we have come to the \nfloor this evening.\n  I am going to turn the floor over to Senator Blumenthal in a moment. \nActually, I will turn it over to Senator Booker for some comments and \nthen to Senator Blumenthal. But let me just finish these remarks by \ntalking about the families of Sandy Hook. Senator Booker was talking \nabout courageous acts of empathy. I think it is a wonderful turn of a \nphrase. I think about the courageous act of empathy inherent in the \ndecision made by the families of those murdered in Sandy Hook to come \nto the Congress to argue in 2013 and then again in 2014, 2015, and 2016 \nfor background checks, because if you know the facts of the case in \nSandy Hook, background checks on sales at gun shows or with respect to \nonline sales wouldn't have mattered in that case, because that sale was \ndone with a background check. To the families of Sandy Hook, what would \nmatter much more is a ban on military-style assault weapons like the \nkind that was used to kill every single kid that was shot in Sandy Hook \nor a ban on high-capacity magazines.\n  Let me tell you this. There are kids who survived that shooting. They \nsurvived that shooting because the shooter fumbled when he went to \nreload and a handful of kids snuck out. But because he was using 30-\nround magazines, he only had to reload a handful of times. Had he been \nforced to reload after discharging 10 bullets rather than 30 bullets, \nthere are a lot of families in Newtown who think there would be more \nkids alive today. That mattered to them. But they came to Washington in \na courageous act of empathy to argue on behalf of Jonathan Aranda, who \nwas still alive in the spring of 2013 when we took that vote. They came \nto this Congress to argue on behalf of those still living on the \nstreets of this country who could benefit by an expanded background \ncheck system that would stem the flow of illegal weapons on their \nstreets. Had we been successful, had we been able to pick up a few more \nvotes to persist and beat that filibuster, maybe Jonathan Aranda would \nbe alive today. Had we years ago passed a law that puts people who have \nhad an intersection with the FBI with respect to terrorist connections \non the list of those who are prohibited from buying guns, maybe that \nnetwork would have caught up with Omar Mateen, and he would never have \nbought the weapon that he used to kill those in Orlando.\n  Those are all maybes, but life isn't always a game of certainties. \nWhat we have been asking for here today is to just take a step forward \nand take a vote on two commonsense measures that can start to show that \nwe have the ability to make progress as a body. There is a laundry list \nof other things that everyone who has spoken wants to happen. Our \nfamilies in Sandy Hook have a laundry list of other things that they \nwant to occur. But we want to start with these two commonsense \nmeasures.\n  Through the Chair to Senator Booker and Senator Blumenthal, I think \nwe can report some very meaningful progress over the course of these 13 \nhours. When we began this debate on the floor, when we declared that we \nwere not going to move forward on the CJS bill without a commitment to \ntalk about what happened in Orlando, to talk about how we fix it, and \nwhen we began, there was no commitment, no plan to debate these \nmeasures. It is our understanding that the Republican leader and the \nDemocratic leader have spoken and that we have been given a commitment \non a path forward to get votes on the floor of the Senate on a measure \nto assure that those on the terrorist watch list do not get guns, the \nFeinstein amendment, and an amendment introduced by myself and Senator \nBooker and Senator Schumer to expand background checks to gun shows and \nto Internet sales.\n  Now, we still have to get from here to there, but we did not have \nthat commitment when we started today, and we have that understanding \nat the end of the day. There is no guarantee that those amendments will \npass. But we will have some time to take the movement that existed \nbefore we started and maybe is a little bit stronger now and try to \nprevail upon Members to take these two measures and turn them into law.\n  So I am deeply grateful to be standing here at now 1:40 in the \nmorning with both of my friends who started here with me now going on \n14 hours ago. I gladly yield to my friend Senator Booker for a question \nand any final comments that he has.\n  Mr. BOOKER. This is my final question. I ask the Senator one more \ntime, will you yield for a question?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I yield for a question without relinquishing my control \nof the floor.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I just want, again, to say thank you to you. We started \nthis about 13 and a half or almost 14 hours ago with business as usual. \nWe started almost 14 hours ago with no focus on these issues in this \nbody. We started this 14 hours ago with something as obvious as closing \nthe terrorist loophole not on the agenda of the Senate.\n  This filibuster--your standing tall, your multiple colleagues \nstanding with you, over 2 dozen representing States from East to West--\nand this measure is standing here together. It now seems that we at \nleast will have a vote on those two things, the closing of the \nterrorist loophole and the expanding of the terrorist block so that we \nhave background checks that can block terrorists who seek to get \nweapons through secondary avenues. So that is a good step. It is not \neverything I\n\n[[Page S3975]]\n\nwould have hoped for out of this day. But it seems clear to me that we \nhave some work to do in changing the hearts and minds of some of our \ncolleagues so these measures that have failed in the past can pass now.\n  For those of you who don't know the history of this body, a lot of \nthe most prideful legislation of America--let's take the Civil Rights \nAct, for example--failed many, many, many times. But those who kept \nfighting and didn't give up or didn't give in to cynicism were able to \nbreak that measure on the floor. This has happened with many pieces of \nlegislation, from the abolishing of slavery to a woman's right to vote.\n  Sweet Honey in the Rock is a group that I love. They sing a song \ncalled Ella's Song, where they say: We who believe in freedom cannot \nrest. We who believe in freedom cannot rest until it is won.\n  So my hope is that this filibuster, now going into its 14th hour, \ndidn't just win a vote on these two amendments, didn't just stop \nbusiness as usual, didn't just get a chance to have a final \ndetermination at least on these two amendments, but that it happened to \ndo something else, Senator Murphy. My hope is that it helped to push \nback on cynicism. I think cynicism is a refuge for cowards, that \ncynical people basically throw up their hands and say nothing can \nchange. Thank God people who are fighting for our freedoms in this \ncountry didn't give in to cynicism and stop fighting. Thank God that \nthose who have reasons to be cynical about government didn't fall into \nthat trap of cynicism, didn't take that refuge for cowards and kept \nfighting in this body for so much of the legislation that we take for \ngranted, from workers' rights to the rights of immigrants.\n  So my hope, Senator Murphy, if I can express it to you, is that not \nonly will we fight to win the vote on these two amendments--one by \nDianne Feinstein in closing the terrorist loophole and the other \nauthored by you, me, and Senator Schumer to expand background checks--\nbut my hope is that this filibuster did not just get those four votes \nbut will mobilize it and engage more people to reach out to their \nSenators.\n  I really appreciate the fact that your office got 10,000 calls. I \nappreciate the fact that your effort has been trending on social media, \nbut that is nothing calling you, who already support this, and not \nreaching out to Senators who are deliberating over whether to support \nthis or not.\n  We are all here because folks not only didn't take that refuge for \ncowards through cynicism, that toxic state that debilitates us from \nbeing agents of change, but we are also here not just because of people \nwho shun cynicism but because of people who embrace love. Love--I use \nthat word very purposefully--love of country, love of patriotism \nnecessitates loving your country, men and women, and if you love your \ncountry, men and women, you don't just tolerate them. I think that is \nkind of a cynical aspiration for this country, that we will be a nation \nof tolerance, stomaching each other's right to be different. If we are \na nation of love, love doesn't just stomach someone's right to be \ndifferent. Love actually sees the truth of who we are. We each have \nvalue, worth, and merit. We need each other. We are interwoven in each \nother's destiny. And if there is injustice facing you, it affects me, \nand I have to work to correct that.\n  I am here, Senator Blumenthal is here, Senator Murphy is here, and \nall of the people who are working here, we are here because of this \nconspiracy of love of folks who didn't just take care of themselves and \ntheir families, they got engaged in their country, in their \ncommunities, in their neighborhoods. They did it for others. They \nserved, they volunteered, and they sacrificed.\n  So we are on another inflection point in America's history, with the \nworst mass murder in our country's history. You cannot control always \nwhat happens to you, but you can control your response to it. Let our \nresponse to this hateful act be love. Let our response to this \nterroristic act seeking to scare us be courage.\n  Let us in the days ahead act with love and courage, as demonstrated \nby our engagement with our political system--pressing, pushing, letting \nour representatives be heard from in this body that we want them to \nsupport commonsense initiatives, the closing of the terrorist loophole \nand expanding that with background checks that shut off the back door \nfor terrorists to exploit to get assault weapons to do repeats of what \nwe saw. With that kind of courage, with that kind of love, our enemies \ndo not win. We do. With that kind of courage, that kind of love, we \ndon't stumble, we don't stop, we don't hesitate, equivocate, or \nretreat; we advance this country toward its highest ideals that we will \nbe a Nation with liberty and justice for all. We are all families. From \ninner city communities to suburban, from rural to urban, all \ncommunities should enjoy safety, security, strength, and prosperity.\n\n  So with that, I ask the question, does Senator Murphy agree that we \nhave not just achieved this first step of stopping business as usual, \nletting this body go on, but actually getting two measures that were \nnot on this agenda until this action began? Does the Senator believe \nthat is not enough, and with thousands of people watching, people on \nsocial media now, we need to get more engagement to begin, as the \nSenator said earlier, not to change the hearts and minds of all \nAmericans--frankly most of America is with us--but to start focusing on \nthe Senators that will be deliberating over the coming hours, maybe \ndays, about these specific pieces of legislation?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank the Senator. This is an important start, but it \nis not sufficient.\n  What is unacceptable is to do nothing. What would have been \nunacceptable is to spend this entire week on legislative business that \nwas irrelevant to the epidemic of gun violence that has been made more \nreal than ever by the tragedy in Orlando. So I thank the Senator for \nhelping us convene our colleagues over the course of 14-some odd hours. \nI think we can report having made progress, but certainly not enough.\n  I will yield for a question to my friend Senator Blumenthal, who has \nbeen on the floor with us for the entirety of this time, standing with \nme, and frankly I have been standing with him, my senior Senator in \nthis fight since 2012. I yield to him for a question without \nrelinquishing control of the floor.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I thank Senator Murphy. And I join in thanking all of \nthe staff who have worked over this day and into the night and into the \nnext day at great personal sacrifice and at great benefit to the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I want to thank my colleague Senator Booker for his eloquence, his \nperseverance, and his dedication to this cause, and Senator Murphy for \nhis courage and strength in this cause that brings us here today, \ntonight, tomorrow, and in the days ahead because this experience is, as \nhe has said, only the next step, and this legislation is only a next \nstep.\n  We have talked a lot in great--and some of it very powerful and \ncompelling--terms about what is at stake here. Certainly the reason we \nare here has to do with the deadliest mass shooting in the history of \nthe United States. But the numbers are important. Numbers are cold, \nhard, and stark. Forty-nine people were killed in that single attack in \nOrlando, but in an ordinary day in America, dozens of people are shot \nwithout any notice. It is not a headline, barely a mentioning. \nCertainly there are no speeches on the floor of the U.S. Senate. The \nfact is that gun homicides are a common cause of death in our Nation--\nthe greatest, strongest Nation in the history of the world--killing \nabout as many people as car crashes, and in direct contrast to the \nexperience of other countries where, for example, in Poland and \nEngland, only about one out of every million people dies in a gun \nhomicide--about as often as when an American dies from an agricultural \naccident or falling off a ladder. These numbers come from the New York \nTimes of just a few days ago, June 13, which I ask to be printed in the \nRecord if there is no objection.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I would ask the Senator to withdraw that request at this \ntime.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I will offer it at another time. Thank you.\n  The point is that we can do something about these numbers. We can \nreduce them, and we can save lives if we adopt commonsense central \nmeasures\n\n[[Page S3976]]\n\nsuch as are going to be debated specifically and given a vote in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  A result of our staying--our colleagues and the three of us staying--\nis no more business as usual. Enough is enough. Let's listen to the \nAmerican people. There is a consensus. The poll numbers show that 90 \npercent of the American people think we should have background checks. \nThe majority of gun owners and the majority of people also think that \nsomeone suspected of terrorist activities based on evidence should be \nbarred from buying a gun. That is a national consensus, as well, and \nmakes good common sense. If we are at war with ISIS--and we are--we \nshould stop ISIS inspired or supported terrorists in this country from \nbuying guns. If we think ISIS is trying to create extremist violence \nhere that leads to the kind of attack that we saw in Orlando, those \nindividuals who are motivated by the twisted, pernicious, insidious \nideology of hate should be barred from buying a gun. These \ndeterminations are not based on speculation; they are based on evidence \nand facts under the measure that we have proposed, and they provide due \nprocess for someone to have his name removed if that determination is \nmade in error that he is on the list or that he is barred from buying \nguns.\n  The details are important, as they are in every law, because they are \na guarantee of due process and individual rights. The same is true of \nbackground checks. Somebody who is mistakenly on the NICS list should \nhave that name removed. But facts are important; evidence is critical. \nThat is what is involved in these measures, which are a start.\n  Laws work when they are enforced. We know they work in Connecticut \nbecause there was a 40-percent reduction in some crimes in the wake of \nthe permit to purchase laws passed in 1994. That study was recently \ndone by researchers at Johns Hopkins University and the University of \nCalifornia, Berkeley, saying to those doubters or skeptics that the \npermit-to-purchase laws passed in Connecticut in 1994 actually were a \nhuge success for public safety.\n\n  My colleague from Connecticut has cited other efforts that show that \nlaws work when they are enforced, and national laws are important \nbecause Connecticut cannot itself create the kind of protections that \nour citizens deserve. Borders are porous to the trafficking of guns. \nGuns have no respect for State boundaries, nor do the traffickers, so \nwe need national laws to protect the citizens of every State.\n  We are here because there is a national consensus in favor of those \nlaws, and we know that we have an obligation and a historic opportunity \nto be changemakers in this body. The American people want change on \nboth sides of the political aisle. We know that voters want Washington \nto change, they want the political system to change, they want our laws \nto change, and they want the system of public financing to change, so \nthat the public interest, not special interests, will prevail. Other \nmeasures surely should be sought--the repeal of the unique immunity and \nshield from accountability that gunmakers have, the inability of a \nprotective order to protect against domestic abusers that have guns, \nthe absence of laws to protect against straw purchasers and illegal \ntrafficking. There ought to be national laws, again, that provide those \nprotections.\n\n  Of course, even for licensed firearms dealers, a person whose \nbackground check is not completed in 72 hours can still buy a gun, even \nthough if the background check had been completed, he would have been \nbarred. That is the reason that in Charleston, SC, nine people were \nmurdered by Dylann Roof, who obtained that gun even though he was in \neffect legally barred from buying a gun because the background check \nwas not completed within 72 hours.\n  There are many more steps that need to be taken, and even with the \npassage of measures that we are advocating today, there is no single \nsolution.\n  We are only at the beginning of the efforts to pass these measures, \nbut we have at least changed this debate. We have changed the context \nof this consideration, and the reason is that Senator Murphy has shown \nthe leadership that he has shown. We are grateful to him for it, and we \nwill continue this fight together.\n  So my question, generally, to my colleague from Connecticut is, How \nshould we close tonight, and isn't he glad there will be no more \nquestions?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank Senator Blumenthal for the final question. Let me \nreiterate my thanks to everyone who has persisted this evening--for all \nof our colleagues who have come down to the floor to join in this \nexercise, and, again, to all of the staff and the pages who, indeed, \njust showed up a week ago for standing with us and for their commitment \nto public service and to those who sat in the Chair. I have done that \nfor an overnight session or two. I know it is not exactly the way to \nplan to spend your Wednesday evening. Most importantly, I thank Senator \nBooker for standing with me quite literally since 11:20 this morning \nand Senator Blumenthal for being a perpetual friend and partner.\n  I woke up this morning determined to make sure that this wasn't going \nto be a lost week, and I have been furious since those days following \nSandy Hook. I have been so angry that this Congress has mustered \nabsolutely no response to mass shooting after mass shooting in city \nafter city that is plagued by gun violence, such that the children who \ngrow up in the east end of Bridgeport or the north end of Hartford live \nthrough stress and trauma that affects their brains in irreparable \nways.\n  I am embarrassed that it took me so long to become a convert to this \nissue. I am embarrassed, frankly, that it took the tragedy in Sandy \nHook for me to wake up to the fact that people all around this country, \nin Newark, in cities in my State, have been living through this horror \nwithout attention from this body. There is no silver lining to what \nhappened in Newtown, but inarguably what has happened in the 4 years \nsince has been the focus of attention from all over this country on the \ninaction of this body and the failure of it to respond, and that is \nwhat is so perplexing to me. We have disagreements over what should be \ndone, but what I have not understood is why we don't even attempt to \nfind common ground on this floor--why, week after week, there is not a \nsingle vote or debate scheduled on any of the measures that have been \nproposed to try to stop this carnage. There hasn't been a debate \nscheduled on the floor of the Senate. There haven't been debates in \ncommittees. I am not saying we aren't doing important work, but there \nare 30,000 people dying every year on the streets of this country. \nThose whom they leave behind--their moms, their dads, their little \nsisters and brothers--don't get the total indifference we portray.\n\n  I know we are not indifferent. I know, in talking to my Republican \ncolleagues, that they feel just as deeply about the loss in Orlando and \nabout the loss in New Haven or Chicago or Newark as we do. I know there \nis a commonality of emotion here that betrays the story line we portray \nto the American people.\n  This exercise over the course of the last 14 hours in many ways has \nbeen a plea for this body to find a way to come together on answers, \nbecause it is devastating. It is devastating to the families who live \nthrough this trauma to watch the U.S. Senate do nothing, absolutely \nnothing, week after week. Think about that. Sandy Hook was 4 years ago, \n3\\1/2\\ years ago, and Congress hasn't passed a single measure that \nwould make the next mass shooting, the next murder of kids in this \ncountry, less likely.\n  I don't know what the vote is going to be--if we are successful, as \nwe believe we will be, in getting these votes--but I do know it will be \nanother chance for our colleagues to come together on two measures that \nwe have carefully selected as being the most likely to get bipartisan \nvotes.\n  That is why we chose to demand votes on these two measures--A, \nbecause they are significant, they will make a difference, and B, \nbecause they are as noncontroversial as you can get.\n  The American people have already made up their minds. They want a \nbackground check system that captures potential terrorists. They want \nto make sure everybody who buys a gun through a commercial sale has to \nprove they are not a criminal before they buy it. The American people \nhave made up their minds.\n  We chose to ask for the two least controversial provisions possible \nthat\n\n[[Page S3977]]\n\nstill will do a world of good. I am pleased that we are on a path to \nget those votes. It is a necessary but insufficient response to the \ncarnage that we witness in this country every single day.\n  This is personal to all of us. Senator Kaine said it well earlier \ntonight--that we have scar tissue, but it is razor-thin scar tissue \ncompared to those today in Orlando who are living through the \ncatastrophe of losing a 21-year-old son in the prime of his life or \nlosing a 24-year-old daughter with all of her potential ahead of her. \nOur scar tissue is there, but it is tiny.\n  I close by telling a story that I told during my first speech on the \nfloor of the Senate. I introduce you to Dylan Christopher Jack Hockley, \nwho in this picture is age 6. According to just about everybody who \nknew him, it was impossible not to fall in love with Dylan Hockley if \nyou met him. He loved video games, and he loved jumping on the \ntrampoline and watching movies. He loved munching garlic bread. He had \ndimples, he had blue eyes, and he had this very mischievous little \ngrin. You can see it here. And he is wearing one of his favorite \nshirts. His beaming smile would light up almost any room he was in. He \nloved to cuddle. He loved to play tag every single morning with the \nneighbors at the bus stop. He liked to watch movies, the color purple, \nand he loved seeing the Moon. He loved eating his favorite foods, \nespecially chocolate. He was so proud that he was learning how to read, \nand he would bring a new book home every day. Most importantly, he \nadored his big brother Jake, who was his best friend and his role \nmodel.\n  Dylan's mom Nicole, who has been a champion in the cause of ending \ngun violence in the country, always thought that Dylan was, in her \nwords, ``a bit special, a bit different.'' She said:\n\n       He was late to develop speech. He was late to learn to \n     crawl, and there was always a little something about him, but \n     we couldn't put our finger on it.\n\n  He said he only liked bland foods and he wanted only plain spaghetti. \nHe had a habit of flapping his hands when he got excited. He would put \nhis hands over his ears when he heard sudden or loud noises. He was \ndiagnosed with autism, but, as his father points out, autism is a \nspectrum with many different facets to it.\n  Dylan loved repetition, and he would watch his favorite movies over \nand over again--``Up,'' ``Wall-E,'' and ``The Gruffalo.'' He would find \na particular portion of that movie that he loved and he watched that \nportion. He would rewind, he would watch it, he would rewind, and he \nwould watch it. When he watched his favorite parts, his laugh was \ninfectious.\n  Dylan was struggling with autism as a student at Sandy Hook \nElementary School, but he was a special boy who was going to turn into \na special young man.\n  He idolized his brother Jake, but he idolized someone else as well. \nHe idolized a woman named Anne Marie Murphy. Anne Marie Murphy was his \nspecial education teacher and his personal aide. Over the course of the \nbeginning of his first grade year, they formed a bond, a deep bond that \nis often hard to form for kids with autism like Dylan. Their bond was \nso tight that he had a picture of her on the refrigerator, along with \nhis class. Every day when he would walk by the refrigerator, he would \npoint to the picture and say ``There's my class! There's Mrs. Murphy!'' \nIt meant something to him to have that relationship, and he loved going \nto school in large part because he knew he had someone there who loved \nhim back.\n  Senator Booker has talked about the expectations that we should have \nfor each other, that expectation of deep, passionate love for each \nother. Dylan and Anne Marie Murphy had it.\n  Senator Blumenthal and I got to Sandy Hook Elementary School after \nmost of the families had come to realize that their loved ones weren't \ncoming back, that their little boys and girls were probably lying on \nthe floor of those classrooms. We still saw and heard things that I \nthink we both wish we didn't hear and see.\n  When Nicole Hockley was standing in or outside the firehouse, when \nshe came to the slow, awful, crippling realization that her little boy \nwas not coming back, she had a moment where she thought to herself, \nmaybe Anne Marie will come back and she will tell me what happened to \nmy little boy. Then she had a second thought: that Anne Marie probably \nwouldn't leave Dylan if he was in danger.\n  When Adam Lanza walked into that classroom and aimed his military-\nstyle assault weapon with clips attached to it, holding 30 bullets, \nAnne Marie Murphy probably had a chance to run or to hide or to panic. \nInstead, Anne Marie Murphy made the most courageous decision that any \nof us could imagine. Instead of running, instead of hiding, instead of \npanicking, Anne Marie Murphy found Dylan Hockley and embraced him. Do \nyou know how we know that? Because when the police entered the \nclassroom, that is how they found Dylan Hockley--dead, wrapped in the \nembrace of Anne Marie Murphy.\n  It doesn't take courage to stand on the floor of the Senate for 2 \nhours or 6 hours or 14 hours. It doesn't take courage to stand up to \nthe gun lobby when 90 percent of your constituents want change to \nhappen. It takes courage to look into the eye of a shooter instead of \nrunning, wrapping your arms around a 6-year-old boy and accepting death \nas a trade for just a tiny, little, itty piece of increased peace of \nmind for a little boy under your charge.\n  So this has been a day of questions. I ask you all this question: If \nAnne Marie Murphy could do that, then ask yourself what you can do to \nmake sure that Orlando or Sandy Hook never ever happens again.\n  With deep gratitude to all of those who have endured this very late \nnight, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I wish to discuss a topic that has \nbeen near and dear to me my entire life: the importance of charities \nand charitable giving to the well-being of America. I am taking this \nmoment to discuss this issue for several reasons.\n  Late last year, Congress managed to make permanent a few of the \ntemporary charitable tax provisions that I have supported for years. \nSince then, two of my esteemed colleagues, Senator Thune and Senator \nWyden, have introduced legislation to enact several more important \ncharitable tax provisions. And later this week, the Alliance for \nCharitable Reform, the Council on Foundations, and the Independent \nSector will send its members to fan out across Capitol Hill to tell \nMembers of Congress and their staffs about the good and essential work \ncharities and nonprofits perform every day in America.\n  Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in ``Democracy in America'' of the \nimportance of intermediate associations that stand between the \nindividual and a centralized state. The Catholic Church speaks about \nsubsidiarity, the principle that matters ought to be handled by the \nleast centralized competent authority. To put these insights into \nconstitutional terms, the Federal Government cannot--and should not--do \nit all. The truth of these moral and legal principles is embodied in \nthe work of America's churches and charities, which have played a \ncritical role in securing the welfare of Americans throughout our \nNation's history when faced with difficulties like war, natural \ndisasters, and economic recessions and depressions.\n  And it is no secret that our economy has been growing much too slowly \nin recent years. That means that a healthy, well-resourced charitable \ncommunity is essential to the well-being of those in need. As State and \nlocal governments grapple with budget deficits and revenue shortfalls \nand as Americans face unemployment, stagnant wages, and lower workforce \nparticipation, people in need are turning for help in ever greater \nnumbers to churches, charities, shelters, and other social welfare \ngroups.\n\n[[Page S3978]]\n\n  But charities need resources to meet these needs, and charitable \ngiving by generous and civic-minded Americans is where it all starts. \nThat is why I have defended the tax deduction for charitable giving and \nI have resisted attempts by some to raise revenue for reckless \ngovernment spending by reducing the incentives for charitable giving. \nAs my friend and colleague Senator Wyden, the ranking member of the \nSenate Finance Committee, has said: ``The charitable deduction is a \nlifeline, not a loophole.''\n  It is essential that charities have sufficient resources to carry \nforward the good works our society so desperately needs them to \nperform. It makes perfect sense to provide the greatest tax incentive \nfor giving to the donors with the greatest capacity to give. These \ndonors, the ones in the high marginal tax brackets, are the very donors \nthat are in a position to give substantial amounts to charity. It \nshould come as no surprise that for nearly 100 years the Tax Code has \nprovided such an incentive.\n  And the charitable tax deduction is truly special. It is the only \ndeduction that encourages you not to spend or invest your income, but \nto give it away. Every charitable gift has one thing in common: The \ndonor is always left worse off financially, but society is made better.\n  So, yes, I am a champion of the charitable sector. And in addition to \ndefending the charitable deduction, I have promoted positive \nimprovements in the charitable tax law. Some of these proposals have \nbeen enacted. For example, last year, Congress made the IRA charitable \nrollover a permanent feature of the Tax Code, as well as the deduction \nfor contributions of food inventory to charity. Congress also extended \npublic charity status to agricultural research organizations associated \nwith a university.\n  But there is more to do.\n  Two colleagues that are leading the way in this Congress are Senator \nThune and Senator Wyden. They recently introduced the Charities Helping \nAmericans Regularly Throughout the Year, or CHARITY, Act. This bill \nwould complete some of the unfinished business from previous years. For \nexample, it expands the group of organizations eligible to receive \ncharitable IRA distributions, it makes a much needed reform to the \nprivate foundation excise tax, and it allows foundations to own \nbusinesses devoted to philanthropy.\n  We got close to passing some of these proposals late last year. They \ndidn't make it over the finish line, but we ought to revisit them and \ntry to pass them this year. These provisions, taken together, will help \nadvance the causes of worthwhile charities by allowing American \ntaxpayers to more freely donate their own resources. That is a good \nthing in my book, and that is why I intend to help my colleagues on the \nFinance Committee process the CHARITY Act and enact it into law.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/15/senate-section/article/S3977-2"}, {"day": "15", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3978-S3979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO RECIPIENTS OF THE CONGRESSIONAL AWARD\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to share with my colleagues the \nnames of this year's winners of the Congressional Award. Established in \n1979, the Congressional Award is a way for the U.S. Congress to \nrecognize the achievements of young Americans aged 14 to 23 years old. \nIt rewards them for success in four vital areas: volunteer public \nservice, personal development, physical fitness, and expedition-\nexploration.\n  Recipients choose the activities in each area that interest them and \nset goals that will challenge them and help them grow. If they are \nsuccessful, they earn bronze, silver, and gold certificates and medals. \nAlong the way, they have gained new skills and earned greater \nconfidence and positioned themselves to become productive, well-\nrounded, and accomplished citizens.\n  Each year in June, a ceremony is held here in the Nation's Capital to \npresent these young people with their Congressional Awards. I want to \npersonally congratulate every one of this year's winners for their \nachievements and for the example they set for others. By improving \ntheir own talents, the recipients of the 2016 Congressional Awards are \nstrengthening their communities and our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of this year's \nrecipients of the Congressional Award be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                  2016 CONGRESSIONAL AWARD RECIPIENTS\n\n       Gabriel Cutler, Sean Villeneuve Jr., Adriana Tapia, Jacob \n     Massie, Cydney Kaslar, Catherine Liang, Conor Hassett, Gianna \n     Chien, Dominic Solari, Griffin Ansel, Claire Dashe, Meghan \n     Leong, Ariane Tsai, William Chen, Terence Lee, Benjamin \n     Dotson, Madison DeBruin, Sienna Santer, Brandon Chen, Mark A. \n     Hanson, George McGuigan, John Monday, Kanhai Shah, Ken Iwane, \n     Carl Xue, William Gutzman, Erica Kang, SungMin Shin, Michael \n     Simic, Bryan Denq, Claire YeaLee, Devin Kanzler, Elizabeth \n     Sams, Brandon Winner, Angela SoyChon, Lynn Kim, Jaewoo Han, \n     Steve Han, Brandon Ho, Sora Jeong, Timothy Joo, Kayla Kang, \n     Charlotte Kim, Jay Kim, Vivian Kim, Joanne Lee, Junsu Lee, \n     Robert Lee, Sarah Lee, Bonnie Lei, Emily Mun, Esther Park, \n     Joo Min Yeo, Jae-Hee Yoo, Sang Yun, So Hee Ki, Jeong Inn Lee, \n     Hannah Park, Karan Shah, Joseph Bastien, Sarah Chen, Kayla \n     Jahangiri, Chris Jiang, Alexandra Lee, Samuel Sugarman, \n     Chelsea Barrows, Karl Garrett, Thomas Meiser, Christina Bear, \n     Lauren Lang, Eric Zhang.\n       Meredith Karle, Duncan Khosla, Allegra Molkenthin, \n     Charlotte Wechsler, Shaleen Thakur, Sonal Thakur, Shyla \n     Blackmon, Jelisa Jackson, Aliya Centner, Safia Centner, Peter \n     Lee, Parker Coye, Varun Singh, Evan Albury, Gabriel Coughlin, \n     Richard Coughlin, Laura Drake, Drew Dubauskas, Robert \n     Ferruggia, Madeline Horowitz, Samantha Keating, Cristina \n     Kodadek, Morgan McDonald, Regina Murphy, Noah Pack, Shikha \n     Patel, Austin Paxson, Thomas Pinkham, Mary Powers, Koushal \n     Rao, Hunter Russo, Joseph Russo, Tyler Wilkinson, Jillian \n     Wrieden, Gabriel Del Campo, Joshua Puchferran, Jade Gibson, \n     Dimitri Godur, Kara McDonough, Julia Abelsky, Elizabeth \n     Harvey, Katie RoseDionne, Noah Smith, Billy McGahan, Kathleen \n     Stueve, Elyssa Turnbull, Cheyenne Quilter, Eric Summers, \n     Kelly Turney, Sarah Close, Christian Cooper, Sarah Stephen, \n     Maddy Peticolas, Robert JamHuber.\n       Caroline Luehrmann, Carissa McAfee, Tiffany Dattel, Nikhil \n     Kuppuswamy, Megan Nalamachu, Ryan Olson, Melissa Rosenthal, \n     Gavin Zhu, Noah Gillis, Amanda Otten, Ben Otten, Audrey \n     Moore, Gabrielle Moore, Garima Dewan, Mahima Dewan, Lynda \n     Loucif, Rachel Steadman, Lillian Bermel, Sophia Duplin, \n     Catherine Upton, Elizabeth Monger, Megan Selby, Samuel \n     Chestna, Justin Conner, Emily Staunton, Christian Kunau, \n     David Kunau, Benjamin Baker, Hillary Burgess, Molly Chamblee, \n     Karynton NDuke, Dee-Ivy Franklin, John ``J.J.''

Mr. President, I am very concerned about section 563 in \nthe Senate-passed fiscal year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act \nrelated to access by institutions of higher education, IHE, to military \ninstallations purportedly for advising and support services.\n  The provision opens the floodgates to military bases and \nservicemembers for for-profit college recruiters. It guts the \nPresident's Principles of Excellence Executive order meant to protect \nservicemembers from aggressive or abusive recruiting practices on \nmilitary installations by requiring that an IHE be granted access to a \nmilitary installation if it has entered into a memorandum of \nunderstanding with the Department of Defense, DOD, and has been \napproved to provide services by the installation's educational service \nofficer. Regardless of other factors which may be of concern to DOD--\ninvestigations and lawsuits, infractions of the MOU, etc.--if an IHE \nconvinces a base's educational service officer to grant them access, \nthere is nothing DOD can do to stop it.\n  In addition, the provision provides preferential treatment to IHE's \nthat enroll large proportions of servicemembers. Providing access to \ninstallations based on how many servicemembers an IHE enrolls instead \nof the actual needs of the servicemembers at those installations does \nnothing to help improve services for enrolled servicemembers. Instead, \nit further entrenches the big for-profit players whose business models \nrely heavily on servicemembers. Those institutions will be able to tout \ntheir statutorily guaranteed increased access to military installations \nwhen recruiting.\n  Finally, as passed in the Senate, section 563 does not limit advising \nand support services to an IHE's currently enrolled students. There \nhave been well-documented cases of IHE's using access to military bases \ngained under the guise of offering advising and other services for \nrecruitment. The Senate-passed language does not limit an IHE's contact \nwith servicemembers, once on base, to students it currently enrolls. \nThis creates the opportunity for IHE's to clandestinely or openly use \ntheir access to recruit other servicemembers to their programs.\n  Because of the potential harm this provision in the Senate-passed \nbill will cause to servicemembers--giving near unrestricted access to \nfor-profit college recruiters at a time when most major companies are \nunder State or Federal investigations or lawsuits--I joined Senator \nBrown, along with Senators Warren, Blumenthal, Murray, Franken, Carper, \nMarkey, Murphy, Reed, Boxer, Heinrich, and Sanders, to introduce an \namendment to remove section 563 from the bill. Military and veterans \ngroups including the Air Force Sergeants Association, Association of \nthe United States Navy, Blue Star Families, Iraq and Afghanistan \nVeterans of America, Military Officers Association of America, Student \nVeterans of America, Veterans Education Success, and Vietnam Veterans \nof America submitted a letter in opposition to the provision. The \nattorneys general of California, Maine, Connecticut, Maryland, District \nof Columbia, Massachusetts, Hawaii, Minnesota, New York, Iowa, and \nPennsylvania also wrote of their opposition.\n  Not only is the provision harmful, but it is unnecessary. IHE's \nalready have the ability to gain access to military installations for \ncertain legitimate educational activities. I will work with others who \nare opposed to this provision to get it removed in conference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/15/senate-section/article/S3979-1"}, {"day": "15", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3979-S3980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MASS SHOOTING IN ORLANDO\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Marcelle and I, along with all Vermonters, \nwere devastated by the news of the attack in Orlando, and our hearts go \nout to the victims and their families. All Americans deserve to feel \nsafe in their communities regardless of their race, age, sex, \nethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation. In the wake of the worst \nmass shooting in American history, all of us must stand with the people \nof Orlando who have been so shaken by this hateful act of terrorism and \nviolence. And in particular, as we celebrate Pride Month, we must stand \nwith and support the LGBT community, both in Orlando and throughout the \nNation.\n  We are so thankful for the law enforcement officers and first \nresponders who rushed to the scene in the middle of the night to \nconfront the killer and save lives. We also are grateful for the work \nof the doctors and nurses who fought and continue to fight to save even \nmore. My wife, Marcelle, is a registered surgical nurse, and we have \nbeen deeply moved to see the outpouring of support by people across \nFlorida and the country who are donating blood and doing what they can \nto support the victims and their families.\n  In the wake of tragedies like this, whether the victims are members \nof the LGBT community, African-American church parishioners, first \ngraders in an elementary school, college students, moviegoers, or \nothers in our community, we are called as Americans to come together in \nsolidarity. We come together in grief and in shock. We come together in \nsupport of the victims, their families, law enforcement personnel and \nfirst responders, and the entire community. And we come together to try \nand find a way to prevent further acts of senseless violence. We are at \nour best as a nation when we come together. When we are united in \nstrength and in courageous acts of selflessness and kindness, our \ncountry can move forward with a greater sense of purpose and hope.\n  We must not allow ourselves to be divided by the bigoted actions of a \nmurderer or by any fear that the killer sought to foment. He took an \nassault rifle into a nightclub, one that was known as a special place \nin Orlando's LGBT community. He fired on a crowd of innocent, unarmed \npeople. This man was no fighter and certainly no soldier. This was \neither the act of a murderous bigot trying to shroud his hatred by \nprofessing allegiance to ISIL or the actions of a cowardly terrorist \nseeking to paralyze and divide us with fear--or perhaps both. In either \ncase, we cannot let his heinous acts lead us to turn on one another.\n  Some are already using this horrific attack as an opportunity to \nfurther divide us. The Republican Party's presumptive Presidential \nnominee continues to peddle his corrosive rhetoric of fear by proposing \nto ban all Muslims from entering the country. This week he went even \nfurther by suggested that the entire Muslim American community was \nsomehow complicit in this heinous act. This is irresponsible fear-\nmongering--plain and simple. It is guilt by association. And it makes \nus less safe. We should all condemn this bigotry and reject attempts to \nfoment fear and hatred. We are stronger and safer when we reject such \nattempts to divide us.\n  The Republican standard bearer has also questioned the motivations \nand patriotism of the President of the United States. These \ninsinuations are dangerous. They are beyond the pale, and I reject them \nemphatically and categorically. I call on every Member of this body to \ndo the same. We are a better nation than this.\n  The American people are rightfully demanding action instead of \nrhetoric. They are tired of hearing that the tragedy in Orlando and the \ncountless others we have endured are not about our gun laws. We must \nrecognize that we have a security weakness in this country and ISIL is \nexploiting it. Our enemies know that in the United States you can go \nonline or to a gun show and buy a gun. You don't need to have \nidentification. No background check will be run. You can simply acquire \na semiautomatic weapon that can kill dozens of people in a matter of \nminutes.\n  We must have universal background checks. That is simply common \nsense. We have had background checks for decades. I am among millions \nof responsible gun owners in this country who undergo background checks \nwhen we purchase a firearm. And, like millions of responsible gun \nowners, I understand that this check is necessary to help keep guns out \nof the hands of criminals and terrorists. It is common sense that we \nneed to close the loopholes that allow people to evade background \nchecks altogether. And we must also make sure that the background \nchecks are effective. That means giving law enforcement the power to \nstop\n\n[[Page S3980]]\n\na suspected terrorist, or someone who has recently been under \ninvestigation for terrorism, from buying a gun. It is also common sense \nthat assault weapons designed for the battlefield have no place on our \nstreets, in our schools, in our churches, or in our communities. I have \nmoved and supported an assault weapons ban for this simple reason.\n  These changes make sense, and they fix glaring vulnerabilities in our \nsystem. This is not about politics. This is about keeping Americans \nsafe. This is about stepping up and taking action and not just \nresigning ourselves to the repeated call for moments of silence, \ntragedy after tragedy. I am a responsible gun owner, and I do not take \nthis issue lightly. I have fought for years to pass these commonsense \nmeasures, and I will continue to do so.\n  Americans have shown throughout the course of history that we can \nlive up to the principles of freedom, equality, and liberty that have \nguided us for so long. Now is the time to stand defiantly against the \npetty politics of fear. Despite what others may say, we are a great \nnation.

Mr. President, Senator Murray and I rise today to \nspeak about our shared concerns with language included in this year's \nNational Defense Authorization Act, NDAA.\n  Section 578 of this year's National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA, \nis an inappropriate place from which to impose mandates on nearly \n20,000 public elementary and secondary schools in 1,225 public school \ndistricts across the country.\n  Legislative language is included in the NDAA this year that dictates \ndisruptive policies on public schools that would create a complicated \nand confusing system where one school system follows established \nbackground checks under State or local law, while a neighboring county \nmust now comply with a new unfunded Federal mandate. This language \nshould not be included in the final version of this bill.\n  The U.S. Senate takes seriously the goal of ensuring the safety of \nthe more than 50 million children in our 100,000 public schools, \nincluding federally connected children. These issues have been and \nshould be discussed, debated, and legislated within the appropriate \ncommittees of jurisdiction. Measures related to education are within \nthe jurisdiction of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee under Rule XXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate, as well \nas within the jurisdiction of the House Committee on Education and the \nWorkforce under Rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives for \nthe 114th Congress.\n  So while it may be appropriate for the Armed Services Committee to \ndictate background check policies for the 172 schools operated by the \nDepartment of Defense, it is not appropriate to use the authorization \nbill for the Department of Defense to impose mandates on nearly 20,000 \npublic elementary and secondary schools in 1,225 public school \ndistricts across the country.\n  These 20,000 public schools, out of 100,000 total, are being singled \nout because they receive ``Impact Aid'' funds from the Federal \nGovernment under title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct, ESEA, of 1965. The purpose of the program is to ``fulfill the \nFederal responsibility to assist with the provision of educational \nservices to federally connected children in a manner that promotes \ncontrol by local educational agencies with little or no Federal or \nState involvement.''\n  According to the Government Accountability Office, 46 States already \nrequire background checks of some kind for all public school employees, \nand 42 States have established professional standards or codes of \nconduct for school personnel. Section 578 of the NDAA would create \nconfusion for all those States and localities, as they are forced to \nnavigate two sets of potentially conflicting background checks \npolicies.\n  As chairman and ranking members of the Senate HELP Committee, Senator \nMurray and I worked tirelessly last year to pass a long-overdue \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Our law, \ncalled the Every Student Succeeds Act, addressed the issue of \nbackground checks.\n  I now want to yield to my colleague, Mrs. Murray, to speak on this \nissue.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman of the HELP \nCommittee, Senator Alexander, for his comments.\n  I share his concerns that section 578 of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act bill is not the right way to ensure students can \nlearn in safe and secure school environments, and will impose unfair \nand unreasonable requirements on more than 1,200 schools districts \nacross the country. Criminal background checks are a critically \nimportant means to ensure that students are safe in our schools, and \nthat is why they are required in 46 States. But the language of section \n578 will force the 1,225 school districts that receive Impact Aid \nfunds--and which are in almost every State--to have two separate \ncriminal background check systems for different schools and different \nemployees within a single school district. It is costly, duplicative, \npoorly conceived, and should not be part of a Defense authorization \nbill.\n  In my State of Washington 628 schools, about a quarter of our public \nschools, receive Impact Aid funds and would be subject to a separate \nexpensive set of background checks that differs from the background \nchecks already conducted. In the chairman's State, 571 schools receive \nImpact Aid funds and would be subject to this different standard. It is \nfundamentally unfair and not beneficial to students to ask our schools \nand our school districts to assume the costs of these checks, which are \nsimilar to but not exactly the same as those already conducted in our \nStates.\n\n[[Page S3981]]\n\n  Our highest priority is making sure students in schools across the \ncountry are protected. But I agree with the chairman that section 578 \nof the National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA, is not the right way \nto help schools effectively protect their students. As the Chairman \nalready noted, the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act that occurred less than a year ago took a major step \nforward in protecting unsuspecting students and families from school \nemployees suspected of abuse in previous positions. We incentivized \nschools and districts to report cases of suspected abuse to law \nenforcement and made it far more difficult for schools to quietly allow \nsuspected abusers to seek employment in another State or school \ndistrict. The amendment that provided those protections was adopted by \na vote of 98-0.\n  While this was an important step forward, I continue to look for ways \nto build on it and continue our work making sure students are being \nprotected most effectively. Unfortunately, rather than taking the \nimportant step of extending similar protections for students to schools \noperated by the Department of Defense, the bill instead overrides a \ncomprehensive Department of Defense criminal background check \nregulation that provides strong new protections to students and is less \nthan a year old. NDAA section 578 imposes a background check system \nwith serious problems on DOD schools and then further extends that \nproblematic background check system to non-Department of Defense \nschools all over the country.\n  Section 578 imposes a system of criminal background checks that \nprohibits people from working in any capacity in these schools if they \nhave committed low-level offenses having nothing to do with violence or \nchildren. Unlike the laws in 29 States, as well as the new Department \nof Defense regulation, section 578 of the NDAA offers employees no way \nto demonstrate mitigating circumstances and requires that employees are \nterminated while appealing a finding, even though these records are \noften inaccurate or incomplete.\n  Section 578 is unnecessary, expensive, unfairly creates competing \nbackground check systems in States across the county and, most \nimportantly, is not the right way to ensure our schools are safe. This \nprovision is not within the jurisdiction of the Armed Services \nCommittee, and I join the chairman in his position that it should not \nbe included in the final bill.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator for engaging in the colloquy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/15/senate-section/article/S3980-2"}, {"day": "15", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3981-S3982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DACA 4-YEAR ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I wish to speak on this fourth \nanniversary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, \nDACA, for all of the young men and young women it has helped bring out \nof the shadows--young men and woman who came to this country as \nchildren and, because of DACA, have had the security of temporary \ndeportation relief and work authorization so they could achieve their \nfull potential as young Americans.\n  I celebrate DACA's anniversary with great pride and tremendous hope. \nFor years, I pushed hard to make this program a reality.\n  I have spoken directly--and frankly--to the President many times \nabout granting long-overdue administrative relief to DREAMers, who are \nAmericans in every way except for a piece of paper.\n  And 4 years ago, with the tireless advocacy of DREAMers and the power \nof their individual stories, with the help of the immigrant community, \ncommunity leaders in cities and towns across America, and countless \nMembers of Congress, the President took action and changed the lives of \nthousands of young men and women, allowing them to fully contribute to \nthe country they call home--the only country they have ever known. DACA \nrecipients are part of our communities in all 50 States.\n  New Jersey ranks ninth in the Nation, with over 34,000 approved DACA \napplications. These young people have been granted the most important \nthing they could have: the peace of mind that comes with temporary \nprotection from deportation and the ability to work and contribute.\n  Since its inception, DACA has harnessed their talents in measurable \nways and is a success today because of the President's bold Executive \nactions in June of 2012. In an immigration system as flawed as ours, \nDACA has been a beacon of hope, one shining light leading the way \ntoward fairness, justice, and a better life for so many immigrants \nlooking for a chance to succeed in America as Americans.\n  The numbers tell the story. DACA has been granted to approximately \n728,000 young immigrants. It has strengthened our economy. A survey by \nthe National Immigration Law Center and the Center for American \nProgress found that after obtaining DACA, more than two-thirds of \nrecipients were able to secure a job with higher pay and their wages \nrose by an average of 45 percent.\n  Higher wages are not just good for DACA recipients, but for all \nAmericans; it stimulates economic growth and translates into more tax \nrevenue.\n  DACA has allowed young Americans to open bank accounts, get a \ndriver's license, go to college, and prepare for a stable, economically \nsecure, and financially solvent future for themselves and their \nfamilies.\n  There is no question in my mind--and the numbers prove it--that DACA \nhas been a model of success, and that success has been shaped by the \ncourageous young men and women who decided to come forward, register \nwith the government, subject themselves to a background check, work \nhard, and take advantage of every single opportunity that DACA \nprovides.\n  These young men and women and their families represent who we are as \na nation. They embody the spirit of American life, which has always \nbeen shaped by the hopes, dreams, and courage of those who have made \nthis country their home.\n  In the absence of comprehensive immigration reform, DACA allows these \nyoung people to live with dignity and without the fear of deportation--\nthe fear of being separated from their families. Now, they are our \nnewest college students, teachers, and small business owners.\n  So here we are--with the perspective of 4 years of DACA success, 4 \nyears of dreams fulfilled, potential reached--and proof that all of \nAmerica benefits when an undocumented individual steps out of the \nshadows--proof that, when we give people a chance, they can make it on \ntheir own ingenuity, skill, and hard work, and they will not only \ncontribute to the economy, but to the strength of America.\n  With the lessons of 4 years of DACA, it should be clear that we need \nto build upon DACA's success, not turn our backs on extending fair \nopportunities to those who are willing to work hard for them.\n  For many, the dream began with DACA. For others, the dream remains \nonly a dream, delayed because of the politically motivated lawsuit of \nU.S. v. Texas. A case which has blocked the President's more recent \nExecutive actions, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Legal \nPermanent Residents, DAPA, and expanded DACA from being implemented.\n  These new programs provide temporary relief from deportation and a \nwork permit to parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent resident \nchildren and a larger group of DREAMers.\n  The case is currently before the Supreme Court, and we expect the \nCourt to issue a decision this month.\n  I attended oral arguments on April 18 and remain hopeful that the \nJustices will see through the hate and the political theater, and that \nit will be clear that our Nation governs by its values, that we favor \nbuilding bridges instead of walls.\n  And I am not alone in that hope. I was joined by 224 Members of \nCongress in filing an amicus brief outlining the legality and \nimportance of implementing the President's DAPA and expanded DACA \nprograms.\n  We felt the need to show our support for the President's actions \nwhile pushing back against the jingoism, isolationism, and xenophobia \nof those who insist on leaving millions of families, millions of \nparents of U.S. children stuck in the shadows.\n  With this case, the Supreme Court has an opportunity to do something \npositive: to provide temporary relief from deportation and a work \npermit to almost 4 million parents of U.S. citizens and lawful \npermanent residents.\n\n[[Page S3982]]\n\n  It would allow the current DACA program to be expanded to benefit \nalmost 300,000 more DREAMers. Combined, these programs would help \nalmost 5 million immigrants waiting for a chance to come out of the \nshadows.\n  And we know, at the end of the day, when all is said and done, DAPA \nand expanded DACA have one dramatic impact that cannot be denied: They \ngive young people and their parents the peace of mind every family \ndeserves--to be able to build their lives together.\n  It is my sincere hope that the politics of what is happening in this \nlawsuit and with the immigration rhetoric in general will be abundantly \nclear to the Supreme Court and we will have a positive ruling that \nallows expanded DACA and DAPA to move forward, bring some order, and \nkeep hard-working families together.\n  I believe the Supreme Court will agree that the President's Executive \nactions are within his legal authority, that they represent the very \nbest of American values and a fundamental respect for family unity. \nThis is a pivotal legal battle over what amounts to the basic humanity \nof American immigration policy. I am not exaggerating when I say that \npeople's lives and families are at stake.\n  It is personal. I have spoken to police chiefs, teachers, religious \nleaders, moms and dads, and U.S. citizen children, and it is clear that \nthese policies are just and humane to keep these families together.\n  Ultimately, the only way to fix our broken immigration system is for \nCongress to pass comprehensive immigration legislation. I will continue \nto fight for comprehensive immigration reform that will fix our \nNation's broken immigration system once and for all, not just because \nit makes good economic sense, but because it is the right thing to do--\nbecause we are a nation of immigrants.\n  DACA's success should further encourage Congress to move forward, \nfortified by the conviction that comprehensive immigration reform is a \nfight worth fighting for.\n  But today I join my colleagues in commemorating DACA's anniversary as \na day that marks 4 years of smart and successful policy, as a step in \nthe right direction, and as a foundation upon which we can continue to \nbuild. The foundation that the Supreme Court should look to when ruling \non DAPA and expanded DACA.\n  Let's work to extend the American Dream to all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/15/senate-section/article/S3981-1"}, {"day": "15", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING MITCHELL WINEY\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, today, I wish to honor West Point Cadet \nMitchell Winey of Chesterton, IN, who tragically passed away along with \neight other soldiers during a military training accident at Fort Hood, \nTexas, on June 2. He was 21 years old.\n  Mitchell was everything a parent hopes for in a son. He was kind, \nhard-working, and someone the community of Chesterton was proud to \nknow. He was an honor roll student, captain of the soccer team, prom \nking, and class president for 4 years at Chesterton High School. \nMitchell was a born leader, who lived his life in service to others. He \nwas someone who inspired his friends and family to step outside of \ntheir comfort zones and try new things. He was also the friend who came \nhome on leave and immediately visited a fellow student he used to \ntutor.\n  In 2013, I had the honor of nominating Mitchell for the U.S. Military \nAcademy at West Point, after he came to my office seeking to fulfill \nhis dream of serving our country and becoming a West Point cadet. In \nhis application for an academy nomination, Mitchell wrote, ``Attending \none of the United States' service academies will help me grow to be the \nbest officer I could become. Through all the rigorous leadership, \ncommunication, and military training, any of the service academies \nwould help me grow to not only be the best person I could be, but the \nbest officer I could possibly be.''\n  At West Point, Mitchell was an emerging leader in his class and a \ndedicated cadet. Mitchell personified the ideals and values of West \nPoint--duty, honor, and country--as he pursued a major in engineering \nmanagement and excelled both academically and athletically as a member \nof the Ski Patrol and founding member of the newly formed freestyle ski \nteam.\n  The loss of Mitchell is felt by West Point, Chesterton, and the State \nof Indiana. He touched many lives and left an impact on all who knew \nhim. Mitchell will be remembered not only for his selfless service but \nfor his positive attitude, contagious smile, caring nature, love of \nlife, as well as for the love he had for his family, friends, and our \ncountry.\n  Mitchell is survived and deeply missed by his parents, Tim and Margo \nWiney, and his sister, Paige Winey-Scheuer. His loss is felt by his \nfellow cadets, the entire Chesterton community, and all who had the \npleasure of knowing Mitchell. Let us always remember and emulate the \nshining example this dedicated, modest young man set for us, and honor \nhim for his commitment to serving his fellow citizens. May God welcome \nMitchell home and shed his grace on his family, friends, and fellow \ncadets.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/15/senate-section/article/S3982-1"}, {"day": "15", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              225TH ANNIVERSARY OF CROYDON, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Croydon, NH, \na wonderful community in Sullivan County that is celebrating the 250th \nanniversary of its founding.\n  Croydon sits atop the plateaus between the Connecticut and Merrimack \nRivers. The charter of Croydon was signed by Colonial Governor Benning \nWentworth and witnessed by Theodore Atkinson on May 31, 1763. Named for \na suburb of London, England, Croydon was incorporated and granted to 71 \nindividuals.\n  In the spring of 1766, individuals hailing from Grafton, MA, made \ntheir way to Croydon to begin the settlement process. On June 10, 1766, \nthe Chase family became the first family in Croydon. The first town \nmeeting was held March 8, 1768, and since that time, the population has \ngrown to include 764 residents as of the year 2010.\n  Known for its mountainous terrain, Croydon is home to many peaks and \nhills. Croydon Peak is the highest location in Sullivan County with an \nelevation of 2,756 feet, and it extends across the western portion of \nthe town. Pine Hill lies in the eastern part. Due to Croydon's access \nto the Sugar River, the town is well-fertilized, which encouraged \nresidents to become skilled in agriculture and raising cattle.\n  Croydon's most notable landmark is the ``Little Red School,'' which \nis reported to be the longest continuously operated one-room \nschoolhouse since the late 1700s. Little Red first opened in 1794 and \ntoday is the schoolhouse for the third and fourth grade classes.\n  In the year of 2016, we join together to honor the 250th anniversary \nof Croydon. Croydon has contributed greatly to the State of New \nHampshire. I am proud to salute its citizens and recognize their \naccomplishments, their love of country, and their spirit of \nindependence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/15/senate-section/article/S3982-2"}, {"day": "15", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3982-S3983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DANIELLE TA'SHEENA FINN\n\n Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I want to congratulate Danielle \nTa'Sheena Finn, a resident of the great State of North Dakota, on being \ncrowned the 2016-2017 Miss Indian World.\n  The Miss Indian World competition is the largest and most prestigious \ncultural pageant for young Native women and was recently held during \nthe Gathering of Nations Powwow at the University of New Mexico in \nAlbuquerque. Twenty-four contestants from across the United States and \nCanada were judged on public speaking, personal interview, talent \npresentation, traditional dance, and essay. Throughout the competition, \ncontestants demonstrated an in-depth knowledge of their culture and \ntribal history. Danielle won ``Best Public Speaking'' and ``Best \nPersonal Interview.'' Her traditional talent was an explanation, song, \nand dance of the Lakota Penny Dress.\n  Danielle is the first tribal member from the Standing Rock Sioux \nTribe to be crowned Miss Indian World. At 25 years old, she is a 3rd-\nyear law student at Arizona State University and will graduate a \nsemester early in December. Danielle also has a degree in criminal \njustice and a minor in international\n\n[[Page S3983]]\n\nbusiness from Minot State University. In 2014, the Center for Native \nAmerican Youth recognized Danielle as a prestigious ``Champion for \nChange,'' which she achieved through a national nomination process for \naspiring young Native leaders. Danielle also served as an intern in my \nBismarck office where she displayed a sense of leadership. Through her \ninternship, I had the opportunity to see firsthand the compassion she \nhas for others and her eagerness to make a positive difference.\n  Danielle plans to use the platform of Miss Indian World to advocate \nfor suicide prevention and higher education. As a speaker of her \ntraditional Lakota language, Danielle also plans to advocate for Native \nlanguage preservation. The National Congress of American Indians has \ndeclared Native languages to be in a state of emergency. According to \nthe United Nations Organization for Education, Science, and Culture, 74 \nNative languages stand to disappear within the next decade. Equally \nalarming, scholars project that without immediate and persistent \naction, only 20 Native languages will still be spoken by 2050.\n  As Congress works to support Native youth and address their holistic \nneeds that include behavioral and mental health issues, it is \nheartening to see Danielle be a strong voice in areas so critical to \nhelping her tribe and community members succeed.

A bill to provide an exception from certain group health \nplan requirements for qualified small employer health reimbursement \narrangements; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for much of this Congress, I have been \nworking on a bipartisan basis to correct a little understood provision \nin the Affordable Care Act, ACA, that punishes small businesses for \nattempting to help their employees purchase individual insurance.\n  That is right, this provision actually punishes businesses that want \nto do the right thing and help their employees obtain health insurance \ncoverage.\n  This is a result of so-called market reforms in the ACA, which based \non IRS guidance generally prohibit employers from reimbursing their \nemployees for the cost of health insurance the employee purchases on \nthe individual market. An employer who does do this faces a $100 a day \nper employee penalty.\n  This fails to meet the common sense test, particularly when it comes \nto farmers, ranchers, and small business owners who frequently do not \nhave the resources to offer a traditional group health plan to their \nemployees.\n  These businesses have no obligation under the ACA to offer any form \nof insurance. However, they would like to do what they can to help \ntheir employees obtain coverage. This is a practice that should be \ncommended, not penalized.\n  This is why last June 1 introduced the Small Business Health Care \nRelief Act with Senator Heitkamp. Under our bill, small businesses \nwould once again be able to do something many have done for years. \nNamely, reimburse their employees on a pre-tax basis for the purchase \nof health insurance on the individual market.\n  Since introduction, Senator Heitkamp and I have been working, along \nwith Congressman Boustany and Thompson in the House, with the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation and Treasury to get feedback on our bill to \nensure it works as intended.\n  I am pleased today to see that this hard work is starting to bear \nfruit. The Ways and Means Committee marked up and favorably reported to \nthe full House a slightly revised version of our bill with bipartisan \nsupport.\n  In hopes of continuing this momentum, Senator Heitkamp and I are \nreintroducing this revised version of the Small Business Health Care \nRelief Act in the Senate today.\n  This new version mainly makes improvements to the bill to ensure the \nbill will work as intended. Further, in order to address cost concerns, \nthe bill imposes a generous limit on the amount an employer may provide \nto their employee to purchase individual insurance. This limit is set \nat $5,130 for individuals and $10,260 for a family. These amounts are \nindexed for inflation going forward.\n  I am pleased that our bill continues to have strong support from the \nsmall business community, including the National Association of Home \nBuilders, the National Association for the Self-Employed, the National \nFederation of Independent Business, the Council for Affordable Health \nCoverage, the American Farm Bureau, and many more.\n  This legislation should be a no brainer for anyone who supports small \nbusiness. I hope with today's action in the Ways and Means Committee, \nit is only a matter of time before this legislation becomes law. I urge \nall my colleagues to work with Senator Heitkamp and me to see to it \nthat this becomes a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/15/senate-section/article/S3985-1"}, {"day": "15", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3985-S3986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4685.

and\n       (E) misaligned priorities that result in unified combatant \n     commands being overly focused on mission support activities \n     (such as intelligence analysis and regional theater \n     engagement) and insufficiently focused on the operational \n     missions of the combatant commands.\n       (4) Preparation.--Each plan under this subsection shall be \n     prepared in consultation with the Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff and the commander of the combatant command \n     concerned.\n       (5) Deadline for development.--Any plan to be developed \n     under this subsection shall be completed by not later than \n     March 1, 2017.\n       (6) Submittal to congress.--Upon completion of the \n     development of a plan under this subsection, the Secretary \n     shall submit such plan to the congressional defense \n     committees.\n       (7) Implementation.--The Secretary shall commence \n     implementation of each plan developed under this subsection \n     for purposes of the pilot program by not later than September \n     1, 2017.\n       (d) Joint Task Forces.--\n       (1) In general.--Each joint task force established for \n     purposes of the pilot program pursuant to a plan under \n     subsection (c) shall be--\n       (A) established and organized as a cross-functional team \n     with the primary purpose of performing an identified mission \n     or providing essential support and enabling capabilities to \n     task forces performing such missions;\n       (B) assigned the necessary number and mixture of Armed \n     Forces personnel and related capabilities to perform the \n     mission of such task force;\n       (C) organized and sized in a manner that best reflects the \n     scope, scale, complexity, and priority of the mission that \n     such task force is required to perform or support;\n       (D) comprised of representatives from each functional \n     component from across the Department of Defense that is \n     relevant to the performance of the mission of such task \n     force, including the Armed Forces, other unified combatant \n     commands, other joint task forces that are subordinate to the \n     same or another unified combatant command, defense \n     intelligence agencies, other combat support agencies, and \n     acquisition offices; and\n       (E) commanded by a military officer of appropriate grade \n     who would be selected as prescribed by section 164(e) of \n     title 10, United States Code, and overseen by the commander \n     of the combatant command as prescribed by section 164(d) of \n     such title were such joint task force the subordinate command \n     of a unified combatant command.\n       (2) Purposes.--The purpose of each joint task force \n     established pursuant to this subsection shall be to achieve \n     the operational military mission of such task force, \n     including by--\n       (A) integrating all the functional components within such \n     task force into joint efforts;\n       (B) producing integrated operational plans, consistent with \n     the orders of the commander of the combatant command \n     concerned and the defense strategy of the Department of \n     Defense;\n       (C) recommending to the commander of the combatant command \n     concerned any additional resources and capabilities that the \n     commander of such joint task force determines necessary to \n     achieve the mission of such task force;\n       (D) providing better alignment and unity of effort with \n     other joint task forces within the combatant command \n     concerned or other unified combatant commands that are \n     performing related missions or addressing similar threats;\n       (E) conducting engagements with foreign partners from the \n     area of responsibility of such task force that are necessary \n     to achieving the military mission of such task force; and\n       (F) experimenting with new operational concepts and \n     developmental capabilities that the commander of such task \n     force considers essential to the mission of such task force.\n       (e) Report.--Not later than September 1, 2018, the \n     Secretary shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees a report that includes, for each plan developed \n     under subsection (c) for purposes of the pilot program, the \n     following:\n       (1) A description of such plan.\n       (2) An assessment of the positive and negative effects of \n     such plan.\n       (3) A description of key factors that contributed to the \n     success or failure of such plan.\n       (4) Recommendations on whether, and in what manner, to \n     apply such plan to unified combatant commands not covered by \n     the pilot program.\n\n     SEC. 925.

ORGANIZATIONAL STRATEGY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF \n                   DEFENSE.\n\n       (a) Organizational Strategy Required.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than July 20, 2017, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall formulate and issue to the \n     Department of Defense an organizational strategy for the \n     Department that--\n       (A) identifies the most important missions and other \n     organizational outputs for the Department, including the \n     manner in which capabilities for such missions will be \n     generated and objectives for such outputs will be achieved;\n       (B) reforms the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the \n     manner in which it operates to support the Secretary;\n       (C) improves management of relationships and processes \n     involving the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff, the combatant commands, the military \n     departments, and the Defense Agencies;\n       (D) improves and professionalizes the supervision of the \n     Defense Agencies; and\n       (E) improves support to the President and the National \n     Security Council in interagency processes and deliberations.\n       (2) Objectives.--The objectives of the strategy shall be as \n     follows:\n       (A) To enable the Department to integrate the expertise and \n     capacities of the components of the Department for effective \n     and efficient achievement of the missions of the Department.\n       (B) To enable the Department to focus on critical missions \n     that span multiple functional issues, to frame competing and \n     alternative courses of action, and to make clear and \n     effective strategic choices in a timely manner to achieve \n     such missions.\n       (C) To clarify responsibility and accountability in the \n     decision-making processes in the Department.\n       (D) To enable the Department to anticipate, adapt, and \n     innovate rapidly to changes in the threats facing the United \n     States, and to exploit the opportunities to counter such \n     threats offered by technological and organizational advances.\n       (E) To improve the ability of the Department to work \n     effectively in interagency processes in order to better serve \n     the President and the National Security Council and to better \n     contribute to national security missions.\n       (F) To achieve an organizational structure with fewer \n     layers of management and reduced levels of staffing that \n     performs better than the current organizational structure of \n     the Department.\n       (3) Impediments to be addressed.--The strategy shall \n     address, and seek to overcome, the following:\n       (A) Sequential, hierarchical planning and decision-making \n     processes oriented around functional bureaucratic structures \n     that are excessively parochial, duplicative, resistant to \n     integration, and result in unclear, consensus-based outcomes \n     that often constrain the ability of the Department to achieve \n     core missions effectively and efficiently.\n       (B) Layering of management structures and processes that \n     result in decisions being made by higher levels of management \n     where the authority for cross-functional integration exists \n     but detailed substantive expertise is often lacking or being \n     reduced to lowest common denominator recommendations to \n     senior leaders that suppress rather than resolve disputes \n     across functional organizations.\n       (C) Weak leadership skills and culture in the Office of the \n     Secretary of Defense.\n       (D) Misaligned incentives and a culture that rewards \n     bureaucratic parochialism and inertia, risk avoidance, and \n     the deferral or delay of decisions.\n       (4) Causes of impediments to be eliminated.--In connection \n     with the impediments specified in paragraph (3), the strategy \n     shall address, and seek to eliminate, the following:\n       (A) A noncollaborative culture within the Department that \n     lacks shared purpose and values.\n       (B) Risk aversion arising from fear of the consequences of \n     real or perceived failure, or from the absence of positive or \n     negative incentives to reduce such risk aversion.\n       (C) Lack of viable alternative mechanisms for achieving the \n     integration of the functional components of the Department \n     and for aligning expertise and decision-making authority at \n     the most efficient levels of management.\n       (5) Solutions.--In connection with the impediments \n     specified in paragraph (3) and the causes of such impediments \n     specified in\n\n[[Page S4093]]\n\n     paragraph (4), the strategy shall specify, and seek to \n     achieve, the following:\n       (A) Cross-functional teams to manage the major missions and \n     other high-priority outputs of the Department that inherently \n     cross functional boundaries (in this section referred to as \n     ``mission teams'').\n       (B) A collaborative, team-oriented, results-driven, and \n     innovative culture within the Department that fosters an open \n     debate of ideas and alternative courses of action.\n       (C) A simplified organizational structure for the \n     Department with reduced layers of management and increased \n     spans of control.\n       (D) Streamlined processes designed to produce improved \n     performance in less time.\n       (b) Action in Support of Strategy.--During the period \n     between the date of the enactment of this Act and the \n     appointment of the Secretary of Defense first appointed in \n     2017, the current

that team members are properly trained in \n     teamwork, collaboration, conflict resolution, and \n     appropriately represent the views of their functional \n     components without inappropriately pursuing the interests of \n     their functional components; and\n       (E) make the team leader available to the congressional \n     defense committees to provide periodic updates

In 2010, the two nations signed an agreement \n     updating and extending several provisions of the Compact, \n     including an extension of United States financial and program \n     assistance to Palau, and establishing increased post-9/11 \n     immigration protections. However, the United States has not \n     yet approved this Agreement or provided the assistance as \n     called for in the Agreement.\n       (8) Beginning in 2010 and most recently on February 22, \n     2016, the Department of the Interior, the Department of \n     State, and the Department of Defense have sent letters to \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro \n     Tempore of the Senate transmitting the legislation to approve \n     the 2010 United States Palau Agreement including an analysis \n     of the budgetary impact of the legislation.\n       (9) The February 22, 2016, letter concluded, ``Approving \n     the results of the Agreement is important to the national \n     security of the United States, stability in the Western \n     Pacific region, our bilateral relationship with Palau and to \n     the United States' broader strategic interest in the Asia-\n     Pacific region.''\n       (10) On May 20, 2016, the Department of Defense submitted a \n     letter to the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the \n     congressional defense committees in support of including \n     legislation enacting the agreement in the fiscal year 2017 \n     National Defense Authorization Act and concluded that its \n     inclusion advances United States national security objectives \n     in the region.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) to fulfill the promise and commitment of the United \n     States to its ally, the Republic of Palau, and reaffirm this \n     special relationship and strengthen the ability of the United \n     States to defend the homeland, Congress and the President \n     should promptly enact the Compact Review Agreement signed by \n     the United States and Palau in 2010; and\n       (2) Congress and the President should immediately seek a \n     mutually acceptable solution to approving the Compact Review \n     Agreement and ensuring adequate budgetary resources are \n     allocated to meet United States obligations under the Compact \n     through enacting legislation, including through this Act.\n\n                   Subtitle I--Human Rights Sanctions\n\n     SEC. 1281.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NUCLEAR DETERRENCE.\n\n       The following is the sense of Congress:\n       (1) The nuclear forces of the United States continue to \n     play a fundamental role in deterring aggression against the \n     interests of the United States and its allies in an \n     increasingly dangerous world in which foreign adversaries, \n     including the Russian Federation, are making explicit nuclear \n     threats against the United States and its allies. Strong \n     United States nuclear forces assure United States allies that \n     the extended deterrence guarantees of the United States are \n     credible and that the resolve of the United States remains \n     strong even in the face of nuclear provocations, including \n     nuclear coercion and blackmail.\n       (2) The prevention of war through effective deterrence \n     requires survivable and flexible nuclear forces that are well \n     exercised and ready to respond to nuclear escalation if \n     necessary. Possessing a range of capabilities and options to \n     counter nuclear threats assures United States allies and \n     enhances the credibility of United States nuclear deterrence \n     by reinforcing the resolve of the United States in the minds \n     of United States allies and potential adversaries.\n       (3) The declared policy of the United States with respect \n     to the use of nuclear weapons must be coordinated and \n     communicate clearly that the use of nuclear weapons against \n     the United States or its vital interests would ultimately \n     fail and subject the aggressor to incalculable consequences.\n       (4) In support of a strong and credible nuclear deterrent, \n     the United States must--\n\n[[Page S4152]]\n\n       (A) maintain a nuclear force with a diverse, flexible range \n     of nuclear yield and delivery modes that are ready, capable, \n     and credible;\n       (B) afford the highest priority to the modernization of the \n     nuclear triad, dual-capable aircraft, and related command and \n     control elements; and\n       (C) ensure the broadest participation of United States \n     allies in nuclear defense planning, training, and exercises \n     to demonstrate the commitment of the United States and its \n     allies and their solidarity against nuclear threats and \n     coercion.\n       (5) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) must make \n     it clear at the NATO summit in Warsaw, Poland, in July 2016 \n     that NATO has taken steps to address the nuclear provocations \n     of the Russian Federation, particularly including steps to \n     counter any calculation by the Russian Federation that the \n     use of nuclear weapons against NATO members could have other \n     than incalculable consequences for the Russian Federation. \n     Effective deterrence requires that NATO clearly communicate \n     that reality to the leaders of the Russian Federation, \n     conduct realistic nuclear planning and exercises, and \n     modernize the full suite of dual-capable aircraft and \n     associated command and control networks and facilities.\n\n     SEC. 1655.
