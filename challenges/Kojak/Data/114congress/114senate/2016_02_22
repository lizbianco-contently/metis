Pursuant to the order of the Senate of January \n24, 1901, the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Coons, will now read \nWashington's Farewell Address.\n  Mr. COONS, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows:\n\nTo the people of the United States\n  Friends and Fellow-Citizens: The period for a new election of a \ncitizen to administer the executive government of the United States \nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts \nmust be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with \nthat important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may \nconduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I \nshould now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline \nbeing considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to \nbe made.\n  I beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured that \nthis resolution has not been taken without a strict regard to all the \nconsiderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful \ncitizen to his country--and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \ndiminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful \nrespect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction \nthat the step is compatible with both.\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in, the office to which \nyour suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of \ninclination to the opinion of duty and to a deference for what appeared \nto be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been much \nearlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at \nliberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had \nbeen reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, \nprevious to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an \naddress to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then \nperplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and \nthe unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me \nto abandon the idea.\n  I rejoice that the state of your concerns, external as well as \ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible \nwith the sentiment of duty or propriety and am persuaded, whatever \npartiality may be retained for my services, that in the present \ncircumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination \nto retire.\n  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were \nexplained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I \nwill only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards \nthe organization and administration of the government the best \nexertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not \nunconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, \nexperience in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, \nhas strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself, and every day the \nincreasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the shade\n\n[[Page S890]]\n\nof retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied \nthat if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my services, \nthey were temporary, I have the consolation to believe that, while \nchoice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, patriotism \ndoes not forbid it.\n  In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the \ncareer of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend the \ndeep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved \ncountry for the many honors it has conferred upon me, still more for \nthe steadfast confidence with which it has supported me and for the \nopportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable \nattachment by services faithful and persevering, though in usefulness \nunequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country from these \nservices, let it always be remembered to your praise and as an \ninstructive example in our annals that, under circumstances in which \nthe passions agitated in every direction were liable to mislead, amidst \nappearances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune often \ndiscouraging, in situations in which not unfrequently want of success \nhas countenanced the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your support \nwas the essential prop of the efforts and a guarantee of the plans by \nwhich they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall \ncarry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows \nthat Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; \nthat your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free \nconstitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly \nmaintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped \nwith wisdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of \nthese states, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so \ncareful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will \nacquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the \naffection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.\n  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, \nwhich cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger \nnatural to that solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present to \noffer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent \nreview, some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no \ninconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important to the \npermanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you \nwith the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested \nwarnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive \nto bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your \nindulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar \noccasion.\n  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your \nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm \nthe attachment.\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now \ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of \nyour real independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your \npeace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty \nwhich you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that, from \ndifferent causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, \nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this \ntruth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which \nthe batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly \nand actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of \ninfinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of \nyour national Union to your collective and individual happiness; that \nyou should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it; \naccustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of \nyour political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation \nwith jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a \nsuspicion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly \nfrowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any \nportion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties \nwhich now link together the various parts.\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens \nby birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to \nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you \nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of \npatriotism more than any appellation derived from local \ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same \nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a \ncommon cause fought and triumphed together. The independence and \nliberty you possess are the work of joint councils and joint efforts--\nof common dangers, sufferings, and successes.\n  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves \nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more \nimmediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds \nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the \nUnion of the whole.\n  The North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected \nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of \nthe latter great additional resources of maritime and commercial \nenterprise and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The South \nin the same intercourse, benefitting by the agency of the North, sees \nits agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning partly into its \nown channels the seamen of the North, it finds its particular \nnavigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in different ways, to \nnourish and increase the general mass of the national navigation, it \nlooks forward to the protection of a maritime strength to which itself \nis unequally adapted. The East, in a like intercourse with the West, \nalready finds, and in the progressive improvement of interior \ncommunications by land and water will more and more find a valuable \nvent for the commodities which it brings from abroad or manufactures at \nhome. The West derives from the East supplies requisite to its growth \nand comfort--and what is perhaps of still greater consequence, it must \nof necessity owe the secure enjoyment of indispensable outlets for its \nown productions to the weight, influence, and the future maritime \nstrength of the Atlantic side of the Union, directed by an indissoluble \ncommunity of interest as one nation. Any other tenure by which the West \ncan hold this essential advantage, whether derived from its own \nseparate strength or from an apostate and unnatural connection with any \nforeign power, must be intrinsically precarious.\n  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and \nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to \nfind in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater \nresource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less \nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is \nof inestimable value! they must derive from union an exemption from \nthose broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict \nneighboring countries not tied together by the same government, which \ntheir own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which \nopposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate \nand embitter. Hence likewise they will avoid the necessity of those \novergrown military establishments, which under any form of government \nare inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as \nparticularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is, that \nyour Union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and \nthat the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the \nother.\n  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting \nand virtuous mind and exhibit the continuance of the Union as a primary \nobject of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common \ngovernment can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it. To \nlisten to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are \nauthorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the \nauxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will \nafford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and \nfull experiment.\n\n[[Page S891]]\n\nWith such powerful and obvious motives to union affecting all parts of \nour country, while experience shall not have demonstrated its \nimpracticability, there will always be reason to distrust the \npatriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to weaken its \nbands.\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as \nmatter of serious concern that any ground should have been furnished \nfor characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--northern \nand southern--Atlantic and western; whence designing men may endeavor \nto excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests \nand views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within \nparticular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other \ndistricts. You cannot shield yourselves too much against the jealousies \nand heart burnings which spring from these misrepresentations. They \ntend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together \nby fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our western country have \nlately had a useful lesson on this head. They have seen in the \nnegotiation by the executive--and in the unanimous ratification by the \nSenate--of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at \nthat event throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded \nwere the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the general \ngovernment and in the Atlantic states unfriendly to their interests in \nregard to the Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of \ntwo treaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure \nto them everything they could desire, in respect to our foreign \nrelations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their \nwisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the Union by \nwhich they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those \nadvisers, if such there are, who would sever them from their brethren \nand connect them with aliens?\n  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the \nwhole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts \ncan be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the \ninfractions and interruptions which all alliances in all times have \nexperienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon \nyour first essay by the adoption of a Constitution of government better \ncalculated than your former for an intimate Union and for the \nefficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the \noffspring of our own choice uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full \ninvestigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its \nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers uniting security with \nenergy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \nhas a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its \nauthority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are \nduties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of \nour political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter \ntheir constitutions of government. But the Constitution which at any \ntime exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the \nwhole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \npower and the right of the people to establish government presupposes \nthe duty of every individual to obey the established government.\n  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and \nassociations under whatever plausible character with the real design to \ndirect, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action \nof the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental \nprinciple and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction; to \ngive it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the place of \nthe delegated will of the nation the will of a party, often a small but \nartful and enterprising minority of the community; and, according to \nthe alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public \nadministration the mirror of the ill concerted and incongruous projects \nof faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans \ndigested by common councils and modified by mutual interests. However \ncombinations or associations of the above description may now and then \nanswer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time and things, \nto become potent engines by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled \nmen will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for \nthemselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very \nengines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.\n  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of \nyour present happy state, it is requisite not only that you steadily \ndiscountenance irregular oppositions to its acknowledged authority but \nalso that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its \nprinciples, however specious the pretexts. One method of assault may be \nto effect in the forms of the Constitution alterations which will \nimpair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what cannot be \ndirectly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, \nremember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true \ncharacter of governments as of other human institutions, that \nexperience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of \nthe existing constitution of a country, that facility in changes upon \nthe credit of mere hypotheses and opinion exposes to perpetual change \nfrom the endless variety of hypotheses and opinion; and remember, \nespecially, that for the efficient management of your common interests \nin a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is \nconsistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable; \nliberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly \ndistributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is indeed little else \nthan a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the \nenterprises of faction, to confine each member of the society within \nthe limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure \nand tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, \nwith particular reference to the founding of them on geographical \ndiscriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you \nin the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of \nparty, generally.\n  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under \ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, \nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its \ngreatest rankness and is truly their worst enemy.\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \nitself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal \nand permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result \ngradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the \nabsolute power of an individual; and sooner or later the chief of some \nprevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, \nturns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the \nruins of public liberty.\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which \nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and \ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it \nthe interest and the duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain \nit.\n  It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the \npublic administration. It agitates the community with ill founded \njealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against \nanother, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door \nto foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to \nthe government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the \npolicy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will \nof another.\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \nupon the administration of the government and serve to keep alive the \nspirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true--and in \ngovernments of a monarchical cast patriotism may look with indulgence, \nif not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of\n\n[[Page S892]]\n\nthe popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit \nnot to be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there \nwill always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And \nthere being constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by force \nof public opinion to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be \nquenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a \nflame, lest instead of warming it should consume.\n  It is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \ncountry should inspire caution in those entrusted with its \nadministration to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just \nestimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which \npredominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the \ntruth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the \nexercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into \ndifferent depositories and constituting each the guardian of the public \nweal against invasions by the others, has been evinced by experiments \nancient and modern, some of them in our country and under our own eyes. \nTo preserve them must be as necessary as to institute them. If in the \nopinion of the people the distribution or modification of the \nconstitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected \nby an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates. But let \nthere be no change by usurpation; for though this, in one instance, may \nbe the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free \ngovernments are destroyed. The precedent must always greatly \noverbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit which \nthe use can at any time yield.\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain \nwould that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to \nsubvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \nthe duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \ntrace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \nsimply be asked where is the security for property, for reputation, for \nlife, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths, which are \nthe instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with \ncaution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without \nreligion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \neducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both \nforbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.\n  It is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary \nspring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or less \nforce to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere friend \nto it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation \nof the fabric?\n  Promote then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \nthe general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a \ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it is essential that public \nopinion should be enlightened.\n  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public \ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as \npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but \nremembering also that timely disbursements to prepare for danger \nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding \nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \nexpense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the \ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously \nthrowing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. \nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it \nis necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to \nthem the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should \npractically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there must \nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can \nbe devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that \nthe intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the \nproper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a \ndecisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the \ngovernment in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the \nmeasures for obtaining revenue which the public exigencies may at any \ntime dictate.\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace \nand harmony with all; religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and \ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be \nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great \nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a \npeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can \ndoubt that in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan \nwould richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a \nsteady adherence to it? Can it be, that Providence has not connected \nthe permanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n  In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that \npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \npassionate attachments for others should be excluded and that in place \nof them just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated. \nThe nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an \nhabitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its \nanimosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it \nastray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation against \nanother disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, to lay \nhold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable \nwhen accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. Hence frequent \ncollisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. The nation, \nprompted by ill will and resentment, sometimes impels to war the \ngovernment, contrary to the best calculations of policy. The government \nsometimes participates in the national propensity and adopts through \npassion what reason would reject; at other times, it makes the \nanimosity of the nation subservient to projects of hostility instigated \nby pride, ambition and other sinister and pernicious motives. The peace \noften, sometimes perhaps the liberty, of nations has been the victim.\n\n  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another \nproduces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, \nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases \nwhere no real common interest exists and infusing into one the enmities \nof the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels \nand wars of the latter, without adequate inducement or justification. \nIt leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of privileges \ndenied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the \nconcessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been \nretained and by exciting jealousy, ill will, and a disposition to \nretaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld. And \nit gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens (who devote \nthemselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the \ninterests of their own country without odium, sometimes even with \npopularity, gilding with the appearances of a virtuous sense of \nobligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable \nzeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, \ncorruption, or infatuation.\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent \npatriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic \nfactions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, \nto influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small \nor weak towards a great and powerful nation dooms the former to be the \nsatellite of the latter.\n  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to \nbelieve me, fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be \nconstantly awake,\n\n[[Page S893]]\n\nsince history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the \nmost baneful foes of republican government. But that jealousy to be \nuseful must be impartial; else it becomes the instrument of the very \ninfluence to be avoided, instead of a defense against it. Excessive \npartiality for one foreign nation and excessive dislike of another \ncause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one side, and serve \nto veil and even second the arts of influence on the other. Real \npatriots, who may resist the intrigues of the favorite, are liable to \nbecome suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes usurp the \napplause and confidence of the people to surrender their interests.\n  The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is, in \nextending our commercial relations, to have with them as little \npolitical connection as possible. So far as we have already formed \nengagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us \nstop.\n  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none or a \nvery remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent \ncontroversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our \nconcerns. Hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate \nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her \npolitics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships \nor enmities.\n  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a \ndifferent course. If we remain one people under an efficient \ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury \nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will \ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously \nrespected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making \nacquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us \nprovocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by \njustice shall counsel.\n  Why forgo the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own \nto stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with \nthat of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the \ntoils of European ambition, rival-ship, interest, humor, or caprice?\n  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any \nportion of the foreign world--so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty \nto do it, for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing \ninfidelity to existing engagements (I hold the maxim no less applicable \nto public than to private affairs, that honesty is always the best \npolicy)--I repeat it therefore, let those engagements be observed in \ntheir genuine sense. But in my opinion it is unnecessary and would be \nunwise to extend them.\n  Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on \na respectably defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary \nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\n  Harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended by \npolicy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should \nhold an equal and impartial hand: neither seeking nor granting \nexclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of \nthings; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of \ncommerce but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed--in \norder to give to trade a stable course, to define the rights of our \nmerchants, and to enable the government to support them--conventional \nrules of intercourse, the best that present circumstances and mutual \nopinion will permit, but temporary, and liable to be from time to time \nabandoned or varied, as experience and circumstances shall dictate; \nconstantly keeping in view, that it is folly in one nation to look for \ndisinterested favors from another--that it must pay with a portion of \nits independence for whatever it may accept under that character--that \nby such acceptance it may place itself in the condition of having given \nequivalents for nominal favors and yet of being reproached with \ningratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to \nexpect or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation. It is an \nillusion which experience must cure, which a just pride ought to \ndiscard.\n  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and \naffectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and \nlasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual \ncurrent of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course \nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even \nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, \nsome occasional good, that they may now and then recur to moderate the \nfury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign \nintrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism--this \nhope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by \nwhich they have been dictated.\n  How far in the discharge of my official duties I have been guided by \nthe principles which have been delineated, the public records and other \nevidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To \nmyself, the assurance of my own conscience is that I have at least \nbelieved myself to be guided by them.\n  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of \nthe 22d of April 1793 is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your \napproving voice and by that of your representatives in both houses of \nCongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, \nuninfluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\n  After deliberate examination with the aid of the best lights I could \nobtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the \ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take--and was bound in duty \nand interest to take--a neutral position. Having taken it, I \ndetermined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with \nmoderation, perseverence, and firmness.\n  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is \nnot necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, \naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from \nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually \nadmitted by all.\n  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without \nanything more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on \nevery nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain \ninviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.\n  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be \nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant \nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and \nmature its yet recent institutions and to progress without interruption \nto that degree of strength and consistency which is necessary to give \nit, humanly speaking, the command of its own fortunes.\n  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I am \nunconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my \ndefects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. \nWhatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or \nmitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me \nthe hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence \nand that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service \nwith an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be \nconsigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \nthat fervent love towards it which is so natural to a man who views in \nit the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \ngenerations, I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat, in \nwhich I promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of \npartaking in the midst of my fellow citizens the benign influence of \ngood laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my \nheart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors \nand dangers.\n                                                      Geo. Washington. \n                                    United States, 19th September 1796.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish to say a few words about a \ntowering figure of the Supreme Court who will be missed by many. \nAntonin Scalia was literally one of a kind. In the evenings, he loved \nnothing more than a night at the opera house. During the day, he often \nstarred in an opus of his own.\n  For most watchers of the Court, even many of Scalia's most ardent \ncritics, the work he produced was brilliant, entertaining, and \nunmissable. Words had meaning to him. He used them to dissect and \nrefute, to amuse and beguile, to challenge and persuade. And even when \nhis arguments didn't carry the day, his dissents often gathered the \nmost attention anyway.\n  President Obama said that Justice Scalia will be ``remembered as one \nof the most consequential judges and thinkers to serve on the Supreme \nCourt.'' I certainly agree. It is amazing that someone who never served \nas Chief Justice could make such an indelible impact on our country. He \nis, in my view, in league with Oliver Wendell Holmes, Louis Brandeis, \nand John Marshall Harlan as perhaps the most significant Associate \nJustices ever.\n  I first met him when we both served in the Ford administration's \nJustice Department. I was fortunate, as a young man, to be invited to \nstaff meetings that featured some of the most influential conservative \njudicial minds of the time. Robert Bork was there. He was the Solicitor \nGeneral. Larry Silverman was there. He was the Deputy Attorney General. \nEveryone in the Department agreed on two things: One, Antonin Scalia \nwas the funniest lawyer on the staff; and, two, he was the brightest.\n  Scalia was usually the smartest guy in whatever room he chose to walk \ninto. Of course, he didn't need to tell you he was the smartest. You \njust knew it.\n  I came back to Washington a few years later as a Senator on the \nJudiciary Committee, serving there when Scalia was nominated to the \nSupreme Court. His views on the Court were strong, and they were clear. \nSome tried to caricature his judicial conservatism as something it was \nnot. It was not political conservatism.\n  Scalia's aim was to follow the Constitution wherever it took him, \neven if he disagreed politically with the outcome. We saw that when he \nvoted to uphold the constitutional right of protesters to burn the \nAmerican flag. He upheld their right to do that. This is what he said: \n``If it was up to me, I would have thrown this bearded, scandal-wearing \nflag burner into jail, but it was not up to me.''\n  It was up to the Constitution.\n  ``If you had to pick . . . one freedom . . . that is the most \nessential to the functioning of a democracy, it has to be freedom of \nspeech,'' Scalia once said. He went on:\n\n       Because democracy means persuading one another. And then, \n     ultimately, voting. . . . You can't run such a system if \n     there is a muzzling of one point of view. So it's a \n     fundamental freedom in a democracy, much more necessary in a \n     democracy than in any other system of government. I guess you \n     can run an effective monarchy without freedom of speech. I \n     don't think you can run an effective democracy without it.\n\n  Justice Scalia defended the First Amendment rights of those who would \nexpress themselves by burning our flag just as he defended the First \nAmendment rights of Americans who wished to express themselves by \nparticipating in the changemaking process of our democracy: the right \nto speak one's mind, the right to associate freely, the rights of \ncitizens, groups, and candidates to participate in the political \nprocess.\n  Numerous cases involving these kinds of essential First Amendment \nprinciples came before the Court during his tenure. I filed nearly a \ndozen amicus curiae briefs in related Supreme Court cases in recent \nyears, and I was the lead plaintiff in a case that challenged the \ncampaign-finance laws back in 2002.\n  These core First Amendment freedoms may not always be popular with \nsome politicians who would rather control the amount, nature, and \ntiming of speech that is critical of them, but Scalia recognized that \nprotecting the citizenry from efforts by the government to control \ntheir speech about issues of public concern was the very purpose of the \nFirst Amendment. He knew that such speech--political speech--lay at its \nvery core.\n  It is a constitutional outlook shared by many, including the members \nof an organization such as the Federalist Society. You could always \ncount on him attending the Society's annual dinner. One of his five \nsons, Paul, is a priest, and he always gave an opening prayer. This is \nwhat Scalia said about that.\n\n       If in an old-fashioned Catholic family with five sons you \n     don't get one priest out of it, we're in big trouble. The \n     other four were very happy when Paul announced that he was \n     going to take one for the team.\n\n  That is the thing about Antonin Scalia. His opinions could bite. His \nwit could be cutting. But his good humor was always in abundant supply. \nOne study from 2005 concluded decisively--or as decisively as one can--\nthat Scalia was the funniest Justice on the Court.\n  He was also careful not to confuse the philosophical with the \npersonal.\n\n       I attack ideas. I don't attack people. If you can't \n     separate the two, you gotta get another day job.\n\n  These qualities endeared him to many who thought very differently \nthan he did--most famously, his philosophical opposite on the Court, \nRuth Bader Ginsburg. Their friendship began after Ginsburg heard him \nspeak at a law conference. Here is what she said: ``I disagreed with \nmost of what he said,'' she recalled, ``but I loved the way he said \nit.''\n  Scalia put it this way:\n\n       She likes opera, and she's a very nice person. What's not \n     to like?\n\n  Well, he continued, ``except her views on the law.''\n  Ginsburg called him Nino. Scalia referred to the pair as ``the Odd \nCouple.'' They actually vacationed together. They rode elephants. They \nparasailed. And just a few months ago, their relationship was captured \nin the perfect medium: opera, their shared love.\n  ``Scalia/Ginsburg: A (Gentle) Parody of Operatic Proportions'' \npremiered last summer. In it, a jurist named Scalia is imprisoned for \n``excessive dissenting,'' and it is none other than Ginsburg, or an \nactress faintly resembling her, who comes crashing through the ceiling \nto save him. It is the kind of show that is larger than life, and so \nwas Nino Scalia.\n  He leaves behind nine children and a wife who loved him dearly, \nMaureen. Maureen would sometimes tease her husband that she had her \npick of suitors and could just as well have married any of them. But \nshe didn't, he would remind her, because they were wishy-washy, and she \nwould have been bored.\n  ``Whatever my faults are,'' Scalia once said, ``I am not wishy-\nwashy.''\n  Far from wishy-washy and anything but boring, Justice Scalia was an \narticulate champion of the Constitution. He was a personality unto \nhimself, and his passing is a significant loss for the Court and for \nour country. We remember him today. We express our sympathies to the \nlarge and loving family he leaves behind. We know our country will not \nsoon forget him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/22/senate-section/article/S894-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we were all shocked by the sudden passing \nof Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Justice Scalia and I had our \ndifferences. However, there was no doubting his intelligence or \ndedication to the country. I offer my condolences to the entire Scalia \nfamily, who laid to rest a devoted husband, father, and grandfather \nthis weekend.\n\n[[Page S895]]\n\n  I watched the funeral from Nevada, and I was deeply impressed with \nJustice Scalia's son, Reverend Paul Scalia, and the moving eulogy he \ngave his father. It was quite remarkable.\n  But now President Obama must nominate a qualified individual to the \nSupreme Court. Once the President has sent a nominee to the Senate, it \nis our responsibility to act.\n  Unfortunately, it appears that the Republican leader and his \ncolleagues have no intension of filling this important vacancy. The \nRepublican leader has repeatedly declared himself to be ``the proud \nguardian of gridlock.'' That is a quote. He has lived up to that \nmoniker, and that is an understatement.\n  In recent years, the Republican leader and the Republican Senators \nhave done everything possible to grind the wheels of government to a \nhalt. But now we are seeing something from the Republican leader that \nis far worse than his usual brand of obstruction. We are seeing an \nunprecedented attempt to hold hostage an entire branch of government.\n  The damage already done to the legislative branch has been written \nabout. The last 7 years, the Republicans have done everything they can \nto stop President Obama's legislative ability to move forward. As \nleader of this democracy, it is too bad that President Obama has had to \nput up with this obstruction of everything dealing with the \nlegislature.\n  The statement the Republican leader issued less than an hour after \nJustice Scalia's death announcement argued that starting now, any \nPresident should be denied the right to fill a Supreme Court vacancy in \na Presidential election year.\n  Think about that. This is a foolish gambit, one to deny President \nObama his constitutional right to appoint nominees to the Supreme \nCourt. This is a full-blown effort to delegitimize President Obama, the \nPresidency, and undermine our basic system of checks and balances, \nwhich is integral to our Constitution.\n  I can find no limits on the President's legal authority to nominate \nSupreme Court Justices during an election year in our Constitution. I \ncan find no mention of a 3-year Presidency in our Constitution. What I \ndo find in the Constitution is article II, section 2, which clearly \nprovides President Obama with the legal obligation to nominate Justices \nto the Supreme Court, contingent on the advice and consent of the \nSenate.\n  This is how our system of government has operated for more than 200 \nyears. This constitutional prerogative is essential to the basic \nfunctioning of our coequal branches of government. What the Republican \nleader is suggesting runs contrary to two centuries of precedent and is \ninconsistent with the Constitution.\n  Our Founding Fathers constructed this American democracy while \nmaintaining certain assumptions of us as elected officials in the \nfuture. They expected us to be rational. They expected us to operate in \ngood faith. They expected this government to be effective. The \nRepublican leader's proposal is none of those things. It is, instead, \nan attempt to nullify what James Madison and the other constitutional \narchitects envisioned.\n  The Founding Fathers never intended the Senate to simply run out the \nclock on its constitutional duties, subverting the President's \nauthority and leaving the judiciary in limbo. The authors of the \nConstitution never envisioned the level of cynicism and bad-faith \ngovernance that we see exhibited by today's Republican Party--a \nRepublican Party that so loathes this President that it is willing to \nrender useless our government's system of checks and balances.\n  Senate Republicans would have the American people believe that is a \nlong-held practice to deny the President the right to fill a Supreme \nCourt vacancy. That is simply not true. I have heard several of my \nRepublican colleagues repeat this line in public statements. It grieves \nme to say it, but the fact is, when Republicans repeat this statement, \nthey are clearly spreading a falsehood. It is not true. I have enormous \nrespect for my Republican friends, but repeatedly skirting the truth is \nbeneath the dignity of their office.\n  According to Amy Howe, an expert on Supreme Court proceedings and \neditor at the popular SCOTUSblog--the Supreme Court of the United \nStates blog--there is no such precedent. She writes:\n\n       The historical record does not reveal any instances since \n     at least 1900 of the president failing to nominate and/or the \n     Senate failing to confirm a nominee in a presidential \n     election year because of the impending election.\n\n  There is not one shred of evidence in the last 116 years to back the \nRepublicans' claims. Democrats never stopped a Republican Supreme Court \nnominee from receiving a hearing and ultimately getting a vote on \nconfirmation--never, never, never.\n  Republicans want to talk about precedent. Well, let's talk about \nprecedent. As recently as 1988, which was both an election year and the \nlast year of a Presidency, the Senate confirmed Supreme Court nominees. \nThat year, a Democratic Senate confirmed President Ronald Reagan's \nnomination of Justice Anthony Kennedy in the final year of his \nadministration. I voted to confirm Justice Kennedy's nomination, as did \nmy friend, the current chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nGrassley.\n  I think it is well that the Presiding Officer today is the junior \nSenator from Iowa. I hope she will listen to what Senator Grassley, the \nsenior Senator from Iowa, has said time and time again. Senator \nGrassley had no trouble supporting Justice Kennedy's nomination then, \nnotwithstanding the fact that it occurred during President Reagan's \nlast year in office. Since that time, the senior Senator from Iowa has \nbeen on record defending the President's right to put forward nominees \nduring a Presidential election year. In 2008, in fact, Senator Grassley \nsaid: ``The reality is that the Senate has never stopped confirming \njudicial nominees during the last few months of a president's term.'' I \nwill repeat that quote. ``The reality is that the Senate has never \nstopped confirming judicial nominees during the last few months of a \npresident's term.'' I agree with Senator Grassley--or at least I agreed \nwith him. Frankly, now I am not sure where the senior Senator from Iowa \nstands. He issues a contradictory statement, it seems, every day on \nthis one issue.\n  Another person who voted to confirm Justice Kennedy in 1980 was a \nfirst-term Senator from Kentucky, Senator McConnell. In fact, for 40 \nyears the Republican leader was remarkably consistent in asserting that \nthe Senate has a duty to consider the Supreme Court's Presidential \nnominations.\n  As a law student at the University of Kentucky, he wrote in 1970:\n\n       Even though the Senate has at various times made purely \n     political decisions in its consideration of Supreme Court \n     nominees, certainly it could not be successfully argued that \n     it is an acceptable practice.\n       If political matters were relevant to senatorial \n     consideration it might be suggested that a constitutional \n     amendment be introduced giving to the Senate rather than the \n     president the right to nominate Supreme Court justices.\n\n  My friend the Republican leader carried that belief with him into \npublic service. As a freshman Senator in 1986, during a Senate \nJudiciary Committee hearing, he said:\n\n       Under the Constitution, our duty is to provide advice and \n     consent to judicial nominations, not to substitute our \n     judgment for what are reasonable views for a judicial nominee \n     to hold.\n\n  Again, in 1990, the Senator from Kentucky said:\n\n       It is clear under our form of government that the advice \n     and consent role of the Senate in judicial nominations should \n     not be politicized.\n\n  In 2005, the Senator from Kentucky reaffirmed his stance, stating:\n\n       Our job is to react to that nomination in a respectful and \n     dignified way, and at the end of the process, to give that \n     person an up-or-down vote as all nominees who have majority \n     support have gotten throughout the history of the country. \n     It's not our job to determine who ought to be picked.\n\n  Finally, just 6 years ago, the Republican leader put it in the \nsimplest terms possible:\n\n       Americans expect politics to end at the courtroom door.\n\n  These are just a few examples, but there are pages of similar quotes \nfrom the Republican leader spanning four decades on this subject. \nUnfortunately, he seems to no longer believe that politics end at the \ncourtroom door. The reason for the Republican leader's about-face is \nclear: He and his party want to undermine this President,\n\n[[Page S896]]\n\nBarack Obama. Senate Republicans would upend our Nation's system of \nchecks and balances rather than afford President Obama the same \nconstitutional authority his 43 predecessors enjoyed.\n  Throughout the news today, it is said by all the Republican think \ntanks--or a lot of them--that it is more important for the Republicans \nto make sure Obama does not get a Supreme Court nominee on the floor of \nthe Senate than it is for them to maintain the majority in the Senate. \nThink about that. That is not what I am saying; that is what they are \nsaying.\n  A few minutes ago, the junior Senator from Delaware was here on the \nSenate floor reading George Washington's Farewell Address. He did a \nremarkable job. This man, who was the national debate champion twice, \ndid a very good job.\n  In his address, President Washington warned of the partisan party \npolitics that Republicans are now employing. He warned of their \nnegative influence on our government. He said:\n\n       All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all \n     combinations and associations, under whatever plausible \n     character, with the real design to direct, control, \n     counteract or awe the regular deliberation and action of the \n     constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental \n     principle, and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize \n     faction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to \n     put, in the place of the delegated will of the nation, the \n     will of a party.\n\n  The American people are watching. They are watching the Republicans' \nobstruction on this issue and the direct contravention of the belief of \nPresident George Washington.

Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nAssociate Justice Scalia of the Supreme Court. His recent death is a \ntremendous loss to the Court and the Nation.\n  He was a defender of the Constitution. Since his death, a wide range \nof commentators--even many who disagreed with him on judicial \nphilosophy--have hailed him as one of the greatest Supreme Court \nJustices in our history. Justice Scalia was a tireless defender of \nconstitutional freedom. In so many cases when the Court was divided, he \nsided with litigants who raised claims under the Bill of Rights. This \nwas a manifestation of his view that the Constitution should be \ninterpreted according to the text and as it was originally understood.\n  The Framers believed that the Constitution was adopted to protect \nindividual liberty, and, of course, so did Justice Scalia. He was a \nstrong believer in free speech and freedom of religion. He upheld many \nclaims of constitutional rights by criminal defendants, including \nsearch and seizure, jury trials, and the right of the accused to \nconfront the witnesses against them.\n  Justice Scalia's memorable opinions also recognize the importance the \nFramers placed on the Constitution's checks and balances to safeguard \nindividual liberty. Their preferred protection of freedom was not \nthrough litigation and the Court's imperfect after-the-fact redress for \nliberty deprived.\n  Justice Scalia zealously protected the prerogatives of each branch of \ngovernment and the division of powers between Federal and State \nauthorities so that none would be so strong as to pose a danger to \nfreedom.\n  We are all saddened by the recent death of Supreme Court Justice \nAntonin Scalia. I extend my sympathies to his family. His death is a \ngreat loss to the Nation.\n  This is true for so many reasons. Justice Scalia changed legal \ndiscourse in this country. He focused legal argument on text and \noriginal understanding, rather than a judge's own views of changing \ntimes. He was a clear thinker. His judicial opinions and other writings \nwere insightful, witty, and unmistakably his own.\n  Even those who disagreed with him have acknowledged he was one of the \ngreatest Justices ever to serve on the Supreme Court.\n  Today I would like to address a common misconception about Justice \nScalia, one that couldn't be further from the truth. Some press stories \nhave made the astounding claim that Justice Scalia interpreted \nindividual liberties narrowly. This is absolutely untrue.\n  It's important to show how many times Justice Scalia was part of a 5-\nto-4 majority that upheld or even expanded individual rights.\n  If someone other than Justice Scalia had served on the Court, \nindividual liberty would have paid the price.\n  The first time Justice Scalia played, such a pivotal role for liberty \nwas in a Takings clause case under the Fifth Amendment. He ruled that \nwhen a State imposes a condition on a land use permit, the government \nmust show a close connection between the impact of the construction and \nthe permit condition.\n  Even though I disagreed, he ruled that the First Amendment's Free \nSpeech clause prohibits the States or the Federal Government from \ncriminalizing burning of the flag.\n  Congress cannot, he concluded, claim power under the Commerce clause \nto criminalize an individual's ownership of a firearm in a gun-free \nschool zone.\n  Justice Scalia was part of a five-member majority that held that \nunder the Free Speech clause, a public university cannot refuse to \nallocate a share of student activity funds to religious publications \nwhen it provides funds to secular publications.\n  He found the Tenth Amendment prohibits Congress from commandeering \nState and local officials to enforce Federal laws.\n  The Court, in a 5-to-4 ruling including Justice Scalia, concluded \nthat it didn't violate the First Amendment's Establishment of Religion \nclause for public school teachers to teach secular subjects in \nparochial schools, as long as there is no excessive entanglement \nbetween the State and the religious institution.\n  Justice Scalia believed that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury \ntrial requires certain sentencing factors be charged in the indictment \nand submitted to a jury for it to decide, rather than a judge.\n  He concluded with four other Justices that the First Amendment's \nfreedom of association allowed the Boy Scouts to exclude from its \nmembership individuals who'd affect the ability of the group to \nadvocate public or private views.\n  Showing that original intent can't be lampooned for failing to take \ntechnological changes into account, Justice Scalia wrote the Court's \nmajority opinion holding that under the Fourth Amendment, police can't \nuse thermal imaging technology or other technology not otherwise \navailable to the general public for surveillance of a person's house, \neven without physical entry, without a warrant.\n  He decided that notwithstanding the Establishment clause, a broad \nclass of\n\n[[Page S897]]\n\nlow-income parents may receive public school vouchers to defray the \ncosts of their children's attendance at private schools of their \nchoice, including religious schools.\n  He voted to strike down as a violation of the Sixth Amendment's right \nto a jury trial Federal and State sentencing guidelines that permit \njudges rather than juries to determine the facts permitting a sentence \nto be lengthened beyond what is otherwise permissible.\n  Justice Scalia found placing the Ten Commandments on the Texas State \nHouse grounds doesn't violate the First Amendment's Establishment \nclause when the monument was considered in context, and conveyed a \nhistorical and social message rather than a religious one.\n  He was part of a 5-to-4 Court that concluded the denial of a criminal \ndefendant's Sixth Amendment right to his counsel of choice, not only \ndenial of counsel generally, automatically requires reversal of his \nconviction.\n  He wrote for a 5- to-4 majority that the Second Amendment protects an \nindividual's right to possess a firearm for traditionally lawful \npurposes, such as self-defense within the home, in Federal enclaves \nsuch as Washington, DC. A later 5-to-4 decision applies this individual \nSecond Amendment right against State interference as well.\n  According to Justice Scalia and four other Justices, a warrantless \nsearch of an automobile of a person who has been put under arrest is \npermissible under the Fourth Amendment only if there is a continuing \nthreat to officer safety, or there is a need to preserve evidence.\n  Justice Scalia also voted that it is a violation of the Sixth \nAmendment right of the accused to confront the witnesses against him \nfor the prosecution to use a drug test report without the live \ntestimony of the particular person who performed the test.\n  He was part of a 5-to-4 majority that found that the First Amendment \nrequires that corporations, including nonprofit corporations such as \nthe Sierra Club and the National Rifle Association, are free to make \nunlimited independent campaign expenditures.\n  And under the Free Exercise of Religion clause, according to Justice \nScalia and four other Justices, a closely held corporation is exempt \nfrom a law that its owners religiously object to, such as ObamaCare's \ncontraception mandate, if there is a less restrictive way to advance \nthe law's interests.\n  Think about the liberty lost, had Justice Scalia not served our \nNation.\n  A different Justice might have ruled against individual liberty in \neach of these cases. It is a frightening prospect. But in each \ninstance, that is what four of Justice Scalia's colleagues would have \ndone.\n  Of course, these are only the 5-to-4 opinions. There were many others \nwhere Justice Scalia ruled in favor of constitutional liberty, and more \nthan four other Justices joined him.\n  And then there were other decisions where Justice Scalia voted to \naccept the claim of individual liberty, but a majority of the Court \ndidn't. Some of those cases unquestionably should've come out the other \nway.\n  When considering Justice Scalia's contribution to individual liberty, \nit's vital to consider his great insight that the Bill of Rights are \nnot the most important part of the Constitution in protecting freedom.\n  For him, as for the Framers of the Constitution, it is the structural \nprovisions of the Constitution, the checks and balances and the \nseparation of powers that are most protective of liberty.\n  These were made part of the Constitution not as ends unto themselves, \nor as the basis to bring lawsuits after rights were threatened, but as \nways to prevent government from encroaching on individual freedom in \nthe first place.\n  For instance, Justice Scalia protected the vertical separation of \npowers that is federalism. Federalism keeps decisions closer to the \npeople but also ensures we have a unified nation.\n  And it prevents a Federal government from overstepping its bounds in \nways that threaten freedom.\n  He also maintained the horizontal separation of powers through strong \nsupport of the checks and balances in the Constitution. He defended the \npower of Congress against Executive encroachment, such as in the recess \nappointments case.\n  Justice Scalia protected the judiciary against legislative \ninfringement of its powers. He defended the Executive against \nlegislative usurpation as well.\n  The best example, and the one that most directly shows the connection \nbetween the separation of powers and individual freedom, was his solo \ndissent to the Court's upholding of the Independent Counsel Act.\n  Contrary to the overwhelming views of the public, the media, and \npoliticians at the time, Justice Scalia correctly viewed that statute \nnot as a wolf in sheep's clothing, but as an actual wolf.\n  Dismissively rejected in 1988 by nearly all observers, his dissent \nunderstood that the creation of a prosecutor for the sole purpose of \ninvestigating individuals rather than crimes not only was a threat to \nthe Executive's power to prosecute, but was destined to produce unfair \nprosecutions.\n  It's now viewed as one of the most insightful, well-reasoned, \nfarsighted, and greatest dissents in the Court's history. But his \npowerful and true arguments didn't convince a single colleague to join \nhim.\n  As important as his 5-to-4 rulings were, in so many ways, the \ndifference between having Justice Scalia on the Court and not having \nhim there, was what that meant for rigorous analysis of the law.\n  Justice Scalia's role as a textualist and an originalist was vital to \nhis voting so frequently in favor of constitutional liberties. He \nreached conclusions supported by law whether they were popular or not, \nand often whether he agreed with them or not.\n  He opposed flag burning. And he didn't want to prevent the police \nfrom arresting dangerous criminals or make trials even more complicated \nand cumbersome.\n  He acted in the highest traditions of the Constitution and our \njudiciary.\n  We all owe him a debt of gratitude. And we all should give serious \nthought to the kind of judging that, like his, is necessary to preserve \nour freedoms and our constitutional order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/22/senate-section/article/S897-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S897-S899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, we find ourselves in a very unusual \nsituation. We are in a Presidential election year. The campaign for our \nnext Commander in Chief is in full swing. Voting has begun. Some \ncandidates for President have dropped out of the race after \ndisappointing finishes in the primaries. Republicans hold the gavel in \nthe U.S. Senate, and a term-limited Democrat in the twilight of his \nPresidency occupies the White House. It is within this context that our \nNation has lost one of the greatest legal minds ever to serve the \nCourt.\n  Justice Scalia's death marks the first time a sitting Supreme Court \nJustice passed away in a Presidential election year in 100 years, and \nit is the first time a sitting Supreme Court Justice passed away in a \nPresidential election year during a divided government since 1888.\n  As my colleagues and I grapple with how the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee should approach this set of circumstances, we seek guidance \nand wisdom from a number of sources. These include history, practice, \nand common sense, and, yes, we look to what former committee chairmen \nhave had to say on the subject. In reviewing this history, I am \nreminded of remarks a former chairman delivered during an election \nyear. That former chairman tackled this knotty problem, and he \ndescribed what should happen if a Supreme Court vacancy arises during a \nPresidential election year. In fact, this chairman's guidance is \nparticularly instructive because he delivered his remarks in a \nPresidential election year during a time of divided government.\n  The Presidential election year was 1992. We had no Supreme Court \nvacancy. No Justice had passed away unexpectedly. No Justice had \nannounced his or her intention to retire. Rather, it was the fear of an \nunexpected resignation that drove this former chairman to the Senate \nfloor 1 day before the end of the Court's term.\n  Near the beginning of his lengthy remarks, this chairman--who was and \nremains my friend--noted another speech he delivered several years \nprior on the advice and consent clause. That speech,\n\n[[Page S898]]\n\nfrom July 1987, was titled ``The Right and Duty of the Senate to \nProtect the Integrity of the Supreme Court.'' This chairman delivered \nthose remarks in 1987 as the Senate embarked on one of its saddest \nepisodes: the unfair and ugly treatment of an exceptional jurist, Judge \nRobert Bork.\n  I don't reference that episode to open old wounds, only to provide \ncontext because it was in that speech during the debate that this \nformer chairman defended the Senate's constitutional role in the \nappointment process. It was there in that speech during that debate in \n1987 that this former chairman reached back to an early debate from an \nespecially warm summer in Philadelphia 200 years prior. He reached back \nto the Constitutional Convention because it was then and there that \nindividuals such as Rutledge of South Carolina, Wilson of Pennsylvania, \nGohram of Massachusetts, and, of course, the father of the \nConstitution, Madison of Virginia, debated how our young Nation's \njudges were going to be appointed. It was his examination of the debate \nin 1787 that led this former chairman to declare 200 years later, \nnearly to the day:\n\n       Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution clearly states \n     that the president ``shall nominate, and by and with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . judges \n     of the Supreme Court.'' I will argue that the framers \n     intended the Senate to take the broadest view of its \n     constitutional responsibility. I will argue that the Senate \n     historically has taken such a view.\n\n  That discussion on the advice and consent clause transpired in 1987, \nbut, as I said, it was during a Presidential election year in 1992 that \nmy friend, this former chairman, took to this very floor. Why did he \nbegin his remarks in 1992 by reference to an earlier speech on the \nadvice and consent clause? I will say it wasn't only because Senators \nsometimes like to quote the wise words they once spoke. My friend \nreferenced his own remarks on the advice and consent clause because he \nwanted to remind his colleagues in this Senate of this Senate's \nconstitutional authority to provide or withhold consent as \ncircumstances might require. And he wanted to remind his colleagues of \nthe Senate's constitutional authority before he addressed the real \nreason he rose to speak in 1992: the prospect of a Supreme Court \nvacancy in a Presidential election year.\n  After discussing confirmation debates that had not occurred in \nPresidential election years, my friend turned to some of those who had:\n\n       Some of our nation's most bitter and heated confirmation \n     fights have come in presidential election years. The bruising \n     confirmation fight over Roger Taney's nomination in 1836; the \n     Senate's refusal to confirm four nominations by President \n     Tyler in 1844; the single vote rejections of nominees Badger \n     and Black by lameduck Presidents Fillmore and Buchanan, in \n     the mid-19th century; and the narrow approval of Justices \n     Lamar and Fuller in 1888 are just some examples of these \n     fights in the 19th century.\n\n  This former chairman continued:\n\n       Overall, while only one in four Supreme Court nominations \n     has been the subject of significant opposition, the figure \n     rises to one out of two when such nominations are acted on in \n     a presidential election year.\n\n  This former chairman then outlined some additional history of Supreme \nCourt nominations in Presidential election years. He emphasized that in \nfour vacancies that arose during a Presidential election year, the \nPresident exercised restraint and withheld from making a nomination \nuntil after the election. One of those Presidents was Abraham Lincoln.\n  Ironically, like President Obama, our 16th President was a lawyer and \ncalled Illinois home. But unlike our current President, Abraham Lincoln \ndidn't feel compelled to submit a nomination before the people had \nspoken in November of 1864.\n  Eventually, my friend got to the heart of the matter during election \nyear 1992:\n\n       Should a justice resign this summer and the President move \n     to name a successor, actions that will occur just days before \n     the Democratic Convention and weeks before the Republican \n     Convention meets, a process that is already in doubt in the \n     minds of many will become distrusted by all. Senate \n     consideration of a nominee under these circumstances is not \n     fair to the president, to the nominee, and to the Senate \n     itself.\n  My friend went on to say:\n\n       It is my view that if a Supreme Court justice resigns \n     tomorrow, or within the next several weeks, or resigns at the \n     end of the summer, President Bush should consider following \n     the practice of a majority of his predecessors and not name a \n     nominee until after the November election is completed.\n\n  And what is the Senate to do if a President ignores history, ignores \ngood sense, ignores the people, and submits a nominee under these \ncircumstances? Here again my good friend, the former chairman, had an \nanswer:\n\n       It is my view that if the President goes the way of \n     Presidents Fillmore and Johnson and presses an election-year \n     nomination, the Senate Judiciary Committee should seriously \n     consider not scheduling confirmation hearings on the \n     nomination until after the political campaign season is over.\n\n  Well, what of the likely criticisms that will be lobbed at the \nJudiciary Committee and at the entire Senate if they were to choose \nthis path of not holding a hearing?\n  My friend, the former chairman, continued:\n\n       I am sure, Mr. President, having uttered these words, some \n     will criticize such a decision and say it was nothing more \n     than an attempt to save the seat on the Court in the hopes \n     that a Democrat will be permitted to fill it, but that would \n     not be our intention, Mr. President, if that were the course \n     to choose in the Senate, to not consider holding hearings \n     until after the election.\n\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       Instead, it would be our pragmatic conclusion that once the \n     political season is under way . . . action on a Supreme Court \n     nomination must be put off until after the election campaign \n     is over. That is what is fair to the nominee and is central \n     to the process. Otherwise, it seems to me, Mr. President, we \n     will be in deep trouble as an institution.\n\n  But won't that impact the Court? Can it function with eight members \nfor some time? Won't it create ``crisis''? Not remotely. My friend \nconsidered this issue as well and appropriately dismissed it:\n\n       Others may fret that this approach will leave the Court \n     with only eight members for some time. But as I see it, Mr. \n     President, the cost[s] of such a result, the need to re-argue \n     three or four cases that will divide the Justices four to \n     four, are quite minor compared to the cost that a nominee, \n     the President, the Senate, and the Nation would have to pay \n     for what assuredly would be a bitter fight, no matter how \n     good a person is nominated by the President, if that \n     nomination were to take place in the next several weeks.\n\n  ``In the next several weeks'' refers to sometime between June and \nNovember of 1992.\n  I want to read this part again:\n\n       Others may fret that this approach will leave the Court \n     with only eight members for some time. But . . . the cost[s] \n     of such a result . . . are quite minor compared to the cost \n     that a nominee, the President, the Senate, and the Nation \n     would have to pay for what assuredly would be a bitter fight, \n     no matter how good a person is nominated by the President.\n\n  That is very well said. This former chairman is eloquent, where I \nhappen to be very plainspoken. I would put it this way: It is the \nprinciple that matters, not the person.\n  My friend concluded this section of his remarks this way:\n\n       In the end, this may be the only course of action that \n     historical practice and practical realism can sustain.\n\n  I think probably everybody kind of knows these are the Biden rules.\n  The Biden rules recognize that ``the framers intended the Senate to \ntake the broadest view of its constitutional responsibility.''\n  The Biden rules recognize the wisdom of those Presidents--including \nanother lawyer and former State lawmaker from Illinois--who exercised \nrestraint by not submitting a Supreme Court nomination before the \npeople had spoken.\n  The Biden rules recognize that the Court can operate smoothly with \neight members for some time, and ``the cost of such a result, the need \nto re-argue three or four cases that will divide the Justices four to \nfour, are quite minor compared to the cost that a nominee, the \nPresident, the Senate, and the Nation would have to pay for what \nassuredly would be a bitter fight.''\n  The Biden rules recognize that under these circumstances, ``[the \nPresident] should consider following the practice of a majority of his \npredecessors and not name a nominee until after the November election \nis completed.'' The President he is referring to there is President \nGeorge H.W. Bush.\n  The Biden rules recognize that under these circumstances, ``[it does \nnot] matter how good a person is nominated by the President.''\n  The Biden rules recognize that ``once the political season is under \nway . . . action on a Supreme Court nomination\n\n[[Page S899]]\n\nmust be put off until after the election campaign is over. That is what \nis fair to the nominee and is central to the process.''\n\n  The Biden rules recognize that ``Senate consideration of a nominee \nunder these circumstances is not fair to the President, to the nominee, \nor to the Senate itself.''\n  The Biden rules recognize that under these circumstances, ``the \nSenate Judiciary Committee should seriously consider not scheduling \nconfirmation hearings on the nomination until after the political \ncampaign season is over.''\n  Vice President Biden is a friend, as I said three or four times \nduring my remarks, and I say it with the utmost sincerity. I served \nwith him in this body and on the Judiciary Committee for nearly 30 \nyears. He is honorable, he is sincere, and he is loyal to the President \nhe now serves. Because I know these things about him, I can say with \nconfidence that he will enthusiastically support the President and any \nnominee he submits to the Senate, but I also know this about Vice \nPresident Biden: He may serve as Vice President, but he remains a U.S. \nSenator. That is why when he rose to speak in this Senate Chamber for \nthe last time, he shared this with his colleagues:\n\n       I may be resigning from the Senate today, but I will always \n     be a Senate man. Except for the title of ``father,'' there is \n     no title, including ``Vice President,'' that I am more proud \n     to wear than that of United States Senator.\n\n  If the President of the United States insists on submitting a nominee \nunder these circumstances, Senator Biden, my friend from Delaware, the \nman who sat at a desk across the aisle and at the back of this Chamber \nfor more than 35 years, knows what the Senate should do, and I believe \nin his heart of hearts he understands why this Senate must do what he \nsaid it must do in 1992.\n  I yield the floor and give back the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/22/senate-section/article/S899-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S899-S907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF ROBERT CALIFF\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, drug overdose deaths, driven largely by \nprescription painkillers, continue to outpace the number of fatalities \nfrom traffic accidents in Kentucky. While I recognize the need to \nprotect legitimate patient access to prescription painkillers, the FDA \nmust do more to help us fight back in the midst of today's \nprescription-opioid epidemic.\n  The FDA plays a leading role in addressing this epidemic through its \ndrug approval process, in which it is required by Federal law to ensure \nthe safety and effectiveness of all drugs. However, the FDA has been \nrightly criticized for not recognizing the severity of this significant \nproblem and for not taking greater action to address it.\n  Over the years, I have heard from many Kentuckians concerned about \nFDA's lax attitude in this area, with many of the belief that the \nagency simply has not taken its role in fighting the prescription \nopioid epidemic seriously.\n  To try and push the FDA in the right direction, I contacted the \nagency in both 2012 and 2013 to warn of the problems with allowing \ngeneric, crushable opioids to be made available without the \nintroduction of abuse-deterrent features. As a result, the FDA \nannounced in April 2013 that it had decided to prohibit a generic \nversion of a certain opioid that lacked abuse-deterrent features.\n  I also cosponsored a measure in the last Congress that aimed to push \nthe FDA to encourage the development and use of abuse-deterrent \nformulations of prescription opioids, which make them harder to crush \nand abuse.\n  Additionally, I joined more than 20 Senate and House Members last \nOctober in a letter to OMB's Administrator of Information and \nRegulatory Affairs, Howard Shelanski. We urged him to help us tackle \nthe prescription-drug abuse epidemic by taking down barriers in the \nMedicaid repayment system that actually discourage manufacturers from \ndeveloping the very same abuse-deterrent formulations that I have been \npushing the FDA to encourage.\n  I recently met with Dr. Robert Califf, the FDA Commissioner nominee \nwe will consider this evening. We had a productive meeting in which I \nexpressed my concerns about the agency's past insensitivity to the \nopioid crisis, along with my desire to see the FDA play a more \nprominent role in addressing this prescription-opioid epidemic.\n  Dr. Califf shared his proposed plan to reassess the agency's approach \nto approving and regulating prescription painkillers. Dr. Califf also \nacknowledged that a cultural shift will be needed within the FDA if the \npotential for addiction and abuse of prescription opioids is to be \ntaken more seriously. He assured me that, as head of this important \nagency, he would be the kind of leader our country needs when it comes \nto confronting this growing epidemic.\n  I believe Dr. Califf understands the dire nature of the opioid \nepidemic, and accordingly, I believe he is today the right person to \nlead the FDA in a new direction. That said, confirming Dr. Califf will \nbe just the beginning of a much longer and enduring effort on \neveryone's part; he and the FDA should expect continued rigorous \noversight in the way the agency deals with prescription opioids moving \nforward.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider the \nnomination of Dr. Robert Califf to head the Food and Drug \nAdministration. For too long, the FDA has been without a Senate-\nconfirmed commissioner, and, given the scope and reach of the agency, \naction on Dr. Califf's nomination is welcomed. After speaking with him \nand carefully reviewing his record, I have decided to support this \nnomination.\n  Consumers depend on the FDA to ensure that food, medicine, and \nproducts sold in this country are safe. The agency has oversight of \none-quarter of all consumer goods sold in the United States, including \nnearly $1 trillion in foods, drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, and \nsupplements. The Commissioner must supervise this critical work with \nindependence from outside influence. Some Senators have raised concerns \nabout Dr. Califf's record as a researcher who worked closely with drug \ncompanies and have questioned his ability to make decisions free from \nthe influence of the multibillion dollar pharmaceutical industry. After \nspeaking with Dr. Califf and reviewing his record, I believe that he \nwill conduct himself with integrity and in the best interest of the \npublic.\n  While the head of the FDA must be an independent voice, we should not \ndiscount the benefits having a Senate-confirmed Commissioner who \nunderstands the importance of medical research and the potential to \nadvance lifesaving treatments. Under Dr. Califf's leadership, the Duke \nClinical Research Institute made advances in drugs that dissolve blood \nclots, cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes, and lower \ncholesterol. As director of the Duke Translational Medicine Institute, \nDr. Califf worked closely with the National Institutes of Health, the \nFDA, and the Institute of Medicine to help ensure scientific \ndiscoveries are translated into usable treatments. I believe that Dr. \nCaliff's understanding of the importance of research in promoting \nlifesaving treatments and his ability to navigate potential conflicts \nthat can arise with drug-industry funded research will be an asset to \nhim as the leader of the FDA.\n  Dr. Califf and I also discussed other issues of importance before the \nFDA, including the labeling of generic drugs. For several years, I have \nled a group of nearly 40 Democrats in Congress in pressing the FDA to \nrequire generic drug manufacturers to update their safety labeling, \ninstead of simply mirroring the brand companies' warnings, as they do \nnow. Generics fill over 80 percent of prescriptions, but injured \npatients have no remedy against them if their product is mislabeled. \nPatients who are injured by a brand-name drug can seek justice, but \nthey have no remedy if, like countless Americans, the drug that injures \nthem is a generic. All drug manufacturers should be required to improve \nthe warning information they give to doctors and consumers. Americans \nhave waited 3 years for the FDA to finalize their rule regarding the \nlabeling of generics, and I intend to continue to urge the FDA, and Dr. \nCaliff if he is confirmed, to move forward on this critical issue.\n  The next Commissioner of the FDA must also work to promote safer \nalternatives to powerful prescription painkillers and to remove from \nthe market older, less safe drugs. Dr. Califf and I discussed the FDA's \nrecent announcement to expand access to abuse-deterrent formulations of \nthese powerful\n\n[[Page S900]]\n\ndrugs to help address the opioid epidemic in this country. While it is \na step in the right direction, the FDA can and must do more. I \nappreciate Dr. Califf's commitment to redouble the agency's efforts in \ncombatting this issue, while working closely with other governmental \nagencies that can oversee the prescribing of these drugs. I expect to \nwork closely with the agency on this issue and will continue to press \nDr. Califf to take action in this area.\n  I hope that the FDA will also recognize the significant concerns that \nI and others in Vermont and other maple producing States have for the \nharm being done to maple sugar producers' income as a result of \npotentially false and misleading labeling of products that contain \nneither maple syrup nor real maple flavor. I recently meet with \nsugarmakers in Vermont who are asking for a strong and thorough \ninvestigation into possibly misrepresentative labeling of food products \nwhose labels incorrectly indicate the presence of maple syrup and \nrequest appropriate enforcement action where warranted. The tradition \nof sugaring is significant not only to our cultural heritage in Vermont \nand throughout New England, but to our efforts to strengthen the \nworking landscape and local agriculture in rural parts of our States.\n  Vermont's cheese industry, particularly raw milk cheese producers, \nhave also raised concerns about FDA overreach. While I fully support \nthe FDA's efforts to ensure the safety of our Nations' food supply, I \nbelieve that standards set by the FDA must be scientifically based and \nmust address a known threat to public health. There have been some \npositive steps forward, and the FDA has recently met with these \nproducers, agreeing to hand over the FDA's data on the standards they \nhad set. I hope that progress continues, and I look forward to hearing \nhow these discussions and data sharing is going.\n  We know that food safety will also be high on the priority list for \nthe FDA as it works to implement the Food Safety Modernization Act, \nFSMA. A landmark piece of legislation, FSMA was passed in 2011 to \nensure the production of safe foods; yet the farmers and processors in \nVermont and across the country are in need of science-based, clear \ntechnical assistance to aid in their compliance with this new set of \nrules. I was proud to learn recently that the University of Vermont was \nrecently chosen to lead the Northeast Center to Advance Food Safety. \nThis new collaboration will advance understanding and practice of \nimproved food safety among the region's small and medium-sized produce \ngrowers and processors as they learn to comply with these new complex \nfood safety standards.\n  The FDA has been without a Commissioner for nearly a year and with no \nshortage of issues to address. I am pleased the Senate is moving one \nstep closer to filling this position with tonight's vote. I look \nforward to working with Dr. Califf on the many pressing issues before \nthe FDA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, today we are about to begin \nconsideration of the nomination of Dr. Robert Califf to lead the Food \nand Drug Administration. This is a historic time at that agency. It has \na record which is not enviable in terms of the way in which it has been \ndealing with the opioid prescription drug epidemic in our country.\n  I want to give just a very brief history of what has been happening \non that issue. About 20 years ago, the FDA was asked to approve \nOxyContin--which is just a shortened form of oxycodone--continuously \ngoing into the bloodstreams of Americans. Purdue Pharma represented \nthat this would be a safer way of having prescription opioids go into \nthe American medical system. Nothing could have been further from the \ntruth because oxycodone--the material inside of OxyContin--is \nmolecularly very similar to heroin.\n  So when one has a bottle of OxyContin or oxycodone continuously in \nyour cabinet--30 pills, 60 pills or more--you are talking about having \na bottle in your medicine cabinet that is very close to being heroin. \nNow if someone said to you that your child or family member is now \ntaking something that is very close to heroin, that would have a \nprofound impact on you--but that is never quite explained to the \nAmerican public. That is something that was not understood at the time \nbecause Purdue Pharmaceutical company was representing that it was safe \nto take OxyContin. It turned out that was not the case.\n  Today we have an epidemic in the United States. More than 30,000 \npeople in 2014 died from this prescription drug heroin epidemic which \nis ravaging our country. This is a dramatic increase from 1996, when we \nreally didn't even talk about it in our country. More than 30,000 \npeople died in 2014. The number most likely was much higher last year. \nThe number, most likely, will be even higher this year as well. Here is \nthe story--80 percent of all people who are dying in the United States \nfrom heroin overdoses started on prescription opioids. Eighty percent \nof all people who died in 2014 from heroin overdoses started on \nprescription opioid painkillers. So the pathway into this heroin \nepidemic is quite clear. It is the Food and Drug Administration \napproving these new prescription opioid pills without the proper \nsafeguards having been put in place to ensure that it doesn't make the \nproblem worse rather than improving the problem.\n  That is why the debate on Dr. Robert Califf is so important. The Food \nand Drug Administration is saying they will not empanel expert advisory \npanels to review the approval of each one of the new prescription \nopiates that are in the pipeline right now at the FDA. What is the \nevidence that will cause big problems? Well, back in 2012 the FDA had \nto consider Zohydro. Zohydro was a new prescription pain opioid. They \nempaneled a group of advisers--experts--to look at the drug. By 11 to \n2, the expert advisory panel said: No, do not approve this new drug, \nunless we establish a whole new system or standard in America for \naddiction, abuse, for diversion of these drugs. Don't do it. The FDA \nignored the advisory panel and approved Zohydro, with experts all \nacross America attacking the FDA for not understanding how \nfundamentally the culture in our country had changed since 1996 with \nthe first approval of OxyContin.\n  Moving forward, the FDA decided it would not empanel expert advisory \npanels at all because they knew most likely they would vote no. So on \nnew drugs such as Hysingla or Targiniq, there were no advisory panels \nat all because it was said by those companies that there are abuse \ndeterrents that are inside those new opioids.\n  What does that mean? Abuse deterrent is basically going to the issue \nof whether that new pill--that new drug--can be crushed to be used for \npurposes other than what is intended, which is to be a painkiller. \nHowever, if the individual just continues to take the pills in the \nbottle as they are prescribed and they do it on a continuous basis, \nthey run a high risk of becoming addicted.\n  The warning went out from all of these outside groups that expert \nadvisory panels were needed. The FDA ignored them. Then we hit August \nof 2015. Believe it or not, Purdue Pharma wanted to get approval for \n11- to 16-year-olds to have OxyContin. Remember, this is heroin \nequivalent. This would go to 11- to 16-year-olds. What they decided to \ndo was to not have any advisory panel at all on that issue in August of \n2015. This is despite the fact that it was controversial, that it had \ntremendous social impact on our society, and that the FDA's own \nguidance says that expert advisory panels are needed on drugs of that \nnature when pediatric dosing or child prescribing is in question. The \nFDA just ignored it.\n  I put my hold on Dr. Califf's nomination. Senator Manchin put his \nhold. We are raising this issue. We are saying to the FDA that we need \nadvisory panels. We need a change of culture at the FDA. This just \ncannot continue.\n  The FDA said they would look at it. The FDA said they would study it. \nThen the FDA announced 2 weeks ago that there would be no advisory \npanels for any of the new opioids which are in the pipeline over at the \nFDA because they are ``abuse deterrent.'' Abuse deterrent is an \noxymoron. It is a contradiction in terms. It is like jumbo shrimp. \nThere is no such thing as an abuse deterrent inside of a bottle of \npills that have the same molecular constitution as heroin, especially \nif we are talking about giving it to kids age 11 to 16 in our society.\n  By the way, if you want to know why there has been a spike in the \nnumber of\n\n[[Page S901]]\n\nbreaking-and-entering crimes in people's homes, with people breaking in \nand looking for these bottles of pills, I will tell you why. Each one \nof these pills can be worth upward of $80 apiece on the streets of \nAmerica. Hear that number? For a bottle of 60 with 80 milligrams is \nworth between $4,000 and $5,000 on the streets of America. That is why \nthey want to break into your house. They don't take the TV. They are \nlooking for that bottle of medicine because that is how much it is \nworth. That is how much they can sell it for.\n  When do we begin to get real about the fact that it is a bottle of \nheroin-equivalent in people's homes?\n  Ultimately, when all their prescriptions are finished off and they \ncan't get it anymore from the doctor, they wind up with heroin at $5 a \nbag in the street. So America, it doesn't matter which community in \nAmerica we are talking about. It can be Boston, West Virginia, \nKentucky, California, it is all the same story, the same pathway in, \nfor 80 percent of all those who overdose on heroin in our society. They \nare still looking for that heroin-like experience.\n  So we have a big issue that the FDA is not responding to, which is \nwhy I don't believe Dr. Califf should be confirmed until we have a \nchange at the FDA, and they are not going to do it. We have to make \nsure they understand it is a coalition of pharmaceutical companies and \nphysicians which have created this epidemic in our country. We are \nreaching a point where we are going to have a Vietnam war equivalent of \npeople dying every single year inside of the United States on an issue \ncreated largely by the pharmaceutical and physician community in our \nsociety. So when do we start getting real about it? When do we start \nhaving a reality check, that while we are 5 percent of the world's \npopulation here in the United States, we consume 80 percent of all of \nthe prescription painkillers in the world? Mix well, wait 20 years, and \na pandemic has broken out across our country.\n  The FDA has a responsibility to ensure that we put the protections in \nplace, that the warnings are there, that the dosage is correct, and \nthat the preventive measures are used to reduce dramatically the number \nof families who are going to be devastated by this issue.\n  When people have back pains, when people have issues other than the \nmost life threatening, we have to begin to discuss how long we want \nthese people to be on something that has the same molecular \nconstitution as heroin. It is a big issue. Lower back pain, broken \nlegs--there is perhaps a greater danger from the prescribing than there \nis from the actual underlying injury in terms of the long-term \nconsequences for these families.\n  We have to have this discussion in our country. We have to have the \nkind of discussion that says that heroin overdoses in our country have \nquadrupled in the last 14 years--quadrupled--and 80 percent of it \nstarted with prescription opioids. We have to have this discussion.\n  Dr. Califf has been nominated as the new head of the FDA. They are \nnot going to change business as usual at the FDA. They are not going to \ndo it. They have already announced it. They don't want to hear from \nexperts. Their slogan at the FDA is no experts need apply to come in \nand give advice to the pharmaceutical companies and to the FDA. No \nwarnings are needed from anyone with regard to what this industry has \nbeen doing to our country and what the FDA has been approving. So this \nissue is one that absolutely is at the top of the list of the things we \nhave to deal with in our country.\n  Last year, the Food and Drug Administration, the agency that actually \napproves how much of this opioid painkiller can be sold in--and the way \nthe system works is individual companies go to the Food and Drug \nAdministration, tell them how much they want to have approved, and then \nthe FDA never tells the rest of the world how much they allowed each \ncompany to, in fact, manufacture in terms of the painkiller, the \nopioid. They give an aggregate number, but they never tell you how much \neach company got approved.\n  What I would like people to do in their minds right now is to think \nfor a moment how many prescription opioid pain pills--equivalent in \noxycodone, other opioids--were approved by the Food and Drug \nAdministration last year. Just pick a number. How many pills total? Do \nyou have a number in your head? I am going to give you the answer: 14 \nbillion. Can I repeat that? There were 14 billion prescription opioid \npills approved for a country of 300 million. That is a bottle for every \nsingle adult--a bottle, again I tell you--with the material that has \nthe molecular equivalency of heroin inside the cabinets of people \ninside the United States of America.\n  This has to stop. It has to end. I understand it is a good business \nmodel for the companies manufacturing these things, but it is not good \nfor America, and it is not good for the families in our country. The \nFDA has to stop them. That is why Senator Manchin, Senator Blumenthal, \nand others who are going to be speaking on this issue--we don't think \nDr. Califf should be approved until they change business as usual, \nuntil they make a commitment that they are going to change business as \nusual at the Food and Drug Administration. They are supposed to be the \nguardian of our public health. They are supposed to be the arbiters of \nwhat is safe for Americans to consume, but they have not been doing the \njob. I am not talking about 1996 anymore; I am talking about 2015 and \n2016. I am talking about right now with the evidence of this national \ntragedy manifesting itself in every community in our country.\n  The least that the Senate should be able to say is that it tried, \nreally tried, to deal with this issue that has been created by the \npharmaceutical and the physician community. It will not be enough to \nsay that we are going to authorize $1.1 billion for treatment, although \nwe need treatment because there are millions of people who are going to \nneed it in our society.\n  We have to go back to the root causes of this problem, this flood of \ndrugs that have gone into this society, the lack of prescribing \neducation that physicians have to undergo. The FDA indicates that only \n10 percent of physicians in America voluntarily even get educated with \nregard to what are the consequences of having a bottle of molecularly \nsimilar heroin pills to be put inside the cabinets of Americans--10 \npercent of physicians. That is just plain wrong, ladies and gentlemen. \nWe have to make sure that the education is there for the physicians who \nneed it. We have to make sure that the pharmaceutical companies do not \nget permission to be able to get these new pills approved until there \nis a new standard for abuse, a new standard for addiction, a new \nstandard for the diversion of these pills, a new standard for what \nabuse deterrent means because right now, again, it is a contradiction \nin terms.\n  You can still get addicted by taking an Oxy or a Percocet over and \nover again, day by day. You are going to get just as addicted. It is \nnot an abuse deterrent if that is how you are going to be taking it. \nYou still wind up with the same problem.\n  We need to get real here. There is no bigger issue in our country. \nThere is no more profound change that has taken place on the streets of \nour country. When it increases by fourfold in just 14 years, what is on \nthe horizon for our society if we don't put an end to it?\n  Working with other Senators, I intend to continue to explain this \nproblem to other Members. I could not have a better partner than the \nSenator from Connecticut, Senator Blumenthal, who as attorney general \nin the State of Connecticut and now as a Senator has focused laserlike \non this issue. We are both committed to making sure that education of \nphysicians becomes an indispensable part of the remedy--the Rx that we \nin the Senate put on the books--so that at a minimum that education is \nmade mandatory for every physician who is going to be handing out these \npills to otherwise unsuspecting Americans.\n  I will just finish this way. One patient came up to me and said: You \nknow, when a doctor says to you that these pills for your family member \nare good, you are not going to second-guess the physician. You are \ngoing to assume that because the physician gave them to you, they must \nbe good.\n  And then this man said to me that he and his wife looked back and \nsaid: Should we have known more? Should we have done something \ndifferent? Should we have tried to protect that other family member?\n\n[[Page S902]]\n\n  No, it should be the FDA. It should be the DEA. It should be the \nphysicians. It should be the prescribers. They are the ones that should \nhave the responsibility, not the guilt that they are giving to families \nall across the country that they should have known more. No, ladies and \ngentlemen, this is the time for us to finally act on this issue.\n  I yield to the great Senator from the State of Connecticut, Senator \nBlumenthal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I am so honored to follow my great \nfriend and very eloquent advocate from Massachusetts, Senator Markey, \nwho said much more powerfully than I can our reasons for opposing Dr. \nRobert Califf as the nominee for the head of the FDA. To say it very \nsimply, this agency needs drastic reform. It needs an overhaul in the \nway that it approves these powerful painkilling substances that can be \na gateway to addiction, whether to opiates or whether to heroin. I am \nproud to stand on the floor with Senator Markey, Senator Manchin, and \nothers who feel that more must be done, that our Nation is lagging in \naddressing an epidemic.\n  It is truly a public health hurricane that is sweeping Connecticut \nand our country. I have done roundtables around my State that are among \nthe most moving public experiences of my service in the Senate and, \nindeed, my time for 20 years as attorney general on any public issue. \nIt is an issue that concerns Iowa as well as every other State in the \ncountry. It is an issue that should bring us together on a bipartisan \nbasis to address this true public health crisis.\n  My reason for opposing Dr. Califf is, very simply, the failure of the \nFDA to recognize its own shortcomings and the prospect that there will \nbe no change in the way the FDA is responding or failing to respond to \nthis crisis if he is confirmed. With his confirmation, all that we can \nsee ahead is more of the same.\n  That is unacceptable. The FDA must be part of the solution or it will \ncontinue to be part of the problem. There is no question that the \nsolution to this problem has to be multifaceted. In the roundtables \nthat I have held around our State and in my conversations with the \nexperts in this field and in the meetings that I have conducted with \npublic health officials around the State with recovering addicts and \ntheir families, law enforcement, as well as public officials, I have \nseen that there is no single solution. There is no one-size-fits-all \nfor recovering addicts, for communities, for different parts of the \ncountry. There has to be an emphasis on law enforcement because cutting \noff the supply has to be an objective, and law enforcement needs and \ndeserves more support from this Nation and from the Congress. There has \nto be an emphasis on treatment and services. We are not going to arrest \nour way or jail our way out of this public health crisis, nor is \ntreatment alone a sufficient solution. Part of the solution has to be \nmore action from the FDA to oversee, scrutinize, and stop the pipeline \nof painkillers and opioids that are continuing to deluge our community.\n  The urgency of this crisis is clear. In 2015 my State had more than \n700 prescriptions leading to overdose deaths. These fatal overdoses are \nalso avoidable. The number of opioid-related deaths around the Nation \nhas skyrocketed, and behind every one of these heartbroken families and \ncommunities is a realization that more must be done. We depend on the \nFDA to deal with these kinds of problems. The American people rely on \nthis agency to implement a strong, regulatory approach to protect them.\n  Unfortunately, the FDA has utterly and abjectly failed to protect the \nAmerican people against the epidemic of opioid overuse. The FDA has a \ntroubling history in this area, and I am well familiar with it because \nI highlighted it when I was the attorney general of our State, asking \nfor stronger warnings for patients and consumers, asking for better \noversight of oxycodone and related medicine, and asking for better \nsupervision and education of the prescribers. And I asked in letters, \nin petitions, and in legal actions. In effect, the FDA has fueled this \ncrisis by approving too many drugs with too little analysis. Too often, \nit has failed to use an advisory committee when approving a new opioid \npainkiller. It has demonstrated a troubling preference for speed over \nsafety. It has expedited consideration at the risk of public health.\n\n  It is essential to have an independent panel of experts to review and \nadvise the agency on its approval of any opioid painkiller, giving the \npublic a chance to provide input before a product comes to market. \nUnfortunately, in addition to instances where no advisory committee has \nbeen convened, the FDA has simply approved new drugs over committees \nobjections. This failing to listen to warnings from experts harms \npublic health and safety and confidence and credibility of this agency.\n  One example, which some of my colleagues may remember, concerns the \nFDA's approval of the drug Zohydro. This high-dose, extremely potent \nopioid, which lacks abuse-deterrent properties, was approved in 2014 \ndespite strong objections from the scientific advisory panel that \napproved it. That panel voted 11 to 2 against approving the drug.\n  The questionable oversight tactics the FDA has employed so far leave \nme with serious doubts about its ability to implement its recently \nreleased action plan. In this plan, the agency committed to convening \nadvisory committees when approving any opioid painkiller that is not \nabuse-deterrent. This approach is, very simply, insufficient.\n  We have seen how dangerous opioids can be. All opioids, whether or \nnot they are classified as abuse-deterrent, should be reviewed by an \nindependent advisory committee. And even if an opioid is classified as \nabuse-deterrent, that doesn't mean it cannot be abused or that an \nadvisory committee shouldn't be consulted. The FDA itself recognizes \nthat abuse-deterrent technology is in its infancy and independent \nadvice is therefore essential.\n  Unfortunately, instances where the FDA has failed to listen to its \nadvisory committees are not limited to the context of drug approvals. \nIn 2012 the agency recognized that opioids could lead to a number of \ndangerous outcomes--addiction, accidental overdose, and death. In \nresponse, the FDA implemented a risk-management strategy for extended-\nrelease opioids, including requiring education for prescribers on safe \nprescription practices and the potential for abuse and addiction. Two \nyears have passed--2 years since the first of these trainings was made \navailable--but the FDA has yet to release information showing how many \nprescribers have been trained and educated on responsible prescribing \npractices. The FDA has ignored my call for this information to be \nreleased.\n  The FDA has ignored the recommendations from two advisory committees \nthat a similar strategy should be used for immediate-release opioids as \nwell--a crucial issue, given that 91 percent of all opioids prescribed \nare in this category.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in sending a signal to the FDA \nthat more effective scrutiny and actions are vitally important. The FDA \nhas failed to take this crisis seriously. Until it does, it is failing \nthe American people. And a new FDA head must indicate there will be a \nsea change--a fundamental overhaul--in the way FDA oversees and \nprotects the American people.\n  I would like to highlight as well the crucial importance of \nfinalizing the deeming rule, which is necessary to ensure the agency's \nauthority over all tobacco products--also pertaining to addiction; the \ndrug is nicotine--and that is essential to ensure that not only \ncigarettes but also e-cigarettes--that the companies that make them \ncannot market to children and to people who may be led to addiction to \nthat drug.\n  I am determined that the Nation do better in addressing this urgent \ncrisis--a public health hurricane sweeping this country, as disastrous \nas any physical crisis of tornadoes or floods, maybe, in destroying \nlives and jeopardizing our national security.\n  I am pleased to yield back to my colleague Senator Markey and to be \njoined by my great friend and colleague Senator Joe Manchin of West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. MARKEY. I thank the Senator from Connecticut, and we intend on \ncontinuing this battle right through this entire confirmation process \nand beyond. Unless we stop it now, FDA is\n\n[[Page S903]]\n\nnot going to stand for ``Food and Drug Administration,'' it is going to \nstand for ``fostering drug addiction.'' That is what it has been doing. \nIt has to change the way it does business. It has to respond to this \naddiction and abuse crisis in our country. It has to be the cop on the \nbeat. It has to understand its responsibility to not allow this flood \nof drugs to go into our society, and we have to begin the battle now.\n  I urge all Members to vote no on this nomination. This is not \ndirected personally at Dr. Califf but directed at an agency which has \nallowed this flood of drugs into our society without putting the proper \nprotections in place.\n  I now yield to the great Senator from West Virginia, who has \ndedicated his career as Governor and as Senator to leading on this \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. First of all, Mr. President, I want to say to my \ncolleagues, Senator Markey of Massachusetts and Senator Blumenthal of \nConnecticut, this doesn't have a partisan home. This is not a \nDemocratic or Republican issue. This is an epidemic that is devastating \nour entire country. It doesn't matter whether someone comes from \naffluence or is socioeconomically challenged. Rich or poor, it makes no \ndifference. What side of the track you live on makes no difference. \nThis is an epidemic that hits us all in its devastation.\n  If Senators will just talk to their communities, their law \nenforcement officials, they will tell you that over 80 percent of all \ncrimes are drug-related. Look at the cost, look at the economy, and \nlook at the devasation in the cost of lives it is taking. Something has \nto be done.\n  We are expected to vote to confirm the President's nominee for \nCommissioner of the FDA, Dr. Robert Califf. Let me say this about our \nPresident, President Barack Obama: I think he is taking this seriously. \nHe has come to the State of West Virginia, and I am very appreciative \nof that. He has seen firsthand the devastation it has taken in all \naspects of life in West Virginia. We are a State that is hit as hard as \nif not harder than other States. It is the No. 1 killer in my State. \nThere are more people dying by legal prescription drug abuse than any \nother cause. So the President came there and he saw that. I am just \nasking the President to make that major commitment to our having a \ncultural change by giving us someone who will shake it up from the top.\n  I believe Dr. Califf is a good man. I really do. I believe he is a \nqualified man. I met with him and spoke with him, and I directly asked \nhim--I said: Dr. Califf, you come from a culture where basically the \nlarge pharmaceutical industry that supplies these types of products to \nthe market and expects the FDA to approve them are the people who have \nsupported you for the last 20 years. It is just human nature that that \nis hard to change and hard to say no to.\n  So with that being said, I said that I think we need a cultural \nchange. I think he understands that and respects my position. I respect \nhis. I just think he is the wrong person at this time of need for the \nposition. We need to shake it up. He is going to continue to serve as \nDeputy Commissioner of the FDA's Office of Medical Products and \nTobacco, but the Commissioner of the agency must be someone willing to \nlead in a different direction. With 51 Americans dying every day due to \nan opioid overdose, the FDA now more than ever needs a Commissioner who \nis a champion committed to changing the way this agency handles \nopioids.\n  As I have said many times before, my State of West Virginia has been \nhit hardest. Drug overdose deaths have soared by more than 700 percent \nsince 1999. We lost 600 West Virginians to opioids last year alone. But \nthat is not the only problem in West Virginia. Since 1999 we have lost \nalmost 200,000 Americans to prescription opioid abuse.\n  I am here today to urge all my colleagues, before they take their \nvote today, to think about the citizens of their States who are \nsuffering from prescription drug abuse. Think about all those you know \nwho have lost a loved one due to this epidemic. Each and every one of \nus here knows someone whose life has been wrecked by legal prescription \ndrug addiction.\n  This is a silent killer. There is not a person whom I know in any \ncommunity or any group in any setting whom I can't look at and say: \nThere is not one of you in this room who doesn't know someone in your \nimmediate family or among your extended family or friends who hasn't \nbeen affected. That is how rampant this is, but it is something we \ndon't speak about much. We are concerned. It could be our son, could be \na brother or a sister, could be a mother, father, aunt, or uncle, but \nwe don't want to talk about it. We are afraid it has been stereotyped.\n  We need a culture change. As the agency overseeing the approval of \nthese addictive drugs, the FDA plays a critical role in this epidemic, \nand as my dear friend from Massachusetts, Senator Markey, said, the FDA \nmight have to change what it stands for. It really has fostered this \ndrug addiction more than any other agency. Think about the fact that it \nis being produced legally, approved by the Federal Government in a \nlegal way, and it is being prescribed in legal ways. We are the most \naddicted Nation on Earth. Over 80 percent of the opioids consumed in \nthe world are consumed by 5 percent of the world's population, that 5 \npercent all living in this great country of ours. Something is wrong. \nSomething is wrong, and everyone should be concerned about this.\n  I tell our children and grandchildren, Mr. President, when I speak in \nschools--I say: You don't have to worry about another country ever \ntaking us over militarily. We have the greatest military the world has \never known. We have the strongest economy, and we are the only ones who \ncan correct the mistakes we have made in our economy because it is so \nstrong. They do not think they have to take us on militarily or be \nworried about overtaking our economy; they are going to sit back and \nwait until we become so addicted we can't function. This is what we are \ndealing with, and this is why it is of such importance.\n  The agency has been so callous about their approach to this epidemic. \nAs a matter of fact, time and time again they have failed to consider \nthe public's health. One would assume that if the Food and Drug \nAdministration makes a decision that something is good and consumable, \nthey would have looked at the effect it has on the public, the health \nand well-being of the citizens of this great Nation. Yet it has \nactively stood in the way of addressing this opioid abuse epidemic--and \nnot only not considering it but prohibiting others from doing it.\n  For years, the FDA delayed before finally agreeing to reschedule \nhydrocodone--to reschedule. Let me explain where I am coming from. When \nI first came to the Senate in late 2010, early 2011, I said: My \ngoodness, we have Vicodin and Lortab, the most prescribed opioids on \nthe market--more than any others. OxyContin had already been moved to a \nschedule II, and Vicodin and Lortab were schedule III. It took us 3 \nyears to get the FDA to reschedule Vicodin and Lortab and all opioids \nto a schedule II. It took 3 years--and after their own advisory \ncommittee overwhelmingly recommended that it be rescheduled. That means \na doctor can only give out a 30-day supply at one time without a doctor \nvisit. Under a schedule III, they can give out 90 days and continue to \njust call it in without seeing a doctor. They were putting this stuff \nout like they were M So that changed and we finally got that done, \nbut it took forever to get it done and we never could understand why.\n  Since that change went into effect, we have seen the number of \nprescriptions for hydrocodone products, such as Vicodin and Lortab, \nfall by 22 percent. We know it worked because they were \noverprescribing. So 22 percent--that is 26 million fewer prescriptions \nand 1.1 billion fewer pills on the market. That is how much just that \none change--it took 3 years but should have been done in 3 weeks. It \ntook 3 years because the FDA stalled their decisionmaking. Then, after \nfinally making the important step after 3 years, the next day--the next \nday that that was done--the FDA approved the dangerous drug called \nZohydro. The next day, after 3 years of waiting to get all opiates to a \nschedule II, they came out and recommended Zohydro and approved it, \neven when their own experts--their\n\n[[Page S904]]\n\nown advisory committee made up of experts--recommended 11 to 2 against \nbringing this most powerful, lethal drug on the market.\n\n  This drug has ten times the hydrocodone of Vicodin and Lortab, with \nthe capability of killing an individual with just two pills, and just \nrecently the FDA approved OxyContin for use for children 11 years of \nage. Can you believe that? They did that without having any experts or \nany advisory committee's consent or recommendations. This decision \nmeans that Pharma is now legally allowed to advertise OxyContin to \npediatricians under certain circumstances.\n  We have seen the devastating impacts of this type of advertising, and \nwe have years of evidence that shows that drug use at an early age \nmakes a child more likely to abuse drugs later in life. These decisions \nillustrate the FDA's inability to consider public health and assess the \nrealities of this deadly epidemic. While I recently accepted the \nagency's decision to finally start listening to the advice of its \nexpert advisory committee--they have just decided now they are going to \nstart listening to their advisory committees. No way have they decided \nto take their recommendations. They are just going to listen. While \nthis might be a step in the right direction, finally, of their \nlistening and basically taking the advice of experts but not acting on \nit, I think is absolutely meaningless.\n  The change at the FDA needs to be fundamental, and it needs to come \nfrom the top. We need a leader who changes the current way of thinking. \nUnless a major cultural change is implemented at the FDA, similar \ninstances will continue to occur into the future. Meanwhile, our \nNation's opiate epidemic continues only to worsen, and our friends and \nfamilies are further torn apart by the impact of addiction.\n  If Dr. Califf is confirmed today, I do not feel confident that this \nculture change is going to take place. Dr. Califf has close financial \nties with the pharmaceutical industry. Between 2010 and 2014, Dr. \nCaliff received money through his university salary and consulting fees \nfrom 26 Pharma companies, including opiate manufacturers. In the past, \nDr. Califf has actually described the FDA regulation as a barrier--not \na safeguard for public health, but a barrier.\n  I believe the FDA needs new leadership, new focus, and a new culture. \nDr. Califf's past involvement with the pharmaceutical industry shows \nthat he would not be the person to do that. He would not have the \nimpact or leadership capabilities the Nation needs to stem the tide of \nthe opioid crisis. I believe the FDA must break its cozy relationship \nwith the pharmaceutical industry and, instead, start a relationship \nwith the millions of Americans impacted by prescription drug abuse. It \nis because of this belief that I am urging my colleagues to vote \nagainst the confirmation of Dr. Califf.\n  My office has been absolutely flooded with stories from West \nVirginians and Americans who want their voices heard. I am going to \nread just a couple of letters because I think it is important to know \nthe impact of these letters. I absolutely want you to hear it. And I \nknow every State has been impacted the way my State has.\n  This is Susan's story:\n\n       My name is Susan. I am from West Virginia and I am the \n     mother of three children, ages 20, 16, and 14. My oldest \n     son's name is Zack. Zack is an addict.\n       Zack grew up in a small town with his mother, father, \n     brother, and sister. He played sports throughout his \n     childhood including football, baseball, wrestling, and \n     basketball. He got good grades in school. He went to church \n     with his grandparents and wanted to be a preacher until the \n     age of 11 or 12.\n       My husband and I divorced when Zack was 13, and it deeply \n     affected Zack. We moved to a new town where Zack and his \n     brother and sister started into a new school system. Around \n     the age of 15-16 Zack started self-medicating with nerve \n     pills----\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I hate to interrupt the Senator, but the time \nhas expired.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I didn't think there was a time barrier on this. I am so \nsorry. I ask unanimous consent to continue at least this letter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. The \nSenator from Washington has 5 minutes to go. I have 10 minutes to go. \nThe vote is at 5:30. So I guess----\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I should be done here in about 2 or 3 minutes. If I can \njust finish this letter--I have many more, but I will come back later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe Senator's remarks, I be allowed 6 minutes and the Senator from \nTennessee be allowed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from West Virginia?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Continuing:\n\n       Around the age of 15-16 Zack started self-medicating with \n     nerve pills, smoking pot, and drinking. Zack did his first \n     stint in rehab at the age of 16. He went to Florida to a \n     rehab facility because they were able to arrange everything \n     including his flight before we even got a call back from any \n     facility in our state. Zack was in treatment 60 days and \n     returned home. He was clean for several months and then \n     started using again. Zack graduated to using pain pills. From \n     there he started shooting up pain pills. A child who had a \n     horrific fear of needles was now injecting opiates to escape \n     his painful reality. Zack was robbing people and living house \n     to house and on the streets. Then when he figured out heroin \n     was a cheaper fix and more accessible, this became his new \n     drug of choice. Zack was arrested and given the chance to go \n     to rehab again. He completed another 2 trips to rehab, one \n     being 60-90 days and another being around 30. He came home, \n     relapsed and went to jail for 4 months due to failed drug \n     tests. He spent 4 months in regional jail without receiving \n     one counseling session or any help with substance abuse. When \n     he was released from jail he was very lost and didn't know \n     what to do with his life. He was clean several months before \n     relapsing again.\n       Zack is now in a peer recovery program in West Virginia. He \n     is 20 years old and on his 4[th] stint in rehab. He is \n     fighting for his life in this program along with about 120 \n     other men. He has been to jail, and has lost close to 20 \n     people in his life due to overdoses.\n       Being a mother of an addict is a nightmare. From learning \n     your child has this disease to fighting with insurance \n     companies and doctors to get your child treatment. When Zack \n     was a juvenile, I was told by treatment providers that \n     insurance companies did not consider substance abuse in \n     children a life threatening disorder. I had to run up in a \n     house when he ran away and handcuff him and take him to a \n     hospital high as a kite. I had CPS called on me for having my \n     intoxicated son handcuffed because I wasn't a police officer. \n     I had mental hygiene warrants lost. My son was released by a \n     hospital at a moderate risk to suicide and because of that \n     treatment centers wouldn't even consider admitting him into \n     their program. I was told by hospital staff that if I had a \n     medical card instead of private insurance or if my child was \n     a ward of the state, they could get him more help. I \n     contemplated quitting my job in order to get a medical card \n     for my son. I have been asked by rehab to take out loans in \n     order to get my son help. I have had to borrow thousands of \n     dollars from my family in order to get my son into treatment.\n       I have driven my child to hospitals while he is nodding in \n     and out and I was crying so hard I couldn't see. I have \n     stayed up for 24 hours in a row watching my son detox in \n     hospitals. I have followed ambulances for miles transferring \n     him [to] facilities. I have missed Christmases, \n     Thanksgivings, and birthdays with my son. I have gone months \n     and months without a good night's sleep. I would cringe every \n     time the phone rang or there was a knock on the door. No \n     mother should ever have to just wait on that phone call or \n     for that [knock] on the door.\n       I have also had to sit my other 2 children down and explain \n     to them that I don't love them any less than I do their \n     brother. I have had to tell them I have to dedicate more time \n     to Zack because I know the 2 of them will be okay but I have \n     to try and keep their brother alive.\n       You see this epidemic is not only affecting the person who \n     is the addict. It is destroying families and communities. \n     Siblings are forgotten. Marriages and relationships are being \n     destroyed. Entire families are getting PTSD. Crime is at an \n     all-time high. The list goes on and on. The whole system is \n     broken when it comes to treating mental illness and \n     addiction. Until we get the money to fund treatment and more \n     treatment centers, this epidemic will continue to get worse.\n       If my child had cancer, or any other chronic disease, he \n     would be able to get immediate treatment. He would be able to \n     get good treatment. Addiction is a disease that may start \n     with a poor choice, but is ultimately a disease. Until we are \n     able to provide adequate treatment immediately to those \n     suffering we will continue to lose a generation of people. I \n     pray that no one else has to experience the pain my family \n     and my son has experienced, but unfortunately, this disease \n     has entered into every community, every neighborhood, and \n     into most families. It's\n\n[[Page S905]]\n\n     just a shame that we live in the greatest nation in the world \n     and this is our reality.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for allowing me that. I am very \nconcerned about where our country is going and the role the FDA plays. \nWe need a cultural change.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to start by expressing my \nappreciation to Dr. Califf for accepting this nomination and continuing \nto offer his expertise in service of families and communities \nnationwide.\n  I am glad this evening to have the opportunity to talk about the \nprogress the FDA has made in recent years, the challenges that lie \nahead, and why I believe Dr. Califf has the necessary leadership, \nbackground, and experience to guide the FDA at this very important \ntime.\n  The FDA oversees a quarter of all the goods sold in the United \nStates, including more than $1 trillion in medical devices, cosmetics, \nand supplements. So the FDA Commissioner has a very critical \nresponsibility to support health and well-being in this country.\n  I am pleased that in recent years important progress has been made to \nimprove FDA's services for patients and families, from approving the \nhighest number of new drugs and biologics in 2014, to making progress \ntoward a 21st-century food safety system as the Food Safety \nModernization Act is implemented. These are important steps that have \nno doubt made a difference for families, but the FDA still faces \nsignificant challenges as we look ahead.\n  As I have discussed with Dr. Califf, the FDA must continue to \nencourage the development of safe, effective cures and treatments for \nthe chronic illnesses that impact far too many families across the \ncountry. The agency should prioritize tackling the threat of antibiotic \nresistant infections, such as the ones linked to the contaminated \nmedical devices in my home State, and it should do more to ensure \npatients can always trust that the medical devices used in their care \nare safe and effective, including by building a robust postmarketing \nsurveillance system for devices. The FDA should continue to strengthen \nits generic drug and biosimilar programs and needs to play a role in \nensuring that all patients and families have access to the prescription \ndrugs they need.\n  In addition, our country faces urgent public health challenges that \nthe FDA must help to address. To name a few, we need to move forward on \nmaking sure families have access to nutritional information and on \nensuring our food supply is both safe and healthy. We need to put all \nthe agency tools to work to stop tobacco companies from targeting our \nchildren. And we need to tackle the epidemic of opioid abuse that is \nending and ruining lives in communities nationwide.\n  I was pleased to see that the FDA put forward an action plan to help \nprotect our communities from that crisis, and I look forward to working \ntogether with all of our colleagues to address that area.\n  Another critical priority is ensuring the FDA always puts science \nover politics. As some on the floor today will remember, several of my \ncolleagues fought long and hard to ensure that medical expertise, not \nideology, governed decisionmaking on the sale of Plan B over the \ncounter. Women and families have to be able to trust the FDA to not \nplay politics with their health.\n  After careful consideration and review, I am confident that Dr. \nCaliff would contribute leadership and expertise as we work to tackle \nall of these challenges. He is a strong nominee for the role of FDA \nCommissioner. He has an impressive history of leadership and management \nexperience, especially at Duke University, where he led one of our \nlargest academic clinical research organizations. He would bring to \nthis new role a record of advancing medical breakthroughs on \nchallenging illnesses through clinical trials and working to translate \nNIH lab discoveries into usable medical treatments for patients. Our \nreview of his record demonstrates a longstanding commitment to \ntransparency in relationships with industry and working to ensure \nacademic integrity. Dr. Califf has made clear he will continue to \nuphold those values and prioritize a strong, independent FDA as \nCommissioner. His nomination received letters of support from 128 \ndifferent physician and patient organizations, as well as the strong, \nbipartisan support of the members of our HELP Committee.\n  I have approached this nomination focused on the best interests of \nfamilies and communities in my State and across the country and in \nmaking sure the FDA puts them first in all its work. I believe Dr. \nCaliff would be a valuable partner in this effort as FDA Commissioner. \nSo I encourage all of our colleagues to join me in supporting his \nnomination, and I look forward to working with all of us to strengthen \nhealth and well-being for the families and communities we serve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President for the information of Senators, the \nvote will be in about 10 minutes, following my remarks, and I want to \nmake my remarks because of the importance of this nomination.\n  I join the Senator from Washington State in urging our colleagues to \nvote to end debate on the nomination of Dr. Califf and then tomorrow to \nvote for him.\n  We are very fortunate to have a man of this distinction accept this \nposition. I congratulate the President for his nomination. I note, as \nthe Senator from Washington said, that his nomination has been widely \napplauded across this country and received strong bipartisan support in \nour committee after an intense investigation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, following my \nremarks, a list of 124 organizations that have submitted letters in \nsupport of Dr. Califf's nomination to our committee. The list does not \ninclude press releases or other statements of support that were not \nsubmitted to the committee.\n  Dr. Califf will be in charge of the Food and Drug Administration. \nThat agency is responsible for the safety and effectiveness of our \nNation's medicines, devices, and other medical products in protecting \nour country's food supply.\n  It is not too much to say that this job affects virtually every \nsingle American. It is a huge job. The FDA affects nearly every single \nAmerican and regulates about one-quarter of all consumer spending in \nthe United States--about $4 trillion annually. It is responsible for \nproduct areas as diverse as prescription drugs for humans as well as \nfor animals, for medical devices, for biologics, for cosmetics, over-\nthe-counter medications, food, and tobacco.\n  To accomplish this, the FDA employs 15,700 full-time employees \nworldwide, with an annual total budget of $4.505 billion from funds \nappropriated by the Congress and user fees paid by the industries it \nregulates. Managing an enterprise of this size is no small undertaking. \nIt requires strong leadership and a steady hand.\n  Last year, on September 17, the President nominated Dr. Califf. My \nstaff and I reviewed the nomination carefully. I found him to be well \nqualified to take charge of the FDA. He is one of the Nation's leading \ncardiologists. He was a professor at one of the Nation's top medical \nschools for over 30 years. He is an expert on clinical research. He has \nbeen recognized by the Institute for Scientific Information as one of \nthe top 10 most cited authors, with more than 1,200 peer-reviewed \npublications. He has managed large organizations, including the Duke \nClinical Research Institute as a founding director. In his current \nposition, he is FDA's Deputy Commissioner for Medical Products and \nTobacco, in which capacity he oversees the regulation of products \nincluding human drugs, biological products, medical devices, and \ntobacco.\n  He has conducted scores of important clinical trials and has advised \nand worked on research with some of the Nation's leading \npharmaceuticals and biopharmaceutical companies.\n  In addition, Dr. Califf, like every full-time nominee, has been \nthrough an indepth process to review his background. Before the \nPresident even announced his nomination, there was an extensive vetting \nby the White House and the FBI. He submitted paperwork to the Office of \nGovernment Ethics, which carefully reviewed that information looking \nfor conflicts of interest.\n\n[[Page S906]]\n\nThe form he submitted is public and includes every source of income \nover $200, every asset worth more than $1,000, and every potential \nconflict that the Office of Government Ethics determined would require \na recusal.\n  Before our committee held a hearing, Dr. Califf answered 37 pages of \nquestions from the bipartisan leadership of the committee, including \nconfidential questions on financial information, and he responded to \nwritten followup questions. His responses included over 3,000 pages of \narticles and lectures my staff and Senator Murray's staff reviewed and \nany Member of the Senate could review.\n  On November 17, the HELP Committee held a hearing on his nomination. \nHe provided testimony and took questions. Afterward, he answered 100 \npages of written questions. Throughout this process, we have carefully \nreviewed everything submitted and not found anything that would call \ninto doubt Dr. Califf's ability to lead the FDA fairly, ably, and \nimpartially.\n  I am pleased to support his nomination. I am pleased the full Senate \nnow will have an opportunity to vote on that nomination in a prompt \nway.\n  Dr. Califf's nomination comes at an important time for the FDA. For \nthe past year, the FDA has been operating without a confirmed \nCommissioner. There are important issues there. It needs a confirmed \nCommissioner to provide the leadership that will carry the agency into \nthe future.\n  One issue that has been on many of our minds is how to make sure \nAmerican patients have access to affordable drugs. Of course, the FDA's \njob is not to set drug prices. I am pleased Dr. Califf agreed at his \nconfirmation hearing that he understands the FDA's role is to make sure \nthat drugs are safe and effective, not to regulate their price, but the \nFDA can help lower drug prices by approving generic drugs and other \nproducts as quickly as it possibly can so there is more choice and \ncompetition in the market.\n  There are thousands of applications for generic drugs sitting at the \nFDA awaiting approval. Addressing this backlog, and reviewing new \napplications as expeditiously as possible, will allow lower-cost drugs \nto be available to patients. I am confident the FDA can improve its \nperformance. Just last month, our committee held a hearing on this \nissue and the FDA was optimistic about making progress.\n  We also needed a confirmed Commissioner who can guide the agency to \nmake sure it keeps pace with medical innovation. There has never been a \nmore exciting time in medical research than today. We know more about \nbiology and medicine than ever before, and knowledge is being applied \nin innovative ways.\n  We are talking about actually curing, not just treating cancers. We \nare using 3-D printing to help doctors replace knees. In one case the \nFDA has approved a drug to treat epilepsy that is made by 3-D printing. \nThe President has announced a Precision Medicine Initiative designed to \npromote personalized treatments to take into account an individual's \ngenes, environment, and lifestyle. These are exciting developments.\n  First, the FDA needs to make sure that regulation is appropriate. Too \nmuch regulation could reduce investment. Not enough regulation could \nlead patients to getting therapies that are not safe and effective.\n  At the same time, the FDA will need to make sure its policies and its \nprocedures, many of which were adopted decades ago, are capable of \naddressing the technologies of today and tomorrow. Second, as we \ncontinue to make medical advances, the FDA will need to keep up with \nthe science and rely on expertise outside the FDA when appropriate. \nDoing that will require a leader who can manage a large and complex \norganization--not just on big policies that make headlines but on day-\nto-day matters such as hiring and training scientists on the core \nmission and integrating information technology.\n  Medical products take more time and money to discover, develop, and \nreach American patients than ever before. We hear stories about drugs \nand devices that are available to patients outside the United States \nbefore they become available here, often because it is difficult for \nmanufacturers to navigate the FDA's often unclear approval \nrequirements. It often takes over a decade to develop a drug that gains \nmarketing approval in the United States. According to one recent study, \nthe costs have tripled in the last 10 years.\n  Senator Murray and I are working with our colleagues on our committee \non bipartisan legislation to help get safe, cutting-edge drugs, medical \ndevices, and treatments into Americans' medicine cabinets and doctors' \noffices more quickly.\n  We held a markup on February 9, in which we approved seven important \nbills with bipartisan support that will help both manufacturers and the \nFDA to get innovative treatments to patients more quickly. They are all \nbipartisan bills.\n  Senators Bennet, Warren, Burr, and Hatch offered the Advancing \nTargeted Therapies for Rare Diseases Act of 2015, S. 2030. If you are \nthe parent of a child suffering from a rare disease like Cystic \nFibrosis, this bill increases the chances that researchers will find a \ntreatment or cure for your child's disease. It does that by allowing \nresearchers to reuse good data they have collected, because it is hard \nto find enough patients for a clinical trial studying a rare disease \nwith multiple genetic mutations.\n  Senators Burr and Franken offered the FDA Device Accountability Act \nof 2015, S. 1622. If you are one of the millions in our country who \nwill need a medical device such as a pacemaker or knee implant, this \nbill will help drive the faster development of better devices--cutting \nunnecessary red tape from the review process for these devices.\n  Senators Baldwin and Collins offered the Next Generation Researchers \nAct, S. 2014. If you are a smart young scientist who wants to find a \ncure for cancer, this bill will help the National Institutes of Health \ncreate opportunities for you to get funding for your research, so that \nyou don't head to another country or into another field. It will also \nhelp you pay back more of your student loans.\n  Senators Kirk, Bennet, Hatch, Murkowski, Isakson, and Collins offered \nthe Enhancing the Stature and Visibility of Medical Rehabilitation \nResearch at NIH Act, S. 800. If you are one of the millions of \nAmericans with disabilities, illnesses and chronic conditions that \nrequire medical rehabilitation--maybe you suffered a stroke and need to \nrelearn how to walk--this bill will help ensure that the government is \nsupporting research that will help you have the best chance at \nrehabilitation.\n  Senators Isakson and Murphy offered the Advancing Research for \nNeurological Diseases Act of 2015, S. 849. If you are the child of a \nparent with Parkinson's, this bill will help speed a treatment or cure \nfor your parents' disease by helping researchers have access to more \ndata on neurological diseases.\n  Senator Murray offered the Preventing Superbugs and Protecting \nPatients Act, S. 2503. If you suffer from something as common as \nindigestion, or perhaps something scarier like cancer, that requires \nputting a scope down your throat to diagnose or better understand your \nailment, and this bill will help ensure that the scope the doctor uses \nis clean and doesn't give you an infection.\n  I offered with Senator Murray the Improving Health Information \nTechnology Act, S. 2511. If you are anyone who has ever changed doctors \nor needs to see a specialist and you want to be sure the new doctor you \nare seeing knows your medical history so he or she can help you best, \nthis bill takes several steps to get health records flowing between \ndoctors, hospitals, and patients to help realize the promise of health \ninformation technology by turning these systems from something that \ndoctors and hospitals dread into something that actually helps \npatients.\n  We will be taking up more of these proposals in March and in April.\n  The next FDA Commissioner will have a lot of work to do, both to \nimplement the legislation we are passing and to take the existing \nauthority and make sure we help patients as best we can.

Mr. President, I recently joined my good friend from\n\n[[Page S908]]\n\nIowa, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in writing an opinion \npiece. We expressed our joint view that the death of Justice Scalia \nrepresented a significant loss for our country and that while finding \nthe right person to take the seat he occupied will clearly be a \nmonumental task, it is one we think the American people are more than \nwell equipped to handle. Some disagree and would rather the Senate \nsimply rush through yet another lifetime appointment for a President \nwho is on his way out the door.\n  Of course, it is within the President's authority to nominate a \nsuccessor even in this very rare circumstance. Remember, the Senate has \nnot filled a vacancy arising in an election year when there was a \ndivided government since 1888--almost 130 years ago. But we also know \nthat article II, section 2 of the Constitution grants the Senate the \nright to withhold its consent as it deems necessary.\n  It is clear that concern over confirming Supreme Court nominations \nmade near the end of a Presidential term is not new. Given that we are \nin the midst of the Presidential election process, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee and I believe that today it is the American people \nwho are best positioned to help make this important decision rather \nthan a lameduck President whose priorities and policies they just \nrejected in the most recent national election.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/22/senate-section/article/S908-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/22/senate-section/article/S908-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL.

Their successful expansion 15 months ago set Bill and Julie \napart from their competition, and today their company is one of the \nlargest in Skowhegan.\n  Maine Stitching Specialties' commitment to local manufacturing and \nhigh-quality products has garnered respect from numerous mainstream \nretail stores. In recent years, Bill and Julie have had the opportunity \nto sell their products to well-established companies like L.L. Bean and \nnow Wal-Mart. Their reputation for manufacturing durable products and \ntheir commitment to the traditions and spirit of our State will ensure \nthat Maine Stitching Specialties continues to grow and prosper.\n  Bill and Julie represent a strong community of small business owners \nwho are devoted to boosting our State's economy and creating jobs in \nlocal communities. Manufacturing is at the heart of industry in Maine, \nand the success of hard-working people like Bill and Julie helps our \nState remain economically competitive.\n\n[[Page S909]]\n\n  I would like to recognize and congratulate Bill and Julie on their \nsuccess and ongoing commitment to producing high-quality goods.

Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the \nRecord copies of some of the finalist essays written by Vermont High \nSchool students as part of the sixth annual ``What is the State of the \nUnion'' essay contest conducted by my office. These finalists were \nselected from nearly 800 entries.\n  The material follows:\n\n\n             NICK SEARS, VERMONT COMMONS SCHOOL (FINALIST)\n\n       The United States of America is an amazing nation that \n     continues to lead the world through the complex geopolitical \n     problems that we are faced with today. As a strong economic \n     and political world leader, we have become the role model for \n     developing nations attempting to give their people the same \n     freedoms and opportunities that Americans have become so \n     accustomed to. This is why it is so important to work harder \n     than we ever have before to better ourselves as a nation, \n     because what we change will set a precedent of improvement \n     around the world and inspire change.\n       The biggest problem in the U.S. is the incarceration \n     system. It has been broken for decades, and there has been no \n     legitimate attempt to fix it. Over the past thirty years, \n     there has been a 500% increase in incarceration rates, \n     resulting in the U.S. leading the world in number of \n     prisoners with 2.2 million people currently incarcerated. \n     Especially in this example, it is important to humanize these \n     statistics. These are 2.2 million people, who now because of \n     their conviction will find it much harder to be truly \n     integrated back in their communities, due to the struggles of \n     finding a job with a record, and the fact that they often do \n     not qualify for social welfare. The incarceration system is \n     also bankrupting both the state and federal government. It \n     currently is the third highest state expenditure, behind \n     health care and education.\n       Fortunately, we as a nation have the opportunity to fix the \n     incarceration system. First, we need to get rid of mandatory \n     minimum sentences. Judges from across the nation have said \n     for decades that they do not like mandatory minimums, that \n     they do not work, and that they are unconstitutional. \n     Mandatory minimum sentences, coupled with racially biased \n     laws concerning drug possession is the reason why we see the \n     ratio of African American males to white males over 10:1. \n     This leads to the second action we must take; we must end the \n     war on drugs. It has proven to be a failed experiment that \n     has reopened many racial wounds in our nation. The war on \n     drugs also put addicts behind bars, rather than treating \n     addiction like the problem it actually is; a mental health \n     issue.\n\n\n     PAIGE THIBAULT, CHAMPLAIN VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)\n\n       In common day society, education is widely accepted as a \n     valuable resource to our nation's future. Education has \n     immeasurable impact on our lives and on our identity, as we \n     build foundations of our growth off of our learning. However \n     with all these potentially influential factors that education \n     possesses, the system that we have nurtured has failed in \n     reaching students with meaning and value. Like other things \n     in our world, the system is broken.\n       What I've been noticing within my own education is that the \n     prospect of content is idolized in the classroom. Teachers no \n     longer cram memorization into our heads (an educational \n     revolution in itself), yet their focus is still the intimate \n     prevalence of deadlines and test scores. Yes--school is where \n     we learn--yet the purpose of our learning should not to \n     become `smart'. When students start thinking that this is \n     indeed the purpose of their learning, inspiration and drive \n     are completely decimated. Being `smart' is a subjective \n     standard that we press upon our kids, yet it's something \n     which has shallow value. Classes stuffed with disconnected \n     information only promote this misconception even further. Why \n     should we be focusing on feeding students material when the \n     students themselves don't see why they're supposed to consume \n     it?\n       And this isn't just the content; it's the atmosphere. An \n     example: When an adult reads from a manual in front of a \n     class, there are two parties in play. There's the instructor \n     (includes the teacher, the manual, the authors of the \n     manual), and there is the student body. Notice it's not \n     twenty individual humans learning differently on the same \n     topic, it is the singular and collective student group. \n     Sitting in this blob of the ``student body'' and being \n     considered solely for the fact that you belong to a mass of \n     apparent learning is an extremely demoralizing thought in the \n     learning setting. I want to be appreciated for what I can \n     bring to my learning; not what the class average is. What \n     value do I have if I can be replaced with a statistic?\n       I'll tell you why: our hopes and dreams are original. Our \n     minds run differently. And most importantly our souls all \n     want to go in our own direction. No matter how similar our \n     test scores are, we will never be destined to have the same \n     future, so why are we clustered to have the same upbringing? \n     Why are we held to the same expectations if the only thing \n     that is the same about us is the year on our birth \n     certificate? I understand that grouping students by age is a \n     positive thing, but we should not let that number classify us \n     as learners.\n       We need to rethink education, emphasizing personal growth \n     versus increased IQ. Students should not be accepted with \n     their differences, but should be accepted because of them. \n     The teachers that guild students should be trained with the \n     ideology that learning is not for a destination, it is for a \n     journey. Administrators and Curriculum Directors or \n     Superintendents need to see the content and need to \n     understand that force-feeding students knowledge is not \n     knowledge at all. We need to create the environment where \n     students have choice of what their learning environment looks \n     like; choice of how they learn material; choice of how they \n     develop and a choice of how they grow.\n       It's true: education is an important system that gets a \n     significant share of financial and governmental attention. \n     Now let's make it a revolution of consciousness. Let's make \n     meaningful education for our future; not for our brains.\n\n\n       PETER UNGER, CHAMPLAIN VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL (FINALIST)\n\n       The internet is the first human creation with the potential \n     to unify and connect the world; with the potential to change \n     the way we collaborate and innovate forever; with the \n     potential to reestablish the United States of America as the \n     preeminent global leader in education, technology, and \n     medicine. However, none of this potential will be realized \n     without a fundamental rethink of Internet Service Provider \n     regulations. We also need a fresh approach on infrastructure \n     capable of launching a new age industrial revolution. The \n     United States of America needs a government maintained and \n     mandated fiber optic network. We no longer have an economy \n     based on production of tangible products for a regional \n     economy, instead we produce innovative and revolutionary \n     ideas. Without a fiber optic backbone, these ideas won't \n     reach their potential. Let me convey to you the urgency and \n     importance of this issue. The competition has already started \n     or even finished the improvements this country is in dire \n     need of. The cost of broadband in dollars per megabits per \n     second ranked Bulgaria as number one with a cost of forty \n     seven cents per megabit per second, and in thirty third place \n     is the United States of America at three dollars and fifty \n     cents. This disconnect between value and product is dousing \n     the innovative fire that is the American Technology industry.\n       What do we do? Myself and experts alike, know for certain \n     that the Internet Service Providers aren't going to figure it \n     out on their own. They are up selling us into decade old \n     technology for a premium. Currently, there is no incumbent to \n     challenge the oligopoly that are the American Internet \n     Service Providers. The only realistic solution to this dire \n     problem is a mindset change in the legislative branch of this \n     very country; people don't do things on the internet, people \n     just do things. Internet needs to be classified as the true \n     utility it is. The internet may be the most powerful \n     collaboration and creation tool ever known to man. I \n     personally believe that we can't currently comprehend the \n     possibilities that will be made real by this truly amazing \n     tool.\n       Do you want cable companies to control what website you \n     visit and to prioritize services that pay a premium? \n     Currently, these are controlled by a concept known as net \n     neutrality, the cable companies' lobbyists want to abolish \n     this fundamental protection of freedom of speech and \n     innovation. Without this fundamental freedom, the creativity, \n     innovation, and communication, at which the internet is so \n     powerful at stimulating, will be stomped out for good.\n       The only way to protect the openness, fairness, and freedom \n     we as United States Citizens are accustomed to as well as \n     enhance the creativity, innovation and communication, which \n     we all use the internet for, is for the Federal \n     Communications Commission to reclassify broadband service \n     under Title II of the Telecommunications act.

A bill to expand the prohibition on misleading or inaccurate \ncaller identification information, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, we all know how our senior citizens have \nbeen the victims of spoofing. Well, that is happening to a lot of our \nfellow citizens, no matter what the age is, because fraudulent and \nabusive phoning scams are plaguing thousands of Americans each year. \nThese deceitful practices are causing very serious harm to victims by \nfake messages coming across often that cause the receiver to respond \nwith some kind of financial transaction or the giving up of a credit \ncard number.\n  The Commerce Committee and the Aging Committee have explored the \nimpact of these scams, and by one account consumers continue to lose \nmillions of dollars each year to fraudulent phone scams, many of which \noriginate in other countries. The impact of these scams are very real \nto the consumers who suffer.\n  For example, one old poor soul took his life last year after spending \nthousands in a vain attempt to collect on his winnings in what he \nthought was a Jamaican lottery--winnings that were nonexistent because \nit was all a scam. A lot of us think we have trained ourselves to \nignore phone calls and text messages from numbers that pop up that we \ndon't recognize, but this is also where the sophisticated scammer \nenters because now scammers can impersonate government institutions' \nnumbers. They promote fraudulent lottery schemes and they tailor their \ncalls to individuals in order to coerce victims into paying large sums \nof money, just like the victim I mentioned earlier.\n  Spoofing technology is used to manipulate the caller ID information \nand trick consumers into believing that the calls are local or are \ncoming from trusted institutions. A few years ago, this Senator \nintroduced the Truth in Caller ID Act to prohibit ID spoofing when it \nis used to defraud or harm consumers, and this law provided important \ntools for law enforcement to go after these criminals and crack down on \nthe phone scams. That legislation was passed. It was signed into law. \nIt was a huge win for consumers and the first step toward ending these \nabusive practices, but technology is passing us by.\n  As the technologies evolve, the law directed the Federal \nCommunications Commission to prepare a report to Congress outlining \nadditional tools that are going to be needed for different kinds of \nspoofing practices because of new technologies. The FCC a few years ago \nprovided its recommendations to Congress on how to update the law to \nkeep pace with technology and the use of it by criminals.\n  Senator Fischer and I have introduced a bill today that responds to \nthe FCC's report, recommendations, and their requests, and it builds on \nthe 2010 act on phone scams to keep up with the new kind of spoofing \nbecause they are now much more sophisticated. We need to make sure \nthere are consumer protections and tools for law enforcement to keep \nup. That is why this legislation we introduced today is important. It \nis called the Spoofing Prevention Act of 2016. It would extend the \ncurrent prohibition in law on caller ID spoofing to text messages and \nto calls coming from outside the United States, as well as from all \nforms of voice over Internet protocol services. For the first time, \nthis bill would have access to information to go after these criminals \nin a centralized location on current technologies available to protect \nthem against this sophisticated type of criminal. It does so by \ndirecting the FCC to publish and regularly update a report on existing \ntools.\n  The act also directs the Government Accountability Office to conduct \na report to assess government and private sector work being done to \ncurb this spoofing, as well as what new measures, including \ntechnological solutions, can be taken to prevent this.\n  I urge our colleagues to join Senator Fischer and me in supporting \nthis act to try to give some protection in this age of digital \ntechnology, of rapidly advancing technology, to help protect those poor \nconsumers who are getting fooled and in other words getting spoofed.\n  I also thank Senator Klobuchar and Senator Donnelly for their work in \ncombatting spoofing. We are going to continue to work on this, and this \nSenator is going to press the Federal Communications Commission to \ncontinue to use its full authority under the Truth in Caller ID Act to \nstop these scams, including a consideration of technical solutions like \ncall authentication to protect consumers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2558\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Office of Strategic Services \n     Congressional Gold Medal Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) was America's \n     first effort to implement a system of strategic intelligence \n     during World War II and provided the basis for the modern-day \n     American intelligence and special operations communities. The \n     U.S. Special Operations Command and the National Clandestine \n     Service chose the OSS spearhead as their insignias.\n       (2) OSS founder General William J. Donovan is the only \n     person in American history to receive our Nation's four \n     highest decorations, including the Medal of Honor. Upon \n     learning of his death in 1959, President Eisenhower called \n     General Donovan the ``last hero''. In addition to founding \n     and leading the OSS, General Donovan was also selected by \n     President Roosevelt, who called him his ``secret legs'', as \n     an emissary to Great Britain and continental Europe before \n     the United States entered World War II.\n       (3) All the military branches during World War II \n     contributed personnel to the OSS. The present-day Special \n     Operations Forces trace their lineage to the OSS. Its \n     Maritime\n\n[[Page S915]]\n\n     Unit was a precursor to the U.S. Navy SEALs. The OSS \n     Operational Groups and Jedburghs were forerunners to U.S. \n     Army Special Forces. The 801st/492nd Bombardment Group \n     (``Carpetbaggers'') were progenitors to the Air Force Special \n     Operations Command. The Marines who served in the OSS, \n     including the actor Sterling Hayden (a Silver Star \n     recipient), Col. William Eddy (a Distinguished Service Cross \n     recipient who was described as the ``nearest thing the United \n     States has had to a Lawrence of Arabia''), and Col. Peter \n     Ortiz (a two-time Navy Cross recipient), were predecessors to \n     the Marine Special Operations Command. U.S. Coast Guard \n     personnel were recruited for the Maritime Unit and its \n     Operational Swimmer Group.\n       (4) The OSS organized, trained, supplied, and fought with \n     resistance organizations throughout Europe and Asia that \n     played an important role in America's victory during World \n     War II. General Eisenhower credited the OSS's covert \n     contribution in France to the equivalent to having an extra \n     military division. General Eisenhower told General Donovan \n     that if it did nothing else, the photographic reconnaissance \n     conducted by the OSS prior to the D-Day Invasion justified \n     its creation.\n       (5) Four future directors of central intelligence served as \n     OSS officers: William Casey, William Colby, Allen Dulles, and \n     Richard Helms.\n       (6) Women comprised more than one-third of OSS personnel \n     and played a critical role in the organization. They included \n     Virginia Hall, the only civilian female to receive a \n     Distinguished Service Cross in World War II, and Julia Child.\n       (7) OSS recruited Fritz Kolbe, a German diplomat who became \n     America's most important spy against the Nazis in World War \n     II.\n       (8) America's leading scientists and scholars served in the \n     OSS Research and Analysis Branch, including Ralph Bunche, the \n     first African-American to receive the Nobel Peace Prize; \n     Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.; \n     Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg; Sherman Kent; John \n     King Fairbank; and Walt Rostow. Its ranks included seven \n     future presidents of the American Historical Association, \n     five of the American Economic Association, and two Nobel \n     laureates.\n       (9) The U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Intelligence \n     and Research traces its creation to the OSS Research and \n     Analysis Branch.\n       (10) James Donovan, who was portrayed by Tom Hanks in the \n     Steven Spielberg movie ``Bridge of Spies'' and negotiated the \n     release of U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers, served as General \n     Counsel of the OSS.\n       (11) The OSS invented and employed new technology through \n     its Research and Development Branch, inventing new weapons \n     and revolutionary communications equipment. Dr. Christian \n     Lambertsen invented the first underwater rebreathing \n     apparatus that was first utilized by the OSS and is known \n     today as SCUBA.\n       (12) OSS Detachment 101 operated in Burma and pioneered the \n     art of unconventional warfare. It was the first United States \n     unit to deploy a large guerrilla army deep in enemy \n     territory. It has been credited with the highest kill/loss \n     ratio for any infantry-type unit in American military history \n     and was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation.\n       (13) Its X-2 branch pioneered counterintelligence with the \n     British and established the modern counterintelligence \n     community. The network of contacts built by the OSS with \n     foreign intelligence services led to enduring Cold War \n     alliances.\n       (14) Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North \n     Africa in November 1942, was aided by the networks \n     established and information acquired by the OSS to guide \n     Allied landings.\n       (15) OSS Operation Halyard rescued more than 500 downed \n     airmen trapped behind enemy lines in Yugoslavia, one of the \n     most daring and successful rescue operations of World War II.\n       (16) OSS ``Mercy Missions'' at the end of World War II \n     saved the lives of thousands of Allied prisoners of war whom \n     it was feared would be murdered by the Japanese.\n       (17) The handful of surviving men and women of the OSS whom \n     General Donovan said performed ``some of the bravest acts of \n     the war'' are members of the ``Greatest Generation''. They \n     have never been collectively recognized for their heroic and \n     pioneering service in World War II.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate \n     shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on \n     behalf of the Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design \n     in commemoration to the members of the Office of Strategic \n     Services (OSS), in recognition of their superior service and \n     major contributions during World War II.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a \n     gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions, \n     to be determined by the Secretary.\n       (c) Smithsonian Institution.--\n       (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal in \n     commemoration to the members of the Office of Strategic \n     Services under subsection (a), the gold medal shall be given \n     to the Smithsonian Institution, where it will be displayed as \n     appropriate and made available for research.\n       (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Smithsonian Institution should make the gold medal \n     received under paragraph (1) available for display elsewhere, \n     particularly at other appropriate locations associated with \n     the Office of Strategic Services.\n\n     SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of \n     the gold medal struck pursuant to section 3 under such \n     regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, at a price \n     sufficient to cover the cost thereof, including labor, \n     materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses, and \n     the cost of the gold medal.\n\n     SEC. 5. STATUS OF MEDALS.\n\n       (a) National Medals.--The medals struck pursuant to this \n     Act are national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title \n     31, United States Code.\n       (b) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of section 5134 of \n     title 31, United States Code, all medals struck under this \n     Act shall be considered to be numismatic items.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/22/senate-section/article/S915-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CONGRATULATING THE DENVER BRONCOS FOR WINNING SUPER BOWL 50\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
