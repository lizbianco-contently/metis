Madam President, when President Obama tried to push a \nregressive anti-middle-class energy tax through a Democratic-controlled \nCongress, his own party said no. Undeterred, the President simply went \naround Congress to impose similarly regressive--and likely illegal--\npower plan regulations anyway. He is currently trying to sell that \npower plan to world leaders in Paris, as proof of the American \nGovernment's commitment to his energy priorities. But with all due \nrespect to the President as our Commander in Chief, governments \ncurrently engaged in this round of climate talks will want to know that \nthere is more than just an executive branch in our system of \ngovernment.\n  More than half of the States have filed suit against the President's \npower plan. A bipartisan majority in both Chambers of Congress have \napproved legislation that rejects the President's plan. The courts \nappear likely to strike it down, and the next President could simply \ntear it up. This is the easily foreseeable result of intentionally \nsidestepping Congress to impose this anti-middle-class power plan.\n  If left in place, the power plan threatens to punish the poor and \ncould result in the elimination of as many as a quarter of a million \nU.S. jobs. For what? The power plan won't even meaningfully affect \nglobal climate emissions, and it could actually increase emissions by \noffshoring American manufacturing to countries that lack our \nenvironmental standards.\n  That is pain for the middle class, a climate rounding error for \nnegotiators in Paris. That is not a good policy for America's working \nfamilies. It certainly would not be responsible to attempt to negotiate \ncommitments based upon an illegal power plan, one that may not even \nsurvive much longer, in any event.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/senate-section/article/S8181-8", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8181-S8182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE NEW CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Now, Madam President, on another matter, in the last \nelection the American people chose a new direction with a new \nRepublican majority in Congress. We have been working hard ever since \nto get Congress back on their side and back to work. Over the past \nyear, Americans have seen committees up and running again. Americans \nhave seen bills passed again. Americans have seen meaningful bipartisan \nbills being signed into law again. Americans have also seen Members of \nopposing parties working together to make progress on important issues, \nfrom trade to Medicare to cyber security. We have seen examples of it \nthis year on some of Washington's stickiest issues.\n  We saw the Senate pass a bipartisan multiyear highway bill this \nsummer, 65 to 34. The Republican chairman and\n\n[[Page S8182]]\n\nthe Democratic ranking member worked closely to bring this about. We \nalso saw the Senate pass a bipartisan replacement for the broken No \nChild Left Behind law last summer, 81 to 17. I would like to thank \nSenator Alexander and Senator Murray for working closely across the \naisle on that achievement. These represent significant accomplishments \nfor the new Congress and significant wins for the American people. \nAfter all, some pundits said Washington could never take these issues \non at all. But we did, and we now expect to finish Congress's work on \nall of those matters in the coming days.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/senate-section/article/S8182-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, our Nation is stunned following last \nweek's wanton murders at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado \nSprings, CO. That heinous attack left three dead: a police officer, a \nmother of two children, and an Iraq war veteran. Nine others were \nwounded. It is sickening that these innocent victims were gunned down \nin cold blood in a medical clinic in the holiday season.\n  More casualties were avoided by the quick and heroic action taken by \nresponding law enforcement as well as by a courageous bystander named \nKe'Arre Stewart, the Iraq war veteran I just mentioned, who heroically \nreentered the building to provide help. While he was doing that, he was \nkilled--murdered. I can only imagine the heartbreaking anguish that the \nvictims and their families are experiencing. I know it is of little \ncomfort, but the Senate mourns with them. Our thoughts are with them, \ntheir families, and the first responders who brought an end to this \nbrutal attack.\n  But we in the Senate should not fail to see the context in which this \nvile assault took place. Last summer, a rightwing group began \nunleashing a series of heavily edited videos with unsubstantiated \nallegations. Since that time, Republicans in Congress have made it \ntheir mission to push these unsubstantiated allegations every chance \nthey get. They are actually baseless.\n  They also have made it their mission to defund Planned Parenthood, \nwhich would irreparably damage this health care provider's future. \nRepublicans have insisted on votes to strip Planned Parenthood from its \nFederal funding on two different occasions. Neither was successful. But \nthey are still trying.\n  Republicans want to stop Medicaid reimbursement to Planned \nParenthood, among other things. Republicans also believe in politically \nmotivated investigations of Planned Parenthood. The Republican chairman \nof the House oversight committee, Congressman Jason Chaffetz, has \nadmitted that he has uncovered no wrongdoing in his investigation of \nPlanned Parenthood to this point.\n  But always willing to play a bad hand, that has not stopped House \nRepublicans from allocating $300,000 of taxpayer money to fund a new \npolitically motivated special subcommittee dedicated to investigating \nPlanned Parenthood. Republicans should not waste their time. I would \nhope that they give up before they match the millions of dollars--at \nlast count it is more than $5 million--that they have wasted on the so-\ncalled Benghazi ``let's get Secretary Clinton'' committee, another \npolitically motivated and untimely fruitless attack.\n  We should never forget that one in five American women will get care \nfrom a Planned Parenthood clinic at some point in their life. Cutting \noff access to important health care services such as breast and \ncervical screenings and contraception is bad for women and bad for the \ncountry.\n  In the wake of this act of domestic terrorism, I commend Planned \nParenthood for refusing to allow threats and violence to stand in the \nway of its work to ensure women have access to care. I hope everybody \nunderstands that I stand with Planned Parenthood. But we as leaders \nmust be mindful of our words and actions. Whipping people into a frenzy \nof hate and anger while providing them with easy access to firearms has \nproven disastrous to our country.\n  We have a responsibility as leaders to think very hard about what we \nsay and do in this context and what the consequences are. We have a \nresponsibility to fund ways to stop this violence. Democrats are \nworking on reasonable gun safety proposals that will help ensure that \nfirearms are kept out of the hands of people intent on committing \nviolence. It is appalling how many times I have had to make this plea. \nThis terrible event that took place in Colorado just a few days ago is \nalready off the news. Why? Because it happens so often in America. It \nis appalling how many times I have had to make this plea, but I say to \nmy Republican colleagues yet again: Join with us in passing sensible \ngun safety reforms. Help us keep guns away from people intent on using \nthem to slaughter innocent people.\n  First, we must do something to close to loopholes that allow FBI \nterror suspects and other unhinged individuals to legally buy AK-47s \nand other weapons. Right now a terror suspect, someone who is listed on \nthe watch list, can walk into a gun store or a gun show and purchase \nsophisticated assault weapons. To leave that loophole unaddressed is \nsheer recklessness by congressional Republicans. Someone on the \nterrorist watch list can walk in and buy a gun, any gun they want. That \nis not good.\n  We must also strengthen our Nation's background check system. We are \nfailing to flag and prevent people who are mentally ill or who have \nviolent motives from legally purchasing weapons. Improved background \nchecks are essential in keeping guns out of the wrong hands. What we \nare saying is if someone is a felon, a criminal or crazy, they \nshouldn't be able to purchase a gun without a background check, and \nthey should never be able to purchase a gun--period.\n  Finally, we have to close loopholes that allow people to illegally \ntraffic in firearms. What does this mean? Right now we have no laws in \nplace to adequately prevent individuals from purchasing weapons--buy \nhuge numbers of weapons. Then what do they do with them? Sell them at a \ngreat profit and transfer them to criminals.\n  For example, a person with a clean background can purchase an \nunlimited number of guns and then turn around and sell them to a \ncartel, a gang or a terrorist organization with no threat of \nprosecution. Unfortunately, as in the past, Republicans are nowhere to \nbe found when it comes to implementing these commonsense changes to our \ngun laws. For example, as to the Colorado Springs murders, did we hear \na single Republican running for President of the United States stand \nand say: We have too many guns; can't we stop this?\n  I haven't heard a single Republican Senator come to the floor and say \nsomething about this terrible event that took place. Instead, they are \nbusy fear-mongering against Syrian refugees, those fleeing Assad and \nISIS. We have a rigorous screening process for when we accept refugees. \nThe refugees we are accepting are women, children, and older men with \nfamilies. Less than\n\n[[Page S8183]]\n\n2 percent of the men who come as refugees from Syria or Iraq are of \nmilitary age. The Department of Homeland Security has verified that not \none of the 1,800 Syrian refugees already admitted to the United States \nhas a single confirmed tie to terrorism, but in spite of all the facts, \nRepublicans would focus their attention on refugees and ignore the \nproblem we have with gun violence in America.\n  Republicans would have Americans believe Syrian refugees are the \npreeminent threat to our national security, and meanwhile the \nRepublican Congress is doing nothing to curb our Nation's gun violence. \nIt is a sad commentary on Republicans that they are more concerned \nabout keeping Syrian refugees out of America than they are about \nkeeping guns out of the hands of terrorists, those who are mentally \nill, and those who are criminals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/senate-section/article/S8183-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PARIS CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, as we speak, in faraway Paris, France, 194 \ncountries are gathering to negotiate an international agreement to \naddress climate change. Fortunately for the world, President Obama is \ncommitted to doing something about that climate change.\n  I send all my appreciation, my accolades to the French people for \ngoing ahead with this extremely important conference and not letting \nthose terrible acts that occurred stop them from doing so. Because of \nPresident Obama's leadership, the United States is taking on a more \nprominent role in rolling back dangerous carbon emissions, not only \nfrom our country but from China, India, Brazil, and other major sources \nof climate-changing pollution.\n  Before the conference in Paris even started, more than 170 countries \nrepresenting over 90 percent of global carbon emissions made concrete \npledges to reduce carbon pollution. Climate change is among the most \nserious problems we face today. What does the Pentagon say? What do all \nthe security agencies say is the most serious problem facing America \ntoday? Climate change. We are beginning to endure the devastating \nconsequences of rising sea levels, extreme weather, and drought across \nAmerica and all over the world.\n  No country acting alone can halt climate change, but through American \nleadership and international cooperation, we can protect our air and \nclimate for our children and their children. I commend President Obama \nfor his work domestically and internationally to address this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/senate-section/article/S8183-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FINISHING THE SENATE'S WORK\n\n  Mr. REID.

We have to get \nthem done, and we don't have a lot of time to do it. There is certainly \nno time for demagoguery and political distractions such as repealing \nObama Care or defunding Planned Parenthood that have been the hallmarks \nof the Republican Congress.

Madam President, I rise to speak on Puerto Rico's \nfinancial and economic challenges.\n  The Government of Puerto Rico tells us the territory has more than \n$73 billion in debt that is, to use their words, ``not payable.'' On \ntop of that, Puerto Rico has tens of billions of dollars in unfunded \npension liabilities and very few assets to back up its pension \npromises. The economy in Puerto Rico has persistently registered \ndouble-digit unemployment rates, staggeringly low labor force \nparticipation rates and a bloated public sector and there are growing \nstrains on Puerto Rico's health care system, some of which reflected \nthe way the so-called Affordable Care Act was written to treat Puerto \nRico and other territories, some of which reflects differing treatment \nbetween Puerto Rico, where residents do not pay Federal personal income \ntaxes, and States where residents are included in the Federal personal \nincome tax system. In short, there is very little good economic news \ncoming from Puerto Rico these days. As a result, we are seeing an \nongoing debate about what the Federal Government can or should do in \norder to help the American citizens residing in Puerto Rico.\n  To me, this debate boils down to four relatively simple questions: \nQuestion No. 1, should the Federal Government allow Puerto Rico access \nto chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code or to even broader debt resolution \ntools; question No. 2, will providing fresh tax incentives to Puerto \nRico help boost the island's economy by creating jobs and stimulating \ngrowth; question No. 3, should Congress increase Federal resources to \nhelp ease Puerto Rico's strained health care system; and question No. \n4, should we take steps to exempt Puerto Rico from burdensome Federal \nregulations--including labor, transportation, and energy regulations--\nthat may be contributing to the territory's ongoing economic struggles?\n  Today we have seen a number of proposals that attempt to address \nthese and other questions, although, in my opinion, many of them do so \nin very awkward ways. I want to take time today to address each of \nthese four major questions in turn and hopefully shed some light on \nwhat we have to consider as we try to address the growing crisis in \nPuerto Rico.\n  So far, the majority of these discussions among policymakers with \nregard to Puerto Rico have focused on question No. 1, allowing access \nto chapter 9 bankruptcy relief. As we all know, chapter 9 applies \nspecifically to financially distressed municipalities that are seeking \nprotection from creditors as they develop and negotiate plans to adjust \ntheir debts. Puerto Rico is not currently eligible for chapter 9 \nbankruptcy, meaning that granting them access to this type of relief \nwill require a legislative change to the Bankruptcy Code, which may \ncome with its own set of problems. Some proponents of the bankruptcy \nsolutions for Puerto Rico have argued that the clear language \npreventing the island from accessing chapter 9 reflects some sort of \ndrafting error. They argue further that once Puerto Rico is eligible \nfor chapter 9 protections, it should apply to debts already incurred.\n  Now, whether the exclusion for Puerto Rico from chapter 9 was \nintentional--and I don't believe it was--we should keep in mind that \nthere are potential rule-of-law issues at stake when we talk about \nlegislative action to retroactively alter the terms of debt contracts. \nPuerto Rico's creditors entered into their contracts with the various \nexisting risks priced into the agreements in the form of interest rates \nand other terms. If the island had been eligible for chapter 9 \nbankruptcy prior to entering into those agreements, creditors would \nhave formed different expectations, likely leading to different terms, \nincluding differing interest rates that could have reshaped the demand \nfor Puerto Rico bonds. This is not rocket science. This is finance 101.\n\n[[Page S8184]]\n\n  We should be cautious about any legislative action that would alter \nthe terms of existing contracts. At the very least, we should consider \nwhat impact extending chapter 9 to existing Puerto Rico obligations \nwould have on credit transactions moving forward, given that parties \nset credit agreements based upon the laws they expect to apply. If \nparties believe there is a real possibility that Congress might \nretroactively change those laws in the future, they are likely to seek \ndifferent terms or reevaluate a contract's potential worth. Even so, it \nis not at all clear that our amending chapter 9 to allow access for \nPuerto Rico will solve the debt problems of Puerto Rico.\n  Officials from the Obama administration have argued that chapter 9 \nwould only cover about 30 percent of Puerto Rico's outstanding \nobligations and, as a result, even broader debt restructuring authority \nis necessary. Therefore, those in Congress with proposed solutions that \ncenter only on chapter 9 bankruptcy are apparently not aware of the \nadministration's position. However, the other nonbankruptcy proposals \nwe have seen--which would allow Puerto Rico to handle its debt on its \nown--are also lacking. For example, we have seen proposals to allow the \nFederal Reserve to purchase debt issued by Puerto Rico and to authorize \nthe Treasury to guarantee bonds issued by the Government of Puerto Rico \nor any of its instrumentalities. Of course, this approach would run the \nrisk of setting very bad precedents for future insolvent entities and \nis fraught with moral hazard.\n  Ultimately, those pushing to restructure Puerto Rico's debt as the \nsole solution tend to want to simply blame the problems on the \ncreditors, using loose terms like ``hedge funds'' or ``vulture funds.'' \nFor these people, punishing the creditors is their desired focus, not \nbecause it is a viable solution but because, at the end of the day, an \nopportunity for populist rhetoric is itself a valuable commodity \nheading into a contentious election cycle.\n  While that approach may help some around here appeal to their \npolitical base, it does precious little to help the people of Puerto \nRico and ignores the fact that a number of the creditors are middle-\nclass investors and retirees from virtually every U.S. State and \nterritory--from Utah to New York, to Puerto Rico itself.\n  Ultimately, whatever case can be made for restructuring authority for \nPuerto Rico's debt, there may not be an urgent need for that authority \nto be granted right away. This is evidenced by the fact that despite \nseveral months of debate surrounding the issues, Puerto Rico has only \nrecently begun negotiating with some of its creditors. I would hope \nthat if the need for relief is in fact dire, the Government of Puerto \nRico will waste no time in negotiating and working toward private \nsolutions. If there is no urgency on that front, it would be hard to \nargue that there is an urgent need for Congress to consider proposals \nrelating to chapter 9 bankruptcy or broader restructuring authority. \nThat is question No. 1.\n  Let's talk about question No. 2, which deals with tax incentives to \nboost Puerto Rico's economy. On the tax front we have seen proposals in \nCongress to allow residents in Puerto Rico to claim the earned-income \ntax credit and the refundable portion of the child tax credit on the \nsame basis as other U.S. taxpayers. Likewise, the Obama administration \nhas indicated support for a similar approach, although they have not \nprovided any real details as to what their proposal would look like.\n  Proposals such as these are problematic for a number of reasons. As I \nmentioned, the residents of Puerto Rico are exempt from the Federal \npersonal income tax system, meaning that they do not pay any personal \nFederal income tax. Therefore, offering these refundable tax credits \nwould not reduce their tax burden because you can't reduce a tax burden \nthat is already zero. In other words, these tax credits would \nultimately be cash payments offered directly to lower income residents \nof Puerto Rico. On top of that, the earned-income tax credit and the \nchild tax credit are already rife with fraud and overpayments when they \nare offered to taxpayers who are required to file a return and can at \nleast theoretically incur a tax burden at some future date if their \nincome goes up. Extending these same credits to Puerto Rico could very \nwell introduce a number of threats to the integrity and administration \nof our tax system.\n\n  Those who issue these types of proposals rarely have a solution to \nthese inherent concerns. Moreover, we haven't seen any public \ninformation from congressional scorekeepers as to how much these \nproposals would cost. I also haven't heard any proponents of this \napproach offer so much as a hint about how they would plan to offset \nthe costs or if they intend to offer any offset at all.\n  Long story short, most of the tax-related proposals to the Puerto \nRico situation leave much to be desired. That is not to say we should \nnot do anything in this area. There are quite likely tax incentives we \ncould offer to better incentivize growth and labor force participation \nand perhaps investment in the Puerto Rican economy. I think it would be \nsafe to say Republicans would be open to such a discussion. But to \ndate, I haven't seen anything that resembles a serious solution that \nfocuses on the Tax Code.\n  This brings us to question No. 3, dealing with health care policy, \nwhich has been the primary focus of a number of our colleagues when it \ncomes to these issues. Here in Congress, we have seen some poorly \nconstructed proposals that, when boiled down to their essence, would \nallocate more than $30 billion from the general fund directly to Puerto \nRico. Of course, that is not how the proponents describe their ideas. \nTypically, these proposals are couched as changes to the way Puerto \nRico's share of Federal health dollars is determined under existing \nprograms. However, while the issues are admittedly complex, the result \nis fairly simple: Fiscal irresponsibility would be rewarded to the tune \nof tens of billions of dollars.\n  Now, don't get me wrong--we will very likely have to consider these \nideas to alter the means by which we allocate Federal health funds to \nPuerto Rico. However, if we decide to go that route, it is essential \nthat we move forward in a fiscally appropriate and responsible manner. \nTo date, I have yet to hear any concrete thoughts from proponents in \nCongress or from our Federal health agencies about how this can be \ndone. I have heard, however, that the so-called Affordable Care Act is \nthe source of some of the health care-related problems faced by Puerto \nRico. I will leave it to those who wrote that law and forced it through \nCongress on a partisan basis to explain why that is the case.\n  We now come to question No. 4, the possibility of providing Puerto \nRico with relief from various Federal regulations. We have heard a \nnumber of ideas in this area, including reforms or exemptions from \nregulations governing labor markets, shipping, energy costs, and \nothers. While I am inherently sympathetic to proposals to scale back \nFederal regulations, the issues here are very complex and would become \nvery political in a hurry.\n  For example, while I haven't taken any straw polls, I think it is \nsafe to say that many of my friends on the other side of the aisle \nwould reflexively oppose any attempt to mitigate the application of \nFederal minimum wage regulations to Puerto Rico. This would be puzzling \ngiven that Congress has offered similar relief to other ailing U.S. \nterritories in the relatively recent past. On top of that, the Krueger \nReport, which was commissioned by the Government of Puerto Rico along \nwith a host of economic analysts across the political spectrum, argued \nthat allowing Puerto Rico the flexibility to set minimum wages that \ndiffer from the Federal levels would have a positive economic impact \nand that the current minimum wage levels do not fit productivity \nconditions on the island. Still, even in the face of all this evidence \nand precedent, my guess is that many of my colleagues would take issue \nwith this idea.\n  I would expect they would similarly reject out of hand any proposals \nto scale back environmental regulations and rules governing \ntransportation even if it could be shown that their regulations were \nhaving a negative impact and contributing directly to Puerto Rico's \nfiscal and economic predicament. Unfortunately, Madam President, for a \nnumber of our colleagues here in Congress, commitment to ideology too \noften does not allow room to\n\n[[Page S8185]]\n\nadmit when your policies are not working. While the situation in Puerto \nRico isn't the first time we have seen that come up, I expect we will \nsee that happening a lot if we get a chance to consider regulatory \nrelief as a potential solution.\n  Those are the four main questions we face with regard to Puerto Rico. \nWhile they each come with their own sets of difficulties, those are the \nbasic categories of solutions we have seen come to light so far. Of \nthose four categories, two of them--the tax and the health care \ncategories--are interrelated insomuch as Members of Congress and \nadministration officials have made them the focus of various ideas to \nhelp Puerto Rico improve its fiscal situation and perhaps its economy. \nWhile those putting the tax and health proposals forward have largely \nbeen silent about what our official scorekeepers--the CBO and the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation--will say about the costs of their CTC ideas, I \nhave done some of my colleagues' homework for them.\n  Adding up the refundable tax credits, including the EITC and the CTC, \nand health-related resource flows, including changes to Medicaid \nallocations, the overall cost looks to be well north of $30 billion and \nlikely around $40 billion over the next 10 years. Those are hardly \ninsignificant figures.\n  Questions of funding and resource allocation are always difficult, \nand they implicate a number of issues. It isn't as simple as just \ndeciding to give more health funds to Puerto Rico or access to \nrefundable tax credits because doing so would necessarily mean reduced \nfunding for other Federal priorities or increased taxes or yet more \nFederal debt.\n  True enough, Puerto Rico's problems are multidimensional and complex, \nand I don't know anyone in Congress who is indifferent to the plight of \nthese American citizens. Sadly, these facts don't make our unpleasant \nbudget arithmetic any easier. If anything, they make it all the more \ncomplicated. In short, there are no easy answers.\n  That said, regardless of how we move forward, we need to have a \nclearer picture of what is going on in Puerto Rico. We need to have the \nfiscal facts regarding the island's indebtedness, funding levels, and \nneeds. Yet, to date, we have not seen any recent audited financial \nstatements from Puerto Rico, although we have asked for them. Instead, \nwe are being asked to rely on statements and cash flow analysis \ncommissioned by the Government of Puerto Rico. As of right now, \nfinances in Puerto Rico remain extremely opaque and difficult to \nmonitor. Congress should demand independent verification of the \nterritory's finances before moving forward on any kind of relief \npackage.\n  Moreover, while we are hearing horror stories of inadequate cash flow \nand a liquidity freeze in Puerto Rico, it is difficult to ascribe much \nurgency to the situation when we are still seeing and reading about \nrelatively large outlays for questionable expenses. Indeed, it is hard \nto believe an entity is in danger of running out of cash when it is \npaying for a broad public relations and lobbying campaign and when \nofficials are talking about protecting hundreds of millions of dollars \nin year-end bonuses for government employees.\n  This brings us to yet another difficult question. I suppose you could \ncall this question No. 5. What can we do to ensure that Puerto Rico \nchanges its clearly unsustainable fiscal course? No matter what we do \nwith regard to debt restructuring, tax policy, health care policy, or \nregulatory relief, the solution will ultimately be meaningless if we \ndon't take steps to ensure that Puerto Rico doesn't simply continue on \nthe fiscally irresponsible path that brought them to this mess in the \nfirst place. Even if every creditor gets a massive haircut and all the \nrequested resources are channeled directly to the island, steps need to \nbe taken to avoid getting into this situation again in the future.\n  For some time Puerto Rico has spent more than it takes in from \nrevenues and receipts and has covered the difference with debt. The \ndebt that has been issued has tapped out virtually every possible \nfuture receipt of the government, and basic budget arithmetic has \ncaught up with this unsustainable fiscal recipe and has effectively \nshut Puerto Rico out of funding markets.\n  In short, Puerto Rico must move to policies that are fiscally \nsustainable. Madam President, that is not me trying to impose on Puerto \nRico's sovereignty. That is not an agenda of ``austerity'' at work. It \nis just the simple budget arithmetic of the situation. Before we \nundertake any efforts to provide relief or assistance to Puerto Rico, \nwe need to give this simple math its proper consideration and demand a \nworkable plan for the future. I would like to see Puerto Rico submit \nsuch a plan, and that plan is going to have to include how they resolve \nthe overwhelming burden of government down there when they have allowed \nit to grow out of control and become the employer of last resort.\n  For its part, the Obama administration has chosen to remain \nrelatively vague on this somehow. In October, we saw a joint statement \nfrom Treasury, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the \nNational Economic Council outlining a general plan which they called a \n``Roadmap for Congressional Action.'' This roadmap contained many of \nthe same general proposals I have discussed today with regard to \nbankruptcy relief, tax credits, and health spending. Conspicuously \nabsent were any proposals for regulatory relief for Puerto Rico. Also \nabsent were any real cost estimates or proposed offsets, just some \nlipservice to the need to undertake these changes in a ``fiscally \nresponsible'' way.\n  I have made inquiries to various agencies, including Treasury and \nHHS, with little in the way of detailed response to many of these \nissues at stake here. It remains puzzling to me that in the midst of \nwhat some in the administration are calling a ``humanitarian crisis,'' \nwe are seeing very little engagement from our health agencies, \nparticularly when so many have been arguing that the crisis stems in \nlarge part from the lack of health care funding in Puerto Rico.\n  It also seems that provisions of taxpayer-funded technical \nassistance--which I would think would be considered in any package \naimed at Puerto Rico--may be rendered moot given that, as I understand \nit, Treasury officials are working to wedge such a system on the \nsidelines into appropriations vehicles. Needless to say, before \nCongress can even begin to consider a significant legislative package \nto address the situation in Puerto Rico, we need more information from \nthe administration about what it is now doing and what it plans to do \nin the near future. Put simply, it would not be productive for Congress \nto move forward on a legislative vehicle costing billions of dollars, \nif not tens of billions of dollars, without knowing beforehand if that \nlegislation contradicts or conforms to the plans of Federal agencies.\n  Long story short, Madam President, this will likely be a significant \nundertaking. There are a lot of ideas floating around. Some may work; \nothers clearly will not. As the chairman of the Senate committee with \njurisdiction over our Tax Code and most of the relevant health \nprograms, I am more than willing to work with my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to find a bipartisan path forward. To accomplish \nthat goal, we need everyone involved to be upfront and willing to work \ntogether. That goes for Members of Congress, the administration, and \nthe Government of Puerto Rico. Everyone needs to come clean about the \ncurrent state of affairs, the specific needs and amounts requested, the \nactual costs of any legislative or administrative proposal, and whether \nthey want to offset costs or simply incur more Federal debt. Right now, \ntoo many people are willing to throw out demands and vague proposals--\nwith the price tag as high as $30 billion to $40 billion--accompanied \nby a lot of political rhetoric. That is precisely what we do not need.\n  It would be very easy to play politics with this issue. My hope is \nthat enough of us will be able to set that aside to allow Congress to \ndo right by our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico. There are some who \nbelieve that crass politics may be playing a role here and that some \nwould throw Puerto Rico to the dogs so that more and more people will \nimmigrate to Florida for political purposes.\n  I hope that is not true. I can't believe that is true, but it has \nbeen stated. I hope we can come together as Democrats and Republicans \nto solve this problem. Puerto Rico is going to have\n\n[[Page S8186]]\n\nto help us to know what to do. I suspect the creditors are going to \nhave to help us, too, or we are going to have to help them as well. I \nstand ready, willing, and able as chairman of the Finance Committee to \nsolve these problems. But so far we haven't even received the right \nfinancial statements from Puerto Rico, and we can't move ahead without \nhaving clear-cut information that shows us what is going on, what the \nproblems are, what we have to do, and how to do it.\n  I want to do whatever it takes to help Puerto Rico resolve these \nproblems, and I would like to see Puerto Rico itself resolve them. It \nmay take some help from us; it may take some help from creditors. I \nwould like to see them sit down with creditors before we come up with \nsome colossal Federal program that is going to basically hurt \neverybody. But I am open, and I sure as heck want to get this problem \nsolved.\n  I like the people of Puerto Rico. I think they deserve better \ntreatment than this. But they also got themselves into this problem by \nrequiring too much of the central government and spending more and more \nall the time, with more and more central government employees that they \ndon't need. That is a large part of this problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, this Senator from Florida doesn't think \nit is true that Puerto Rico is having such economic chaos that the net \nresult is that Puerto Ricans--who are American citizens--move to \nFlorida. The fact is that some are moving to Florida, I would say to \nthe distinguished Senator from Utah, because of the economic \ndeprivation of the island.\n  It would seem to me, as someone who has looked at this issue and has \nbeen to the island and spoken to the leaders, that there is an \nessential element of fairness here. If the bankruptcy laws are allowed \nto apply to all States and municipalities, why would those bankruptcy \nlaws not apply to Puerto Rico and its need to reorganize its finances \nas well?\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NELSON. I will. Let me make this statement.\n  There is another part of unfairness, and that is that Puerto Ricans \nare not being treated the same way under the Medicare and Medicaid laws \nas well. To this Senator from Florida, who is close to the Puerto Rican \npeople, it does not seem to be the fair thing.\n  Regardless of what the issue is with regard to how they got into \neconomic trouble, the fact is they are in economic trouble. The \nquestion is, How are we going to get them out of economic trouble?\n  Of course, for purposes of a question, I yield to the distinguished \nSenator, my chairman of the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate my friend and colleague from Florida. I too \nunderstand that he understands a lot about this.\n  Look, bankruptcy laws do not apply. That doesn't mean we can't change \nthat. I am not sure that is the way to do it. We are going to have to \nhave some real information before we can move in that direction--which \nmay be dangerous.\n  I do think it is incumbent upon the Puerto Rican leadership to \nprovide us with audited financial statements, so we really know what \nthe problems are, so we can then approach this in an intelligent, \nreasonable, healthy, loving way. I am for getting this problem solved, \nbut I am not for just throwing money at it when we know their central \ngovernment is completely bloated and that is what is causing some, if \nnot most, of the problems. At least that is what we have been told.\n  I am happy to look at financials. I am happy to look at whatever \nsuggestions are made. Not that I am that important, but we can move if \nwe know what we are talking about. I am not about to move on the backs \nof the rest of the American taxpayers until they clean up the mess that \nis there, and they sit down with their creditors and see what they can \nwork out. We ought to be encouraging them. I think their creditors want \nus to encourage them because they think it can be worked out--at least \nthe one that I have spoken with.\n  So I commit to the distinguished Senator. He knows I don't make \ncommitments unless I mean them. I am going to try to solve this \nproblem. When I say ``I,'' I mean our committee and our Congress is \ngoing to try to solve this problem. But let's do it in an intelligent \nway. Let's get all the facts, let's get some cooperation from Puerto \nRico, and let's get the right financials so we know exactly what we can \nwork with. If we can get all that, hopefully we can find some solutions \nhere that will bring these folks into balance and give them a shot for \nthe future.\n  Last, but not least, I agree with the distinguished Senator that they \nhave not been treated fairly, and it is time for us to start treating \nthem fairly.\n  I disagree with him that there are not people in Congress who would \nlove to see more and more coming to Florida as Democrats. I am pretty \nsure that is the case, but that shouldn't be the case. We should be \nworking on these problems and solving them.\n  I commit to the distinguished Senator from Florida who is a great \nMember of our committee that I will work with him, and we will see what \nwe can do to solve these problems. But let's get some financials we can \nrely on before we go off on some deep end and miss the boat here.\n  Mr. NELSON. The Senator is certainly entitled to the information in \norder to make a reasonable judgment. This Senator is advocating \nfairness in the system.\n  There was a time that Puerto Rico was, in fact, included under the \nbankruptcy laws. For whatever reason, a couple of decades ago the law \nwas changed and they were treated differently; the same was true with \nMedicare and Medicaid payments. I think, regardless of what their \nfinancials show, Congress is going to have to take action. So when the \nSenator gets the information he wants, then I hope we can act forthwith \nbecause this is a problem that is with us at the moment. They are about \nto the point that they cannot make the payments on their debt \nobligations. So the day of reckoning is basically here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/senate-section/article/S8186-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8186-S8187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               BULK TELEPHONE METADATA COLLECTION PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I came to the floor for a different \nreason. I want to speak about the National Security Agency and the bulk \ntelephone metadata collection program that basically the new law took \nover, that there was reform of. Now, let me explain the old law and the \nnew law that just took effect yesterday.\n  The old law had been in effect for--I don't know the exact number of \nyears but something in excess of 5 and less than 8. The old law said \nthat by going to the approved court that handles classified \ninformation--called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court, \nknown by its acronym FISA--that the government could ask for these \nrecords to come into the possession of the government by showing good \ncause as to why those records would be held. So it was pursuant to a \ncourt order.\n  What were the records to be held? These are business records of the \ntelephone company. This is not the content of the telephone call; this \nis the business record that says that on such and such a day, at such a \ntime, that telephone number such and such called telephone such and \nsuch. That is called metadata. That is it; there is no content.\n  For almost a decade, ever since we had the 9/11 attacks and we passed \nthe PATRIOT Act to try to make it much more efficient for our National \nSecurity Agencies to protect us--those records, if the telephone \ncompany complied with the order, would be in the data-base. But it is \nnot the content. It is only the business records stating what I just \nsaid: Number such and such called such and such.\n  Why was that important? Because when we suddenly got an indication \nthat we had a terrorist that was going to strike either here or abroad \nand if that terrorist had a link to a number, we could see what calls \nthat potential terrorist had made to what number and what numbers that \nnumber then called, and we could go down several different calls. It \nwas through this that we were able to track down and prevent a number \nof terrorist acts, including in this country.\n  Earlier this year, along came the reform. The choice this Senator--\nwho\n\n[[Page S8187]]\n\nsupports the old law--was given was that either the old law is going to \nexpire and there is not going to be any law that governs the collection \nof these business records--nothing--or go with the reform. The so-\ncalled reform was that you had to go to the FISA Court to get an order \nas to a specific number and a specific reason why that number was \nsomething that you wanted. That sounds harmless enough, except when you \nare dealing in some cases with seconds, minutes, a few hours; you might \nbe looking for this person about whom we suddenly got a tip--maybe from \na human source--that they are about to try to do us damage. So how long \nis it going to take to go into court? Is it going to take months? Is it \ngoing to take weeks? Days? All the time, the potential terrorist is \nwell ahead of us. I know our intelligence agencies are trying to be \nprepared so they can do it in the shortest possible time, but a judge \nhas to be there to hear the facts and the probable cause in order to \nthen render an order to allow the intelligence agencies--domestically, \nit would be the FBI--to go get those business records.\n  If they get the business record and see that it goes one hop to \nanother number, but maybe that goes another hop to another number and \nthat goes another hop to several other numbers, under the so-called \nreform of the USA FREEDOM Act, there is a limitation on the number of \nhops. This Senator feels we shouldn't limit those hops if we are trying \nto find out who the bad guy is and what he is about to do.\n  Once we had that determined, then we go to the court again. If it is \nan American citizen or a person who is legally in the United States, \nthey have to obtain another court order in order to be able to get the \ncontent--either listening to those calls or in the case of email \nrecords, the content of the email.\n  We always said there ought to be this continuous tension between our \nright to privacy, protecting our country, and ourselves. We want that \ntension to be there because our right to privacy is what makes us \ndifferent in this country. Therefore, that is why we have the \nprotections of having to go into court in order to get an order to get \nthe content of the communications.\n  All you have to do is look to Paris and you can see that these guys \nare out to really do some mayhem. If in any way we are slowed down, \nthen I think it is a considerable hindrance to us. I bring this to the \nattention of the Senate simply because the new act superseded the old \nact this past weekend. Naturally, when these records were spread about \npublicly 2 years ago by Edward Snowden, intentionally, recklessly, and \nI might say illegally, there was a fear. It made it seem like Big \nBrother was gathering up all of our information. That is why in the \ninitial PATRIOT Act we were so careful to keep this right of privacy \nprotected by court order for the business records and then of course \nfor content by a court order.\n  I believe that program was lawful, I believe it was court-approved, \nand I believe it has helped protect us from terrorist attacks in the \npast. I think the confusion in the land is because of what the bulk \nrecord was. It wasn't content. It was business record--the dates, \ntimes, length, and the numbers dialed but not their content.\n  We have this new law. It is in place. The National Intelligence \nDirector, Jim Clapper, and the NSA Director, ADM Mike Rogers, assured \nus that the new law preserved a critical counterterrorism capability, \nbut these Paris attacks remind us how brutal ISIS really is and that \nthe terrorist threat persists.\n  As we look at who the terrorists in Paris were, there were four of \nthem whom we knew of, whom we had on our no-fly list, and who were \ncitizens of European countries. What does that mean? That means they \ndidn't have to go into the Embassy to get a visa so their background \ncould be checked. They are one of the visa waiver countries. But there \nwas another one of their citizens who was one of those terrorists who \nwas not on our no-fly list. I think the fact that the administration \nhas already started clamping down, doing the extra checks, we certainly \nwant to keep the Visa Waiver Program going, but it is a considerable \npotential threat if we are not checking and rechecking. I think from \nwhat we learned out of Paris, if the European countries will be more \nforthcoming to share their intelligence information with us about the \npotential terrorists, that will build our no-fly list for their \ncitizens and that will be very helpful.\n  We ought to permanently extend section 702 of the FISA Amendments \nAct, which is going to expire in another 2 years. This crucial tool \nprovides access to electronic communications of suspected terrorists \nand other foreign persons located outside of the United States. As we \nredouble our counterterrorism efforts, we must maintain what works and \nmake the necessary changes as the threat evolves. That means remaining \nvigilant and using all the tools in our toolbox--including intelligence \ncollection, Homeland Security protections, and the fight against ISIS \non the battlefield.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/senate-section/article/S8187-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8187-S8188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HOLDS ON AMBASSADORIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, in September, we learned shocking news \nthat the U.S. Secret Service--armed agents of the Executive--violated \nthe law to intimidate a congressman from doing his constitutional duty. \nForty-five Secret Service employees accessed the personal records of \nCongressman Jason Chaffetz in violation of the Privacy Act. They shared \nwith hundreds of personnel the fact that Congressman Chaffetz had \nunsuccessfully applied to join the Service, leading to a leak of the \ninformation to the news media.\n  This activity was not limited to low-level employees. The Service's \nAssistant Director and head of training, Ed Lowery, encouraged the \nsharing of information, writing in an email:\n\n       Some information that he might find embarrassing needs to \n     get out. Just to be fair.\n\n  The Director of the Service, Joe Clancy, failed to act to rein in the \nbehavior when the information was raised to him. He had no reaction \nwhen he heard what he deemed to be a speculative rumor about the \ninformation. He apparently forgot that he had been informed of \nCongressman Chaffetz's personal records, incorrectly telling the \nHomeland Security Department's inspector general that he didn't learn \nof the matter until it was about to be published in the Washington \nPost.\n  The White House's reaction to this criminal violation was equally \nmuted. The White House implied that an apology to Congressman Chaffetz \nwould suffice in the absence of formal discipline and a criminal \ninvestigation. This was unacceptable. To ensure that proper remedial \naction took place, I placed a hold on three ambassadorial nominees to \nsend a clear message to the White House.\n  I intended to lift these holds once two actions took place: First, I \nasked that the Department of Homeland Security take appropriate \ndisciplinary action against all Secret Service personnel involved, \nincluding Secret Service leadership; second, I requested that a \ncriminal investigation be initiated by the Department of Justice into \nviolations of the Privacy Act.\n  Since I placed the holds, the White House reached out to my office \nand made clear that the President understood the gravity of the \nviolations that occurred. In the past month, the Obama administration \nhas finally begun to take action. The Department of Homeland Security \nissued disciplinary proposals for the suspension of 42 lower level \npersonnel involved in the misconduct. For senior-level personnel--\nincluding Assistant Director Lowery--discipline proposals are being \nprepared, with the maximum penalty ranging up to the removal from their \npositions.\n  This discipline may or may not be proper in each case, but my intent \nisn't to be an HR officer for the Department of Homeland Security. \nInstead, when I instituted the holds on the three ambassadorial \nnominees, I made it clear my aim was not to keep these nominees in \nlimbo indefinitely. My sole aim was to force action from the Obama \nadministration, which too often ignores this separation of powers and \nproper enforcement of our laws.\n  Because the Obama administration has taken partial steps to hold \nthose who violated the law to account, I will in turn honor my word and \nlift two of\n\n[[Page S8188]]\n\nthe three holds I have on ambassadorial nominations: Mr. Samuel Heins, \nwho is nominated to be the U.S. Ambassador to Norway, and Ms. Azita \nRaji, who is nominated to be the U.S. Ambassador to Sweden. I believe \nboth are qualified to represent our Nation abroad, and we have \nsignificant interests in Scandinavia. My hope is that both nominees \nreceive a vote and are confirmed in the Senate sooner rather than \nlater.\n  I will retain, however, the hold on President Obama's Ambassador to \nthe Bahamas. This is because the Department of Justice has yet to \ninitiate an investigation into the unauthorized access and \ndissemination of Congressman Chaffetz's personal records.\n  The DHS inspector general has testified to Congress that he believes \ncriminal violations of the Privacy Act occurred. Secret Service \nDirector Clancy, in his own testimony to Congress, agreed with the \ninspector general, acknowledging that the violations constituted, in \nhis words, ``a criminal offense.'' With such agreement between the \nDepartment of Homeland Security IG and the Secret Service Director, I \nretain the hope and fully expect that a criminal investigation of these \noffenses by the Department of Justice will be forthcoming.\n  That investigation and the discipline currently being meted out by \nthe Department of Homeland Security are important to send the message \nthat politically motivated crimes will not be tolerated. Consequences \nare needed to make clear that the separation of powers will be \nrespected and that Members of Congress acting on behalf of the people \nwill not be intimidated.\n  I also reserve the right to place new holds on future administration \nnominees. What we cannot have is impunity for criminal offenses. If the \ndiscipline for the Secret Service leadership is too weak or if a \ncriminal investigation is not initiated, I may place additional holds \nin order to again remind the White House of the seriousness of this \nmatter, but in the meantime I look forward to continuing to work with \nthe administration to ensure that discipline is appropriate and a \ncriminal investigation on this matter is initiated.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, having just finished the Thanksgiving \nholiday season, many of us had a chance to be with our families and \ngive thanks for all of the great goodness we have had showered on us as \nindividuals and those lucky enough to live in this great Nation, but \nfor many families this was a painful holiday weekend. It is sobering to \nrealize how many American families have their lives impacted by gun \nviolence in America every single day. Sadly, the past holiday weekend \nwas no exception.\n  In my home State of Illinois, in the city of Chicago, gun violence \nhas taken a devastating toll. There have been 436 homicides in Chicago \nthis year--most of them by gunfire. In Chicago, the news this morning \nwas that 8 people were killed and at least 20 others were wounded in \nshootings over the holiday weekend. Today the University of Chicago has \nclosed its campus in Hyde Park because of a shooting threat that was \nmade against the campus community. Classes and activities are canceled. \nExtra security has been provided. At a high school in Barrington, IL, \nin the suburbs of Chicago, students saw a lockdown after a student came \nto school with a gun and was arrested.\n  The fact is, there is too much gun violence in America. All across \nthe country we have seen such terrible stories.\n  On Friday, in Biloxi, MS, a patron at a Waffle House restaurant shot \nand killed Julia Brightwell, a waitress, after she asked him not to \nsmoke in the restaurant.\n  In Atlanta, on Saturday, 6-year-old Ja'Mecca Smith found a loaded \nhandgun in the cushions of a sofa and fatally shot herself--6 years \nold.\n  In Rome, NY, a 7-month-old infant was shot and killed on Saturday \nwhen a nearby 18-year-old was cleaning and loading a shotgun that was \ndischarged.\n  In Colorado Springs, CO, a gunman burst into a Planned Parenthood \nbuilding and killed three people, including police officer Garrett \nSwasey, and wounded nine others. The Governor of Colorado called this \ndomestic terrorism, and I agree.\n  An average of 297 Americans are shot every day, 89 of them fatally. \nThey are shot in homicides, assaults, suicides, accidental shootings, \nmass shootings, and even domestic terrorism attacks like the one we \njust witnessed at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs. By \none count, there have been at least 351 mass shootings in America so \nfar this year--that is more than one every single day--and there have \nbeen more than 50 shootings in American schools so far this year. There \nare some people who think that the Founding Fathers, when they \nenvisioned the future of America, envisioned an armed America with \nabsolute, inviolate gun rights. I don't believe it. I don't believe for \na minute they had any vision of this level of wanton violence which is \ntaking place.\n  Several weeks ago, I joined with my Senate Democratic colleagues. We \nwent to the steps of the Capitol and called on the Republican majority \nin the Senate to do something. We urged Republicans to consider calling \non the floor of the Senate--in light of all of this gun violence--\ncommonsense reforms that would keep guns out of the hands of dangerous \npeople.\n  Whether or not you own a gun, whether or not you hunt, whatever your \nview is of the Constitution, can't we all basically agree that people \nwho have been convicted of a felony and those who are mentally unstable \nshould not be allowed to buy a gun? That, to me, is just common sense. \nThere are many people in my own family who are sportsmen and hunters \nand enjoy the firearms they bought as kids and went hunting with their \ndads and really appreciate it. It is part of the Midwestern culture. I \nhave yet to meet a single person who owns a gun and uses it responsibly \nwho doesn't agree with the statement that we should keep guns out of \nthe hands of convicted felons and also out of the hands of those who \nare mentally unstable.\n  It is also hard to imagine why there is opposition to this issue. Did \nyou know that even if you are on the government's terrorist watch \nlist--a person who is suspected of terrorism--you can legally buy a gun \nin America? I am not talking about gun show loopholes, where there are \nno questions asked; I am talking about the law in America which allows \nsuspected terrorists to buy firearms. In light of what happened in \nParis, France, does it make sense that someone on the terrorist watch \nlist can buy an assault weapon? God only knows where they would take it \nor what they would do with it and ultimately how many innocent people \nwould be killed. We can't even have a conversation about that on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate. No way. The National Rifle Association would \nnot approve. The gun lobby does not want us discussing these issues. We \nare talking about a Second Amendment absolute, inviolate right, in \ntheir eyes, and I think we are talking about something that is \nimpossible to explain and defend, from my point of view.\n  I will stand up for Second Amendment rights--the rights of people to \nown and use guns responsibly and store them safely away from children. \nI will stand up for their rights, but we also have to come together and \nacknowledge that those who would misuse firearms because they have a \ncriminal intent, with a criminal record, are mentally unstable, or are \non a suspected terrorist watch list--for goodness' sake, we ought to be \nable to draw that line in the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/senate-section/article/S8188-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8188-S8190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SYRIAN REFUGEES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it was just a few weeks ago that--I \nguess 10 days ago, actually--the Republican Presidential candidates \nwent to the Presiding Officer's State to meet with religious leaders, \nChristian leaders, and were seeking their support. Of course they all \nwant the support of everyone living in Iowa because the Iowa\n\n[[Page S8189]]\n\ncaucus is coming up pretty soon. I thought about that as they went to \nmeet these Christian leaders in Iowa, just across the river from my \nhome State of Illinois. I thought about how they had just left their \ndiscussions here in Washington, talking about Syrian refugees.\n  The most humbling humanitarian crisis in the world today is occurring \nin Syria. They have had a civil war which has gone on for years. \nMillions of people have been displaced and thousands have been killed. \nI met some of them just a few months ago when I went to Greece and saw \nthese refugees streaming away from the camps in Syria trying to find a \nsafe place. I can't imagine what it must be like for a husband to turn \nto his wife and say: We have to move. Pick up the kids. Whatever you \ncan carry is all that we are taking. We are going to try to find a safe \nplace to live.\n  I saw hundreds and thousands of them--families streaming out of this \nwar-torn area. Very few of them have ever made it to the United \nStates--about 2,000. Part of the reason is we have an elaborate, \nlengthy background check before anyone can be admitted as a refugee. In \nfact, it takes anywhere from 18 to 24 months of waiting to see if you \nmight legally become a refugee in the United States of America.\n  Well, these Republican Presidential candidates and 25 Governors have \nsaid: We don't want any Syrian refugees. We are not going to allow them \nto come to the United States during a period of a ``pause''--as some \nsay. Others have taken more extreme positions. It is hard to imagine. \nIf our goal is to keep Americans safe, why are these Republican \ncandidates focusing on Syrian refugees? You see, since we have allowed \nabout 2,000 refugees into the United States over the last 4 years, not \none single Syrian refugee has been arrested and accused of terrorist \nactivity--not one. After a lengthy background check, we believe we have \ndone everything humanly possible to keep those away who would be any \ndanger to our country.\n  I met some of those Syrian refugees who have made it here, in the \ncity of Chicago. If you think they are terrorist threats to the United \nStates, for goodness' sake, take a few minutes and sit down and talk to \nthem and hear their stories of how their families went through extreme \nhardships--some of them with children who were being killed in Syria \nduring the war--and as they fled with the clothes on their backs, they \nappealed to the United States to be allowed to come here as refugees \nand then waited up to 2 years to go through every one of the possible \nbackground checks before they finally made it.\n  What happens when they get here? Well, initially they need some help. \nMany of them don't speak English very well. Some of them are not \nfinancially ready to take care of themselves. But do you know what \nhappens after a few months? They find a place, go to work, and join a \nlong parade of those who have come to the United States as refugees and \ncalled it home. That includes 400,000 Vietnamese refugees who came to \nthe United States and are now a great part of our country. It includes \n650,000 Cuban refugees who came to the United States, escaping Castro. \nIncluded in those 650,000 refugees were the fathers of two U.S. \nSenators, one of whom is running for President of the United States. \nThey came to the United States and made an important contribution to \nthe Senate and our Nation--refugees. I heard one of them say: Well, it \nwas different then. We are dealing with terrorism today.\n  Really? What were we dealing with when we accepted Cuban refugees? We \nwere dealing with a Communist regime in Cuba that was friendly with the \nSoviet Union, which had nuclear weapons pointed at the United States, \nand we were accepting refugees from that country. I am glad we did. We \nwere living in a very dangerous time when they were accepted, and on \nbalance we found that history has proven that those refugees from Cuba \nhave become an important part of the United States.\n  We accepted over 200,000 Soviet Jews who were being persecuted in \nthat country and wanted to come to the United States so that they could \npractice their religion freely. In my hometown of Springfield, IL, the \nsynagogues opened their doors and said: We will sponsor these families \nas they come to our Midwestern community. We brought refugees from the \nSoviet Union in, and they became part of the United States.\n  The story is told over and over again. Yet Republican Presidential \nnominees and Governors describe refugees as just terrorists on the run. \nThey say they are not carefully screened and are still allowed in the \nUnited States. That is the way they describe it. It is not true. We \nknow it is not true.\n  When I consider those Republican Presidential nominees going to Iowa \nto pose for holy pictures with religious leaders after they said we \nwould exclude these poor people who are simply trying to find a safe \nplace for their families, it is hard to imagine.\n  This morning's New York Times tells a totally different story. Madam \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that this article in the New York \nTimes be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 17, 2015]\n\n A Manhattan Hardware Store Welcomes Refugees as Governors Vow To Shut \n                                Them Out\n\n                             (By Jim Dwyer)\n\n       Chris Christie of New Jersey and at least 25 other \n     governors have said they do not want Syrian refugees to come \n     to their states.\n       Then again, there is Wankel's, a family-owned hardware \n     store that opened on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in the \n     19th century. For decades, it has hired people who came to \n     the United States fleeing violence and persecution.\n       ``People coming from really bad situations, trying to make \n     a better life in America,'' said Sean Wankel, 32, vice \n     president of Wankel's. ``Or a life.''\n       The refugees come to Wankel's through resettlement agencies \n     like Catholic Charities or the International Rescue Committee \n     and stay for a few months or years as they get their bearings \n     in a new world. On a wall map, colored pins mark the three \n     dozen countries from which the Wankel workers have come.\n       Felix Royce, 39, started in the store two months ago. Like \n     many before him, he is new to retail work; in Nigeria, he had \n     been a pastor and an author. He said the picture on his book \n     jacket made him a target of the Boko Haram, a murderous sect \n     of anti-Western Islamists who rose in a swamp of official \n     corruption and violence. Among Boko Haram's infamous \n     atrocities was the kidnapping of scores of schoolgirls in \n     2014.\n       ``They organize mock street fights and send little kids \n     with suicide bombs,'' Mr. Royce said. ``ISIS is more sensible \n     than Boko Haram. You would have insiders, police officers and \n     politicians who collaborate with the Boko Haram. You didn't \n     know who to trust.''\n       In fear of his life, he said, he made his way to Houston \n     and applied for asylum, appearing without a lawyer three \n     times in front of immigration judges before being formally \n     admitted to the United States. He, his wife and their two \n     children now live in the Bronx, aided by the International \n     Rescue Committee.\n       ``I am sitting here,'' he said, ``trying to put my life \n     together. We are just trying to find our feet.''\n       Mr. Royce said he had been closely following the news of \n     the attacks in Paris on Friday evening by bombers and gunmen \n     connected to the Islamic State, also called ISIS or ISIL.\n       A tiny fraction of the refugees leaving Syria have been \n     permitted into the United States--fewer than nine a week \n     between Oct. 1, 2011, and Sept. 30 of this year, a total of \n     1,854--as an estimated four million people fled the \n     deteriorating nation. President Obama said the United States \n     would accept 10,000 refugees from Syria in the coming fiscal \n     year. Republicans in Congress and in statehouses are \n     objecting, saying that terrorists like those involved in the \n     Paris attacks could camouflage themselves in the stream of \n     legitimate refugees.\n       Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, the \n     newly inaugurated House speaker, called for a ``pause'' in \n     the refugee resettlement program. Mr. Christie, seeking the \n     Republican presidential nomination, released a letter he sent \n     to the president.\n       ``I write to inform you that I will not accept any refugees \n     from Syria in the wake of the deadly terrorist attack in \n     Paris,'' he wrote, saying federal screening procedures were \n     inadequate. ``Neither you nor any federal official can \n     guarantee that Syrian refugees will not be part of any \n     terroristic activity.''\n       New Yorkers might imagine police barricades being set up \n     around the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, to prevent \n     people from fleeing the collapsing towers because no one \n     could guarantee they would not be part of any future \n     terroristic activity.\n       It is not clear whether Mr. Christie or any other governor \n     can refuse to ``accept'' refugees. As a practical matter, New \n     Jersey does not have border controls, and probably could not \n     set up traffic lanes for citizenship papers at places like \n     the Lincoln Tunnel.\n       Other Republican candidates, including Ted Cruz and Jeb \n     Bush, said they would permit Christian refugees from Syria, \n     but not Muslims.\n\n[[Page S8190]]\n\n       At the hardware store where he has found work, in a city \n     where he and his family have taken refuge, Mr. Royce was \n     polite in assessing the proposed restrictions.\n       ``Some people are saying, let them be, let them stay \n     there,'' he said. ``I wouldn't subscribe to that. There are \n     innocent ones out there. This would mean there is no hope for \n     them. If you screen, there are good ones among the bad. \n     Everyone from Syria is not from ISIS. If you leave everybody, \n     ISIS will take advantage of them.''\n       Mr. Wankel was asked if his business had room for Syrian \n     refugees.\n       ``Certainly,'' he said. ``If they are coming through the \n     International Rescue Committee or Catholic Charities, I'd do \n     it. They have a tough life. If I was in Syria, I'd want to \n     get the heck out.''\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it is a story about a man named Sean \nWankel. His family has owned a hardware store on the Upper East Side of \nManhattan since the 19th century. For decades, the Wankel family has \nbeen hiring people who came to the United States to escape violence and \npersecution--asylees and refugees. The owner of the store, Sean Wenkel, \nsaid: ``People coming from really bad situations, trying to make a \nbetter life in America.'' Wankel, of course, takes these refugees in to \nwork in their store. They are referred to him by Catholic charities and \nthe International Rescue Committee. They stay for a few months or years \nas they get their bearings in the new world. He has a wall map in the \nhardware store with colored pens marking three dozen countries from \nwhich these workers have come.\n  The article goes on to tell the story of Felix Royce, who came to the \nUnited States a few months ago, from persecution by terrorists in \nNigeria, and got a job in this hardware store.\n  It is interesting that for decades this man and his family have \nintentionally brought in these refugees and asylees and made them part \nof their business and life, while nearby, the Governor of New Jersey is \nquaking in his boots at the thought of a refugee coming into the State \nof New Jersey. What a contrast.\n  The gentleman at the hardware store said that it is not clear if the \nRepublican Governor of New Jersey even understands who these people \nare.\n  I will quote Mr. Royce from Nigeria again:\n\n       Some people are saying, let them be, let them stay there. I \n     wouldn't subscribe to that. There are innocent ones out \n     there. This would mean there is no hope for them. If you \n     screen, there are good ones among the bad. Everyone from \n     Syria is not from ISIS. If you leave everybody, ISIS will \n     take advantage of them.\n\n  It is hard for me to imagine some of the things that have been said \nrecently by some of the Presidential candidates on the other side. It \nisn't just a matter of turning away Syrian refugees even with the \nclearance practices we have, but some have gone to even more extreme \nstatements, saying that we should never allow people of the Muslim \nreligion to come to the United States or that they should somehow be \nidentified in this country. If you are a student of history, you will \nknow that kind of paranoia and that kind of prejudice has exhibited \nitself many times in our history. We look back on it now not with pride \nbut with sadness to think that we reached the point where we treated \npeople that way.\n  In May of 1939, when a shipload of Jews were trying to escape the \nNazis in Germany--900 of them on the SS St. Louis--and came to Miami, \nthey were turned away. They went back to Europe. Two-hundred of those \nJews perished in the Holocaust because they were turned away from the \nUnited States of America. And when Senator Robert Wagner of New York \nsuggested that we allow 10,000 Jewish children to come to the United \nStates to escape the Nazis, that was defeated in this Congress. There \nwere Japanese internment camps and other situations just like that--\nsad, fearful things that were done that we look back on now and say: We \ncan't repeat those mistakes. But the language that is coming out of \nmany today is an echo of the past decisions--decisions we look back on \nnow and say never again. Sadly, they are being suggested even today.\n  Our first obligation is to keep America safe, and if we are going to \ndo that, let's look to things that truly do keep us safe. Let's say \nthat if you are on the terrorist watch list in the United States of \nAmerica, you cannot legally purchase guns or explosives. That is not a \nradical idea; that is something we need to do to change the law. \nInstead of focusing on 70,000 refugees who go through 2 years of \nbackground checks before they come here, let's focus on the 20 million \nwho visit the United States without visas each year from Europe and 38 \ncountries around the world and make sure they have been carefully \nchecked before they come to the United States.\n  There are things we can do to keep America safe, but denying access \nto refugees who are suffering now with their children in the hopes of \nfinding a safe place is not American. It is not who we are. It is not \nwho we should be.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/senate-section/article/S8190-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MACKENZIE BAKER\n\n Mr. THUNE.

In January \n2014 and again in January 2015, increases for civilian Federal \nemployees were limited to a 1.0 percent overall pay increase, an amount \nlower than the private sector pay increases and statutory formula for \nadjustments to the base General Schedule for 2014 and 2015. However, as \nthe country's economic recovery continues, we must maintain efforts to \nkeep our Nation on a sustainable fiscal course. This is an effort that \ncontinues to require tough choices.\n  Under current law, locality pay increases averaging 28.74 percent and \ncosting $26 billion would go into effect in January 2016. Federal \nagency budgets cannot sustain such increases. Accordingly, I have \ndetermined that under the authority of section 5304a of title 5, United \nStates Code, locality-based comparability payments for the locality pay \nareas established by the President's Pay Agent, in the amounts set \nforth in the attached table, shall become effective on the first day of \nthe first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2016. \nThese rates are based on an allocation of 0.3 percent of payroll as \nindicated in my August 28, 2015, alternative pay plan for adjustments \nto the base General Schedule. These decisions will not materially \naffect our ability to attract and retain a well-qualified Federal \nworkforce.\n  The adjustments described above shall take effect on the first \napplicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2016.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, November 30, 2015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/30/senate-section/article/S8191-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 2015, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on November 23, 2015, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Messer) \nhad signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 599.

Res. 322\n\n       Whereas many historians date the beginning of the modern \n     civil rights movement in the United States as December 1, \n     1955;\n       Whereas Rosa Louise McCauley Parks was born on February 4, \n     1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama, the first child of James and \n     Leona (Edwards) McCauley;\n       Whereas Rosa Louise Parks was arrested on December 1, 1955, \n     in Montgomery, Alabama, for refusing to give up her seat on a \n     bus to a Caucasian man, and her stand for equal rights became \n     legendary;\n       Whereas news of the arrest of Rosa Louise Parks resulted in \n     approximately 42,000 African-Americans boycotting Montgomery \n     buses for 381 days, beginning on December 5, 1955, until the \n     bus segregation law was changed on December 21, 1956;\n       Whereas the United States Supreme Court ruled on November \n     13, 1956, that the Montgomery segregation law was \n     unconstitutional, and on December 20, 1956, Montgomery \n     officials were ordered to desegregate buses;\n       Whereas the civil rights movement led to the Civil Rights \n     Act of 1964, which broke down the barrier of legal \n     discrimination against African-Americans;\n       Whereas Rosa Louise Parks has been honored as the ``first \n     lady of civil rights'' and the ``mother of the freedom \n     movement'', and her quiet dignity ignited the most \n     significant social movement in the history of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas Rosa Louise Parks was the recipient of many awards \n     and accolades for her efforts on behalf of racial harmony, \n     including--\n       (1) the Congressional Gold Medal;\n       (2) the Spingarn Award, which is the highest honor of the \n     National Association for the Advancement of Colored People \n     for civil rights contributions; and\n       (3) the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is the highest \n     civilian honor in the United States;\n       Whereas Rosa Louise Parks was named 1 of the 20 most \n     influential and iconic figures of the 20th century;\n       Whereas Rosa Louise Parks sparked 1 of the largest \n     movements in the United States against racial segregation, \n     and by her quiet courage symbolizes all that is vital about \n     nonviolent protest because of the way she endured threats of \n     death and persisted as an advocate for the basic lessons she \n     taught the people of the United States;\n       Whereas Rosa Louise Parks and her husband Raymond Parks \n     relocated to Michigan in 1957, and remained in Michigan until \n     the death of Rosa Louise Parks on October 24, 2005;\n       Whereas, in November 2005, Congress authorized the Joint \n     Committee on the Library to procure a statue of Rosa Louise \n     Parks to be placed in the Capitol; and\n       Whereas the bus on which Rosa Louise Parks sparked a new \n     era in the quest for freedom and equality in the United \n     States is--\n       (1) 1 of the most significant artifacts of the civil rights \n     movement in the United States; and\n       (2) on permanent display in the Henry Ford Museum in \n     Dearborn, Michigan: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and celebrates the 60th anniversary of the \n     refusal of Rosa Louise Parks to give up her seat on a bus on \n     December 1, 1955;\n       (2) commemorates the legacy of Rosa Louise Parks to inspire \n     all people of the United States to stand up for freedom and \n     the principles of the Constitution; and\n       (3) endeavors to work with the same courage, dignity, and \n     determination exemplified by a civil rights pioneer, Rosa \n     Louise Parks, to address modern inequalities and injustices.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Gayle \nSmith, of Ohio, to be Administrator of the United States Agency for \nInternational Development.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 30 \nminutes of debate, equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, 2 months ago I came to the Senate floor \nto urge the majority leader to schedule a vote on the nomination of \nGayle Smith to serve as Administrator of the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development, also known as USAID. Here we are, 7 months \nafter the President nominated her to fill this position. The Senate \nwill have a chance in a few minutes to vote on Gayle Smith's nomination \nto head USAID.\n  I fully expect that today's vote will lead to her confirmation. We \nare witnessing a humanitarian crisis in Syria and across the Middle \nEast that grows worse by the day, posing a risk to European stability \nand cohesion. Having someone at the head of USAID is absolutely \ncritical. The United States, with our unparalleled capacity to mobilize \ninternational support for humanitarian relief, should continue to play \na leading role in assisting both Syrian refugees and the neighboring \ncountries that are hosting them.\n  Having an effective leader such as Gayle Smith at USAID is a critical \npart of that effort. Last month I had the opportunity to lead a \ndelegation of three other Senators to Greece and Germany. Senator \nDurbin, Senator Warren, Senator Klobuchar, and I all went to see \nfirsthand the plight of refugees from the war in Syria and the \nincredible burden that both Greece and Germany are under as a result of \nthese unprecedented refugee flows.\n\n  Many of us--and we heard this when we were in Greece--believed that \nthe rate of refugee arrivals would slow with the coming of cold \nweather. In fact, the exact opposite has happened, and the humanitarian \nsituation has only become worse.\n  Of course, USAID's work is not only limited to the situation in \nSyria; it extends to the 60 countries and regional USAID missions \naround the world, including in Afghanistan, where USAID development \nwork is critical to the long-term success and security of that country.\n  I am relieved that we are finally going to get to vote on Gayle Smith \nand that the majority has overcome the objections of the one Member \nwho, for the last 7 months, has been holding up her nomination. That \nMember was willing to put at risk the massive investment of resources \nthe United States has made in Afghanistan and other parts of the world \njust to score political points on an issue that was completely outside \nof Gayle Smith's portfolio at USAID.\n  As things have moved on Gayle Smith, I am hoping this type of \nobstruction is going to end, and we will soon vote not only on Ms. \nSmith's nomination but also to confirm other critical national security \nnominees, especially the pending Foreign Service nominations that have \nbeen approved by the Foreign Relations Committee and that could be \nvoted on by the full Senate today.\n  For example, in May the President nominated Tom Melia to be Assistant \nAdministrator for USAID for Europe and Eurasia. This is a critical \nposition not only because of the development work but because these are \ntwo regions that are under extreme pressure from Vladimir Putin. These \nregions would both benefit from USAID programs that would bolster their \nability to act independently of Russian influence. Tom Melia is still \nunconfirmed, despite the fact that the Foreign Relations Committee \napproved his nomination in July. In addition, the nominee to serve as \nU.S. Ambassador to Sweden has been pending for over a year. Sweden has \nbecome a much more critical ally in terms of the refugee issue that \nEurope is facing. The nominee to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Norway--\nagain another critical ally--has been pending\n\n[[Page S8194]]\n\nsince May. The nominee to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, a \ncritical post for the United States, one of our neighbors and main \nallies in this hemisphere--these have all been pending since June.\n  At a time when the world is facing national security challenges on a \nnumber of fronts and nations are looking to the United States for \nleadership, we cannot afford to sideline ourselves by failing to \nconfirm nominees for these diplomatic posts.\n  I recognize Senator Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee as well as his Democratic counterpart, Senator \nCardin, who have worked very hard to secure the confirmation vote for \nGayle Smith to serve as Administrator for USAID. I know we are working \nhard to get these other nominees to the floor, but at a time when our \nleadership is so important, when there are so many challenges facing us \naround the world, to fail to have those key spokespeople for the United \nStates in positions of so many critical situations is unacceptable. We \nneed to move these nominees. We need to continue the work of U.S. \nforeign policy.\n  I am sure we will have a very broad bipartisan vote in support of \nGayle Smith. What is unfortunate is that we couldn't have done it 7 \nmonths ago when she passed through the committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first I thank Senator Shaheen for her \nleadership on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and for her \nleadership with regard to the nomination of Gayle Smith to be the \nAdministrator of USAID.\n  This is the U.S. Agency for International Development. I mention that \nbecause we are talking about a national security position. Our national \nsecurity depends on having a strong military, but it also depends upon \nhaving a strong position in international development assistance in \ndealing with our diplomacy. The director of USAID is a critical member \nof our national security team.\n  We couldn't have a stronger person for that position than Gayle \nSmith. I wholeheartedly support her confirmation.\n  I thank Senator Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, for the manner in which this nomination has been brought \nforward. He has been a strong proponent of Gayle Smith, and I thank him \nvery much for his help in getting this nomination to the floor.\n  I said that I couldn't find a stronger person to fill this position. \nShe is currently a Special Assistant to the President and Senior \nDirector at the National Security Council, where she is responsible for \nglobal development, democracy, and humanitarian assistance issues. She \nwas previously a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, \ncochair of the Enough Project, and the cofounder of the Modernizing \nForeign Assistance Network. During the Clinton administration, Gayle \nSmith served as the Special Assistant to the President and Senior \nDirector for African Affairs at the NSC, so she has broad experience \nover a long career in Foreign Service and in serving in regard to \ndevelopment assistance issues.\n  For over 37 years of her professional career she has served in Egypt, \nSudan, Ethiopia, and Eritrea. She has worked as a journalist and as a \nconsultant to aid groups. She has worked as a senior adviser to the \nAdministrator and Chief of Staff for USAID/East Africa. She has served \ntwice on the National Security Council as Special Assistant to the \nPresident. She has been hailed as a strong and effective advocate on \nglobal development issues. She was voted out of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, on which I serve as a ranking member, by a \nunanimous vote. I am very pleased that we are now able to vote tonight \nfor her confirmation to be the Administrator of the USAID.\n  I have already pointed out that this is a position critically \nimportant to our national security, but let me also point out that the \nworld is facing a host of humanitarian crises--including food \ninsecurity and displacement in Syria, the Europe migration crisis, the \nRohingya refugee crisis of Southeast Asia, and the millions of people \nwho are displaced and starving in South Sudan, which require American \nleadership and assistance.\n  Growing humanitarian needs worldwide are outstripping available \nresources. The Administrator of USAID is a key leadership post in the \neffort of the United States to shape the world's reaction to crisis and \ninstability.\n  I would go into a bit of detail on just one of the crises that the \nAdministrator of USAID faces so that everyone can truly understand the \nscale we are talking about. As a result of the war in South Sudan, 1.5 \nmillion people are internally displaced. More than 730,000 have crossed \nborders into Sudan, Ethiopia, and Uganda as refugees. The number of \npeople facing severe food insecurity has almost doubled since the start \nof the year, from 2.5 million to an estimated 4.6 million people, \nincluding approximately 874,000 children under the age of 5. This is \njust one example and I could give you many more examples why it is \ncritically important that we have a confirmed Administrator for USAID.\n  Gayle Smith is the right person for the right time to serve our \ncountry. I encourage my colleagues to support her nomination. This is a \nperson who will serve our country, continue to serve our country well, \nand I am proud to support her.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE.
