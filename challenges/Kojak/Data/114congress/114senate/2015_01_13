All Senators should know \nthat we will get on this bill today and begin the amendment process. We \ncan do it the easy way or we can do it the hard way. Either we will get \non it this afternoon by consent or shortly after midnight without \nconsent. But we will get on it today.\n  It is surprising to me that some Democratic Senators are choosing to \nexercise their procedural rights in order to block their own colleagues \nfrom offering amendments to the bill, although at this point the only \nSenators who have filed amendments at the desk are Republican Senators.\n  I want to make it clear to everybody that we are committed to an open \namendment process but not an open-ended one. So we are hopeful--I have \nread that Democrats have a number of amendments--that we will be given \na chance to get on the bill and begin to offer amendments so the Senate \ncan work its will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/13/senate-section/article/S159-7", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S159-S160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Democrats and Republicans cooperated \nlast night to bring the Keystone Pipeline another step closer to \nconstruction. Thanks to that bipartisan cloture vote, the Senate can \nfinally begin an open floor debate on this committee-vetted and \napproved legislation.\n  It is a debate many of us have actually been looking forward to--and \nnot just because of the substance of what we are considering. But we \nhave also been waiting a long time to have a debate where individual \nSenators actually matter again, which is why earlier I suggested that \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle allow us to get on the \nbill and let us offer amendments. This is going to be an open process, \nbut as I indicated, not an open-ended process.\n  This is a debate where Senators can offer amendments and have them \nconsidered by the Senators. It is a debate where Senators can make the \nvoices of their constituents heard. That is just the kind of serious \nlegislating many of us have been waiting a long time for, and the fact \nthat we are finally seeing it today is a direct consequence of our \nconstituents' calls for a functioning Congress. It is the latest \nexample of the new Republican majority putting Congress back to work.\n  Getting Congress back to work means working to pass legislation that \nis good for jobs and for the middle class, and that is why we are \nfocused on getting measures such as the bipartisan infrastructure bill \nover to the President's desk.\n  Even though he may not sign it--and we all know that he may not sign \neverything we pass--we are getting the Congress out of the business of \nprotecting the President from good ideas. That is our commitment to the \nAmerican people.\n  When it comes to the bipartisan Keystone bill, it is hard to see a \nserious reason why President Obama would\n\n[[Page S160]]\n\nveto these jobs anyway. The Nebraska Supreme Court just cleared away \nthe last pretense many of us could imagine. So we hope President Obama \nwill listen to the American people, and we hope in the end, after due \nconsideration, he will decide to sign it. But, no matter, we will not \nbe dissuaded from our path of working for the middle class. The new \nRepublican Congress is not going to stop working for more jobs and more \nopportunity.\n  Let's get the debate started. Let's see what Members of both parties \ncan accomplish by actually working together, and let's continue trying \nto pass as many good ideas as we can, starting with this bipartisan \njobs and infrastructure bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/13/senate-section/article/S160-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is true that we are in the process of \nnegotiating and discussing on the Democratic side the amendments that \nwill be offered, and yes, there will be amendments offered. Senator \nBoxer has been part of this effort--and I just got off the phone with \nher--and she is now working with her staff to come up with amendments \nshe believes will withstand any procedural challenge on the floor and, \nhopefully, those amendments will be brought up to the floor soon.\n  Senator Cantwell, who is the floor leader on our side on this \nparticular measure, is also open. There is no question that we will be \nprepared to and will offer amendments. We are trying to finalize the \nlanguage at this point and the order in which the amendments will be \noffered.\n  We will be working with the Republicans once we have our own set of \namendments in place. There is no effort to obstruct this process. We \ngenerally agreed that we would not be voting today on amendments. It is \npossible--before the end of the day--that we will have an agreement to \nmove forward in terms of the submission and debate on the amendments \nand the votes to occur perhaps next week. But that is still unresolved, \nand we are still talking about it.\n  What is interesting is to put this in perspective. We are talking \nabout S. 1. This is the very first bill offered by the new Republican \nmajority in the Senate. It is a bill, as they say, to approve the \nKeystone XL Pipeline.\n  The Republicans' highest priority and their No. 1 bill now that they \nhave majority status in the Senate is the approval of a pipeline \nproject to benefit one company--a Canadian company--and create 35 \npermanent jobs. The highest priority of the Republican majority in the \nSenate is to debate and pass a bill to benefit a Canadian company to \ncreate 35 permanent jobs.\n  This special interest, small-ball effort, is not a national economic \nor energy policy or a plan to make America energy independent. The \nKeystone XL Pipeline, sadly, is going to have a negative impact on the \nenvironment--and not just in the United States. It will literally \naffect all adjoining countries.\n  The tar sands that will be carried in this pipeline will increase the \namount of pollution, greenhouse gas emissions--first when they are \nmined in Canada and later when they are refined. We know this because \ntar sands are currently coming into the United States--Canadian tar \nsands--and are being processed at a refinery in Wood River, IL. It is a \nrefinery now owned by the Phillips oil company, and their refined \nproduct is distributed throughout the Midwest.\n  So the Keystone XL Pipeline is not the first Canadian tar sands \npipeline. We already have a pipeline, and that existing pipeline--in \nthe course of cleaning up Canadian tar sands so it can be made into \nproducts that can be sold on the market--generates something called \npetcoke. Petcoke is the waste product--the dirty part of the Canadian \ntar sands--that needs to be removed before they become viable petroleum \nproducts.\n  If you don't believe this petcoke is a danger, you only need to come \nto the great city of Chicago, which I am honored to represent. I \nvisited the southeast side of Chicago. The British Petroleum refinery, \nwhich is at the end of Lake Michigan in the northern part of Indiana, \nrefines the Canadian tar sands and generates, as part of the refining \nprocess, literally hills of petcoke--this black, sooty, nasty product \nthey stack up near the refinery. Unfortunately, many times it ends up \nwithin the boundaries of the city of Chicago.\n  What impact do hills of petcoke have on a neighborhood? When the wind \nblows, this nasty, dirty product blows all over the homes, the \nfamilies, and the children who live in that neighborhood. I have seen \nit. I have visited mothers with small children who try to seal the \nwindows of their homes because this petcoke can get through any crack \nand into their homes, leaving a sooty deposit around them.\n  For those who argue that these Canadian tar sands pose no \nenvironmental threat, come take a look at these petcoke hills that are \ngenerated now by the process of refining this product.\n  Additionally, the Keystone XL Pipeline doesn't move us away from the \ndangerous tipping point which we face when it comes to climate change \nand global warming. In fact, it is going to speed up the day of \nreckoning. Leading scientists warn us that we are running out of time. \nAs a Nation and as a world, if we do not accept the reality of what is \nhappening to our environment, we are going to pay a heavy price.\n  According to the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, at \nleast half of the world's energy supply will need to come from low-\ncarbon sources in the future--wind, solar, even nuclear--by 2050, if we \nare going to avoid catastrophic climate changes. That barely gives us \n35 years to do something for our kids and grandkids. This Keystone bill \ndoes not even acknowledge that reality.\n  I have come to the floor many times and offered the challenge which I \nwill renew today. I believe the Republican Party of the United States \nof America represented in the Senate is the only major political party \nin the world today that denies global warming and climate change. It is \nthe only major political party which refuses to accept the premise that \nis well established in science, well established by our departments, \nsuch as the Department of Defense, that our activity as human beings on \nEarth is changing the world we live in--and not for the better.\n  One Republican pulled me aside off the floor, after I made this \nchallenge several times, and said: Durbin, you are wrong. There is \nactually a political party in Australia that denies global warming as \nwell. Well, that may be true, but the fact that they have such little \ncompany when it comes to this position suggests that our Republicans \nare denying reality. This bill denies that reality as well.\n  If it is about jobs, I suggest--not only to the majority leader but \nto the labor unions and to others interested in creating American \njobs--that there are better alternatives in the energy sector. Solar \npower is already generating 3.4 million jobs in the United States. \nRemember, the Keystone XL Pipeline generates 35 permanent jobs, and, \naccording to some estimates, maybe 40,000 temporary supply jobs for the \nconstruction of the pipeline. The Keystone XL Pipeline will create 35 \npermanent jobs while solar power is generating 3.4 million jobs in \nAmerica. By the end of 2013, 24,000 of them were created just that \nyear. Jobs were created in the solar industry at a growth rate of 20 \npercent over 2012. It is a growth industry for clean, green jobs. In \nIllinois, 9 solar projects employ almost 4,000 workers.\n\n  Solar isn't the only energy source we can invest in. Fuel cell \ntechnology doesn't get much attention but supports 11,000 jobs versus \n35 permanent jobs for the Keystone XL Pipeline. The U.S. Department of \nEnergy estimates that with the rapid increase in fuel cells, 180,000 \nnew domestic jobs can be created by 2020 and 685,000 by 2035.\n  The International Renewable Energy Agency found the renewable energy \nindustry in the United States responsible for 625,000 direct and \nindirect jobs in solar, biofuels, wind, biomass, hydropower, and \ngeothermal industries. That is a conservative estimate. So if we are \ninterested in clean energy, if we want to do the right thing by our \nenvironment for our kids and grandkids and we want to create American \njobs--this isn't 35 jobs, which is the highest priority of the Senate \nRepublican Caucus;\n\n[[Page S161]]\n\nthis is looking at alternative sources of energy, which will create \njobs and not destroy the planet.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline will produce oil with a process that \nproduces 17 percent more carbon than any conventional crude oils. That \noil is going to be shipped, if the Republicans have their way, through \na pipeline from Canada all the way to Texas, over and near thousands of \nlakes and aquifers that Americans rely on for clean drinking water.\n  After it reaches Port Arthur, TX--the original plan, which I think is \nstill the case--it will be exported, so even the refined product is not \ngoing to be used here in America. So we ask our Republican colleagues: \nWhere is your plan to make sure America leads the world in creating \ngood-paying, green jobs for the future? Where is your plan to increase \nAmerica's production of wind, solar, thermonuclear, cellulosic, and \nother forms of renewable energy? In fact, when it came to debating the \nextension of some tax benefits to these industries, many Republicans \nopposed it. They instead wanted to see us move toward initiatives such \nas the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  So this is an important debate, and it is one that we ought to take \nin the context of the challenges our generation faces. We will either \nacknowledge the global environmental reality and deal with it, or we \nwill have to answer to our children and grandchildren why we put the \nprofits of 1 Canadian company and why we put 35 jobs ahead of a \nmeaningful discussion about a national energy policy that is consistent \nwith a clean and strong environment for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/13/senate-section/article/S161-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S161-S162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          IMMIGRATION FUNDING\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this evening I am joining with the Center \nfor American Progress to host a screening of ``Spare Parts,'' a new \nmovie that tells the story of four students at Carl Hayden High School \nin Phoenix, AZ. These students were undocumented immigrants brought to \nthe United States as kids. They started a robotics team at their high \nschool that went on to great success. The movie itself was produced by \nactor and comedian George Lopez. He stars in it as the coach of the \nteam; Jamie Lee Curtis as the high school principal; Carlos Pena, as \nOscar Vazquez, one of the students; and Alexa Vega, as Oscar's \ngirlfriend Karla.\n  I am especially excited about seeing the movie because I have known \none of these students, Oscar Vazquez, for some time. Five years ago, I \ntold Oscar's story here on the floor of the Senate. He dreamed of \nenlisting in the military and spent his high school years in junior \nROTC. At the end of his junior year, a recruiting officer told him he \ncould never serve in the military because he was undocumented. So Oscar \nfound another outlet for his talent. He helped to start the robotics \nclub at Carl Hayden High School.\n  Oscar and his three teammates entered a college-level robot \ncompetition, despite the fact they were high school kids, sponsored by \nNASA. They worked for months in a storage room in their high school to \nproduce their competitive robot. They were competing against students \nfrom MIT and similar universities. The Carl Hayden High School team won \nfirst place in the robotic competition.\n  After high school, Oscar Vazquez went to Arizona State University, \nand in 2009 graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering. He was \none of the top three students in his class. Following his graduation, \nhe took a brave step. He voluntarily returned to Mexico, a country \nwhere he had not lived since he was a small child. He said, ``I decided \nto take a gamble and do the right thing.''\n  In 2010, the Obama administration gave him a waiver to reenter the \nUnited States. Otherwise, he would have been barred for 10 years. He \nwould have been separated from his wife Karla and their daughter \nSamantha, both of whom are American citizens.\n  Oscar returned to the United States with the waiver from President \nObama and he did two things: He applied for citizenship and he enlisted \nin the United States Army.\n  Oscar served as a cavalry scout in Afghanistan, fulfilling the dream \nhe had as a child, and when he became a citizen of this country he was \nobviously willing to risk his life for it.\n  Last year, Oscar testified at a hearing I held about the benefits of \nallowing immigrants to enlist in the military. The Falcon Robotics \nTeam, which Oscar and his friends started, is now a fixture at Carl \nHayden High School.\n  I have told the story about two other members of that team.\n  Dulce Matuz graduated from Arizona State University with a bachelor's \ndegree in electrical engineering and as a senior received an internship \nto work at the NASA space station. After graduation, Dulce couldn't \nwork as an engineer, so she cofounded the Arizona DREAM Act Coalition. \nAs a result of her leadership, she was named one of the 100 most \ninfluential people in the world by Time Magazine.\n  Angelica Hernandez served in junior ROTC and was president of the \nNational Honors Society. She graduated from high school with a 4.5 GPA \nand graduated from Arizona State University with a mechanical \nengineering degree herself.\n  Why am I telling my colleagues about a movie called ``Spare Parts'' \nand the Carl Hayden robotics team? Because it puts a human face on what \nis happening today on Capitol Hill. It puts into perspective what the \nRepublican-led House of Representatives wants to achieve this week. \nThey are preparing to pass a bill in the House that would defund the \nPresident's immigration policies, including the very program--the DACA \nProgram--that President Obama created by Executive order.\n  The DACA Program puts on hold the deportation of immigrant students \nsuch as those I have just described who grew up in this country and \nsimply want a chance to be a part of our future. These young people--\nimmigrants such as Oscar, Dulce, and Angelica--are known as DREAMers. \nThey were brought to the United States as little kids. They didn't make \na conscious effort to come across the border; they were brought here by \ntheir parents. They grew up in this country and they have overcome \ngreat obstacles to succeed. They are our future leaders. They will \nserve in the military. They will be doctors and engineers and lawyers \nand business leaders, if they are given the chance. The House of \nRepresentatives is determined not to give these DREAMers a chance to be \npart of America's future.\n  In the last 2 years, more than 600,000 DREAMers have stepped up, paid \ntheir fees, gone through the background checks, and were given this \ntemporary status where they can't be deported. With that temporary \nstatus, they have gone on to do extraordinary things in this country. \nMany of them are already contributing. I mentioned Angelica, a former \nmember of the Carl Hayden robotics team. She is working for Nexant \nCorporation where she specializes in renewable energy.\n  The Center for American Progress tells us that if we give legal \nstatus to these DREAMers, it will dramatically help our economy. These \nare great young people who want a chance to be a part of America's \nfuture. They can put $329 billion into our economy, according to the \nstudies, and create about 1.4 million new jobs. These are the sparks, \nthe catalysts, the leaders who can help us build this economy.\n  But the Republicans in the House of Representatives want to deport \nthem. They want to turn them away after they have had these educational \nopportunities in America. They don't want us to take advantage of their \nskills and talents. They are wrong.\n  Why do they want to eliminate DACA? Why are the House Republicans so \ndetermined to eliminate it? Because that is their way of getting back \nat this President. That is their way of trying to make us forget that \nthe House Republicans refused for 2 years to call up immigration reform \nlegislation. They refused to fix our broken immigration system, and \nwhen the President stepped in on an emergency basis, now they are \nresisting him and trying to deport these DREAMers. How can they explain \nthis? How can they explain this to these young people who, through no \nfault of their own, were brought to the United States and who have not \nhad an opportunity to succeed, as we all hope they will? This is \nobstructionism on the part of the Republicans in the House. We did pass \nthe bill on a bipartisan basis in June of 2013, 68 to 32, for \ncomprehensive immigration reform. The House had ample opportunity--over \na year and a half--to\n\n[[Page S162]]\n\ncall up this measure and they refused. They refused because they knew \nit would pass. And that is why it is important for us to stand up and \ntell the American people what is at stake.\n  One of the most important things we can do is to face the reality \nthat our immigration system is broken. And to fix this immigration \nsystem, we need to work together on a bipartisan basis. Let us not do \nit with a negative feeling toward these young people. Give the DREAMers \na chance.\n  I will tell my colleagues this. If this bill comes over from the \nHouse of Representatives and this bill eliminates DACA, fate puts 1.6 \nmillion young DREAMers into the legal jeopardy of facing deportation, \nand then eliminates the rights of their parents who have children who \nare citizens or legal residents to stay in this country, then we are \ngoing to see a fight on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I think it is the \nresponsible thing to do for us to stand up for these young people who \nhad the courage to step out of the shadows, to register with their \ngovernment, to submit themselves to a background check. The right and \nresponsible thing to do is for us to stand behind them. There are so \nmany amazing stories about these young people and to ignore them is to \nignore America's legacy and roots.\n  We are a nation of immigrants. My mother was an immigrant to this \ncountry and I stand on the floor of the U.S. Senate honorably, I hope, \nrepresenting the great State of Illinois, and really I hope a testament \nto what the sons of immigrants can do across America, and daughters as \nwell. That is why this is an important issue for us to deal with and to \ndo it forthrightly, and I urge my colleagues to resist this effort by \nthe Republicans to deport 1.6 million eligible DREAMers and others who \nmay stand the chance to make America a better and stronger nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/13/senate-section/article/S162-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 12:30 p.m. will be equally divided between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \nan hour to discuss the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I wish to address my comments to the \nKeystone XL Pipeline approval bill--the legislation currently before \nthe Senate--which is the motion to proceed to this legislation. The \ncloture on the motion to proceed to this legislation was passed 63 \nvotes in favor to 32 votes against last night. I thank my colleagues \nfor that tremendous bipartisan vote, and of course the good news is \nthat the vote advances us to the bill. We have to have another vote now \nto actually move to the bill today, and we are working through an \nagreement to hold that vote. Then we will be on the bill and in a \nposition where all Members of this body can offer amendments--\nRepublicans and Democrats alike.\n  We will have an open amendment process. We will have regular order. \nWe can have an energy debate. Members of this body are going to get to \ndo what they haven't been able to do in some time, which is offer their \namendments, bring forward their ideas, and let's have that energy \ndiscussion, let's have these amendments brought forward and debated, \nand if they can garner 60 votes, they will be passed and attached to \nthe legislation. This is how the Senate is supposed to work and I \nencourage my colleagues to participate by offering their amendments to \nhave the debate and do the work of this body--the important work for \nthe people of this great Nation.\n  I would like to begin the discussion today in support of the Keystone \nXL Pipeline, the Keystone XL approval legislation, which is the bill we \nhave in front of us, S. 1.\n  I note that my esteemed colleague, the senior Senator from Utah, is \nhere. He is a Senator who leads us on a variety of issues and has for \nmany years in our caucus, as the chairman of the Finance Committee. He \ncertainly understands tax policy and fiscal policy for this country.\n  This legislation we are considering is a jobs bill. It is about \nenergy. It is about jobs. It is about economic growth. It is about \nnational security.\n  The Senator from Utah is working on reforming our Tax Code and how we \ncan stimulate economic growth in this country. So I wish to turn to him \nright at the outset and ask--as someone who truly understands how our \neconomy works and how we have to build a good business climate in this \ncountry and how we have to empower the development of infrastructure, \nroads, and rails, pipelines and transmission lines as part of building \nan energy policy that will truly make this Nation energy secure--if he \nwould take a few minutes and address not only this project on the broad \nbasis of its merits, but particularly some of the economic aspects that \nare so important when we are talking about growing our economy and \nputting our people in this country to work in good jobs.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to thank my distinguished colleague \nfor leading this fight. He has been leading it for years now. It is \nsuch a no-brainer. It is amazing to me that we have to go through this \nagain. I thank him for yielding to me, and I would like to associate \nmyself with the many persuasive arguments that have been made here by \nmy colleagues--both Democratic and Republican--urging the speedy \npassage of this legislation.\n  To me, the decision to approve this pipeline is an obvious one for a \nhost of reasons:\n  It will support more than 42,000 good-paying jobs. I didn't quite get \nwhat the assistant minority leader was saying today on how few jobs it \nwill create. It actually will support more than 42,000 good-paying jobs \nduring its construction phase.\n  It will contribute more than $3.4 billion to our gross domestic \nproduct.\n  It will aid in the goal of North American energy independence.\n  As the State Department's environmental impact statement found, \nbuilding the Keystone XL Pipeline will actually be better for the \nenvironment than not building it. The energy resources the Canadians \nproduce will reach the market regardless of whether this pipeline is \nbuilt, and Keystone XL is by far the safest, cleanest, and most \nefficient means of doing so. What are the arguments against it other \nthan phony environmental arguments? That was the State Department, \ncontrolled by them.\n  As a commonsense, bipartisan jobs and infrastructure measure, this \nbill is exactly the sort of legislation the Senate should be \nconsidering as its first order of business in this new Congress, but it \nshould not have to be. The story here is about more than a single \npipeline, no matter how many jobs its construction will create, no \nmatter how important it is for our energy independence, and no matter \nhow environmentally sound it is. This is a story about a regulatory \nprocess that is clearly broken. This is a story about special interests \nmanipulating the bureaucracy to muck up a process that should be very \nsimple and uncontroversial. This is a story about just one of many \nexamples of tragically missed opportunities to create good-paying jobs \nand provide relief for household budgets across the country.\n  The application for approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline was first \nfiled in September of 2008--more than 6 years ago. U.S. Senators have \nserved more than a full term during that time. Children born after the \napplication was filed are now in first grade.\n  The notion that any infrastructure project should be held up for such \na long period is disturbing not just to me but I think to anybody who \ncarefully\n\n[[Page S163]]\n\nlooks at this, but the delay of Keystone XL is even worse. Given the \nstrong and well-documented economic and environmental case for the \npipeline, Keystone is the sort of project that should have been quickly \nand easily approved for construction. But for some committed \nenvironmentalists inside and outside the Obama administration, common \nsense and balanced consideration of the facts no longer matter. \nInstead, to them, this simple pipeline has become a political symbol, \nregardless of what the science tells us. They have directed their ample \nenergies at throwing up every procedural roadblock imaginable to the \napproval of the pipeline. As a result, this project has endured delay \nafter delay.\n  Over the past few years, the American people have rightly developed \nthe impression that Washington is broken. There can be no better \nexample of the consequence of this dysfunction than the Keystone XL \nPipeline sitting in bureaucratic purgatory.\n  When a project such as this--which is good for jobs, good for \nfamilies, and good for families' budgets--gets bogged down in the Obama \nadministration's redtape, it is absolutely the responsibility of \nCongress to act. Unfortunately, for years the Senate became a place \nwhere good ideas such as approving Keystone XL came to die, where \ncontrol of the calendar and the amendment process prevented the \nconsideration of so many good, bipartisan issues and ideas. Not only \nwas the administrative process broken, but the Senate was also \nparalyzed and unable to step in and fix it.\n  By taking up this important bill as our first matter of consideration \nin the new Congress, we are taking steps to restore the Senate to the \ngreat legislative body it is meant to be, the place where Senators work \nacross the aisle to meet the needs of the American people.\n  By coming together to propose a commonsense solution to get back on \ntrack this project which has become such a symbol of what is wrong with \nWashington, my friends from North Dakota and West Virginia are \ndemonstrating exactly the sort of thoughtful, inclusive, and bipartisan \nleadership the American people have been demanding as they watched this \ngreatest deliberative body in the world become the laughingstock of the \nworld because we haven't gotten very much done. We haven't gotten very \nmuch done because of the way it has been run over the last number of \nyears.\n  It is my sincere hope that we move quickly and desperately and \ndeliberately to approve this measure and that we soon begin considering \nserious regulatory reform to prevent the sorts of abuses we have seen \nbedevil the Keystone XL project. The American people deserve an \nefficient and effective regulatory process that works for them. It is \ntime for the Senate to deliver.\n  Having said these few words, I wish to personally thank my \ndistinguished colleagues from North Dakota and my colleagues from West \nVirginia for the leadership they have provided on this issue.\n  Senator Hoeven is a former Governor. He knows what he is talking \nabout. He is one of the most reasonable, decent, and honorable people \nin this body. He has shown a great willingness to work with both sides. \nHe has continued to fight for this even though it has been uphill for \nmore than 6 years. He has continued to fight for it because it is \nright. It is the right thing to do, and it is in our best interest to \ndo it and to do it now.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I wish to thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah for his leadership both today and over the past many years on \nthis floor. I would like to pick up on a point he emphasized and did so \nvery eloquently. He is in a unique position to comment on it, and that \nis the importance of having this open amendment process; having regular \norder on the Senate floor; allowing Senators, Republican and Democratic \nalike, to come forward and bring their ideas forward, bring their \namendments forward, have this discussion, and do it in an open way.\n  The whole effort here is to produce good energy legislation that will \nhelp this country move forward but also to foster bipartisanship--to \nfoster bipartisanship on this bill and other legislation so that we can \nget the work done that this body needs to get done on behalf of the \nAmerican people. That is what this is all about. This is about getting \nthe work done for the American people on the important issues our \ncountry faces.\n  That is why this bill is S. 1--not just because it is important \nenergy infrastructure legislation, not just because we need to have \nthis debate on energy, not just because we need to advance legislation \nto help build our energy future, but because it is truly an effort to \nget this body working in a bipartisan way on this and other important \nissues for the American people. That is what the American people want. \nThey want us to get the job done.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Utah for bringing out the important \nfact and discussing why it is so important that we approach legislation \nin that way.\n  I would like to turn to my good friend, the senior Senator from the \ngreat State of Arkansas, somebody who I think really has a good \nunderstanding of how our economy works and what needs to be done, \nsomebody who has good relationships on both sides of the aisle, which \nis so important as we try to build support for this and other \nlegislation, and somebody whose State is directly affected by this \nproject. I know he will agree with me that it is very important on \nbehalf of the State of Arkansas that we move forward with the Keystone \nXL Pipeline project. I think a very high percentage of the pipe that \ngoes into this project--about a 1,200-mile-long project--is actually \nmanufactured and made in Arkansas. So that is a clear benefit for the \nmanufacturing industry and workers in the State of Arkansas that \ncorrelates directly to this project and to this legislation.\n  So I would like to turn to the senior Senator from Arkansas and ask \nhim about that and ask him to tell us about the importance of this \nproject in terms of what it means to the great State of Arkansas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to talk about \nthe Keystone Pipeline. I also wish to thank the Senator from North \nDakota for his tireless efforts and his leadership on behalf of getting \nthe Keystone Pipeline project moving.\n  For the past 6 years I have urged the administration to approve the \nproject. I voted for legislation to speed up the pipeline construction. \nThis pipeline makes sense for job creation and the future of our \nNation's energy supply.\n  In a recent email survey sent to more than 30,000 Arkansans, I asked \nwhat issues the new majority in the Senate should focus on in the 114th \nCongress. Participants told me that one of their top priorities is an \n``all of the above'' energy policy that addresses current and future \nenergy needs.\n  The Senate has an opportunity to pass legislation that is a \ncommonsense plan to improve our Nation's energy supply by approving the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. Tapping into these Canadian oil sands will offer \nus a reliable source of energy from one of our strongest allies and \ntrading partners. This is good news as we work to reduce our dependence \non oil from regions of the world that are hostile toward our country, \nand it is good news for Arkansas. Here is why.\n  Approval of this infrastructure project will mean jobs. This is one \nreason it has the support of both parties. Organized labor has been \nvery vocal in support of the pipeline. Unions understand that this \ninfrastructure project will create well-paying jobs for skilled \nlaborers, and it will do so at no expense to the taxpayers. And it is \nnot just unions; certainly businesses are supportive of the pipeline \ntoo, as well as an overwhelming majority of Americans.\n  Last month, as the Senator from North Dakota alluded to, I toured the \nWelspun Tubular Company, the Little Rock-based company hired to produce \nhundreds of miles of pipeline for the project. Company officers \nestimate that 150 jobs will be created just to load the pipe onto the \nrailcars for shipment when the project finally gets the green light.\n  The economic impact has wide reach to Arkansans. Blytheville's Nucor \nCorporation was slated to make some of\n\n[[Page S164]]\n\nthe steel for the pipeline, and there is a trickle-down impact \nthroughout the State.\n  A central Arkansas Caterpillar employee wrote to me about the \nimportance of this project to his job because of its impact on his \nlivelihood. ``The Keystone pipeline project would be a huge boost to \nus,'' he wrote.\n  Once built, the infrastructure will provide a safe and reliable \nsupply of energy. Currently, this oil is transported from Canada to \nrefiners by rail and truck. A new, modern pipeline poses less risk to \nthe environment than these current modes of transportation. The project \nwill help maintain lower fuel prices, which is good for all Americans.\n  At every hurdle, using science and common sense, this project gets \nthe green light. Last week Nebraska's Supreme Court upheld the State's \nlaw approving a route for the pipeline through the State.\n  Time and again this project passes the test, but the President has \nthreatened to veto the bill. This isn't surprising considering the \nadministration spent more than 6 years analyzing this and punting a \ndecision down the road until further studies have been conducted. The \npipeline is being studied literally to death. It is ready to go. Yet \nthe President is still looking for ways to stop it.\n  The American people deserve this affordable energy. They deserve \nwell-paying jobs. Both can be accomplished by building the Keystone \nPipeline.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his tireless efforts \nin the past 6 years trying to get this project off the ground. The good \nnews is I think we have made real progress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nArkansas and once again point out this is another State that will \nbenefit from this project. This is a State far removed from the route \nof the project. As I pointed out in earlier debate on this floor, all \nof the States on the route, from Montana to Texas, have approved the \nproject--all of them. They have all approved it. The only entity still \nholding up the approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline is the Federal \nGovernment, the Obama administration.\n  All of the States have approved it. Those States on the route will \nrealize tremendous benefits from the construction--from the \nconstruction jobs, from the hundreds of millions of dollars they will \nreceive in tax revenues, payment in lieu of taxes at the State and \nlocal level. They will receive tremendous benefit from this project, \nnot to mention of course the benefit the whole country receives as we \nbecome more energy independent by working with Canada to truly achieve \nNorth American energy security.\n  But here is a State, Arkansas, far removed from the route of the \npipeline. I do not think the oil will--I do not know about refineries \nin Arkansas. I do not think there are refineries there that it will go \nto. It will go to refineries in States such as Louisiana and Texas and \nso forth.\n  But even still, Arkansas will benefit directly from this project \nbecause they manufacture much of the pipe that goes into the project. \nThose are good manufacturing jobs that not only benefit those workers, \nbut then you have the secondary impacts. Once again I thank the Senator \nfrom Arkansas for coming down to the floor and taking a few minutes to \npoint that out.\n  We will continue over the next several weeks to talk about the \nbenefits in other States as well. I thank the good Senator from \nArkansas at this time. Even though I have floor time reserved until \nabout 11:15 or a little more, I would like to actually stop and allow \nthe Senator from Washington to talk about her views on it. I know she \nis not--of course, I work with her on the energy committee. She is our \nranking member. I enjoy and appreciate working with her, but I \nunderstand she shares different views in this case.\n  I ask unanimous consent that her time for the next 10 to 15 minutes, \nas she needs, not be counted against my time. I would be willing to \ndefer so she can speak at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I know we are \ngoing to be going back and forth on this issue and that we have other \npeople coming. Later this morning we are going to have time divided. \nBut I appreciate the Senator from North Dakota allowing us to join in \nthe debate this morning and make a few points.\n  I do want to say I appreciate the hard work of the Senator from North \nDakota on the energy committee in general. I look forward to working \nwith him on many energy policies. He and I have worked together on a \ncouple of different agricultural issues. I certainly appreciate his due \ndiligence, but needless to say I do not agree with the process of \nmoving forward with this motion to proceed to the Keystone XL Pipeline \nbill.\n  Many of my colleagues are going to be coming down and talking about \nthe issues. Two of my colleagues, including the Senators from Utah and \nArkansas, along with the Senator from North Dakota, brought up a couple \nof different points. But in my mind, they are talking about a 19th \ncentury energy policy and fossil fuel instead of us focusing on what \nshould be a 21st century energy policy for our country.\n  It is unfortunate that S. 1 is a very narrow, specific, special \ninterest measure for a pipeline that did not go through the proper \nchannels of a permitting process and because of that is flawed. As \npeople are heralding it as the new Congress.\n  This process continues today with people saying: Let's just give it \nmore special interest attention and approve it. I believe America \nshould be a leader in energy policy and that our job creation is \ndependent upon that energy policy for the future. We want to see \nAmerica be a leader in this. I applaud the fact that the President \nreached a climate and clean energy agreement with China.\n  We are over 60 percent of the world's energy consumption. If the two \ncountries can work together on a clean energy strategy, I guarantee \nthat will be good business for the U.S. economy. In fact, I read a \nstatistic that something like 50 percent of all energy is going to be \nconsumed by the buildings in China--there is huge growth in building \ndevelopment, but they do not have good building standards so those \nbuildings consume too much energy. So there is a lot to do on energy \nefficiency that will grow U.S. jobs and help us. That is why we would \nrather see us focusing on some of the energy policies that we did in \n2005 and 2007. Those things unleash huge opportunities for American \njobs and huge opportunities for American consumers to get a better deal \nand not be subject to price spikes.\n\n  The 2007 bill had fuel efficiency standards in it and laid the \nfoundation for the growth of the hybrid electric car industry and has \nadded over 263,000 jobs in the last 5 years. That is the kind of smart \npolicy we should be pursuing. We also have had energy bills that made \ninvestments in clean energy tax credits, something I was just talking \nabout with my colleague from Utah, saying we needed to move forward on \nenergy tax credits. If there is nothing else that we should be doing, \nwe should be doing that as S. 1, because the predictability and \ncertainty we would be giving to that industry would certainly unleash \nmany jobs.\n  So the 2005 and 2007 energy bills that we did in a bipartisan fashion \nhelped foster an energy-efficient economy and helped support 450,000 \njobs according to a 2011 Brookings Institution report.\n  These are examples of the types of things we have done in the past \nthat have unleashed investment, and have grown jobs in the United \nStates of America. They are important milestones in the type of clarity \nCongress can give to the private sector to spur growth and development. \nI can guarantee this is the opposite of that. This is about a special \ninterest deal and overriding a process, including the White House \nprocess and local government process, that is so essential.\n  Two examples of what we should be doing instead: As I said, the \nenergy tax credits which have been delayed. As my colleagues from \nOregon pointed out at the end of last year, we basically authorized \nthem for about 2 more weeks in December. That was about all the \ncertainty we gave the industry. A McKinsey report has estimated that \nproviding the right incentives for retrofitting buildings and energy \nefficiency would help employ 900,000 people over the next decade; that \nthe wind energy tax credit would employ 54,000\n\n[[Page S165]]\n\npeople, and there are other issues about modernizing our grid and new \ntechnology storage.\n  There is also very important work to be done in the manufacturing \nsector; that is, to help unleash innovation by making sure we set \nstandards on improving efficiency and focusing on lightweight materials \nfor both automobiles and aviation. We have seen huge job growth in the \nPacific Northwest because we were able to transform aerospace into \nlighter weight materials. We are also working on a biojet fuel.\n  So all of these things mean we have to get the R right, we have to \nget the tax credits right, and we need to help protect consumers from \nspiking energy prices. This is the evolution. I do not think anybody in \nAmerica thinks we are going to hold on to a 19th century fossil fuel \neconomy forever. The question is, Whether Congress is going to spend \nits time moving forward on a 21st century plan that gives the \npredictability and certainty to unleash that leadership and capture the \nopportunities in developing markets around the globe or whether we are \ngoing to hold on to the last elements of fossil fuel forever and leave \nour constituents more at risk.\n  But I would like to take a few minutes and talk about this process my \ncolleagues are trying to describe as to why we need to hurry. Because I \ncan guarantee that is what people have been trying to do all along, \nhurry this along for a special interest. I do not believe that is good \nfor the American people. I do not think it is good for this process.\n  If we think about where we have been, this process is about people \nwho are trying to push a route through no matter what the \ncircumstances. Every State, people are saying, has approved this \nprocess. I can guarantee there are a lot of people in Nebraska and a \nlot of people in South Dakota who do not agree with that. They are very \nconcerned about the public interest.\n  Unfortunately, in the case of the Keystone XL project, landowners and \nranchers in Nebraska affected by the pipeline did not feel they were \nafforded equal opportunity before the law. In their view the process \nwas set up to benefit a special interest, the TransCanada Corporation. \nOn three separate occasions, beginning in 2011, the Nebraska \nLegislature passed carve-outs to circumvent the role of the public \nservice commission to approve the Keystone Pipeline.\n  If this was such a great deal, why can't it go through the normal \nprocess, as in every other State, with a transportation and utilities \ncommission ruling on siting? Why do we have to take the public interest \nout of it? The first carve-out included the Major Oil Pipeline Siting \nAct of 2011. So this bill laid out the rule that the public service \ncommission determined whether a new pipeline project was in the public \ninterest. In making this decision, the legislature required that the \ncommission consider eight criteria.\n  Among them: the environmental impact of water and wildlife and \nvegetation, the economic and social impact, the alternative route, the \nimpact to future development in the pipeline's proposal, and the views \nof counties and cities. OK. That all sounds great, right? That is what \nthe legislature says they should be considering. But the legislature \nalso required the commission to hold public hearings and have public \ncomment--OK, we are still on the right track--and importantly required \nthe commission to establish a process for appealing the decision, so \nthat any aggrieved party could have due process rights under the \nAdministrative Procedures Act.\n  Here is the punch line. Tucked away in that Nebraska legislation was \na special interest carve-out that exempted TransCanada--Keystone XL--\nfrom having to comply with the public service commission process. \nSpecifically, the legislation stated, ``. . . shall not apply to any \nmajor oil pipeline that has submitted an application to the US \nDepartment of State pursuant to Executive Order 13337 prior to the \neffective date of this act.''\n  There was only one company that qualified for this special interest \nexemption at the time of that legislation; that was TransCanada. So you \ngot it. The legislature basically exempted them from that process, even \nthough they were stating that these are the processes that you should \ngo through. So at the very time the legislature created new rules for \ndue process on the pipeline, it exempted them from those rules. I do \nnot understand why TransCanada cannot play by the rules, but I \nguarantee you Congress does not have to join in and make S. 1 a special \ninterest bill. They should make sure everyone plays by the rules.\n  In this same legislative session, the Nebraska legislature also \npassed the Oil Pipeline Route Certification Act. This bill provided \nKeystone XL with an expedited review process by the Nebraska Department \nof Environmental Quality and gave the sole authority to approve the \nproject to the Governor. Unfortunately, for the legislature and for \nTransCanada, these carve-outs quickly became irrelevant because \nPresident Obama denied the application in 2012. That is in part due to \nthe fact that Congress had decided to try to intervene in the matter. \nThat is when Congress said this is important and we should go ahead and \ndo this.\n  I am going to get into more detail on that in a second. This is \nimportant to understand because the initial Nebraska legislation was so \nnarrowly tailored, it was designed to benefit the TransCanada pipeline \nand its pending date of enactment. What happened next? The legislature \nwent back to the drawing board and created a third new special carve-\nout for the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  The day following the President's denial of TransCanada's \napplication, a new bill was introduced in the Nebraska Legislature. \nThis bill was yet another path around the existing due process afforded \nto citizens in that State. The legislation allowed the company to \nchoose whether to go through a formal process with the public service \ncommission or seek expedited review with the Governor. I am sure a lot \nof U.S. companies would love to have that opportunity.\n  These are U.S. companies that have to pay lawyers, go through \nenvironmental processes, make sure all of the issues are addressed. I \nam sure American companies would love to know any day of the week they \ncan just go past a utility commission and get the Governor to stamp \n``approved'' on their project. Under this expedited approach, the \nlegislature authorized the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality \nto independently conduct an environmental impact report. However, \nunlike due process required by the public service commission, this \nprocess required only token outreach to the public.\n  There was just one public hearing in 2012. This special process \nprovided no recourse for aggrieved parties. There was no formal appeals \nprocess. Other than the courts, there was no administrative process \nwith the ability for stakeholders to challenge the facts as a matter of \nrecord to base their formal appeal on. These are fundamental \ndifferences between an expedited consideration within the Governor's \noffice and a process requiring a public interest determination by \nrelevant decisionmakers at a commission.\n  I know my colleagues here would like to argue that somehow this has \nbeen a long, drawn-out process. This has really been a process by one \ncompany constantly circumventing the rules on the books and trying to \nget a special deal for approval. We have to ask ourselves why. Why do \nthey want to proceed this way?\n  I know my colleagues always like to talk about their neighbors. My \nneighbors in British Columbia are not so thrilled about tar sands \npipeline activity. They are not interested in it. So maybe that is why \nTransCanada wants to hurry and get this process through in the United \nStates.\n  I ask my colleagues, do you have confidence the public interest was \nreally taken into consideration--that you run over the interests of \nprivate property owners on these issues? Was the department of \nenvironmental quality evaluation comprehensive?\n  I can say one Nebraska landowner described the report as ``an \nincomplete evaluation of a natural resource with the magnitude of the \nOgallala Aquifer, and now it is left in the hands of TransCanada to do \ntheir own policing.''\n  Another family, who has been ranching for more than five generations \nin Nebraska, said the process left landowners with nowhere to turn with \ntheir concerns of erosion, water contamination or eminent domain.\n\n[[Page S166]]\n\n  Another landowner had this to say about circumventing the process in \nNebraska:\n\n       I feel it is not in the best interest of Nebraska, nor the \n     citizens of Nebraska, to have our legislators crafting \n     special legislation to meet the specific demands of an \n     individual corporation.\n\n  I couldn't agree with them more. That is exactly what we are trying \nto do today.\n  The same stakeholders in Nebraska have also questioned the appearance \nof conflict of interest associated with the Nebraska Department of \nEnvironmental Quality report since it was prepared by a contractor who \nalso worked for TransCanada and Exxon on different joint pipeline \nprojects.\n  Meanwhile, a majority of the State Supreme Court, 4 out of 7 \njustices, just last week ruled that the legislature and the Governor's \nactions were unconstitutional.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator has consumed 15 \nminutes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent that I be given an additional 2 \nminutes to wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. My colleague has already given me some time this \nmorning--and I can certainly come back and add more to the debate--but \nwhat I am outlining is exactly how this process has circumvented the \nlaws of this land. One more action by this body is exactly what this \nspecial interest company is seeking.\n  If Congress had succeeded in pushing the President of the United \nStates into agreeing to the original route through Nebraska in 2011, \nthe route would have been right through the Ogallala Aquifer. Even \nTransCanada had already agreed that it needed to change the route. I \ndon't know why we are being asked to push something through when we \nreally should allow the State Department to do its job.\n  I will have much more to say on this process of the circumventing of \npublic interest; about the devastating spill in the Kalamazoo River, \nand the fact that we don't know all we need to know about tar sands \ncleanup in water; and the fact that Midwest gasoline prices could be \naffected if this pipeline is approved.\n  There are many issues. So I will gladly debate this with my \ncolleagues throughout the rest of this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I wish to resume my time for the colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I will take a couple of minutes to respond to the points \nthat my colleague on the energy committee just brought up with regard \nto both the process and also in regard to the timeline for approval of \nthis project. Then I will turn to my cosponsor, the Senator from West \nVirginia, and get some of his input on the project.\n  Now we are starting to get into the kind of debate that we have \nwanted from day one. I had the good fortune to serve as Governor of my \ngreat State of North Dakota, and the good Senator on the floor with me \nfrom West Virginia was Governor at the same time of his State of West \nVirginia. We worked together many times on issues. I am a Republican, \nand he is a Democrat. We found common ground as Governors, and we found \ncommon ground in the Senate.\n  This is what this is all about. This is what we want to have happen \namong our colleagues so we can get this and other important legislation \naddressed, passed, and help our country.\n  But before I turn to my colleague from West Virginia, I wish to touch \nbriefly on a couple of points that the ranking member of our energy \ncommittee brought up a moment ago. As she said, she opposes the \nproject. I understand and respect her views, but she talked about the \nlength of time the approval process takes.\n  What I have to point out is that we have been in this approval \nprocess now for more than 6 years. So when she talks about needing more \ntime to get the project approved, it is hard to understand how we are \ngoing to have a working, functioning economy, how we are going to get \nthe private sector to invest the billions of dollars it takes. This \nproject alone is the largest shovel-ready project that is ready to go--\njust under $8 billion, $7.9 billion--and it has been held up for more \nthan 6 years.\n  America got into World War II and won the war in less than 6 years. \nBuilding the Hoover Dam, I believe, took less than 6 years. If we are \ngoing to create the kind of environment where we stimulate investment \nby the private sector, get our economy growing and growing and get \npeople back to work, we can't hold private investment up.\n  Remember, not one penny of Federal spending--almost $8 billion, \nalmost all private investment that will help create jobs, help grow our \neconomy, create hundreds of millions in tax revenue, help us to build \nour energy future, help us with national security by being energy \nsecure--all those things--and the Federal Government has held them up \nfor more than 6 years.\n  How can we argue that there is any process there that works in any \nkind of a realistic or commonsense way when it has been up for more \nthan 6 years.\n  Specifically--as regards the State of Nebraska--in 2012 I put forward \nlegislation which we passed in this body attached to the payroll tax \nholiday that required the President to make a decision.\n  We didn't tell them what decision to make. We just said: Hey, you \nhave to make a decision. At that point the project had been under \nreview for 4 years--long enough, Mr. President, to make a national \ninterest determination. That is what the legislation said that we \nattached to the payroll tax holiday. It passed with 73 votes.\n  The President at that time said: No, I am not going to make a \ndecision on the project now because of what he perceived to be the \nproblem with the route in Nebraska.\n  Remember, this project goes through States from Montana to Texas. \nHere it is. Remember, it is not carrying only Canadian crude. It \ncarries crude from my State of North Dakota and the State of Montana. \nLight, sweet Bakken crude goes into this pipeline as well.\n  Everyone talks about the Canadian crude, but they forget that this \nmoves domestic crude as well. My State alone produces 1.2 million \nbarrels of oil a day, and we are moving 700,000 of barrels a day on \ntrains because we can't get enough pipelines. Here we want to put \n100,000 barrels a day into this pipeline, and we have been waiting for \n6 years putting more and more oil on rail cars, congestion on the \nrails. We can't move our agriculture products, and we have been held up \nfor 6 years. But in 2012 we passed that bill.\n  This body passed it, then the House, and it went to the President. \nThen he turned it down because he said the routing wasn't right in \nNebraska. There is an objection here. Here we see the pipeline goes \nthrough Nebraska.\n  He said: No, I am not going to approve it at this point because they \nhave to square it away in Nebraska.\n  In Nebraska, the State legislature, the elected body of the people, \nwent to work with Governor Dave Heineman, a good friend of mine, and \nthe Senator from West Virginia as well. We served with Governor Dave \nHeineman.\n  The elected body of the people, the legislature, went to work with \nthe Governor. They went through a long process. They rerouted the \npipeline to address any concerns regarding the Ogallala Aquifer and any \nother concerns that had been brought--a long laborious process--and \napproved it.\n  Every State on the route has approved the project. They have all \napproved it. They have had 6 years to do it. So it wasn't like they had \nto hurry, but they all approved it. Yet the Federal Government \ncontinues to hold it up and say: Oh, well, we have concerns.\n  Now, my esteemed colleague from Washington, who opposes the project, \nsaid that she was concerned about the supreme court decision.\n  Well, remember, the supreme court decision came up because after the \nState of Nebraska approved the project, then opponents challenged it, \nforced it into court, and it went to the Nebraska Supreme Court. The \nNebraska Supreme Court found in favor of the Governor and the \nlegislature for the State of Nebraska. They found in favor of the \nroute, and the State of Nebraska said that is as it should be--OK.\n  So that is all that was covered at great length by the elected \nrepresentatives of the State of Nebraska and the Nebraska Supreme \nCourt. I mean, how much more does this take? Furthermore, there is the \npoint that my colleague was making: Well, if we had\n\n[[Page S167]]\n\nrushed, somehow this would have been a problem.\n  We put it in the legislation in section 2, under the private property \nsavings clause, to make sure that if there is any issue such as that it \nis addressed in this legislation. So the very concern that she has \nraised is in the legislation.\n  The reason it is in there is because the good Senator from Montana--\nwhich is also on the route--Mr. Tester, wanted this provision in the \nbill. He is also a Democrat. In showing the bipartisanship of the bill, \nhe said: Well, let's make sure we take care of that. So we put language \nin the bill to make sure that the language we just addressed on the \nfloor is addressed. It is very short, and I will read it--section 2, \nsubsection (e):\n\n       Private Property Savings Clause.--Nothing in this Act \n     alters any Federal, State, or local process or condition in \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act that is necessary \n     to secure access from an owner of private property to \n     construct the pipeline and cross-border facilities described \n     in section (a).\n\n  So we tried to make sure--and furthermore--let me also read judicial \nreview. That section is long, and I won't read it. But we also provided \nfor judicial review so that if any of those issues are a concern--in \naddition to the language we put in to protect States rights--you also \nhave judicial review. I don't know how much more we can do to make sure \nany and all concerns she just raised in regard to the process of the \nindividual States is protected.\n\n  Again, I make the case today that we have all gone through great \nlengths to approve the project. The only entity blocking it now after \nmore than 6 years is the Federal Government.\n  There is one other point I would make briefly before turning to the \nSenator from West Virginia. The good Senator from Washington talked \nabout alternative energy sources, renewable energy sources, other \nenergy resources, and how we need to develop them. They create jobs, \nand that is great.\n  This is a note on which I will turn to my cosponsor, the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia. We are for ``all of the \nabove'' energy approach, but we have to get over the idea that somehow \nthey are mutually exclusive. We go forward and build important \ninfrastructure so that we can make sure that we don't have to import \noil from OPEC or from countries such as Venezuela or from other parts \nof the world, to ensure that we can be secure in energy and that we can \nproduce as much or more oil than we consume--both domestic oil \nproduction and in Canada. We need the infrastructure.\n  But that in no way precludes the development of any other sources of \nenergy. They are not mutually exclusive. So to say that we should be \ndoing one and not the other--how does that make sense? Let's do them \nboth.\n  On that note, I turn to my colleague. Ask anybody in this body, \nparticularly those coming to the Senate as a former Governor. He is \nsomebody who not only is very bipartisan in his approach to all of \nthese issues, somebody who has not only advocated for producing all of \nthe above in terms of energy, but somebody who has done it in his time \nas Governor.\n  So I turn to my colleague and say: Can't we do both? Isn't approving \nthis part of doing it all?\n  Mr. MANCHIN. First, I thank the Senator from North Dakota, my friend, \nfor taking the lead and working with me so closely. I am very excited \nabout the process, the open amendment process.\n  We are learning a lot in debates, a lot of good ideas are coming out \nof this. When all is said and done, we will have a better piece of \nlegislation. That is what this is all about.\n  Let me make sure everyone understands this is not all about \npipelines. If this is about an XL pipeline or any other pipeline, we \nwouldn't have a hundred thousand miles of pipeline in America already. \nSince the Industrial Revolution we would not have built all the \npipelines needed to carry the energy that we need to run this country. \nThis is not about pipeline.\n  This is about the concerns we all have with greenhouse gas emissions \nand the development of the oil sands in Canada--nothing to do with the \npipeline.\n  With that being said. We have to be very clear that Canada is going \nto develop the oil sands whether or not the Keystone pipeline is built. \nThat is a fact, and we have talked about this.\n  The State Department--our own State Department in this great country \nof ours, the United States of America--has conducted five environmental \nassessments of the Keystone Pipeline and have found in all of them that \nthe project will not have a significant impact on the environment. Now \nthese are the things we have to be cognizant of.\n\n  The State Department also found the pipeline is unlikely to \nsignificantly affect the rate of extraction in Canadian oil \ndevelopment. That means whatever we do here is not going to change the \nrate of development in the oil sands.\n  The State Department also examined alternatives to the proposed XL \nPipeline. These alternatives included what would happen if no action \nwere taken at all. Let's say we do nothing here; that nothing comes \nabout with this pipeline. Likely, the crude would be shipped westward \nby rail or by tanker. That is happening today. So they are going to \nship it anyway. And if that continued, it would be considered no \naction. If we take no action here and don't build this pipeline for \nwhatever reason, the greenhouse gas emissions--which we are all \nconcerned about, and our debates are about that, really--will be \nbetween 28 to 42 percent higher if we do nothing.\n  So those people who are concerned about greenhouse gas emissions \nshould say: Well, OK, why do we want to contribute to more? The \npipeline decreases that. If we don't do it, we have 28 to 42 percent \nmore emissions by how we will move this oil. So the pipeline addresses \nour energy security limits, and I have talked about that before, and \nour dependence on foreign oil.\n  I have said this many times. We all are entitled to our opinions, and \nI think we are all going to hear all those opinions in the next couple \nof weeks. But what we are not entitled to is our own set of facts, \nbecause the facts are what they are. I have said this before, and I \nwill repeat it again, and I will continue to repeat: We buy, as of the \n2013 figures from the Department of Energy's EIA, we--the United States \nof America--buy 7 million barrels of crude oil a day. Whether we like \nit or not, we are buying it. Now, I am sure people say: I wish we \ndidn't. Well, that is what it takes for our economy to run. We are \nbuying that oil--7 million barrels a day.\n  Then we need to look at where the oil is coming from. If you are \nupset with Canada producing oil, we already buy 2\\1/2\\ million a day \nfrom Canada right now. We are already dependent upon Canada for 2\\1/2\\ \nmillion barrels a day.\n  We also buy oil from other countries, and I think we should all \nquestion why we are buying oil from these other countries, especially \nwhen we look at Venezuela. We buy 755,000 barrels a day from Venezuela. \nThey are an authoritarian regime that impoverishes their citizens. We \nknow that. They violate their human rights and have shown their \nwillingness to put down political protest with horrific violence. Yet \nwe are supporting that by purchasing a product from them which they \nthen use the resources from to continue this type of regime.\n  The same here: In 2013, we bought 1.3 million barrels from Saudi \nArabia. Now I don't know about my colleagues, but I question whether \nthe resources from that or the proceeds from that oil that we paid \nSaudi Arabia for were used for the betterment of the United States of \nAmerica, for our best interests. I have my doubts about that.\n  We also buy over 40,000 barrels a day from Russia. I don't need to \nsay anything about what is going on there. I think we all know that.\n  The Keystone Pipeline would allow us to safely import more oil from a \nstable ally and one of our best trading partners. In fact, it is the \nNo. 1 trading partner of 35 of our 50 States in the United States of \nAmerica. Our No. 1 trading partner is Canada. It is also the most \nstable regime we have, the best ally we have ever had.\n  The pipeline will have a final capacity of a little more than 800,000 \nbarrels a day. So right there we could stop buying any oil from \nVenezuela or cut down dramatically the amount of oil we buy from Saudi \nArabia and become less dependent. We can continue to produce energy in \nNorth America while stabilizing global supply as well as benefiting \nAmericans and our allies.\n\n[[Page S168]]\n\n  In fact, last year, one of President Obama's former national security \nadvisors--one of President's former national security advisors, Retired \nMarine Gen. James Jones--told the Foreign Relations Committee:\n\n       The international bullies who wish to use energy scarcity \n     as a weapon against us all are watching intently. If we want \n     to make Mr. Putin's day and strengthen his hand, we should \n     reject the Keystone.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       If we want to make Mr. Putin's day and strengthen his hand, \n     we should reject the Keystone. If we want to gain an \n     important measure of national energy security, jobs, tax \n     revenue and prosperity to advance our work on the spectrum of \n     energy solutions that don't rely on carbon, it should be \n     approved.\n\n  So you have to decide which side you are on. Do you want to make Mr. \nPutin's day or do you want to find alternatives and use all of the \nabove and be less dependent on foreign oil?\n  In addition to our national security interests and energy \nindependence, this bill will also create thousands of jobs. I think we \nhave talked about that. I hear the argument: Well, yes, but they are \nnot going to be permanent. You know, we have built a lot of bridges in \nAmerica, a lot of infrastructure, and a lot of roads. I don't know of \nany permanent jobs we have after we build a bridge, but we have a lot \nof good construction jobs when we are building the bridge. I don't know \nof any permanent jobs after we build a road, but we have a lot of good \nconstruction and high-paying jobs. And when you start looking at that, \nthe building and construction trades, the teamsters, the AFL-CIO, all \nof our friends of working Americans, the middle class--the hard-working \nAmericans--support this piece of legislation. They want these jobs.\n  Our own State Department says it will create about 42,000 jobs to \nconstruct the pipeline and thousands of other related jobs. So why \ndon't we seize the opportunity?\n  We talk about amendments. This is an open amendment process. A lot of \nmy colleagues, a lot of my Democratic colleagues on my side of the \naisle, have some great ideas and I am going to work with them. I agree \nwith my Democratic friends that companies shipping oil through this \npipeline should pay the excise tax to the oilspill trust fund. There is \nno reason they should be exempted from these payments. I am going to \nwork with them to put that amendment in. It is a good amendment and it \nwill strengthen the bill. That is what the amendment process is about.\n  I agree also with my colleagues on the Democratic side that any steel \nneeded in the future on this product should be bought from American \nsteel companies. That is great. That is promoting more jobs in America: \nBuy American steel. Don't let them dump on us. We should be supporting \nAmerican jobs.\n  I also agree with our friends we shouldn't export any of our oil \nabroad. If that oil comes to America, it should be subjected to the \nsame laws as all the oil that is extracted in America. So if we extract \nin the Balkans, if we extract in Texas, we treat them all the same. \nThose are all good amendments.\n  I would like to think this process will strengthen a piece of \nlegislation and hopefully give us 68, 70 votes. That would really give \nus a good piece of legislation for the American people.\n  We have been promised an open amendment process, and I am so thankful \nfor that. This presents an incredibly valuable opportunity to \naccomplish some of our Democratic priorities--some of our Democratic \npriorities that we talk about all the time on my side of the aisle. I \nbelieve the process will improve the bill, and I hope to convince my \ncolleagues to support this important piece of legislation.\n  Let us get the needed votes we need to make sure we move our country \nforward, become less dependent on foreign oil and more self-sufficient \nand more secure as a nation.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I know we have several colleagues who want to come and \nspeak on other issues this morning, and then we have some Members who \nwant to join back in on this debate, but I want to make a few points \nand finish up my remarks from earlier and then yield to our other \ncolleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I ask the Senator to yield for the purpose of a question. \nI want to understand the time. I need about 3, 4 minutes to wrap up. I \ndid relinquish 15 minutes for the other side, so I would request 3 to 4 \nminutes to wrap up and then I would certainly yield the floor to her.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Go right ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I just want to wrap up.\n  I want to thank the Senator from West Virginia. I am glad we are \nengaged in this debate. I think we should debate all aspects of it, as \nwe are, and I look forward to that continuing effort.\n  I do, though, want to wrap up on a point as to the environmental \nimpact. We have talked about a number of different aspects of this \npipeline project. We are talking about taking great care in the \napproval process to address all the issues at the State level. We have \ntalked about making sure we put provisions in the bill to respect that \nState process. That has been going on for more than 6 years and, \nobviously, it is now well past time for the Federal Government to move \nforward and make its decision.\n  But again, back to that process. If the President continues to oppose \nthis legislation--and he has indicated he will veto it because he has a \nprocess and he hasn't finished the process--then he needs to \ndemonstrate and finish the process. He indicated he was holding out for \nthe decision in Nebraska. Well, the decision in Nebraska has been \ncompleted. So if there is a process, if there is a real process, then \nhe needs to make a decision and he needs to tell us when he is going to \nmake that decision. And if the President follows his process, he needs \nto make a decision in favor of the project. Because as I am pretty sure \nwe are going to hear from some of the opponents of the project, they \nwill say: Oh, well, based on environmental issues, that is why he \nshould turn it down.\n  I understand and respect their views on some of the climate change \nissues, and they are certainly entitled to those opinions, but based on \nfive studies--three draft environmental impact statements and two final \nenvironmental impact statements done on this project--the Obama \nadministration's State Department in those environmental impact \nstatements found this will result: As a result of this project, ``no \nsignificant environmental impact.''\n  I understand they are going to spend a lot of time talking about \ntheir views on climate change, and that is fine. I understand that. But \nthere is a difference between opinion and that general discussion and \nthe science of this project. That is the finding by the Obama \nadministration.\n  We will have more discussion on this issue, in addition to the fact \nthat Canada is working to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from oil \nproduction in their country and in the oil sands. Since 1990, on a per-\nbarrel basis, they have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by about 28 \npercent, and they are continuing to do more. So they are addressing the \nenvironmental issue by doing what? Investing in technology that not \nonly produces more energy but does it with better environmental \nstewardship.\n  So instead of empowering that investment, here we want to block it? \nThat is not the way to address better environmental stewardship. The \nway to do it is by encouraging the investment that not only produces \nmore energy but does it with better environmental stewardship.\n  Again, I want to thank my colleague and fellow member of the energy \ncommittee for deferring so I could wrap up, and I look forward to \ncontinuing this debate and discussion on this important issue.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, as I said, I know we have other \ncolleagues here, so I will wrap up my opening remarks on the debate, \nthen turn it over to other colleagues who are wanting to speak on this \nsubject and other matters this morning.\n  I want to respond to a couple of things, because I know our \ncolleagues keep thinking this is something we have to do and we have to \nexpedite. But the reason why this project hasn't been approved to date \nis because we\n\n[[Page S169]]\n\nhaven't followed the process, and people keep bringing up objections to \nthat process.\n  Along those lines, I want to turn back to congressional involvement \nin this matter during the back-and-forth with Nebraska on the pipeline \nroute change in the Sandhills region.\n  During the time from 2008 until 2012, the U.S. State Department was \nreviewing TransCanada's initial pipeline application. This process \nrequires a national interest determination by the President. It is \nworth reminding my colleagues this was a process laid out by President \nBush. But in the review of that process, in their initial application, \nthe State Department, in 2011, announced that an alternative route \nthrough Nebraska needed to be found to avoid the uniquely sensitive \nterrain of the Sandhills area.\n  The President and the State Department said we need to go a different \nroute. So what happens next? One would think that most people would \nstop and listen and say: Oh, my gosh, there is a concern about this \naquifer. But that is not what happened. That is not what happened. \nPeople came to Congress and said: We should get the old route approved \nin the aquifer that provides 30 percent of the groundwater for \nirrigation through the United States--where a spill would have been \ndisastrous.\n  At the same time the State Department was telling the company, we \nhave real concerns; you need to re-route the pipeline. The company was \ncoming here to Congress trying to push the old route through at the \nsame time the State Department was negotiating. So I would say to my \ncolleagues, if you think you are helping this process, you are hurting \nit. You are trying to take away the negotiating power of the State \nDepartment to make sure that environmental and public interest issues \nare addressed here.\n  Now I know my colleague, whom I look forward to working with on the \nenergy committee, thinks his legislation has protected something in the \narea of property rights, but let me be clear: This legislation ensures \nthat the status quo in Nebraska under the Supreme Court decision last \nweek will stand. It simply affirms that the use of eminent domain on \nbehalf of TransCanada will be the law. So we are not doing anything in \nthis legislation to protect them. Jamming Keystone XL onto the \ntemporary payroll tax cut bill was a mistake, and the bill today is \nalso a mistake. This bill says, ``Don't try to answer all of these \nquestions that we think the State Department should decide in our \nnational interest.'' The President should have the ability to say yes \nor no on this.\n  I would like the President to answer these questions as they relate \nto the tar sands oil in water, only because I had a chance to ask the \nCommandant of the Coast Guard a year ago about this issue. We are very \nconcerned about the transport of tar sands out of the Pacific \nNorthwest. The commandant at that time said we have no solution--no \nsolution. So when my colleague from Michigan talked about the $1.2 \nbillion that was spent on tar sands cleanup because it sank in the \nKalamazoo River, I think these are issues that the State Department has \nevery right to raise with the company to get answers on.\n  Just recently TransCanada has been redoing some of its pipeline in \nother areas because it has also found that the welds in the pipeline \nwere not properly done. So in the State Department's Environmental \nImpact Statement, it required TransCanada to get a third-party \nvalidator to validate whether it was actually meeting the standards we \nwant to see on the pipeline; but, no, our colleagues would like to \ninterrupt that and say: We know best, just like we were ready to make \nit right with the Sandhills aquifer. We know best.\n  So I ask my colleagues not to rush a process that has been failed \nfrom the beginning, that did not allow for the public interest to be \nadequately afforded its right.\n  I don't understand what the hurry is. I do want to hurry on energy \npolicy, but it has much more to do with getting the tax credits and \nclean energy incentives in place that will unleash thousands of more \njobs and give predictability. That is the prerogative and the \nresponsibility of Congress, to look at these tax incentives to \nestablish economic incentives. It is not our job to site pipelines when \nthe local process has not played out. At least don't stop the President \nfrom making sure these environmental issues are addressed.\n  My colleague from Massachusetts has been waiting, and I know he was a \nleader in the House of Representatives prior to his time in the Senate \nmaking sure that tar sands should pay into the oilspill liability trust \nfund, and I certainly appreciate his leadership on that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. I rise for recognition to speak on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. MARKEY. I thank the Presiding Officer very much and I thank the \nSenator from Washington for her great leadership on this issue.\n  We are having the beginning of an historic debate here on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate. We are debating whether the dirtiest oil in the \nworld, the tar sands from Canada, is going to be brought through the \nUnited States in a pipeline, like a straw, and brought right down to \nPort Arthur, TX, to a tax-free export zone so that it can be exported \nout of the United States.\n  What is in it for our country?\n  Well, when you think about it, we are going to take the environmental \nrisk, but the benefits flow to the Canadian companies. The benefits \nflow to the oil companies. This whole argument that it deals with \nAmerican energy independence is false, and the way in which we are \ngoing to ensure that we are protected is that we are going to bring an \namendment out here on to the Senate floor to debate whether this oil \nshould stay in the United States. We export young men and women \noverseas to protect these ships coming back from the Middle East with \noil. Why should we export the oil that is already in the United States \nwhen it can reduce our dependence? That is our challenge, and we must \ndeal with that.\n  As well, the Canadians under existing law are exempt from paying a \ntax into an oilspill liability fund. That can no longer continue as \nwell. That is upwards of $2 billion over 10 years to deal with \noilspills in the United States created by Canadian oil, and they are \nexempt. That is wrong. That is just plain wrong. So this is a very \nimportant debate, but it goes right to the heart--let's admit it--of \nenergy independence in the United States. That oil should not come to \nour country, go right through it and out. We have a responsibility to \nthe young men and women we send around the world to not provide any \nfalse advertising about this oil and where it is going to go.\n\n\n                             Net Neutrality\n\n  Secondly, I want to talk a little bit about net neutrality. We are \ncoming up to the first anniversary of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals \nstriking down the rules the Federal Communications Commission had put \non the books to protect the Internet, to ensure that it is open, that \nit is entrepreneurial. Network neutrality is just a fancy word for \nnondiscrimination, just a fancy word for saying that it is open, that \nentrepreneurs, that smaller voices have access, so they cannot be \nblocked by communications behemoths. This is an issue that goes right \nto the heart of job creation in the United States of America.\n  Consider this. In 2013, 60 percent of all of the venture capital \nfunds invested in the United States of America went toward Internet-\nspecific and software companies. That is all you have to know. That is \n60 percent of all venture capital money. That is why 4 million people \nhave registered with the Federal Communications Commission their views \nthat net neutrality is central to this entrepreneurial activity in our \ncountry. The FCC is going to promulgate or announce the beginning of \nthe promulgation of new regulations in February. We are on the first \nanniversary right now of the rules having been struck down. There are \nnone.\n  From my perspective, this goes right to the heart of the new \ngeneration of companies. Yes, we have Google and eBay and Amazon and \nYouTube and all rest of these first-generation companies, but there are \nnew companies like Dwolla and Etsy that are at the heart of the new job \ncreation, and we have to make sure they and others like them are not \ndenied access.\n  So, in both of these issues, net neutrality and on the pipeline issue \ncoming down from Canada, it is all about\n\n[[Page S170]]\n\njob creation. It is all about making sure that if America is going to \ntake the risk, America should get the benefit. And it is not going to \non the pipeline issue. It is not. This is the dirtiest oil in the \nworld. This is going to contribute to dangerous global warming.\n  Yet the oil companies are going to be able to sell it out on the open \nmarket. And why? Because the price of a barrel of oil on the open \nmarket is $17 higher than it is in Canada. You don't have to go to a \nbusiness school to figure out this model. Get it out and onto the open \nseas, sell it to China, sell it to Latin America, sell it to other \ncountries around the world. That is what this is all about. That is \nwhat is at the heart of this entire Keystone Pipeline agenda.\n  It is wrong for us to be short-circuiting a process that will \nguarantee that the environment of our country, the environment of our \nplanet is, in fact, protected by the President and by the process that \nhas been put in place.\n  I am so glad we are finally having this debate to make sure we put \nall of the facts out on the table.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor up to 4 minutes, followed by Senator Shaheen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Isakson and Mrs. Shaheen pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 150 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before I speak, I have two unanimous \nconsent requests: No. 1, that Senator Whitehouse be allowed to follow \nme and, No. 2, that my remarks not break up the debate on the pipeline \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, with all of the issues our country \nfaces, here we are debating a Canadian pipeline. What are we doing? A \nnew majority has taken over the Senate and their first bill--their \nopening gambit--is the Keystone Pipeline. What is going on?\n  Is it about jobs? There has been an awful lot of talk about jobs over \nthe last couple of days, but this opening gambit--both obviously and \ndemonstrably--has nothing to do about jobs. If this were about jobs, \ninstead bring up the Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency bill, the \nbipartisan bill the Republicans spiked last year. That bill has been \nestimated to produce nearly 200,000 jobs, more than quadruple the \n42,000 jobs supported by the construction of the pipeline.\n  If this were about jobs, bring up the highway bill, which came out of \nEPW unanimously last year. That bill was estimated to support 3 million \njobs a year, 70 times the number of jobs the Keystone Pipeline will \nproduce. Forty-two thousand is a pittance compared to that.\n  Right now the economy is adding over 70,000 jobs every week. In the 3 \nweeks we spend arguing about this bill, we will add five times as many \njobs as the Keystone Pipeline would provide. We matched Keystone in \njust 4 average days of job growth. Yet we are going to spend 3 weeks on \nthis issue?\n  If this were truly about jobs, bring up an infrastructure bill--the \nkind our Republican friends have relentlessly stymied when they were in \nthe minority. Set up an infrastructure fund. God knows wherever we look \nAmerican infrastructure is crumbling. Schools, airports, trains, water, \nhealth information infrastructure, smart grids, and broadband are all \nyearning for activity.\n  We could do very big things on jobs. We get 13,000 jobs on average \nfor every $1 billion spent on infrastructure, and we need the \ninfrastructure, but instead we are doing this. It is definitely not \nabout jobs.\n  Is it about the merits of the pipeline? Hardly. With oil prices at \n$50 per barrel, it is not even clear that the pipeline is viable. The \nState Department calculated that crude oil prices below $75 per barrel \nwould limit the development of tar sands crude.\n  According to a recent report from the Canadian Energy Research \nInstitute, due to a steep increase in production costs, new tar sands \nprojects require crude prices of at least $85 per barrel to break even. \nWe are around $50 per barrel. The U.S. Energy Information Agency \npredicts that crude oil prices will average below $65 well into 2015.\n  Shell, Total, and Statoil have all canceled or postponed major tar \nsands expansion projects. Southern Pacific Resources has nearly gone \nbroke transporting heavy crude to the gulf by rail. The Canexus \nterminal in Alberta has run far below capacity, plagued by logistical \nproblems, lost contracts with developers, and has been put up for sale. \nAt $50 per barrel this pipeline could already be a zombie pipeline--\ndead man walking.\n  Moreover, Keystone XL would be an environmental disaster. \nNotwithstanding the talking points to the contrary, the facts prove \notherwise. As a source of carbon pollution alone, it will produce the \nequivalent of as many as 6 million added cars on our roads for 50 \nyears. That is enough added carbon pollution to erase 70 percent of the \ncarbon reductions from the recent motor vehicle emission standards that \nthe automobile companies agreed to.\n  The cost of that carbon pollution adds up. Using official U.S. \nestimates of the social cost of carbon, the economic damage of the \nemissions from the Keystone Pipeline will amount to $128 billion in \nharm over the lifetime of the project. These are enormous costs that we \nwill pay, borne out as parched farmland, harms to our health, and \nflooded businesses and homes. It is not about jobs and it is not about \nthe merits of this pipeline. Unfortunately, it is not even a venue for \na serious discussion about climate change--for a conversation about \nwhat carbon pollution is doing to our atmosphere and oceans.\n  In all of last week's conversation about the Keystone Pipeline tar \nsands bill, the number of times Republicans mentioned climate change \nwas exactly one time, and that was only when Chairman Murkowski \nsummarized testimony submitted to her energy committee by an opponent \nof the pipeline. She used the term while describing the witness's \ntestimony. There was one reference to a Democratic witness's committee \ntestimony, and that is it. There were ``zero'' serious conversations.\n  We are long past time for a serious bipartisan conversation about \ncarbon pollution and climate change. What a great thing it would be if \npart of the new majority's new responsibility was just to take an \nhonest look at those issues. But for sure this isn't that. Republicans \nremain politically incapable of addressing climate change. Forget \naddressing climate change, Republicans remain politically incapable of \neven discussing it.\n  It is not jobs, it is not the merits of the pipeline, it is not an \nopening on carbon pollution and climate change, and the President has \nalready told us he is going to veto this bill.\n  What the heck are we doing? I will tell you what I think we are \ndoing--and I think the facts support this conclusion--but first what \nyou have to understand to understand what is going on is that the \nRepublican Party has become the political wing of the fossil fuels \nindustry. There has always been a trend of this within the Republican \nParty, but since the Republican appointees on the Supreme Court gave \nthe fossil fuel industry the great, fat, juicy gift of its Citizens \nUnited decision, fossil fuel industry control over the Republican Party \nin Congress has become near absolute.\n  According to the Center for American Progress, the fossil fuel \nindustry spent nearly three-quarters of $1 billion over the last 2 \nyears on lobbying and direct and third-party campaign \ncontributions. That is just what is reported. That doesn't even count \nthe anonymous dark money that is preferred by many special interest \ndonors. It certainly doesn't include the pungent fact that even if a \nspecial interest never spends the money, just quiet, private, backroom \nthreats of attack ads can influence political behavior.\n\n  We can argue this point more on another day. I have talked about it \nfrequently, and I think I have made the case pretty convincingly in \nother ``Time to Wake Up'' speeches that the evidence points to this as \nthe present state of affairs within the Republican Party. So for \npurposes of this discussion, take it as my premise, anyway,\n\n[[Page S171]]\n\nthat the Republican Party in Congress is now effectively the political \nwing of the fossil fuel industry.\n  That premise clarifies what is happening here. The fossil fuel \nindustry has a shiny new Republican Senate majority, and it wants to \ntake it out for a spin. It wants to take its new Republican-controlled \nCongress out for a spin. That is what this Keystone opening gambit is \nall about. This is somewhere between performance art, a show of \nobedience, and a show of force.\n  Well, fine. Take us out for a spin. Have your fun. But the laws of \nnature that turn carbon pollution into climate change and into ocean \nacidification aren't going away. God laid down those laws, and they are \nnot subject to repeal by man. Ignore them all you want. Worship at the \naltar of the fossil fuel Baal all you want, but there will be a price \nto pay for this negligence and inaction. It is truly time for this body \nto wake up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Cuba Policy\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to say that nothing has changed \nin Cuba since Cuban arms were captured on this North Korean ship going \nthrough the Panama Canal a year and a half ago, just after the Obama \nadministration started its secret negotiations with the Cuban \nGovernment--not the regime, not its mindset, nor its oppression of its \npeople.\n  This is the essence of the regime. They put this missile system and \nMiGs in a container ship going through the Panama Canal, hid them under \ntons of sugar in violation of U.S. Security Council resolutions. It was \nthe most significant violation of security council resolutions as its \nrelates to North Korea in quite some time, and certainly the biggest \nviolator in all of the Western Hemisphere.\n  We could not trust the Castro regime then, and we cannot trust it \nnow. What we can trust are the voices of those who promote human rights \nand democracy who have been arrested and rearrested time and time \nagain, year after year, for demanding nothing more than their ability \nto speak their minds freely, openly, and without fear.\n  Voices such as Berta Soler, the leader of the Ladies in White--the \nLadies in White are a group of women who each Sunday travel to mass \ndressed in white, normally holding a gladiola--peacefully. These are \nwomen whose husbands or sons languish in Castro's jail simply because \nof their political views. And as they march to church, they are \nsavagely beaten by state security.\n  Berta Soler, the leader of the Ladies in White, said:\n\n       Sadly, President Obama made the wrong decision. The freedom \n     and democracy of the Cuban people will not be achieved \n     through these benefits that he's giving--not to the Cuban \n     people--but to the Cuban government.\n       The Cuban government will only take advantage to strengthen \n     its repressive machinery, to repress civil society, its \n     people and remain in power.\n\n  Or the voice of Yoani Sanchez, a prominent Cuban blogger and \nindependent journalist, who said, ``Alan Gross was not arrested for \nwhat he did but for what could be gained for his arrest. He was simply \nbait and they were aware of it from the beginning. Castroism has won, \nthough the positive result is that Alan Gross has left alive the prison \nthat threatened to become his tomb.''\n  Or the voice of Rosa Maria Paya, the daughter of Oswaldo Paya, the \nisland's most prominent and respected human rights advocate, who was \nkilled in what the regime calls an automobile accident, what many of us \ncall an assassination. His whole effort was under the existing Cuban \nConstitution to petition his government under that constitution for \nchanges in the government, of which he amassed thousands of signatures \nof average Cubans across the island, and the regime saw that as such a \nthreat that he was run off the road and, sadly, killed.\n  His daughter Rosa Maria Paya said:\n\n       The Cuban people are being ignored in this secret \n     conversation, in this secret agreement that we learned today. \n     The reality of my country is there is just one party with all \n     the control and with the state security controlling the whole \n     society.\n       If this doesn't change, there's no real change in Cuba. Not \n     even with access to Internet. Not even when Cuban people can \n     travel more than two years ago. Not even that is a sign of \n     the end of the totalitarianism in my country.\n\n  Or another voice, the voice of Sakharov prize winner Guillermo \nFarinas, who spoke for many Cuban dissidents when he said this:\n\n       Alan Gross was used as a tool by the Castro regime to \n     coerce the United States. Obama was not considerate of Cuban \n     citizens and of the civil society that is facing this \n     tyrannical regime.\n       In Miami, Obama promised he would consult Cuba measures \n     with civil society and the non-violent opposition. Obviously, \n     this didn't happen. That is a fact, a reality. He didn't \n     consider Cuba's democrats. The betrayal of Cuba's democrats \n     has been consummated.\n\n  As you can see, Farinas is in the midst of being arrested by state \nsecurity simply for a peaceful protest.\n  Or the powerful voice of the husband of Berta Soler, Angel Moya, a \nformer political prisoner of the Black Spring in 2003 when Fidel Castro \nimprisoned 75, including 29 journalists along with librarians and \ndemocracy activists. He said this:\n\n       The Obama Administration has ceded before Castro's \n     dictatorship. Nothing has changed. The jails remain filled, \n     the government represents only one family, repression \n     continues, civil society is not recognized and we have no \n     right to assemble or protest.\n       The measures that the government of the United States has \n     implemented today, to ease the embargo and establish \n     diplomatic relations with Cuba, will in no way benefit the \n     Cuban people. The steps taken will strengthen the Castro \n     regime's repression against human rights activists and \n     increase its resources, so the security forces can keep \n     harassing and repressing civil society.\n\n  These are the voices of those who languished inside the belly of the \nbeast. These are the voices not of this romantic image that some have \nof Castro's Cuba but of the reality, the harsh reality--people who, \nsimply to be able to promote the basic freedoms that we enjoy here in \nthe United States and most people in the Western world, are constantly \nthrown into jail for long periods of time, beaten and oppressed.\n  Those are the voices of freedom inside of Cuba. These are the men and \nwomen who have been arrested and suffered under the oppressive hand of \nthe Cuban regime for the belief in the right of all Cubans to be free. \nThese are the people who know that nothing--nothing--has changed. The \nregime, after reaping the benefits of what in my view is a bad deal, is \nstill arresting peaceful protesters, including more than 50 at the end \nof December.\n  As a matter of fact, on New Year's Eve when most of us were \ncelebrating the advent of the new year, there was an effort inside of \nCuba. Tania Bruguera and a series of other human rights activists and \npolitical democracy activists were going to hold in Revolution Square a \n1-minute opportunity for any Cuban who wanted to come forth and talk \nabout what they aspired to for their freedom, what they aspired to for \nthe Cuba of tomorrow to be. It was going to be a peaceful demonstration \nand an exposition of the hopes and dreams and aspirations of Cuba's \npolitical dissidents and human rights activists inside their country. \nIn that peaceful effort, dozens of human rights activists and political \ndissidents, including the organizers, were arrested before they ever \ngot to the event. The event was totally suppressed.\n  Weeks after the administration's deal with the Castro regime--even \nthen--the simple act of speaking for 1 minute about what your views \nwould be of the future were repressed. So let me say that while I \nwelcome the news that Cuba has released 53 political prisoners and that \nthe administration has finally shared the list of names it negotiated \nwith the Castro regime, this entire process has been shrouded in \nsecrecy.\n  Reuters reports that the administration officials said the list was \ncreated in June or July. But some of the 53 were released well before \nJune, before the list was supposedly put together. As a matter of fact, \n14, to be exact, were released 6 to 8 months before the December 17 \nannouncement. One was released over a year ago.\n  So, clearly, the list that supposedly was put together by the \nadministration with the regime could not have envisioned or could not \ntake credit for\n\n[[Page S172]]\n\nthose who were released well before the list was put together. Many had \nsimply finished their unjust prison terms. Clearly, keeping the list \nsecret provided the regime the flexibility to define ``mission \naccomplished.'' The fact is, the release of 53 political prisoners does \nnot mean there are no longer political prisoners inside of Cuba. Human \nrights groups had stated, prior to the President's speech in December, \nthat there were over 100 long-term political prisoners in the country, \nand there were 8,900--to be exact, 8,889--political detentions in Cuba \nlast year--an appalling number--8,889.\n  In short, while 53 political prisoners have been let out of jail, the \nsame corrupt jailer is still ruling the country. The Castros have a \nlong history. I have followed this not only for all of my career of 23 \nyears in the Congress, but even before that. They have a long history \nof rearresting these political and human rights activists whom they \npreviously released.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute remaining under Democratic \ncontrol.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous consent to be able to continue for \nabout 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, the fact is that as someone who has \nspoken out time and again on the brutal repression of the Cuban people \nunder the Castro regime, someone whose family has suffered the \nconsequences, I believe the agreement this administration has reached \nwith the Castro regime is one-sided and misguided. It fails to \nunderstand the nature of the regime that has exerted its authoritarian \ncontrol over the Cuban people for over 55 years. Now, no one wishes \nthat the reality in Cuba were more different than the Cuban people and \nCuban Americans that have fled the island in search of freedom.\n  In December, the same month that the President announced changes to \nU.S. policies, the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National \nReconciliation, a group that works within Cuba, documented 489 \npolitical arrests, bringing the total number of political arrests \nduring the first 11 months of 2014 to nearly 8,900.\n  This is the regime that imprisoned an American citizen for 5 years \nfor distributing communications equipment on the island. Releasing \npolitical prisoners today in Cuba is meaningless if tomorrow these \nindividuals can be arrested again and denied the right to peacefully \npursue change in their own country. It is a fallacy that Cuba will \nchange just because an American President believes that if he extends \nhis hand in peace, the Castro brothers will suddenly unclench their \nfists.\n  As you see from the quotes I have read, a majority of democracy \nactivists on the island, many whom I have met with in the past, have \nbeen explicit that they want the United States to become open to Cuba \nonly when there is a reciprocal movement by the Castro brothers. They \nunderstand that the Castros will not accede to change in any other way. \nIn my view and in theirs, the United States has thrown the Cuban regime \nan economic lifeline. With the collapse of the Venezuelan economy, Cuba \nis losing its main benefactor, but it will now receive the support of \nthe United States, the greatest democracy in the world.\n  This is a reward that a totalitarian regime does not deserve. It is a \nreward that at the end of the day perpetuates the Castro regime's \ndecades of repression. The regulatory changes the regime has won, which \nare clearly intended to circumvent the intent and spirit of U.S. law \nand the U.S. Congress, present a false narrative about Cuba that \nsuggests that the United States and not the regime is responsible for \nits economic failure. So let's be clear. Cuba's economic struggles are \n100 percent attributable to a half century of failed political and \neconomic experiments that have suffocated Cuban entrepreneurs. In Cuba \nprivate business is controlled by the Cuban government--most \nsignificantly the military--with the benefits flowing directly to the \nregime's political and military leaders.\n  Cuba has the same political and economic relations with most of the \nworld. But companies choose not to engage because of political, \neconomic, and even criminal risks associated with investment on the \nisland, as exhibited by the arbitrary arrests of several foreign \ninvestors from Canada, England, and Panama in just recent years.\n  To also suggest that Cuba should be taken off the list of state \nsponsors of terrorism is alarming while Cuba harbors American fugitives \nsuch as Joanne Chesimard, a cop killer who is on the FBI's list of most \nwanted terrorists for murdering New Jersey State Trooper Werner \nFoerster. She is not the only one who is a cop killer inside of Cuba \nfrom the United States. There is also Cuba's colluding with North \nKorea, as I showed before, to smuggle jets, missile batteries, and arms \nthrough the Panama Canal in violation of the U.N. Security Council \nresolution, and for giving refuge to members of FARC from Colombia and \nmembers of ETA from Spain, groups that the State Departments has \nrecognized as foreign terrorist organizations.\n  Now, finally with respect to the President's decision to attend the \nSummit of the Americans, I am extraordinarily disappointed that we \nintend to violate our own principles laid down in the Inter-American \nDemocratic Charter in 2001, on the Summit being a forum for the \nhemisphere's democratically elected leaders. This action disavows the \ncharter, and it sends the global message about the low priority that we \nplace on democracy and respect for human and civil rights.\n  So in this new Congress I urge my distinguished colleague, the now \nchairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Corker, to \nhold hearings on this dramatic and mistaken change in policy. I will \nkeep coming to this floor to address at length all of the issues I have \nraised. I will come to this floor again and again to expose one of the \nmost oppressive, repressive, and undemocratic regimes in the world.\n  To those of my colleagues who herald this agreement and for those in \nthe press who still live with the mistaken romanticism of the Castros' \nrevolution and who speak out about human rights abuses and democratic \nmovements all over the world, it is so hypocritical to be so silent--a \ndeafening silence when it comes to the democratic and human rights \nmovement inside of Cuba.\n  I have listened to many eloquent speeches of my colleagues about \nhuman rights violations and democracy movements in many parts of the \nworld. But on Cuba their silence is deafening.\n  This does not end here. It does not end today with one speech. It \nsurely will not end until the people of Cuba are truly free.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I wish today to address S. 1, which would \napprove construction of the Keystone Pipeline to transport tar sands \nheavy oil from Canada to the gulf coast. The key consideration is \nwhether this bill, by authorizing the pipeline, would contribute \nsignificantly to global warming, which is already damaging our rural \nresources and our future economic prospects with profound consequences \nfor families in America and around the world.\n  Also, are there better ways to create jobs that would enhance rather \nthan damage our economy? In the words of President Theodore Roosevelt, \n``Of all the questions which can come before this nation, short of the \nactual preservation of its existence in a great war, there is none \nwhich compares in importance with the great central task of leaving \nthis land even a better land for our descendants than it is for us.''\n  Let's start by examining the impact of the Keystone Pipeline on \natmospheric carbon dioxide pollution and global warming. This chart \ndisplays the variations in carbon dioxide that have occurred over time, \nback through the last 800,000 years. We have seen that carbon dioxide \nlevels have gone up and down within a modest range until modern times \nand the Industrial revolution.\n  At that point, where they continued to oscillate as they have in the \npast, we see a steady, upward progress into a realm not seen within \nthese last 800,000\n\n[[Page S173]]\n\nyears. This is the impact simply of human kind pulling up a lot of \nfossil fuel out of the ground and burning it--whether it comes in the \nform of coal or it comes in the form of oil or it comes in the form of \ngas.\n  Now, let's take a look and see how the temperature of the planet has \ncorresponded with the levels of carbon dioxide. What we find, going \nback in time, is a very strong correlation with the carbon dioxide in \nred and temperature change in blue--a very close correlation between \ncarbon dioxide around our planet and the temperature of the planet.\n  Well, this makes enormous sense since any high school student can \nestablish in the laboratory that carbon dioxide has thermal properties \nin trapping heat. As less heat radiates from the Earth, the Earth \nwarms. Well, this certainly bears upon our stewardship of this planet. \nBy many estimates, to contain global warming to 2 degrees Celsius--that \nis just shy of 3.9 degrees Fahrenheit--human civilization must \ntransition aggressively and rapidly away from conventional fossil fuels \nand toward the use of nonfossil, renewable energy.\n  Now, this shift is within our power. It is a challenge presented by \nthis circumstance and by our stewardship of human civilization on this \nplanet. But are we up to the task? Do we have the political will to \nundertake responsible stewardship of our beautiful blue-green Earth? \nThat is the test that stands before this body--this Senate--at this \nvery moment.\n  Building the Keystone Pipeline, which opens the faucet to rapid \nexploitation of massive new unconventional fossil reserves--the tar \nsands--takes us in the exact opposite direction from where we need to \ngo. It locks us into the dirtiest fossil fuels on the planet for a \ngeneration. It accelerates human civilization down the road to \ncatastrophic climate change.\n  That is why building the Keystone Pipeline is a mistake. There is a \nlot at stake. Global warming is not some imaginary concept based on \ncomputer models or something that might happen 50 to 100 years from \nnow. Indeed, global warming is not only present right now, but it is \nalready making vast changes in State after State, and nation after \nnation.\n  The warmest 10 years on record for global average surface temperature \nhave occurred in the last 12 years. Let me repeat that. The warmest 10 \nyears on record for global average surface temperature have occurred in \nthe last 12 years. That is pretty powerful evidence that something \ndramatic is occurring. The effects can be seen in every State. The \naverage forest fire season in the United States is getting longer. \nSince the 1980s the season has grown by 60 to 80 days. That is 2 to 3 \nmonths of additional fire season. The average amount of acres consumed \nannually by wildfires has doubled to more than 7 million acres.\n  One study estimates that global warming, through the combined impact \nof greater pine beetle infestation and the greater number of forest \nfires and more severe forest fires will decimate the western forests of \nthe United States by the end of this century. That is not the only \nimpact that we are seeing. In addition, the snowpack in our mountains--\nin our Cascade Mountains--is decreasing, which means smaller and warmer \ntrout streams. That is not good for fishing.\n  It means less water for irrigation--not good for farming. The Klamath \nBasin, a major agricultural basin in Oregon, has suffered through many \nyears and three horrific droughts just since 2001, in substantial part, \nbecause of the lower snowpack.\n  This chart, which shows Washington State, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana, \nshows the areas of intensity of the decrease in snowpack. The decreases \nare circled in red and the increases in the snowpack are circled in \nblue. As you can see, the decreasing snowpacks vastly, vastly outweigh \nthe occasional spots where there have been reported increases.\n  This translates to the types of droughts we have been seeing in the \nKlamath Basin, in this area of southern Oregon, and the droughts we \nhave seen in northern California, a very significant impact on \nagriculture.\n  So when some are critical on this floor--some climate deniers who \nchoose to ignore all of the facts on the ground and say there is no \nimpact and no harm--well, they simply are putting forth a myth designed \nto serve the oil, fossil fuel, and coal industries in order to advance \nthose powerful special interests.\n  Well, I have a special interest. That special interest is the people \nof Oregon, who are being impacted by the longer forest fires, who are \nbeing impacted by the droughts. I have a special interest. It is called \nplanet Earth. That trumps the Koch brothers, that trumps the coal \nindustry, that trumps the oil industry.\n  There are other impacts that we are seeing. One is the impact on our \noceans. As the high levels of carbon dioxide in the air interact \nthrough wave action with the ocean, the ocean absorbs some of that \ncarbon dioxide. As it absorbs that carbon dioxide, it becomes carbonic \nacid. Here we see some charts from Hawaii. In the purple here we have \nthe change in atmospheric carbon dioxide over a 50-year period.\n  Then we have measurements of carbon dioxide in blue in the water. \nThen we have the measurements, over that same period, of the pH or \nacidic content of the oceans. What we are seeing is that as the pH \nlevel drops, that means that the oceans are more acidic. Now, what \nhappens when the ocean is more acidic? It affects the coral reefs, for \none. Coral reefs are very sensitive to this. We have seen, from \nscientists who are studying coral reefs, significant damage both from \nwater temperatures and from increasing acidity.\n  One scientist from Oregon State University who studies coral reefs \naround the world came here to DC and presented a series of slides \nshowing the reefs he studied. He said: These are my babies and my \nbabies are dying. Those coral reefs are the basic food chain for a \nsignificant amount of sea life that is harvested for human consumption. \nTo put it differently, fishing families around the world often depend \non the coral reefs to sustain the foundation of their livelihood.\n  Off the Pacific coast, we are seeing a big impact on our oysters. The \nWhiskey Creek shellfish hatchery started having trouble in 2008 with \nthe growth of its baby oysters that are known as oyster seeds. I \nvisited that hatchery 3 months ago to hear their story about what they \nhad faced.\n  At first they thought: Well, maybe this problem is from a bacteria. \nMaybe this problem is from a virus. Maybe this is from something else. \nThey brought in Oregon State University to research and they figured \nout that it was, in fact, the acidity of the water, the very acidity \nthat I just showed you the chart about.\n  The acidity does not happen in just one place. It is happening \nbroadly across the world. The oyster seed--if they are having trouble \nfixing their shells because of the high acidity in the water, well then \nwhat else is going on? The oysters--here are some headlines related to \nthe oysters.\n  Up in Washington State, the Seattle Times reported: ``Oysters dying \nas coast is hit hard.'' In fact, I was flipping through channels a \nmonth or 2 ago, and there was the Governor of Washington over at a \nhatchery on the coast of Washington, just like I visited Whiskey Creek \nHatchery in Oregon. It is the same story. Oysters are dying. Why? \nBecause of the acidity of the water.\n\n  This is a headline from the Los Angeles Times: ``Oceans' rising \nacidity a threat to shellfish--and humans.''\n  From Oregon: ``Researchers scramble to deal with dying Northwest \noysters.''\n  So for my colleagues who want to wreak this kind of harm to our \nfarms, to our fisheries, and to our forests, how about you figure out \nfrom the folks of your State how to pay for the damage being done in my \nState to our forests, our fishing, and our farming. How about you \nfigure out how to pay for the damage being done throughout the United \nStates and throughout the planet. You want to unleash the dirtiest oil \nin the world from the tar sands and increase this damage? Tell me how \nyou are going to compensate those who are injured across this Nation \nand across the world.\n  I hear a lot of comments about responsibility. I hear a lot of \ncomments from my colleagues across the aisle about accountability. Put \nyour actions where your statements are and show us some accountability \nfor the damage you are wreaking by approving this pipeline, by voting \nfor this pipeline.\n\n[[Page S174]]\n\n  Does this bill before us, which would open the faucet on a massive \nnew reserve of fossil fuels, advance the stewardship of the planet? \nDoes it advance our rural economy? Clearly the answer is no. \nStewardship, accountability, and responsibility would insist that we \nnot open this faucet to further damage of the kind we are seeing right \nnow, that we not unlock the tar sands.\n  But proponents of the pipeline say: Wait, we have some arguments on \nour side. Let's examine those arguments.\n  First they say: You know, this will create 4,000 construction jobs.\n  Well, let's take a look at this chart. This is a chart that shows the \nKeystone--roughly 4,000 construction jobs. That represents this little \ntiny line at the bottom, if you can even see it.\n  Now let's talk about the Rebuild America Act, which colleagues across \nthe aisle filibustered in order to kill it even though it was revenue \nneutral. That is how many jobs the Rebuild America Act would create.\n  If you want to talk jobs, let's talk about a jobs bill. Let's \nsubstitute the Rebuild America Act for the Keystone act. Let's have a \nreal jobs bill, a real stimulus bill, a bill that would put people to \nwork in construction across this Nation in a way more intense fashion \nthan would the Keystone bill.\n  Proponents have a second argument. They say that bringing this \nadditional oil from Canada down to the Gulf of Mexico will increase our \nnational security because all that oil will be refined and utilized in \nthe United States.\n  Well, my colleagues are a little confused about this. They haven't \nthought about why it is Canada wants to ship it to a gulf port--so that \nit can have access to world markets, so that it can get the world \nmarket price. Our refineries in the gulf coast are largely fully \noccupied now. An additional supply of crude means additional crude you \ncan export to other countries that have refineries that are short of \nsupply. Well, that is profitable to Canada, but that doesn't mean the \noil will get used in the United States.\n  They say: But wait a minute, some of it might get refined and \nutilized in the U.S. system.\n  Well, let's acknowledge that some of it might get refined, albeit it \nis clear why the oil is being shipped to the gulf coast because it is \nbeing shipped there to get into the world market and be available for \nexport to the world. Let's say some of it might happen to be utilized \nin the United States. That little bit of impact is nothing compared to \nwhat we can do by investment in renewable energy that would decrease \nour reliance on fossil fuels. So a far better solution would be \ninvesting in renewable, non-fossil fuel energy that doesn't have the \nimpact on the fishing, the farming, and the forests.\n  But, say proponents, if the Keystone Pipeline is not built, an \nalternative pipeline will be built through Canada.\n  Well, that is certainly highly questionable. If it were easier and \ncheaper to go through Canada, TransCanada would not be seeking to build \nthe Keystone Pipeline.\n  Oh, they say, they will figure out a way to run a pipeline west to \nthe Pacific.\n  But you know that has to pass through First Nation lands, and it has \nto have all kinds of approvals. And there are folks in Canada who \nactually feel as deeply and passionately about being good stewards of \nour planet and not contributing to the assault on our forests, our \nfarming, and fishing as many of us here feel, and there is going to be \nintense opposition. That is why TransCanada wants to push this through \nthe United States in order to reach the world market and the gulf \ncoast. It is cheaper and easier, and they have no confidence they can \nbuild a pipeline to substitute.\n  Opponents say: If it is not shipped by pipeline, it will be shipped \nby railroad--which, of course, is again way off the fact track because \nthe railroads are already congested, making additional capacity modest \nat best. In addition, the price point for shipping by rail is much \nhigher than the price point for shipping by pipeline. If you change the \nprice of the pipeline, you change the supply and demand curve, and you \ndon't end up producing the same amount of oil.\n  So these arguments made are thin efforts to camouflage a fundamental \nfact that this is a great deal for TransCanada, it is a great deal for \nthe oil industry, and it is a terrible deal for Americans depending on \nrural resources, a terrible deal for our oceans and our fisheries, a \nterrible deal for our forests, and a terrible deal for our farming.\n  So if you care about the future economy of the United States, if you \ncare about rural America, if you care about all of us who depend on \nrural America for these wonderful and important resources, then you \nwill oppose this pipeline.\n  There is no question, this is a sweetheart deal. Talk about \naccountability? TransCanada won't even have to pay into the oilspill \nliability fund. They are being exempted from that fund. They do not \nhave to pay into the insurance fund that will help clean up when their \npipeline leaks. And they all leak. That is outrageous. You want \naccountability? Put forward the amendment that says they would have to \npay into the oilspill liability fund, the same as any other person or \ngroup pumping oil through a pipeline in the United States. Say that \nthey would be fully responsible for every bit of damage that local \ngovernments and State governments and the U.S. Government have to pay \nfor to compensate for the damage created by those oilspills. Let's hear \nsome responsibility and accountability from the proponents of this \npipeline, not this sweetheart deal for a Canadian company.\n  Tackling carbon pollution--global warming--is going to take an \nenormous amount of international cooperation. Just recently, the United \nStates and China entered into an agreement to address global climate \nchange. President Obama announced the goal of cutting American net \ngreenhouse gas emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. \nThe Chinese President announced that China would invest heavily in \nrenewable energy to generate 20 percent of China's energy from \nnonfossil sources by 2030 and would seek to decrease China's \nCO2 emissions thereafter.\n  These goals will require significant efforts by the United States and \nmassive investments by China. Do they go far enough? No, not in the \ncontext of the challenge faced because of our elevated carbon dioxide \nlevels around the world, but this agreement by the two biggest carbon \npolluters among nations is a significant step forward. It is the type \nof leadership the world has been asking for.\n  We cannot simply wish for nations to work together, we have to do our \npart. That is why we should be talking today not about how to turn on \nthe tap for the dirtiest oil on the planet but how to work with other \nnations to invest in energy conservation, to invest in non-fossil fuel \nrenewable energy.\n  Let's turn back to the test President Theodore Roosevelt put before \nus. He said that there is no more important mission than ``leaving this \nland even a better land for our descendents than it is for us.'' That \nis the challenge. Let's rise to that challenge.\n  Mr. President, let's rise to that challenge. Help lead your \ncolleagues--all of us--in stopping this assault on our farms, our \nfishing, and our forestry. Stop this sweetheart deal for a Canadian \ncompany, and let's substitute a real jobs bill, a rebuild America jobs \nbill that will create more than a hundredfold more construction jobs \nthan the jobs we have before us.\n  When we think about the complete lack of accountability and \nresponsibility embedded in this bill, when we think about the enormous \ndamage that comes from turning on the faucet to the dirtiest oil in the \nworld, there really is only one way to vote on this bill, and that is \nto vote no.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/13/senate-section/article/S174-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                         HELP Committee Agenda\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about the work\n\n[[Page S175]]\n\nof the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. It \nis an important committee. Senator Ted Kennedy, who served for many \nyears as the chairman of the HELP Committee, as we call it, once said \nthat the HELP Committee had 30 percent of the legislative jurisdiction \nof the Senate. If you think about it, health, education, labor, and \npensions--the work we do touches the lives of virtually every American.\n  During the last 2 years, I had the privilege of being the ranking \nRepublican on the committee. The Senator from Iowa, Tom Harkin, was the \nchairman. I think most people would agree we have as ideologically \ndiverse a committee as any committee in the Senate, but we worked very \nwell together. Where we disagreed, which was often, we simply stated \nour piece and we voted. But we looked for opportunities to agree, and \nlast Congress, we passed 25 bills through the committee that became \nlaw. I am not sure any other committee can say that.\n  I look forward to a similar productive working relationship with the \nSenator from Washington, Mrs. Murray. She is an experienced legislator, \ncares deeply about education, health, labor, and pensions, and has \nproven she knows how to successfully negotiate. We are operating today \nunder a budget agreement that she helped negotiate with Congressman \nPaul Ryan in the House. I am hopeful Senator Murray and I can work \ntogether in the same successful manner that I did with Senator Harkin \nlast Congress.\n  I have now visited with almost all of the members of the committee, \nDemocrat and Republican, and I feel confident we can successfully work \ntogether.\n  Here are my goals for the next 2 years. I have the privilege of being \nthe chairman of the committee. The job of the chairman is to set the \ncommittee's agenda and work with all members of the committee on that \nagenda. This Congress, all members, before and during hearings, will \nhave a full chance to discuss and amend legislation related to the \nagenda. When we report a bill to the floor, there will be an \nopportunity for a robust amendment process, as Senator McConnell has \nsaid. Then, I hope we will go to conference with the House of \nRepresentatives on our bill, where there will be further discussion. \nThe challenge in passing legislation is there will have to be 60 votes \nto move a bill out of the Senate, 60 votes to move to conference on the \nbill, and 60 votes to pass a bill in the end. To accomplish that takes \nworking with all Senators, including those on the other side of the \naisle.\n  I also know if we want a bill to become law, President Obama must \nsign it. On the major issues we plan to address, we hope to work with \nhim to gain his signature.\n  My first priority as chairman will be to fix No Child Left Behind. \nThe law is over 7 years expired, and we have been working to \nreauthorize it for 6 years. The law has become unworkable. States are \nstruggling. As a result, we need to act.\n  The Secretary of Education gave a fine speech yesterday saying we \nneed to act on No Child Left Behind. I agree with him. I intend to \nfinish this work in the first few months of this year.\n  Second, we need to reauthorize the Higher Education Act and \nderegulate higher education. We need to simplify and streamline the \nregulations that are imposed on 6,000 colleges and universities. One of \nthe committee members is Elizabeth Warren, the Senator from \nMassachusetts. When she was at the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau, she said she would like a one-page mortgage application. A \nmultipage mortgage application is not consumer friendly, but a two or \nthree page one provides the consumer with information in a more easily \nunderstood manner. I think we could do the same with the application \nfor federal aid, and there is substantial room for bipartisan agreement \non this in higher education.\n  Just last week, I introduced legislation with Senators Bennet of \nColorado, Booker of New Jersey, King of Maine, Isakson of Georgia and \nBurr of North Carolina, to make it easier for students to go to college \nby simplifying the complicated, dreaded FASFA. The FASFA is the 108-\nquestion application form that 20 million American families fill out \nevery year. The President talked about it on his visit to Tennessee on \nFriday. He also thinks it is too long and wants to simplify it. I think \nhigher education is an area on which we can work together in the Senate \nand with the President.\n  The third thing I would like to do is to modernize the Food and Drug \nAdministration. Now, there is a great opportunity, working with the \nHouse and with the President, to take a good look at the FDA, to take a \ngood look at the modern world of medical devices and personalized \nmedicines, and to say: What do we need to do to make it easier to get \ntreatments, medical devices, and cures through the FDA process quickly \nand effectively while ensuring those treatments, medical devices, and \ncures are safe so they can help people? This sort of work literally \nwould affect every single American.\n  Fixing No Child Left Behind would affect 50 million schoolchildren, \nmillions of teachers, and 100,000 public schools. Reauthorizing the \nHigher Education Act and making its regulations simpler would affect \n6,000 institutions of all kinds and over 20 million students across \nthis country. If we worked together with the House and the President to \nreform the FDA, we could affect the lives of every American and people \nall over the world by the kinds of treatments and devices and cures we \nbring to market.\n  Those are my top 3 priorities. Of course, we also want to deal with \nthe Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare. On this side of the aisle, we \nwould like to repeal it, and I am sure there will be that vote. I also \nhope, in the words of the Senator from Wisconsin, Ron Johnson, we move \nas rapidly and as responsibly as we can to repair the damage that \nObamaCare has done. One example to improve ObamaCare would be to \nredefine full-time work from 30 hours to 40 hours. That would give \nabout 2.5 million low-wage employees in America a pretty big pay raise \nwhen they go from 27 hours or 28 hours to 37 or 38 hours, which is what \nthey would be able to do if full-time work were defined, as it is for \neverything else, as 40 hours.\n  We will have our first hearing on that on a bipartisan bill in the \nHELP Committee on next Thursday--a week from Thursday. It is a bill \nintroduced by Senators Collins, Murkowski, Donnelly, and Manchin. It is \na bipartisan bill.\n  Our committee has a great interest in this bill. The technical \njurisdiction is with the Finance Committee. But by agreement with the \nFinance Committee, we will have this hearing, and then we will send to \nthe Finance Committee our opinions, and it will be up to the Finance \nCommittee how to report the bill, whether to report it, or what version \nof it to report. It helps, at least on the Republican side of the \naisle, that six of the members of the Finance Committee are also \nmembers of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n  Mr. President, let me talk about the first item on the HELP Committee \nagenda; the plan to fix No Child Left Behind.\n  I see the Senator from Washington on the floor today. She will be \nspeaking next, and I look forward to hearing her comments. I said \nbefore she came to the floor how much I look forward to working with \nher. She is an experienced legislator, proven leader, and has a \ndemonstrated record of results. I hope we are able to work together to \npass No Child Left Behind.\n  No Child Left Behind was passed in 2001--a year before I became a \nSenator. It has become unworkable because Congress and the President \nfailed to reauthorize and amend the law when it expired over 7 years \nago.\n  Under the terms of the law, the original provisions continue, but \nthat is what has made it unworkable. Those original provisions, if \nstrictly applied, would label as a failing school almost every one of \nour 100,000 public schools. This is clearly an unintended result of the \nthose who passed No Child Left Behind.\n  To avoid that unintended result, the U.S. Secretary of Education has \ngranted waivers from the law's provisions to 42 States, the District of \nColumbia, and Puerto Rico. This has created a second unintended \nconsequence. In exchange for the waiver, the Secretary has told those \nStates what their academic standards should be, what accountability \nsystems they should use to set\n\n[[Page S176]]\n\nperformance standards, how many and what tests shall be used to measure \nthe progress of students, how to evaluate teachers, and how to identify \nand intervene in low-performing schools. The Department has become, in \neffect, a national school board.\n  We have been working over the last 6 years to fix the problems of No \nChild Left Behind. Over the last 6 years, the Senate HELP Committee \nheld two dozen hearings on No Child Left Behind and K-12 education. \nTwice the committee reported legislation to the Senate floor. In the \nCongress before last, we reported the Democratic majority's bill. I did \nnot particularly like it, but Senator Kirk, Senator Enzi, and I all \nvoted for it so we could move it to the floor, continue to work on it, \nand then replace the law. But it did not come to the floor. In the last \nsession of Congress, the committee reported a bill again.\n  This Congress, we need to start with a specific proposal. I will put \nforward a Chairman's staff discussion draft, consult with all the \nmembers of the committee on the proposal, and see if we can ultimately \nget bipartisan agreement on the proposal.\n  I have already distributed to all the committee members, Republican \nand Democrat, copies of the Chairman's staff discussion draft. This is \nnot a chairman's bill; it is not a Republican bill; it is the \nChairman's staff discussion draft put forward as a place to start \ndiscussions.\n  We would like for staff of the various members of the committee to \nmeet every day for the rest of this week and next week. They can \ndiscuss and provide feedback on each section of the bill. This will \nhelp determine areas where we agree and disagree.\n  Former Chairman George Miller gave some good advice on fixing No \nChild Left Behind. He said: Let's pass a lean bill to fix No Child Left \nBehind. Discussions have highlighted there are about eight or nine \nproblems with the law. We probably can agree quickly on about four or \nfive of those problems. There are real differences of opinion on the \nother three or four areas. I hope we can come to agreement on those \nissues in the committee, and I am going to do my best to lead that \nprocess. I am willing to spend all the time we need over the next \nseveral weeks to reach agreement.\n  If we cannot reach agreement in committee, then we should vote on a \nbill, and bring that bill to the floor. We can amend the bill there, \nand pass it with 60 votes. Then we can go to conference with the House, \nand ultimately send a bill to the President for him to sign.\n  I look forward to the process. A week from tomorrow, we will hold a \nhearing on testing and accountability. Every member of the committee is \ninterested in this topic. Here are the questions to be examined in the \nhearing: are there too many tests? Who should decide how many and what \ntests should be administered? We need to answer some questions before \nwe make decision to be put into a bill. In the Chairman's staff \ndiscussion draft I have circulated, I have included two options for \ndiscussion: current law testing requirements and another option that \ngives more flexibility to the States to decide what to do on testing.\n  On fixing No Child Left Behind, I plan to set realistic goals, keep \nthe best portions of the law, and restore to States and communities the \nresponsibility to decide whether schools and teachers are succeeding or \nfailing.\n  The Chairman's staff discussion draft relies on and respects the 30 \nyears of work by Governors and chief State school officers to develop \nhigher standards, better tests, stronger accountability systems, and \nfair and effective teacher and principal evaluation programs that will \nallow parents and communities to know how children in our country's \npublic schools are performing.\n  I have watched the development of goals, standards, tests, and \nteacher evaluation systems for a long period of time. I was Governor of \nTennessee in 1983 when Secretary Terrell Bell in the Reagan \nadministration issued a report called: ``A Nation at Risk.'' The report \nsaid that if a foreign country had created schools in the condition of \nour nation's schools, we would have considered it an act of war. At \nthis time, Governors all over the country were working to fix state \neducation systems, understanding that while the Federal Government has \nsome involvement in elementary and secondary education, it only pays \nfor about 12 percent of state budgets. Most Americans feel as though \nthey should be in charge of their local schools, not Washington.\n  In 1985 and 1986, every Governor spent an entire year focused on \nimproving schools--the first time in the history of the Governors \nassociation that it happened. I was chairman of the National Governors \nAssociation that year. The Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton, was the \nvice chairman.\n  In 1989, the first President Bush held a national meeting of \nGovernors and established national education goals. Then in 1991-1992, \nPresident Bush announced Goals 2000 to help move the nation toward \nthose goals. I was the Education Secretary at that time. States worked \ntogether to develop challenging education standards that were \nvoluntary. States discussed teacher evaluation systems that were \nadopted by states such as Tennessee. In 1984, Tennessee became the \nfirst State to pay teachers more for teaching well. Washington did not \ndictate to Tennessee how to pay its teachers based on performance and \nother States began to model teacher policies in the same way. Governors \nbegan to work together on higher standards, on accountability systems, \nand on teacher evaluation systems.\n  President George W. Bush brought many of his education ideas as \nGovernor of Texas to Washington. A large portion of those ideas were \nincluded in No Child Left Behind, such as the requirement for annual \ntesting to determine student achievement in every school and \ndisaggregated reporting.\n  President Obama created Race to the Top to give States incentives to \nadopt certain standards and certain tests and certain teacher \nevaluation systems. Since much of No Child Left Behind became \nunworkable in his term, Secretary Duncan provided waivers to certain \naspects of the law in exchange for telling states and districts what \ntheir academic standards should be, what their accountability system \nshould be, how to evaluate teachers, and how to intervene in low-\nperforming schools.\n  These actions have created, in essence, a national school board. We \nneed to reverse the trend toward a national school board and put \nresponsibilities for education back with States and local communities. \nThere is a difference of opinion about the proper balance between the \nfederal and state role in education. I hope we can come to agreement on \nthat balance in the committee. We need to start discussions. We have \nbeen working on fixing No Child Left Behind for 6 years, have held \nmultiple hearings, and have reported a bill twice to the floor. 20 of \nthe 22 members of the committee were members last year when we had \nhearings and reported a bill.\n  I think we need to identify the seven or eight issues to fix in the \nlaw, discuss each other's points of view, and see if we can fix No \nChild Left Behind. I look forward to that process.\n  The chairman's staff's discussion draft, already distributed to \ncommittee members today, will be on the committee Web site tonight so \nthat people can see it. We will solicit feedback. Staff will work \ntogether over the next few weeks, Senators will talk, and we will see \nwe can turn that discussion draft into a bipartisan bill. If we can, we \nwill mark it up in committee, have amendments, and see if we can get a \nbipartisan result. We will then bring it to the floor for further \ndiscussion and debate. If we can't get a bipartisan bill in committee, \nwe will still bring a bill to the floor knowing we will have to get a \nbipartisan vote to get it off the floor.\n  I am ready to get started on this process. I have talked to almost \nall my colleagues on the committee, and I believe they are as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks a list of the nine problems the chairman's staff \ndiscussion draft identifies as the problems we should work on in trying \nto fix No Child Left Behind. These problems generally come from the \ndiscussions we have had over the last 6 years with the House of \nRepresentatives, and with the Secretary of Education. Identifying and \ndiscussing these problems should help us move along more rapidly.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S177]]\n\n                 A Plan To Fix ``No Child Left Behind''\n\n       ``No Child Left Behind'' (NCLB) was passed in 2001. It has \n     become unworkable because Congress and the President failed \n     to reauthorize and amend the law when it expired over seven \n     years ago. NCLB's original provisions, which continue in \n     place today, would label as a ``failing school'' almost all \n     of America's 100,000 public schools. To avoid this unintended \n     result, the U.S. Secretary of Education has granted waivers \n     from the law's provisions to 42 states, the District of \n     Columbia, and Puerto Rico. This has created another \n     unintended result: in exchange for the waiver, the Secretary \n     has told these states what their academic standards should \n     be, what accountability systems shall be used to set \n     performance standards, how many and what tests shall be used \n     to measure the progress of students, how to evaluate teachers \n     and how to identify and intervene in low performing schools.\n       The Department has become, in effect, a national school \n     board.\n       For the last six years, the Senate and the House have \n     worked together to try to fix ``No Child Left Behind'' In \n     each of the last two Congresses, the Senate HELP Committee \n     has held numerous hearings and reported legislation to fix \n     the problems with ``No Child Left Behind.'' In 2015, the \n     Senate HELP Committee will spend the first six weeks \n     concluding this work and, in former Rep. George Miller's \n     words, report a ``lean bill fixing No Child Left Behind'' \n     ready to move to the Senate floor on Feb 23. The House of \n     Representatives is pursuing a similar schedule.\n       The plan is to set realistic goals, keep the best portions \n     of the original law, and restore to states and local \n     communities the responsibility to decide whether local \n     schools and teachers are succeeding or failing. The HELP \n     Committee's bill will seek to build on thirty years of work \n     by governors and chief state school officers to develop \n     higher standards, better tests, stronger accountability \n     systems, and fair and effective teacher and principal \n     evaluation programs that will allow parents and communities \n     to know how children in our country's public schools are \n     performing.\n       1. New Goals--The 2001 goal is unworkable. Set new, \n     realistic but challenging goals to help all students succeed.\n       2. High Standards--Require states to have high and \n     challenging standards that promote college and career \n     readiness for all students, but the federal government may \n     not dictate or get involved with what those standards should \n     be, or require states to submit their standards to the \n     federal government for review or approval.\n       3. Reporting Progress Toward State Standards--Continue and \n     improve disaggregated school-by-school reporting so that \n     parents, teachers, schools, legislators, and communities know \n     what progress schools are making.\n       4. State Accountability Systems--Free all public schools \n     from the federal requirement of conforming to a federally-\n     defined adequate yearly progress mandate and, in exchange, \n     require states to establish accountability systems to measure \n     school performance toward meeting the each state's standards.\n       5. Federal Support for the Lowest-Performing Schools--The \n     federal government will continue to support states and local \n     school districts in fixing schools that states determine are \n     lowest performing.\n       6. Better Teaching--Encourage the creation of state and \n     local school district teacher and principal evaluation \n     systems, but the federal government may not dictate or get \n     involved with the design of those systems. This will replace \n     the current federal ``highly qualified teacher'' \n     requirements.\n       7. More Local Authority To Transfer Federal Funds--Allow \n     school districts to transfer funds more efficiently among the \n     largest federal education programs.\n       8. Consolidate and Streamline Programs--Consolidate and \n     streamline more than 60 programs within NCLB. Eliminate those \n     that are duplicative.\n       9. Empower Parents--Encourage the creation and expansion of \n     high-quality charter schools that give teachers more freedom \n     to teach and opportunities that give parents more choices of \n     schools for their children.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, a century ago, President Lyndon Johnson \nreturned to his old elementary school in rural Texas with a major piece \nof legislation. At a picnic table on the lawn of his school and sitting \nbeside his very first teacher, President Johnson signed into law the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, or ESEA.\n  Our Nation has always held the ideal of education for everyone. In \n1786, Thomas Jefferson wrote:\n\n       By far the most important bill in our whole code is that \n     for the diffusion of knowledge among the people. No other \n     sure foundation can be devised for the preservation of \n     freedom and happiness.\n\n  The idea of a strong public education for every child was woven into \nthe fabric of this Nation. But ESEA put that idea into action. It aimed \nto close the gaps between rich and poor, Black and White, children \ngrowing up in the crowded neighborhoods of Philadelphia, to the rural \ndistricts of Texas, children with every advantage in the world and kids \nwith disabilities. This law moved our country in the right direction, \nbut we still have a long way to go to close those gaps.\n  In the coming weeks and months, Congress will have the opportunity to \nmake sure we continue moving our country toward this ideal and to work \ntogether to fix the broken No Child Left Behind law, because we as a \nnation still believe every student should have access to a quality \npublic education, regardless of where they live or how they learn or \nhow much money their parents make.\n  Education and fighting on behalf of children is what drew me to \npublic service in the very first place. When my kids were much younger, \nI found out their wonderful preschool program might close because of \nbudget cuts. I knew how valuable that program was and how much it was \nhelping our local children, so I put my two young kids in my car and I \ndrove off to the State capitol to explain to our legislators why they \ncouldn't just cut this program. When I got there and was finally able \nto get one of the legislators to listen to me, he said something I will \nnever forget. He said to me: You can't make a difference. You are just \na mom in tennis shoes.\n  Well, I couldn't believe that, and I was furious. I drove all the way \nhome telling my two little kids in the car that I was going to change \nthat. So I got home, picked up the phone and started calling other \nparents, and they called other parents, and we held rallies, and we \nwrote letters. Finally, after it was all said and done, the legislature \nvoted to keep the funding for that preschool program.\n  Throughout my career, as a preschool teacher, to serving on the local \nschool board, the Washington State Senate, and here in the U.S. Senate, \nI have been committed to expanding educational opportunities and making \nsure every kid has someone fighting for them and their future. But that \nbattle is far from over. Now is the time to take another big step \nforward, putting the ideals of our Nation into action.\n  The current law, No Child Left Behind, is badly broken and it is time \nto fix it. The good news is this doesn't have to be a partisan issue. \nNearly everyone--Democrats, Republicans, teachers, parents, business \nleaders--agrees this law needs to be rewritten. So today I wanted to \ncome to the floor to lay out some pretty basic but very important \nprinciples I think should guide any bill to fix No Child Left Behind.\n  For one, we need to work to reduce redundant and unnecessary testing \nso educators focus on preparing students for college and their career \nand also ensure we know how all of our students are progressing. We \nneed to continue to hold schools and States accountable for delivering \non the promise of a quality education for all our kids so they can \ncompete in the 21st century economy. We need to improve our schools and \ngive them the resources they need so every student does have the \nopportunity to reach their potential. And I believe we need to expand \naccess to early childhood education so students can go to kindergarten \nready to learn.\n  What is clear to nearly everyone is that No Child Left Behind is not \nworking. For one, the law requires States to set high standards for \nschools, but it didn't give them the resources they needed to meet \nthose achievement goals. In effect, this law set up our schools for \nfailure. It sets teachers up for failure. It set our students up for \nfailure. That needs to change.\n  I have heard from parent after parent and teacher after teacher in \nWashington State who have told me that not only are students taking too \nmany tests, oftentimes the tests are of low quality and are redundant. \nThat needs to change too.\n  We are still facing inequality in our education system, where some \nschools simply don't offer the same opportunities. For example, \nAfrican-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to \nattend a high school that offers advanced math classes. According to \nthe Department of Education, 30 percent fewer students from low-income \nbackgrounds reach proficiency or higher on assessments compared to \ntheir peers of affluent backgrounds. On average, kids from low-income \nneighborhoods don't have access to qualified\n\n[[Page S178]]\n\nand experienced teachers, as do students from wealthier neighborhoods. \nThat needs to change.\n\n  The current law is not working for our States either. I have seen \nfirsthand how No Child Left Behind is not working for my State of \nWashington. The law is so bad the Obama administration began issuing \nwaivers to exempt States from the law's requirements. Washington State \nhad received a waiver but last year it lost it. As a result, most of \nthe schools in my home State are now categorized as failing. That means \nthat hard-working parents sending their kids to schools in communities \nsuch as Spokane in eastern Washington, the Tri-Cities in central \nWashington, and Seattle, Tacoma, Everett, and many others in western \nWashington are receiving a letter in the mail that says their children \naren't getting the type of education we expect in this country.\n  Not only that, but Washington now has less flexibility in how to use \nFederal investments in education. That needs to change.\n  I recently heard from a woman--her name is Lillian, who lives in \nShoreline, WA--last year whose son was going into the fourth grade in \nthe same school district where I used to serve as a school board member \nyears ago. Her son has a learning disability. With the help of teachers \nand specialists in his elementary school he has shown great signs of \nprogress. But then Lillian said she got a letter in the mail 2 weeks \nbefore school started describing the school as failing, and that left \nher worried about her son's education.\n  Because No Child Left Behind is broken, so many parents and schools \nand districts across the State of Washington are facing a similar \nuncertainty, and that is not fair to our students. That needs to change \ntoo.\n  It is time to rewrite No Child Left Behind with something worthy of \nthis Nation's children and their future. In the coming weeks and \nmonths, these are some of the core principles I am going to be fighting \nfor. Let us work with our States and districts to reduce unnecessary \ntesting, especially by targeting redundant and low-quality tests. This \nis an obvious step we need to take and one you won't find much \ndisagreement on.\n  That doesn't mean we should roll back standards or accountability for \nschools to provide a good quality education. We need to make sure we \nestablish expectations for our students that put them on a path to \ncompeting in the 21st century global economy.\n  And let me be clear on assessments. We know if we don't have ways to \nmeasure students' progress, and if we don't hold our States \naccountable, the victims will invariably be the kids from poor \nneighborhoods, children of color, and students with disabilities. These \nare the students who too often fall through the cracks, and that is not \nfair. True accountability makes sure we are holding our schools up to \nour Nation's promise of equality and justice. This is a civil rights \nissue, plain and simple.\n  Another reason assessments are important is they help parents monitor \ntheir kids' progress. If a school is consistently failing to provide a \nquality education year after year, parents deserve to know. We \nshouldn't forget this law provides the Nation's largest Federal \ninvestment in K-12 education. It would be irresponsible to ask our \ntaxpayers to spend billions of dollars on education without knowing if \nit is making a difference in our students' lives. That is a good \ngovernment principle which Democrats and Republicans should be able to \nagree on and which the taxpayers should have every right to expect.\n\n  So let's maintain strong accountability that measures the students' \ngrowth with statewide assessments. I believe annual assessments are one \nof the most important tools we have to make sure our schools are \nworking for every student. We need to make sure these assessments don't \nlead to unintended consequences. But I would be very concerned about \nany proposal that rolls back this key student and taxpayer protection \nand accountability tool.\n  I believe we need statewide assessments that give parents, civil \nrights groups, and policymakers the ability to see how students are \ndoing from district to district.\n  Furthermore, to make sure we are meeting our obligations to all of \nour students, let's increase funding for schools that have high numbers \nof children from low-income backgrounds. Rich or poor, every child \nshould get a high-quality education.\n  The ones who are on the frontlines of this noble work--let's make \nsure our teachers and principals have the resources they deserve to \ncontinue to build their skills so they can best help the students about \nwhom they care so much. Let's improve schools through innovation and \nwith coursework that challenges our students--not just so they earn a \ndiploma but so their diploma means they are truly college- and career-\nready.\n  I believe Congress should only pass an education bill that expands \naccess to preschool programs. This is a particularly important issue to \nme. As a mom and when I was a preschool teacher, I saw firsthand the \nkind of transformation early learning can inspire in a child not just \nto start kindergarten ready to learn but to succeed later in life. That \nis why law enforcement, business groups, military leaders, and so many \nothers support expanding access to early childhood education.\n  Congress needs to catch up with the Democratic and Republican \nGovernors and legislators around the country who support investments in \nearly learning, and we need to make sure the investments in our \nyoungest kids that will pay off for generations to come are part of \nthis bill.\n  Those are just some of the core principles I am going to be focused \non as we work together to revamp our Education bill.\n  Providing an excellent education to all students is a national \npriority--not just because our children deserve it but because it is \none of the best investments we can make to ensure long-term and broad-\nbased economic growth. Businesses and entrepreneurs need the next \ngeneration of workers to come in and help them innovate, invent, build, \nand grow. That is something I hear from my Washington State businesses \nall the time.\n  Making sure all students are able to take on the jobs of the 21st \ncentury is the only way our Nation will stay economically competitive \nin the years to come. Other countries are investing massively in \neducation and their students, and we cannot afford to fall behind in \nthis country.\n  Let me be clear on another point. The only way Congress will be able \nto fix this law is by working in a bipartisan way. That means \nRepublicans should come to the table ready to work with Democrats to \nget this done. I know the Republicans are the majority in the Congress, \nand I welcome our new committee chair, Senator Alexander. I listened \ncarefully to his remarks and thank him for reaching out to begin this \nprocess. But parents across the country are expecting us to put \npartisanship aside and work together for the good of our children.\n  Secretary Duncan, President Obama, and so many of us here in Congress \nhave made it very clear that we aren't going to accept a bill that \nhurts students or doesn't live up to the ideals of our great Nation.\n  There is no question, as Senator Alexander said, that there are some \nserious differences in the way the two parties approach this, but I am \nconfident, just as we did with the budget last Congress, we can find \ncommon ground and move forward if both sides are willing to leave their \npartisan corners and work across the aisle. Everyone should be able to \nagree that this law needs to provide every student in every school in \nevery State with a quality education, and that is what I am going to be \nfighting for.\n  When President Johnson signed the Education bill, he said he \nenvisioned ``full educational opportunity as our first national goal.'' \nOur Nation's commitment to that ideal is so important to me and my \nfamily. I would not be here in this Senate Chamber without it. When I \nwas 15 years old, my dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. In just \na few short years he could no longer work at the five-and-dime store he \nran. Without warning, my family fell on hard times. But instead of \nfalling through the cracks, my six brothers and sisters and I got a \ngood education because of our public schools, and we all went to \ncollege with the support from the program we now know as Pell grants. \nMy mother was\n\n[[Page S179]]\n\nable to get the skills she needed to get a job through a worker \ntraining program at Lake Washington Vocational School.\n  Today I believe we need to continue to make education a national \npriority so more families can seize the opportunities that are only \npossible with access to a good education. So I am glad to be here on \nthe floor today with the chairman of our committee, and I call on \nDemocrats and Republicans to work together to fix this law.\n  For the child who may not live in the best neighborhood or the kid \nwhose parents are struggling to make ends meet, for every student who \ndeserves the chance to learn, grow, and thrive--I hope we can work \ntogether to write a bill to make sure every child in this country gets \na quality education. Let's make sure our country continues to have the \nbest workforce the world over. Let's deliver on Jefferson's promise of \neducation as the foundation for freedom and happiness.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Washington for her remarks. \nIn the spirit of her remarks, I am delighted to have the privilege of \nworking with her in Congress because of her leadership position, her \nbackground, her caring for children, and her reputation for getting \nresults. I like all of those things.\n  I neglected to mention that our first hearing will be on the 21st--a \nweek from Wednesday--on testing and accountability. I am working with \nSenator Murray to see if perhaps we can agree on the witnesses. The \npurpose of the hearing is to ask the questions she asked: Are these the \nright tests? Are they redundant tests? Are there too many tests? What \nare we hearing from across the country?\n  I thank the Senator for her comments. I took careful notes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                            Law Enforcement\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the law enforcement \nin Pennsylvania and throughout the country.\n  We just finished the holiday season, and in my family--as with many \nof us, I am sure--we had a wonderful Christmas in our homes, had a \nwonderful meal, and got to watch the kids open their presents.\n  There are a lot of Pennsylvanians and Americans who didn't have the \nchance to do what we got to enjoy, and they were the law enforcement \nmen and women who were out on the streets, in the cold, protecting us \nas they do day in and day out because their work goes on 24/7, 365 days \na year.\n  Just this past Saturday a number of us gathered on Independence Mall \nin Philadelphia. Several hundred people braved a very cold and windy \nday to let the law enforcement officials of Pennsylvania and beyond \nknow just how much we appreciate the sacrifice they make for us day in \nand day out. We had a terrific turnout. It was a very enthusiastic \ncrowd who rallied in support of our police officers.\n  But being a police officer is not just often inconvenient; sometimes \nit is very dangerous. Last year 115 police officers died in the line of \nduty. So far we are 13 days into a new year and 10 officers have \nalready been shot and wounded.\n  Often these police officers have been targeted and shot just because \nof the uniform they wear. Unfortunately, Pennsylvania is not immune to \nthis problem. Last year on September 12, late at night, two \nPennsylvania State troopers were coming in for their shift at work, and \nEric Frein was lying in wait, hiding in the woods, with a high-powered \nrifle. He shot and killed Corporal Bryon Dickson, and he shot Trooper \nAlex Douglass, who was grievously wounded. The killer, Eric Frein, \ndidn't know either Corporal Dickson or Trooper Douglass; he shot the \ntwo police officers simply because they were police officers. He \nthought that somehow by killing a cop he would help spark a revolution. \nSuch is the madness police officers have to face on a regular basis. On \nany given day they don't know that they won't run into that kind of \ninsanity.\n  It is important for us to remember that these victims--in this case, \nCorporal Dickson--aren't just numbers and badges. Corporal Dickson was \na dad, the father of two young boys. He used to enjoy making toys for \nhis sons. He was a devoted husband who had recently celebrated his 10th \nwedding anniversary. He was a proud Marine Corps veteran.\n  I am proud, as Pennsylvanians generally are, of the response of law \nenforcement to the savage and despicable shooting of these two State \ntroopers. Officers from all across Pennsylvania and surrounding States \nand even around the country joined in a very intensive, tireless, 7-\nweek-long manhunt. In the end they found Eric Frein, and they brought \nhim into custody wearing the handcuffs of Corporal Dickson. He will \nmeet justice.\n  But, of course, the story doesn't end there. There was another \nterrible tragedy just last month in Brooklyn. Just 5 days before \nChristmas, Officer Rafael Ramos and Officer Wenjian Liu were both \nmurdered in the line of duty. In the middle of the afternoon, in broad \ndaylight, a gunman approached their marked police vehicle while they \nsat in the vehicle and shot each police officer point-blank range in \nthe head, killing them both instantly. The motivation of the gunman was \nvery clear: He just wanted to kill any police officer he could. That \nday, the gunman posted messages such as ``They Take 1 of Ours . . . \nLet's Take 2 of Theirs.'' Another message he posted used the hashtag \nadvocating ``Shoot the Police.''\n  Officers Ramos and Liu were not just nameless people in uniforms \neither.\n  Officer Ramos was described by his family and friends ``as a Puerto \nRican kid who grew up on these streets'' in Queens and never stopped \ntrying to help the people in his community. Officer Ramos had spent the \nlast 10 years of his life studying to become a chaplain. He was \nmurdered just an hour before his graduation ceremony. Office Ramos \njoined the police force at the age of 37. He explained that he saw the \nstreets as his ministry and that by protecting and serving his \ncommunity, he was serving God as well. Office Ramos left behind his \nwife and two sons, 19-year-old Jaden and 13-year-old Justin.\n  Officer Liu was the other victim that day. In many ways, Officer Liu \nwas the epitome of the American dream. He was a young boy who at age 12 \ncame from China to America with his family. He was a teenage boy who \nleft playground basketball games occasionally so he could do the \nshopping for his family's groceries. He was a young man who was so \ninspired by the heroism he saw on September 11 that he decided he would \nbecome a police officer. He was the police officer who called home \nevery night to let his dad know he had finished a day of work safely--\nevery night, that is, except December 20, when the phone call never \ncame. Officer Liu is survived by his wife, whom he married just 3 \nmonths before.\n  The response of law enforcement to the savage murders of Officer \nRamos and Officer Liu should make every American proud. Over 25,000 \npolice officers traveled from across America and from parts of Canada \nto attend the funeral services last month.\n  We can never really fully repay the debt of the men and women who \nsacrifice their very lives protecting us, but there are small things we \ncan do to help the families they leave behind. I want to call on \nCongress to take one small step toward that goal. We should pass the \nChildren of Fallen Heroes Scholarship Act, and we should do so soon.\n  The Children of Fallen Heroes Scholarship Act simply provides that \nany child whose parent dies in the line of duty as a member of the \narmed services or as a public safety officer would be entitled to the \nmaximum permissible scholarship under the Pell Grant Program for their \nattendance in college.\n  Five years ago the House of Representatives unanimously passed this \nlegislation. My fellow Pennsylvanian Senator Bob Casey plans to \nreintroduce this legislation. I would be cosponsoring this legislation, \nand I call on Congress to pick up where it left off back in 2010 and \nenact the Children of Fallen Heroes Scholarship Act.\n  I also want to take a moment to address the recent spate of protests \nwe have seen. People have gone out on to the streets and across the \ncountry, often harshly criticizing the officers. I want to be clear, if \npeople want to protest, they have the right to protest; and I would \nnever challenge their right to say what is on their minds or to convey \nwhatever message they would like\n\n[[Page S180]]\n\nto convey. But I would hope they would keep a few basic facts in mind \nas they consider, or in fact carry out, the protests.\n  No. 1, any human institution is going to be imperfect. That is the \nnature of humanity. It consists of human beings. So it therefore will \nbe imperfect. But the fact is that the overwhelming majority of police \nofficers are honest, hard working, decent Americans, and they are \nmotivated by the desire to serve and protect the community in which \nthey live, and they don't have a racist bone in their bodies.\n  So my message to law enforcement is I understand how demoralizing it \nmust have been recently to see some of these protests, to hear some of \nthe outrageous and slanderous statements that have been made. But these \nprotestors don't speak for most Americans. The fact is, a big majority \nof Pennsylvanians and, I suspect, a big majority of Americans know that \nevery day 780,000 men and women across America who put on their blue \nuniforms and put on their badges are answering to the call of the \npeople in need when they need them the most, and they put themselves in \ngreat danger to serve all of us. When other people choose to run away \nfrom danger, they are the ones who have to run toward it.\n  So just as the law enforcement community has stood by the families of \nall the victims, and that of Officer Dickson, Officer Ramos, and \nOfficer Liu, I want you to know that America stands with you.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. First, I would like to thank my colleague from \nPennsylvania for his thoughtful remarks. As one who has been involved \nin law enforcement for a number of years and having great friends in \nthe law enforcement community, I am well aware of what their duties are \nlike.\n  I remember we had a dangerous event here at our Capitol, and one of \nthe police officers raced around the building to the scene of the \nevent. Did he know what could happen to him? Could there be a team of \nterrorists waiting to assassinate him when he came around that corner?\n  What if a police officer responds to a domestic violence call at the \na home? They don't know what is behind that door and what might happen \nto them. It is a tough job. They have a right to come home to their \nfamily and their children. They do not have to allow themselves to be \nmurdered by someone who is a danger. It is a tough issue. Police \ndepartments work at it very hard.\n  I thank Senator Toomey for his beautiful remarks. I think they are \nvery appropriate at this time.\n  Mr. President, with regard to the Keystone Pipeline issue and the \ndiscussion we have been having here, I want to associate myself with a \nseries of very important and balanced concerns raised in support of \nthat pipeline.\n  We have pipelines that criss-cross my State, as the Presiding Officer \ndoes in Oklahoma. We don't have problems with them. I cannot remember \nwhen somebody raised a problem, environmentally, about a pipeline. We \nknow they are less likely to cause environmental damage than \ntransportation by train or truck. We know they are less likely to be \naccessed. We know there is less energy consumed in that process. So I \nwant to associate myself with that.\n  But there is something that has been bothering me for quite a long \ntime, and I want to raise that point today because I think it is so \nvalid and I think it is important for all of us to understand. The \nreason this Senator and I think others have advocated for more \nproduction of American energy, advocated for these issues and for more \nproduction is not to benefit some oil company, as we have been wrongly \naccused, not to benefit some rich group, it is to benefit the American \nconsumer. The more energy we produce in America, the more the American \npeople benefit.\n  We import a great deal of oil today. It is less now because we are \nproducing more through the new technology of fracking and other \ntechnology. We have seen a reduction in the amount we import. Much of \nit has been imported from places such as Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and \nLibya--many places with which we have not had very good relations. So \nwe have made a transfer of wealth from the American people to foreign \nnations--weakening us and strengthening them. Many of them have not \nbeen friendly to us over the years, as I have said. So we have a choice \nin this vote to help supply a shortage we have from our--perhaps--\nclosest ally in the world, Canada.\n  I was at the Canadian-American Interparliamentary Group. I was \nsurprised how deeply our Canadian friends feel about this pipeline. \nThey cannot imagine why we wouldn't want to buy oil from them as \nopposed to other countries around the world. They purchase all kinds of \nproducts from us. We have a good, fair, and honest trading relationship \nwith Canada. They support us throughout the world, consistently in the \nU.N. and in other places, on important issues--important to the \nAmerican people. We have so many common interests.\n  No. 1, I just want to say if we are going to import oil from around \nthe world to meet our needs, there is no better country we could ever \nchoose to import from than Canada, our friend and neighbor.\n  No. 2, it has been said that this is being done to help some big \nbusiness. That is not the way this system works. In a free market \nsystem, bringing in this oil provides another source of oil for \nconsumers. They don't have to buy the Canadian oil if it is not \ncheaper. They wouldn't build this pipeline if they didn't think they \ncould sell the oil cheaper than Saudi Arabia and Venezuela could \nproduce it or even America could produce it. They believe they can sell \nit, and they have to sell it for a lower cost or they won't sell it.\n  What would the lower cost mean? It means good things for mothers, for \nchildren, for families, and for businesses. All over America we have \nlower cost energy to make America a stronger, more vibrant world-class \neconomy. We are able to compete in the world market if our energy costs \nare below other nation's energy costs. It helps us overcome the wage \ndifferences that Americans have compared to other places around the \nworld. This reliable source of energy is important.\n  I guess what I wish to say to my colleagues is that this is an \nopportunity for us to make a statement. The statement is we are going \nto help the American people by reducing the cost of their energy so \nthey may have more money each month to maybe go out to a movie, to go \nout to eat--and it can make quite a difference.\n  Well, they say the price is fixed. You know, these guys have got \nthese powers, and try to manipulate prices. I don't deny that goes on \nin the world. But one of the most powerful forces in the world is \nsupply and demand. If the oil companies are so powerful, why has oil \nfallen from $110 a barrel this summer to now $46 a barrel today? Why \ndid this happen? Because there is a supply from fracking, from other \nsources around the world. It has brought up the supply, created some \nsurplus, and the prices have collapsed. There are a lot of oil \ncompanies out there that are hurting today.\n  So if you don't like big oil and you don't like the big oil \ncompanies, why would you want to oppose importing oil that would be \ncheaper? This is the way the free market system works. I would say the \nmarket system is working. I saw an expert yesterday in Barron's \nindicating that oil could fall to $20 a barrel. That would be great for \nthe American consumer.\n  I spoke with an oilman. I teased him a little bit. I said: I hope you \nsaved some money, because I like this low-priced oil. Don't come in \nhere and ask me to have oil go up on my constituents, on American \nconsumers.\n  I mean, I appreciate the fact that people go out there and they drill \nthese multimillion dollar wells and sometimes they are dry and \nsometimes they hit. That is the great American free market system. Some \npeople have gotten rich. A lot of them have gone broke. There has been \nboom and bust in the oil industry since the beginning of time, as it is \ndocumented by Daniel Yergin in the book ``The Prize'' and by other \nwriters. This is the way it has always been.\n  We benefit when the price falls, and importing a good source of oil \nfrom our neighbor Canada at a competitive price provides one more \nsource that helps keep the price down and gives more options to the \nAmerican people. It is the\n\n[[Page S181]]\n\nright thing to do, colleagues. I cannot imagine that we would want to \nfavor importation of oil from other countries over Canada.\n  I believe we should go forward with this, and I am concerned that the \nPresident and his allies are not in agreement. But look, this is a true \nfact, as many of us who have been involved in these issues for several \nyears have come to understand. There is a large group of folks out \nthere--activists, environmental extremists, and not just good \nenvironmentalists but people who have extreme views--who want the price \nof energy to go up. President Obama even said it in the campaign when \nhe ran the first time. He said the price of electricity would \nnecessarily skyrocket. That is not my policy. That is not the policy of \na good public servant, in my view, for America, for the American \nworkers. Personally, I want the electric bill as low as we could \npossibly keep it, consistent with good environmental and clean \nactivities, and I want that gasoline bill as low as we can get it. That \nis what we should do, and that is how we can make this country better. \nIt will make it tougher for a lot of these guys who have been sitting \non oil at $100 a barrel and now it is $46.\n  So who is the loser with more supply? The guys who have been sitting \non the energy. I don't bear any grief for them. I am happy if they make \nmoney. They have to go through tough times just as everybody else does.\n  I want to thank Senator Hoeven and others who worked so hard on this \nlegislation. I believe we are in a position to see some positive action \noccur in the next few days and look forward to creating an additional \nsupply of oil from an ally of the United States that will bring down \nthe price of oil perhaps even further in the world and in the U.S. \nmarket.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments to speak \nabout an amendment that I will be offering as part of the Keystone \nPipeline legislation. It is an extremely simple, straightforward \namendment. It is a brief amendment, but it basically raises a very \nfundamental issue, and that issue is whether the Senate will abide by \nscientific evidence, will come down on the side of science as we debate \nthis enormously important issue of climate change.\n\n  The amendment is very brief, and I wish to read it and then explain \nwhy I believe it is such an important amendment. This is what it says:\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that Congress is in agreement \n     with the opinion of virtually the entire worldwide scientific \n     community that, No. 1, climate change is real; No. 2, climate \n     change is caused by human activities; No. 3, climate change \n     has already caused devastating problems in the United States \n     and around the world; No. 4, a brief window of opportunity \n     exists before the United States and the entire planet suffer \n     irreparable harm; and No. 5, it is imperative that the United \n     States transform its energy system away from fossil fuels and \n     toward energy efficiency and sustainable energy as rapidly as \n     possible.\n\n  That is it. That is the entire amendment. I would say that for the \nscientific community around the world, there is nothing in that \nstatement that smacks of controversy. These are simple statements of \nfact, agreed to by the overwhelming majority of scientists who have \nwritten and studied climate change.\n  Climate change is, in fact, one of the great threats facing our \ncountry and the entire planet. It has the capability of causing severe \nharm to our economy, to the food supply, to access to water, and to \nnational security.\n  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--the leading \ninternational scientific body on this issue--reported yet again this \npast fall that ``warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is \nnow evident from observations of increases in global average air and \nocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising \nglobal average sea level.''\n  More than 97 percent of the scientific community in the United States \nand across the globe agrees with these findings, including, among many \nother organizations, the American Association for the Advancement of \nScience, the American Chemical Society, the American Meteorological \nSociety, and the American Geophysical Union, to name just a few. In \nfact, at least 37 American scientific organizations, 118 international \nscientific organizations and national academies, and 21 medical \nassociations all agree that climate change is real and is being caused \nby human activities.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of 37 \nAmerican scientific organizations, 135 international scientific \norganizations, 21 medical associations, and some religious and teacher \norganizations that understand that climate change is real and that it \nis caused by human activity.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Virtually every major scientific organization in this \n     country and throughout the world have said that climate \n     change is real, climate change is caused by carbon emissions \n     and human activity, and that climate change is already \n     causing devastating problems in the United States of America \n     and around the world.\n       This list includes at least:\n       37 American scientific organizations, 135 international \n     scientific organizations, 21 medical associations, 4 \n     religious organizations.\n\n\n                  37 American scientific organizations\n\n       American Anthropological Association, American Association \n     for the Advancement of Science, American Association of \n     Geographers, American Association of State Climatologists, \n     American Astronomical Society, American Chemical Society, \n     American Fisheries Society, American Geophysical Union, \n     American Institute of Biological Sciences, American Institute \n     of Physics, American Meteorological Society, American \n     Physical Society, American Quaternary Association, American \n     Society for Microbiology, American Society of Agronomy, \n     American Society of Plant Biologists, American Statistical \n     Association, Association of American Geographers, Association \n     of Ecosystem Research Centers, Botanical Society of America, \n     California Academy of Sciences.\n       Crop Science Society of America, Ecological Society of \n     America, National Academy of Engineering, National Academy of \n     Sciences (USA), National Association of State Foresters, New \n     York Academy of Sciences, Scripps Institution of \n     Oceanography, Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, \n     Society of American Foresters, Society of Systematic \n     Biologists, Soil Science Society of America, The Geological \n     Society of America, The Wildlife Society, United States \n     National Research Council, University Corporation for \n     Atmospheric Research, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.\n\n\n               135 international scientific associations\n\n       Academia Brasiliera de Ciencias (Brazil), Academia Chilena \n     de Ciencias (Chile), Academia das Ciencias de Lisboa \n     (Portugal), Academia de Ciencias de la Republica Dominicana, \n     Academia de Ciencias Fisicas, Matematicas y Naturales de \n     Venezuela, Academia de Ciencias Medicas, Fisicas y Naturales \n     de Guatemala.

Mr. President, let me read from an excerpt of a letter \nsigned by virtually every major scientific organization in this country \nthat was sent to the U.S. Senate way back in 2009. This is what the \nletter states:\n\n       Observations throughout the world make it clear that \n     climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research \n     demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human \n     activities are the primary driver. These conclusions are \n     based on multiple independent lines of evidence, and contrary \n     assertions are inconsistent with an objective assessment of \n     the vast body of peer-reviewed science. Moreover, there is \n     strong evidence that ongoing climate change will have broad \n     impact on society, including the global economy and on the \n     environment. For the United States, climate change impacts \n     include sea level rise for coastal states, greater threats of \n     extreme weather events, and increased risk of regional water \n     scarcity, urban heat waves, western wildfires, and a \n     disturbance of biological systems throughout the country. The \n     severity of climate change impacts is expected to increase \n     substantially in the coming decades.\n\n  Let me repeat that one sentence:\n\n       The severity of climate change impacts is expected to \n     increase substantially in the coming decades.\n\n  We know that the Earth's climate is warming and warming quickly as a \nresult of industrial greenhouse gas emissions. The 2014 National \nClimate Assessment reported:\n\n       The most recent decade was the nation's warmest on record. \n     U.S. temperatures are expected to continue to rise.\n\n  According to NOAA, October, August, June, and May were the hottest \nmonths ever recorded. And 2012 was the warmest year on record in the \ncontiguous United States and saw at least 69,000 local heat records \nset.\n  The consequence of this rapid and dramatic rise in global \ntemperatures--what does that mean? What is going to happen? The answer \nis, it is going to mean more severe storms, more flooding and \ndestructive storm surges, heat waves, drought, forest fires, and the \ninundation of water supplies and agricultural land with saltwater.\n  As the New York Times reported in August, droughts in the West and \nSouthwestern United States appear to be intensifying as a result of \nclimate change.\n\n       Over the past decade, droughts in some regions have rivaled \n     the epic dry spells of the 1930s and 1950s. . . . The country \n     is in the midst of one of the most sustained periods of \n     increasing drought on record.\n\n  China's heat wave a year and a half ago was the worst in at least 140 \nyears. Fire-suppression costs in the United States have increased from \nroughly $1 billion annually in the mid-1990s to an average of more than \n$3 billion in the last 5 years, adjusted for inflation, reports the \nNational Climate Assessment.\n  Our oceans are not just warming, they are becoming more acidic, \nthreatening fish, coral reefs, and other sea life.\n  A study published in the Journal of Science reported:\n\n       Carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere are driving a \n     rate of change in ocean acidity, which is already thought to \n     be faster than at any time in the past 50 million years.\n\n  The authors warn that we may be entering an unknown territory of \nmarine ecosystem change.\n  Extreme storms are also becoming more common and more intense, with \nextraordinary impacts. For example, when Typhoon Haiyan struck the \nPhilippines a year ago, it displaced over 4 million people, killed \nthousands, and cost the country at least $15 billion in damages.\n  What will happen if we fail to cut back dramatically on greenhouse \ngas emissions and climate change continues to accelerate? What will \nthat reality mean for our country and for the globe? The IPCC estimates \nthat without additional efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, \n``warming is more likely than not'' to exceed 4 degrees Celsius--7.2 \ndegrees Fahrenheit--by the end of the century.\n  Let me repeat that. If we do not begin the process to dramatically \nreverse carbon emissions and slow down the warming of this planet by \nthe end of the century, warming is more likely than not to exceed 4 \ndegrees Celsius, which is 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit, resulting in a planet \nthat is over 7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer.\n  Similarly, just last year the White House released the National \nClimate Assessment, emphasizing that global warming is already \nhappening and warning that global warming could exceed 10 degrees in \nthe United States by the end of the century--10 degrees Fahrenheit.\n  The World Bank, which is a pretty conservative organization, talked \nabout a world in which temperatures increase by just 4 degrees Celsius, \nthat that would be one of unprecedented heat waves, severe drought, and \nmajor floods in many regions, with serious impacts on many \nsystems, ecosystems, and associated services. This is the warning we \nhear from the World Bank, which is a fairly conservative international \norganization.\n\n[[Page S183]]\n\n  The IPCC reports that sea levels are likely to rise another 10 to 32 \ninches by the end of the century. Some studies have reported projected \nincreases of more than 6 feet during that time period.\n  As the New York Times reported, a rise of less than 4 feet would \ninundate land on which some 3.7 million Americans live. Miami, New \nOrleans, New York, and Boston are highly vulnerable.\n  Similarly, according to the IPCC, ``many small island nations are \nonly a few meters above present sea level. These states may face \nserious threat of permanent inundation from sea-level rise.''\n  Reuters has reported that experts estimate that if the sea level \nrises by 1 meter over the next 50 years, 20 million additional people \nwill be displaced from their land.\n  The Army Corps of Engineers has predicted that the entire village of \nNewtok, AK, could be underwater by 2017 and more than 180 additional \nNative Alaskan villages are at risk. Parts of Alaska are literally \nvanishing.\n  As reported in the journal Forest Ecology and Management, U.S. Forest \nService researchers reported that wildfires are expected to increase 50 \npercent across the United States under a changing climate and over 100 \npercent in areas of the West by 2050. So huge increases in forest fires \nare expected.\n  The World Health Organization reported in August that the number of \nweather-related natural disasters has more than tripled since the \n1960s, and more than 60,000 people now die each year in weather-related \nnatural disasters. By 2020 food production is estimated to drop by 50 \npercent in some African countries, and by 2090, the World Health \nOrganization anticipates, climate change will double the frequency of \ndrought and the duration will be six times longer.\n  In 2003 a heat wave in Europe killed an estimated 70,000 people. As a \nstudy published in Nature Climate Change projects, however, Europe will \nlikely experience severe heat waves once every 5 years now, which is 10 \ntimes more frequent than just a decade ago.\n  The need to act quickly is profound and pronounced. In its fifth \nassessment, the IPCC found that ``without additional mitigation efforts \nbeyond those in place today, and even with adaptation, warming by the \nend of the 21st century will lead to high to very high risk of severe, \nwidespread, and irreversible impacts globally.''\n  In order to prevent ``irreversible and severe impacts,'' we must \nquickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to keep warming below \n2 degrees Celsius, and to do that we must transform our energy system \naway from fossil fuel and into energy efficiency and sustainable \nenergy.\n  In the face of this overwhelming evidence, in the face of deep \nconcerns all over this planet, what is the Senate going to do over the \nnext few weeks? Well, I hope very much that we do not go forward with \nthe Keystone Pipeline, which moves us exactly in the wrong direction by \nexpanding the production and transportation of some of the dirtiest \nfossil fuel on this Earth. I think that would be a terrible mistake. \nBut maybe more importantly, I hope the Senate goes on record in \nstrongly supporting the overwhelming scientific evidence which tells us \nloudly and clearly that climate change is real, that climate change is \ncaused by human activity and the emission of carbon, and that climate \nchange is already causing devastating problems in our country and \naround the world.\n  We have a short window of opportunity in order to move dramatically \nto reverse climate change and cut carbon, and we must transform our \nenergy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and \nsustainable energy.\n  I intend to offer an amendment which basically urges the entire U.S. \nSenate to go on record in making it clear that they understand what \nscientists are talking about. They are going to listen to the \nscientific community, and they are going to take actions for which our \nkids and our grandchildren will be proud of them so that we do not \nleave them with a nation and a planet substantially less habitable than \nthe planet on which we were born.\n  With that, I want to thank Senator Bennet and Senator Carper for \ncosponsoring this amendment. I hope we can have more cosponsors and I \nlook forward to seeing the adoption of this important amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                        Personal Identity Theft\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to speak on the Keystone Pipeline, \nbut before I do, I want to alert the Senate that I am filing \nlegislation today to try to protect the average American from the \nbreach of data in an individual company and therefore the loss of their \npersonal identification.\n  We have had a number of cases where there have been these wide data \nbreaches in companies with hundreds of thousands of records being \nstolen. And, of course, woe to you if, in fact, your personal identity \nis stolen. It may manifest itself in so many different ways, not the \nleast of which we have seen particularly in the Tampa and the Miami \narea of my State--the use of stolen Social Security numbers to file \nfalse income tax returns seeking refunds. Believe it or not, there was \na ring in Tampa that was actually doing this so successfully that the \nstreet crime actually dropped--the burglaries, the robberies, the \nbreakings and enterings, all of that dropped because suddenly the \ncriminals found it was so easy to use a laptop instead, once they had \nsecured the stolen ID, to generate these false income tax returns. That \nis just one example.\n  The fact is if your identity is stolen because of a breach in a \ncorporation, you should have a right of having the knowledge that your \nsecurity has been breached. Therefore, we are filing today, with a \nnumber of cosponsors, simple legislation that I have filed before in \nprevious Congresses, that if data is stolen from a company, it is \nincumbent upon that company to notify its customers within 30 days that \ntheir secure information has been stolen. That is it. Plain and simple.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk about the Keystone XL. I would first \nremind anybody who is not familiar with this issue, this is the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. What does XL stand for? It stands for extra \nlarge. Well, if this is an extra-large pipeline, that would indicate \nthere is a smaller pipeline, and in fact there is. There is a smaller \npipeline that is in existence from Canada coming across the northern \npart of the United States, coming down to a terminal in southern \nMissouri.\n  It was about 2 years ago that the President announced he was going to \nstart and allow the extension of that southern terminus all the way to \nthe gulf where there are the refineries. That is under construction. I \ndon't know the completion date. It may be already completed. So there \nis a pipeline from Canada all the way to the gulf coast.\n  If what the oil interests in Canada want is a larger pipeline, XL, a \nlot of this environmental debate could have been avoided if you simply \nran it along the same route as the existing pipeline. In fact, there \nwouldn't have been all the controversy about all of the aquifer and the \nrecharge area right across the middle of Nebraska that the State of \nNebraska got so exercised about, and at first the Governor and the \nvarious State officials took the position they did not want this.\n  Finally, a new route was negotiated and the route was further to the \neast, not right across the middle of the recharge area which supplies a \nlot of the aquifer not only in Nebraska but a lot of the Western \nStates. Yet it is still running across part of the aquifer. We would \nhave avoided all of that had you just run the XL pipeline right along \nthe existing pipeline. There wouldn't have been all of this siting \nproblem. The environmental problems associated with the pipeline \nwouldn't have been there.\n  But why was it done? This is all politics. It was done in the middle \nof the Presidential campaign going back--coming up to the 2012 \ncampaign, and it was supposedly to show that the President was anti-\nenergy, anti-energy independence because he wasn't in favor of creating \nmore oil production in North America.\n  Well, that is clearly what played out. But along the way, then the \nquestion came: Well, assuming you put this pipeline there, what is \ngoing to happen to that Canadian oil? Where is it going to go? It was a \nlegitimate question.\n\n  The answer to that was it was going to go right out to additional \nforeign\n\n[[Page S184]]\n\ncountries. So this particular Senator said, now wait a minute, do I \nunderstand that you want Canadian oil to have a conduit right through \nthe center of the United States to a port in the Gulf of Mexico, then \nto be exported to foreign countries? And the answer to that was yes.\n  I said, well, since it seems as though it would be in the interests \nof the United States that we at least keep part of that in the United \nStates for consumption so it would lessen our dependence on foreign oil \ncoming from the Middle East or coming from places where we used to get \nsome 12 percent to 20 percent of our oil--thank goodness we don't \ntoday, but used to from a place such as Nigeria. You know how troubled \nthat area is now.\n  My question was: Well, wouldn't it make sense that we keep some of \nthat oil in the United States for domestic uses so we didn't have to \nrely on oil coming from Saudi Arabia, the Persian Gulf area, from the \nWest Coast of Africa? The answer was that they would not entertain an \namendment that would prohibit that oil from being exported. Likewise, \nif the oil is refined on the gulf coast, it is not prohibited from \nbeing exported.\n  I am just a country boy from Florida, but I can put two and two \ntogether. It simply does not make sense to me that you would want \nforeign oil to come in a conduit through the United States right \nthrough the heartland to go right out to other oil-thirsty nations in \nthe world. If that were the case, then why doesn't Canada take an oil \npipeline and build it themselves to the west, through the Pacific \nCoast? Or why wouldn't Canada use the existing structures and end up in \nthe Great Lakes and send the oil out through the Great Lakes?\n  And yet, what did I say? This is politics.\n  Since the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed last \nnight was passed, this is going to be in front of the Senate. There are \ngoing to be opportunities for amendments, and I can tell you that this \nSenator is going to support the amendment that prohibits this oil from \nbeing sent out to other countries.\n  If we are really interested in the security of the United States, \nnational security, our independence from foreign oil, since Canada is \nsuch a close friend and ally, this would be in the interests of the \nUnited States.\n  The fact is that it is coming at an interesting time. It is getting \nall the more complicated. It used to be that oil--and you think back a \nhalf a year, three-quarters of a year ago, oil was selling in excess of \n$100 barrel. Yesterday it was just over $46 a barrel. It is said that \nCanada cannot efficiently produce this oil and have any break-even \npoint unless oil is selling in the range of $70 a barrel. So why in the \nworld would Canada even want to do this right now, particularly at a \ntime that oil is at $46 and may stay down for some period of time, even \na year or two?\n  I think if we apply some country-boy logic to this, there are \nsufficient significant questions--first of all, to kill the bill, and \nif that is not possible, certainly to amend it so that it complies with \nthe financial and national security interests of the United States. \nThat is the intention of this Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all \npostcloture time on the motion to proceed to S. 1 now be expired and \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on the motion to proceed; that if the \nmotion to proceed is adopted, the bill be reported and that Senator \nMurkowski be recognized to offer a substitute amendment, the text of \nwhich is at the desk.\n  I further ask that the following amendments be in order to be offered \nduring this week's session by Senators Cantwell and Murkowski or their \ndesignees: Markey amendment No. 13 related to oil exports; Portman \namendment No. 3; a Franken amendment related to U.S. steel; and that \nthe consideration of these amendments be in the order listed and the \nbill be for debate only during this week's consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I just \nwant to note for my colleagues that this agreement has been worked out \non both sides; that instead of staying until midnight and having a \ngreat deal of uncertainty as we approach the next 2 days for both of \nour caucuses to have retreats, giving people predictability about \nFriday and next Monday being a holiday, working out a back-and-forth on \nthese agreements I think is a good way to proceed.\n  I hope people will feel free on Friday to come and dialogue about \nthese or other amendments. But this process is one I think we should \npursue at this point, so I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have discussed the process going \nforward on this bill with our leader, the majority leader, and Senator \nCantwell. It is our intention to work together so the two bill managers \nor their designees continue to offer amendments in an alternating \nfashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to proceed.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/13/senate-section/article/S184-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S184-S197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President. I am pleased we are at this point in \ntime\n\n[[Page S185]]\n\nwhen we can start debate on the Keystone XL Pipeline. We have had some \ngood conversation on this floor while we have worked through procedural \nissues. I appreciate that we have been able to avoid a midnight vote, \nthat we were able to work out an agreement. I thank my colleague and \nthe ranking member, Senator Cantwell, for her assistance in getting us \nto this point, where we, during the daylight hours, can begin debate on \namendments. These amendments, I think, are particularly timely and \nparticularly important to where we are today from an economic \nperspective, from an energy perspective, and from an energy security \nperspective.\n  Keystone XL fits in with that. In front of us is the first amendment \nto the Keystone XL Pipeline, S. 1, and it is in the nature of a \ncommittee substitute. What I will assure Members is that the substitute \nwe have in front of us is almost a mirror image of the bill we reported \nfrom the energy committee just last week. We reported it on a \nbipartisan basis. We had good discussion at that point in time.\n  But we have in front of us that substitute amendment. When we look to \nthe amendment itself, it is pretty simple. We are truly talking about a \ntwo-page bill, a bill that is clear in content, a bill that is very \nreadable in terms of what it does and what it does not do. Again, it \nspans just over two pages--pretty wide font, pretty wide margins. One \ncan read it in a couple of minutes--and better yet, understand it.\n  That is because the bill itself is very simple. What this measure \ndoes is approve the cross-border permit that is needed to construct the \nKeystone XL Pipeline. It does this with important provisions. It fully \nprotects private property rights. It requires all State and local \nobligations be met, including those related to siting. There has been \nsome discussion that somehow or other the Senate is engaging in \nrouting, engaging in siting. This bill does not approve a pipeline \nroute. We are not a planning board. Our bill only approves the \npipeline's cross-border permit. It only does that because we have been \nwaiting for 6 years for this cross-border permit.\n  Some have suggested this is somehow some big giveaway. There is no \nsubsidy in this bill. It is not a giveaway. It does not evade any \nregulations. It does not preempt any environmental study. It will not \ncost taxpayers a single dollar. Again, I would encourage my colleagues \nto look critically at the language of this bill. What this bill does is \nauthorize a cross-border permit.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about the jobs created and the \nenvironmental pros and cons on both sides. We have had good, strong \ndebate already, just as we have moved through the procedural process of \nthis. But what I think is important for us as a body to appreciate is \nthe point we are at now, the point where we as Members can take this \nsimple, straightforward bill and offer amendments we believe would make \nit better or enhance it.\n  As we go forward, I am encouraging Members on both sides to bring \ntheir amendments forward. Let us have the give and take, the back and \nforth for which the Senate was once so famous. I have been asked: How \nare you going to handle amendments on the floor? Is it going to be a \nsituation where the majority determines what the minority will \nintroduce, what we will have an opportunity to debate and decide?\n  That is not how we are handling amendments on this bill. The majority \nleader has promised a full debate. He has said: It is not unlimited. We \nare not going to be on this for months, but we are going to give \nMembers an opportunity to speak to the issues of the day, the issues of \nthe day that are so important to our Nation's economy.\n  The Presiding Officer comes from an energy-producing State, as do I. \nWe know the significance of energy jobs that come to our States and our \nlocal economy. We know the independence that comes when we are not \nreliant on others, particularly others who wish us ill, for a resource \nthat powers our country.\n  We are seeing firsthand the benefits of good energy production \nthroughout the entire country. So why would we not want to allow for a \npiece of beneficial infrastructure, a piece of infrastructure to cross \na border from our closest friend and ally in Canada, moving a product \nto our refineries in the gulf coast where they are set up to handle \nthis type of crude oil.\n  There has been a lot of discussion that this is just going to be a \ntransference of oil from the north in Canada through the United States \nand exported to the rest of the world. But I think if we look to the \nfacts that are laid out in the State Department's report, in their \nenvironmental assessment, we appreciate the fact that it makes no sense \nto use the United States just as a conduit, when our refineries, those \nrefineries that are designed to handle the heavy crude, will be in a \nposition to refine that crude for our benefit in this country, for \nthose in Canada who are looking to again move their product.\n  What we are effectively going to be able to do is replace what we are \ncurrently receiving from Venezuela, which provides us with that heavy \ncrude currently, which we refine in the gulf coast areas--in those \nrefineries we will be able to replace that with oil from our friend and \nally, Canada. I do not know about the Presiding Officer, but I would \nmuch rather have a relationship with Canada than Venezuela.\n  Again, the benefits, the merits of this legislation are very \nsubstantive. Keep in mind, this is not a case of first impression. This \nis not the first pipeline we have crossing the United States-Canadian \nborder. There are 19 cross-border pipelines currently operating today. \nSo as we work to develop not only a relationship around our energy, I \nthink it is important to recognize the relationship we have with our \nfriends to the north is important as well.\n  One of the issues we will see come forward for discussion on the \nfloor is the environmental aspects of the Keystone XL Pipeline and the \noil sands from which they stem. We will have an opportunity to discuss \nthe issue of exports and the significance of our energy exports, in \nterms of the benefits to our economy, trade perspective, balance of \npayments, the significance of that, and the opportunities we have in \nother areas related to energy, energy efficiency.\n  I know my friend and colleague from Ohio wishes to speak to an \namendment he will propose today. But this is a long time in the making \nfor us to not only have the chance to talk energy but the opportunity \nfor us to vote on energy-related amendments.\n\n  I have much I wish to relay and convey in response to some of the \ncomments that have been made by colleagues on this floor in the past \ncouple days. We will have an opportunity to speak directly.\n  As was noted in the agreement, we will have this measure in front of \nus. We will put some amendments forward this afternoon. We will not be \nvoting on any amendments today nor will we be voting on any amendments \non Friday, but we will have an opportunity for good, concerted \ndiscussion on Friday and going into next week.\n  On behalf of the majority leader, I have been asked to announce that \nthe next rollcall vote will occur on Tuesday, January 20.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 2\n\n  But what that allows us is an opportunity again, beginning today, \nbeginning now, to encourage Members to come forward with their \namendments and based on the agreement we have outlined--two on the \nRepublican side today, two on the Democratic side today--get those out \nthere, get them on the table, get them up, let's talk about them. We \nwill have the opportunity on Friday and will do more of the same on \nTuesday. Then we can actually start moving through a process that I \nhope is good, robust, and encouraging--encouraging, not only for the \nAmerican public--but also encouraging to members of this body.\n  I think it will be good for us in the Senate to get back to a habit \nof advancing amendments, of allowing the floor managers to work \ntogether to decide a process, to lay out initiatives, to have the back \nand forth, to take some tough votes--it is what we do or what we should \ndo--and to get back to what we know to be regular order.\n  I want that to be a terminology all Members understand instead of \njust some who have been around for more years than others. Being able \nto get back to regular process feels pretty good today. I am pleased to \nbegin this debate under regular process.\n  With that, Senator Portman was on the floor as we began our unanimous\n\n[[Page S186]]\n\nconsent request, but I understand we will defer to Senator Markey to \nfirst bring up his amendment and then turn to Senator Portman for his.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 13 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. I seek recognition, pursuant to the consent agreement, to \ncall up amendment No. 13.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. MARKEY], for himself \n     and Ms. Baldwin, proposes an amendment numbered 13 to \n     amendment No. 2.\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To ensure that oil transported through the Keystone XL \n    pipeline into the United States is used to reduce United States \n                   dependence on Middle Eastern oil)\n\n       At the end of section 2, add the following:\n       (f) Limitation.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), none of the \n     crude oil and bitumen transported into the United States by \n     the operation of the Keystone XL pipeline under the authority \n     provided by subsection (a), and none of the refined petroleum \n     fuel products originating from that crude oil or bitumen, may \n     be exported from the United States.\n       (2) Waivers authorized.--The President may waive the \n     limitation described in paragraph (1) if--\n       (A) the President determines that a waiver is in the \n     national interest because it--\n       (i) will not lead to an increase in domestic consumption of \n     crude oil or refined petroleum products obtained from \n     countries hostile to United States' interests or with \n     political and economic instability that compromises energy \n     supply security;\n       (ii) will not lead to higher costs to refiners who purchase \n     the crude oil than the refiners would pay for crude oil in \n     the absence of the waiver; and\n       (iii) will not lead to higher gasoline costs to consumers \n     than consumers would pay in the absence of the waiver;\n       (B) an exchange of crude oil or refined product provides \n     for no net loss of crude oil or refined product consumed \n     domestically; or\n       (C) a waiver is necessary under the Constitution, a law, or \n     an international agreement.\n  Mr. MARKEY. If I may speak briefly on the amendment, I thank the \nchair of the energy committee. I thank her for her courtesy and the \nSenator from Ohio as well.\n  While we will not be having the full debate at this time on the \nSenate floor, we are in fact beginning with a critical issue, an issue \nthat relates to climate change, American energy independence, the \nimpact that legislation can have upon consumers--drivers in our country \nin terms of how much they are paying at the pump.\n  It deals with actually the mission of young men and women in our \ncountry who go overseas in order to protect tankers of oil that are \nbrought back to our country.\n  So the first question that will be asked in this debate is whether \nthe oil, which is going to be delivered through this pipeline from \nCanada, is going to stay in the United States of America.\n  The Canadian tar sands oil is the dirtiest oil in the world.\n  The pipeline, similar to a straw, is going to be built through the \nUnited States down to Port Arthur, TX, a tax-free export zone. You \ndon't have to have an MBA from business school to figure out what this \n3-by-5 card looks like.\n  It is something that basically says, since the price of a barrel of \noil on the global market is $17 higher than what the Canadians can get \nfor the tar sands oil--that they want to get it out of the country, \nwhich is why it is going to end in Port Arthur, TX, an export zone.\n  What the amendment I am going to be making on the floor of the Senate \nsays is that if the oil is drilled for in Canada, put through a \npipeline in the United States, that oil cannot be exported, that oil \nstays in the United States, and that the promise of energy independence \nin our country is in fact what this agenda is all about. Because \notherwise the United States is taking all of these environmental risks, \nthe planet is taking all of these environmental risks, but the economic \nbenefits are not flowing to consumers, drivers in the United States who \nfinally feel some relief at the pump--that they are not feeling--that \nthey are being tipped upside down and having money shaken out of their \npockets on a daily basis.\n  The oil companies have made many claims about this pipeline. They \nhave said it was for North American energy security, but it is about \nexporting oil. They have said it is about reducing prices, but it is \nabout getting the highest profits. They said it would not harm the \nenvironment but it in fact will worsen climate change and risk \ndangerous oilspills.\n  They have been trying for 6 years to get this pipeline built, even \nwhen it is clear that we do not need it. So this is the Keystone \n``export'' pipeline--the KXL.\n  So this first amendment that we will be debating is one that says: \nNo, you cannot export it. We must keep that oil in the United States. \nWe must ensure that it is in fact something that benefits the American \npeople. Otherwise, the Canadians are just ripping this oil, this dirty \noil from their soil in Canada and putting it into a pipeline that then \nwill be exported, which will only ensure that the planet gets hotter, \nthat it becomes more dangerous for future generations.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very important debate. The planet is \nrunning a fever. There are no emergency rooms for planets. We have to \nengage in preventive care.\n  If this action takes place, and all we are doing is allowing Canadian \noil to go through our country and out the other end, then we haven't \ndone anything for the American consumer or for the planet.\n  I look forward to a more complete debate on this issue, and I yield \nback the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                   Amendment No. 3 to Amendment No. 2\n\n                (Purpose: To promote energy efficiency)\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I rise and call up amendment No. 3.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Portman], for himself and Mrs. \n     Shaheen, proposes an amendment numbered 3 to amendment No. 2.\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Monday, January 12, 2015, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise to thank Senator Murkowski for \ngiving me this opportunity. She spoke earlier about the fact that we \nare going to talk about Keystone in an open process, going to allow \namendments, which seems very normal, but in the Senate it hasn't been \nover the past several years.\n  This amendment is one that results to energy efficiency. I strongly \nsupport the underlying bill, and we will talk about it in a moment, but \nI also support the strategy of saying let's produce more energy, but \nalso let's use the energy that we have more efficiently. I believe \nthose are complementary, and I believe it is consistent with creating \nmore jobs in this country, making our businesses more competitive, and \nimproving the environment. So I appreciate her willingness to allow us \nto move forward with this amendment.\n  This energy efficiency amendment we are talking about is a key part \nof the ``all of the above'' energy strategy that a lot of us discuss, \nwhether it is nuclear, renewable, oil, coal or gas, efficiency ought to \nbe a part of it.\n  It is an amendment that is the result of a lot of years of work by \nSenator Shaheen, who was mentioned earlier, myself but also Senator \nHoeven, Senator Ayotte, Senator Franken, and many other Members of this \nbody.\n  Our cosponsors this afternoon are Senator Shaheen, Senator Ayotte, \nSenator Bennet, Senator Collins, Senator Gardner, and Senator Manchin.\n  This is legislation that is clearly bipartisan and legislation that \nshouldn't be controversial. It takes part of the broader Portman-\nShaheen legislation that has already passed the House of \nRepresentatives and brings it to the floor.\n  This is also legislation that has passed the committees in the Senate \nand the committees in the House--energy committees--with wide \nbipartisan margins. Also, it was on the floor of the House last year \nand passed with a vote of 375 to 76, including with the support of the \nPresiding Officer. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n[[Page S187]]\n\n  There are four provisions and they are all pretty straightforward. \nNone of them has a mandate, none of them has a cost curve. The CBO, the \nCongressional Budget Office, has told us they don't score. All of them \nare voluntary.\n  The first one is an important one. It is called Tenant Star. It \nestablishes a voluntary market-driven approach to try and align the \ninterests of commercial business owners and their tenants. This is \nimportant because a lot of the real estate folks would like to have the \nability to say this has the Good Housekeeping seal of approval. It is \nlike an Energy Star seal of approval that enables people to know it is \nan energy-efficient building.\n  This is broadly supported in part because it is voluntary. It is not \na mandate, but it will help us in reducing energy consumption.\n  The second provision is one that is very timely. This is one that a \nlot of us have worked on over the years. Senator Hoeven has talked \nabout this. We talk sometimes in the Senate about the unintended \nconsequences of regulations. This would be a great example.\n  Here we have the Department of Energy promoting a regulation that if \nwe don't stop it now will actually make our country less energy \nefficient. It is unintended, perhaps, but it is something we need to \ndeal with legislatively now.\n  If we don't, then we are not going to be able to help save these \nparticular products, which are water heaters. Around the country there \nare hundreds of electric cooperatives that operate voluntary programs \nand use what we call electric resistance water heaters.\n  They use them to store energy at night, and then during a peak demand \nperiod they don't have to turn on these electric water heaters. So it \nis actually an energy efficiency effort.\n  It is the kind of grassroots, on-the-ground innovation we want to see \nmore of. But this regulation that we have to stop--from the Department \nof Energy--establishes a new standard for water heaters that \neffectively undermines this program. How? Because it makes it \nimpossible for these companies to produce these kinds of water heaters \nthat the co-ops are using. So the legislation exempts these water \nheaters from business standards, allowing these co-op programs that are \ngood for energy efficiency to continue.\n  People probably heard from their rural electric co-op--if they are a \nMember of this body--on this issue because it is important to them that \nit be handled and handled now. If it is not, then these companies will \nstop producing these water heaters and they will not be able to \ncontinue these programs.\n  The third provision has to do with the Federal Government. Basically \nit says the Federal Government ought to practice what it preaches.\n  The Federal Government talks a lot about energy efficiency. Yet it is \nprobably the biggest energy user in the world and probably one of the \nmost inefficient. This says simply that Federal agencies have to \ncoordinate with the Office of Management and Budget, with the \nDepartment of Energy, and with the Environmental Protection Agency to \ndevelop an implementation strategy that includes best practices, \nmeasurements, and verifications for the maintenance, purchase, and use \nof energy-efficient and energy-saving information and technology.\n  IT has been a source of great inefficiency in the government, and \nthis legislation simply says let's require these Federal agencies to \nactually clean up their act so they will be more energy efficient in \nthe area of information technology.\n  Again, it is a nonpartisan approach. It is one that has been \nsupported by both sides of the aisle.\n  Finally, along the same lines, the fourth provision requires that \nfederally leased buildings without Energy Star labels benchmark and \ndisclose their energy usage data. Again, these are not Federal \nbuildings that have to report this information, but these are buildings \nthat the Federal Government leases.\n  So in effect all of us as taxpayers should have an interest in being \nsure that these leased buildings also have the energy efficiency \nprovision to avoid wasting taxpayer money.\n  I think these are very important provisions. These are not \ncontroversial provisions. I think they are consistent with the idea \nthat, yes, let's produce more energy. Let's make sure we have the \ninfrastructure to bring the energy to the consumer, but let's do it in \na way where we are using more energy but also using it more \nefficiently.\n  I hope we will see the kind of strong bipartisan support on the floor \nwe have seen in the past on these provisions as they are part of this \nunderlying legislation.\n  I would like to talk for a moment about the underlying legislation. \nThis is the Keystone XL Pipeline construction. It seems as if we have \nbeen talking about this forever. Frankly, we have. This has been going \non for almost 7 years now, I believe. Think about that. This is just to \nget the approval of the pipeline--not to actually build it. Just to get \nthe approval it has taken 7 years. It is time to stop talking about it \nand move forward on it.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline has taken almost 7 years. In comparison, we \nbuilt the Hoover Dam in less than 5 years. The entire Empire State \nBuilding was constructed in 1 year and 45 days. In fact, the entire \ntranscontinental railroad was constructed by hand in 6 years. So there \nis no reason we shouldn't move ahead on this.\n  We have learned a thing or two about this Keystone XL Pipeline during \nthis period of time we have been debating it, and everything we have \nlearned leads us to the conclusion it just makes sense to move forward. \nWe know we can do it safely. We know we can do it in an environmentally \nsound way. We know we can create thousands of good jobs during its \nconstruction. Yet as we stand here today, with the Keystone XL Pipeline \na source of debate rather than a source of jobs, we are not moving the \ncountry forward. I think we have waited long enough.\n  There has been debate before. I have heard it over the last couple of \ndays and last week. Is this going to create jobs? Yes, it will. The \nState Department has said it will. The State Department is in the Obama \nadministration, and they are the ones who tell us it is going to \nincrease our economy by about $3 billion, increase the GDP of America, \nand also create more than 40,000 jobs during its construction--both \nthrough the actual building of the pipeline and through the sourcing of \npipeline projects to American manufacturers.\n  By the way, a bunch of those manufacturers are in my home State of \nOhio. Ohio produces pipe. Ohio produces the kind of steel--the \nstructural steel--that goes into the construction of the pipeline. Ohio \nalso produces the monitors that go on this pipeline. We also produce \nother things, such as pumps and compressors. So this will create jobs \nin my home State of Ohio. I have toured these factories and talked to \nthese workers. They are going to have the opportunity now to roll that \nsteel, build these compressors and so on, and for them this is \nimportant too.\n  Some of the critics of the pipeline have attempted to undermine these \nnumbers by claiming the jobs related to the pipeline are not permanent. \nI don't know what to say about that except are any construction jobs \npermanent, by that definition? We certainly want construction jobs. \nThis administration--the Obama administration--talks all the time about \nthe need for more infrastructure projects to create more jobs. This is \nan infrastructure project. By some measure it may be the biggest \ninfrastructure project in America over the next couple of years if we \napprove this thing. It will create not just jobs but good jobs. This is \nthe kind of work we want to have more of in this country.\n  This is a why a lot of labor unions, including the building trades, \nare excited about this, because they know it is going to be able to \nlower unemployment and get the people back to work who have lost their \njobs.\n  Others have expressed environmental concerns. Let's look at the \nfacts. Let's look at the science. With every environmental study that \nhas been conducted, the pipeline has passed. In fact, we know the \npipeline is safer and more environmentally sound than the alternative. \nWhat is the alternative? What is happening now--it is transporting this \noil by truck, transporting this oil by train. As we know, and as the \nCRS report has said, a lot of this oil actually doesn't even come from \nCanada. It comes from the Bakken. The Bakken is actually in America. It \nis in North Dakota and in other places. So some of\n\n[[Page S188]]\n\nthat oil is now being moved by truck and train. It is better that it go \nby pipeline. It is more efficient, of course, and less costly, but it \nis also safer environmentally.\n  Let's debate this issue. I am happy to do that, but let's try to \nstick to the facts. The fact is this thing just makes sense. For those \nwho oppose it, I would ask: Why is it so different from all the other \npipelines we have constructed in this country? In all our States we \nhave pipelines. When we build this, it won't be the first pipeline to \ncarry oil across international boundaries, by the way. It won't be the \nsecond or the third. It will actually be the 20th--the 20th pipeline to \ncarry energy across international boundaries. It will be the fourth one \nto import oil--specifically oil from Canada.\n  Just to give some idea of how the permitting process of XL has been, \nof the three other Canadian pipelines that have been approved, it took \nthe Federal Government 15 months on one, another was 24 months, and \nanother was 28 months. The permitting process for this one--the \nKeystone XL--has now dragged on for over 76 months and counting.\n  So look, I have heard people on the floor say: What is the rush? Why \nare we rushing this? I don't think we are rushing. I think this makes \nsense. Just as we have approved other pipelines, we go through a \nprocess, and now we should have the ability to move forward on these \njobs and the energy security that it provides.\n  By the way, when this debate is over, we also need to think about our \npermitting system. To me, this is really an indictment of our entire \npermitting system in this country. We need to do something about it, \nwhere you simply can't get a project approved. And by the way, I am not \njust talking oil and gas projects. I am talking about other energy \nprojects--solar projects. I am talking about siting windmills. I am \ntalking about hydro projects.\n  I first got involved in this issue because there was a hydro project \non the Ohio River, of all places, that was being held up by Federal \nregulations. The folks who were trying to get this through came and \nsaid: We can't believe how complicated it is to get a permit from the \nFederal Government. As soon as we get one permit from one agency \nanother agency comes in. They require it be done sequentially, and it \nis taking us forever, and we are losing investors. Those investors are \ngoing not just across the Ohio River to another State, they are going \nto another country because the Federal permitting system is so bad in \nthis country.\n  That is why I intend to introduce bipartisan legislation called the \nFederal Permitting Improvement Act. Senator McCaskill of Missouri is my \ncosponsor. We are hoping to bring that to the floor very soon too \nbecause the American government shouldn't be standing in the way of \ngood projects, particularly these energy projects that are so \nimportant. The American Government shouldn't be standing in the way of \ngood American jobs. That is exactly what is happening. We need to \nstreamline the approval process. It can be done and be done in a \nbipartisan way.\n\n  So it comes down to this. We hear a lot about an ``all of the above'' \nenergy strategy in the Senate. Everyone seems to be for it. It is a \nposition the American people support, by the way, overwhelmingly. I \nhave been to the floor many times to express my support for an energy \npolicy that includes everything from nuclear to oil, natural gas, \nrenewables, coal, and of course, increased energy efficiency, as we \ntalked about earlier. We will need all of those if we want to continue \nto see energy prices fall and to continue to see our reliance on \ndangerous and unstable parts of the world decline.\n  An ``all of the above'' energy strategy includes the Keystone \nPipeline and other projects like it. So if you want to say you support \nall of the above, you better support Keystone. If you don't support the \npipeline, I think you have to explain to the American people why you \nstood in the way of 40,000 good-paying jobs, why you opposed a project \nthat is more environmentally safe than the alternatives out there now, \nand you need to explain why you opposed an ``all of the above'' energy \nstrategy that can keep prices low and help secure North American energy \nindependence. That also affects our national security. For us not to be \ndependent on these volatile and dangerous parts of the world is good \nfor our national security. Let's stop sending the money to the Mideast. \nLet us keep the money here in North America.\n  Let's stop the delay. Let's make construction of this pipeline a \nreality. The American people are watching. We have all spent time in \nour States over the last month. We have all heard over and over again \nthat the American people want us to work together. They want us to \ncooperate where we can, particularly on issues that relate to jobs and \nthe economy and getting things moving in this country. I think this \ncurrent legislation can be a model for how the Senate can operate and a \nsign that we have heard the message the voters sent in November.\n  This final bill will be the model, as I said earlier, of an open \nprocess where people can come to the floor to debate, as I have today, \nand not just on the underlying legislation but on the amendments on \nenergy efficiency. That is good. At the end of this process, it will \nlikely contain some policies that I fully support. And by the way, the \nfinal bill will probably contain some policies I don't support, because \nthat is what happens when you have an open process. People will be able \nto come out here, make their best argument, and people will vote yea or \nnay, depending on how they feel it affects them, their States, and \ntheir constituents. That is what is happening on the Senate floor, and \nthat is a good thing for our country and a good thing for getting to \nthe right policy.\n  When the amendment process is complete, I believe we will have \nproduced a bill that advances this goal of implementing a true ``all of \nthe above'' energy policy, while creating more jobs for the American \npeople and protecting our environment in better ways. That is what we \nall want, and that is why this legislation is a win for all Americans.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Paris Unity Rally\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, throughout history a single picture has \nrevealed the political reality of the moment.\n  Before we had photography, there were artist depictions of Caesar \nentering Rome, General Washington crossing the Delaware, and Napoleon \ncrossing the Alps. When photography came, we could see the images that \ndefined America's role in the pivotal moments of existential threats to \nour values, our faiths, and our way of life: Roosevelt and Churchill \nsitting beside Stalin in Tehran and later at Yalta, President Kennedy \nat the city hall in Berlin, and Ronald Reagan at the Brandenburg Gate.\n  The pictures that define the moment, the pictures that are seared \ninto our minds, images that stay with us throughout our life are all \npowerful, and they have the common theme and the common purpose of \nconfirming America's essential leadership role in global affairs.\n  In all of these examples and thousands of others, we can see the \nworld looking on Americans with respect and with the expectation that \nwe will be there at moments critical to the world's future--they are \nthere not just to participate but there to lead where U.S. leadership \nis essential to the success of the endeavor.\n  Today, possibly the most powerful image that evokes most clearly a \nnew reality is this image right here. Here, we see many of the world's \nleaders of major nations--some of the most significant, influential \nleaders--walking arm-in-arm down a Paris boulevard as a united protest \nagainst the grotesque barbarism that threatens us all. The leaders of \nEurope, Africa, the Middle East, and even those who in other \ncircumstances are not united, are united arm-in-arm, marching in front \nof literally millions of Europeans from France and other countries.\n  Yet something is tragically missing. The most profound significance \nof this picture--which has been shown around the world and which has \nbeen seared\n\n[[Page S189]]\n\ninto our minds as a defining moment--is that America is nowhere to be \nseen, looking at this picture, with the world's leaders, some \ndiametrically opposed ideologically to each other but united here. And \nwe are told that throughout the millions of people who were there, if \nthere was the presence of an American representative, that person was \nnot seen.\n  If the world needs any further demonstration of America's decline and \nour growing irrelevance, it is this utter absence at this potentially \ndefining moment of rallying the nations of the world to address this \nexistential threat to the most basic of our values and our freedoms.\n  It is not just an image problem, although the image itself carries \nthe message, it is a substance problem.\n  This group of world leaders and millions of others joined together in \nParis last weekend to show the entire world that a threat to our \nprincipal freedoms is entirely unacceptable to us all and will be \nresisted by all of us, an unacceptable mortal threat to freedom of \nexpression, freedom of conscience, freedom of religion, and freedom of \nthe press.\n  My friend and former colleague Joe Lieberman wrote a piece in today's \nWall Street Journal that articulately defines this threat and how we \nmust respond. In his piece, he wrote:\n\n       In rapid order, the three attacks in France last week \n     showed more clearly than ever that the international movement \n     of violent Islamist extremism has declared war on Western \n     civilization's foundational values, which are embraced by so \n     many people throughout the world. The murders of police \n     officers, cartoonists and Jews were attacks against the \n     West's most central values and aspirations--the rule of law, \n     freedom of expression and freedom of religion. This radical \n     extremism will continue to threaten what we hold dear unless \n     it is fought and eventually defeated.\n\n  Millions gathered not only because 16 people died so tragically, they \nalso gathered because those who would pervert their faith in order to \nlure deluded young people into violent extremism must know that we will \nall oppose them no matter what it takes.\n  So how can we reconcile this vital mission with America's utter \nabsence? No excuses are sufficient. No apologies or explanations about \nbureaucratic ineptitude will be enough to undo the damage caused by our \nabsence and depicted throughout the world.\n  Some may say the President didn't attend because of security \nconcerns. Writing for the Wall Street Journal, Peggy Noonan said, \n``Life is a security concern, you must do what's right.''\n  Sadly, the President's absence is an accurate reflection of how this \nadministration sees our role in the world. During the past year we have \nseen a long list of foreign policy disasters--the rise of the most \npotent and violent terrorist organization in history; the continued \ndisintegration of Syria; American hostages beheaded in full public \nview; a resurgent Taliban conducting more attacks in Afghanistan; and \nthe Government of Iraq losing control of a third of the country, \nincluding cities and provinces soaked with the blood of American \ntroops. We have seen our old enemy Al Qaeda and its affiliates \nmetastasize throughout the Middle East and north Africa to mount \nthreats from Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, and now even France. We have seen \nthe Islamic State mount media campaigns that have persuaded thousands \nof Americans, Europeans, and others to flock to their black banners. We \nhave seen an ill-conceived and poorly prepared Middle East peace \ninitiative collapse under the weight of unattainable expectations.\n  All of these problems and many others--some colossal disasters--have \nbeen aggravated by U.S. policy failures. Those failures have come from \na White House isolated in a wasteland of confusion. The Obama \nadministration has no coherent strategy for dealing with the world \nother than, in a now famous paraphrase, ``Don't do stupid stuff.'' \nShrouded in this fog of indecision and failures, is it any wonder that \nwe could not find the vision to join with the rest of the world to show \npurpose in Paris?\n  It is deeply ironic and appropriate that the events in Paris were all \ngenerated by the power of imagery--cartoons, no less. Those events have \nnow produced this new imagery, a picture of global common action in \nwhich the United States is tragically absent.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, we are awaiting the arrival of \nSenator Franken to bring up the amendment relating to U.S.-made steel \nthat is part of the agreement we entered into just a little bit ago \nthat would allow for a series of amendments to be brought forward to \nthe floor. The first was my substitute amendment to S. 1; Senator \nMarkey has brought forward his amendment No. 13; Senator Portman, his \nenergy efficiency bill.\n  What I would like to advise Members is that these are the matters \npending before the body at this point in time. We certainly welcome \ndebate on these issues.\n  Obviously, energy efficiency is very key to any energy debate. The \naspect of export is one also that is worthy of discussion and, I hope, \ngood debate on both sides as we go forward.\n  I would encourage Members to speak not only to these issues, but if \nthere are other issues they would like to have brought to the floor--\nwhile we won't be in a position to allow other Members to offer their \namendments at this time under this agreement, there is certainly plenty \nof time to be talking about them.\n  Prior to the entry of the agreement, Senator Sanders came to the \nfloor and spoke about his intention to offer an amendment at a later \npoint in time.\n  I again invite Members to be engaged, to be part of this open \namendment process we are part of. I think for some it is new and it may \ntake a little bit of getting used to, but that is a good thing. It is a \ngood thing because these are areas that are worthy of debate on the \nSenate floor. When we are talking about jobs, when we are talking about \nour energy security, when we are talking about the strength of our \neconomy, it is always timely to have this debate.\n  I will again remind colleagues that our next opportunity to discuss \nthese issues will be Friday morning, when we will be in session to take \nthem up.\n  I look forward to more discussion from across the aisle.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 17 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Franken, I call \nup his amendment No. 17.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Ms. Cantwell] for Mr. Franken, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 17 to amendment No. 2.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To requie the use of iron, steel, and manufactured goods \n produced in the United States in the construction of the Keystone XL \n                        Pipeline and facilities)\n\n       After section 2, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. USE OF UNITED STATES IRON, STEEL, AND MANUFACTURED \n                   GOODS.\n\n       (a) Limitation.--Subject to subsection (b), to the maximum \n     extent consistent with the obligations of the United States \n     under international trade agreements, none of the iron, \n     steel, or manufactured goods used in the construction of the \n     Keystone XL Pipeline and facilities approved by this Act may \n     be produced outside of the United States.\n       (b) Nonapplication.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to the \n     extent that the President finds that--\n       (1) iron, steel, and the applicable manufactured goods are \n     not produced in the United States in sufficient and \n     reasonably available quantities with a satisfactory quality; \n     or\n       (2) inclusion of iron, steel, or any manufactured good \n     produced in the United States will increase the cost of the \n     iron, steel, or any manufactured good used in the Pipeline \n     and facilities by more than 25 percent.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, we have made some progress with \nproceeding to this very important issue and Members are obviously \ncoming to the floor to talk about their amendments and offer their \nviewpoints on this legislation.\n  I would just point out that I hope we have a chance to consider some \nof the\n\n[[Page S190]]\n\nother amendments we have been talking about, the issue of whether \ncompanies in the tar sands business should be paying into the oilspill \nliability trust fund. We talked earlier today about how the oilspill \nliability trust fund which U.S. companies are required to pay into and \nis critical for cleanup. I want to add some documents to the Record of \nthis case we had in Kalamazoo where the company may have hit its cap \nand where it may--for that Kalamazoo spill on tar sands--be asking the \noilspill liability trust fund to actually recoup the benefits they had \nto pay out.\n  To me this is a very important issue. Here is a company where we have \ntar sands spilling into the Kalamazoo River and actually costing, I \nthink, something like $1.2 billion, and instead of this company paying \ninto the trust fund and paying for costs on this, they basically are \ngoing to take money that U.S. companies paid into the trust fund and be \nrecouped because of this. So I just want to get this right, and I hope \nwe can work with our colleagues on another amendment on that process.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article that \njust appeared in the paper from the AP about how TransCanada is said to \noffer landowners a price for their land in Nebraska at which point if \nthey don't come to an agreement by this Friday the company can use \neminent domain to take the land.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From Associated Press, Jan. 13, 2015]\n\n      Attorney: Landowners Still Have Options in Pipeline Dispute\n\n                           (By Grant Schulte)\n\n       Lincoln, NE (AP).--Nebraska opponents of the Keystone XL \n     oil pipeline will continue to fight the project, even though \n     the state's highest court allowed its planned route to stand, \n     an attorney for the group said Monday.\n       Omaha attorney Dave Domina said landowners on the route can \n     challenge the project again once pipeline developer \n     TransCanada uses eminent domain to get access to their \n     property. Once the company begins that process, Domina said \n     individual landowners can fight the company in court battles \n     that could take two to three years with appeals.\n       In addition, Domina said the landowners could file a new \n     legal challenge against the law itself, using landowners who \n     live directly on the route. Or they could lobby Nebraska \n     lawmakers to try to change the law. It's too early to know \n     which approach they'll choose, Domina said.\n       ``This decision has simply been punted down the road, to be \n     answered another day,'' Domina said in an interview. ``It's \n     up to TransCanada to make the next move.''\n       The Nebraska Supreme Court on Friday ruled against three \n     landowners who sought to overturn Nebraska's 2012 pipeline-\n     siting law, which they say violates the state constitution. \n     Not all of the plaintiffs owned property along the route, but \n     the group sought legal standing as Nebraska taxpayers \n     challenging an illegal use of state money to review the \n     project. TransCanada later reimbursed the state.\n       The Nebraska attorney general's office argued that, among \n     other things, that the landowners didn't have legal standing \n     to bring the case.\n       The high court ruled 4-3 that the plaintiffs had standing, \n     and four judges also deemed the law unconstitutional. The \n     remaining three declined to review the constitutional \n     arguments, arguing that the landowners lacked the legal \n     standing. A five-judge supermajority was needed to overturn \n     the law because it raised a constitutional question.\n       Pipelines are generally reviewed by the Nebraska Public \n     Service Commission, but the siting law allowed then-Gov. Dave \n     Heineman to approve it after a review by the state's \n     environmental department. Heineman, a Republican, supported \n     the pipeline, and the environmental department is a part of \n     the governor's administration. Public Service Commission \n     members are elected.\n       TransCanada spokesman Shawn Howard said offers to \n     landowners are set to expire on Friday, at which point the \n     company can begin eminent domain proceedings. Howard said the \n     company will continue to discuss deals with landowners who \n     are still negotiating in good faith. When warning letters \n     were sent in December, the company said it had voluntary \n     agreements from 84 percent of landowners along the route.\n       The $8 billion pipeline would carry oil from Canada through \n     Montana and South Dakota to Nebraska, where it would connect \n     with existing pipelines to carry more than 800,000 barrels of \n     crude oil a day to refineries along the Texas Gulf Coast.\n       Environmentalists and other opponents argue that any leaks \n     could contaminate water supplies, and that the project would \n     increase air pollution around refineries and harm wildlife. \n     But many Republicans, oil industry members and other backers \n     say that those fears are exaggerated and that the pipeline \n     would create jobs and ease American dependence on oil from \n     the Middle East. They note a U.S. State Department report \n     raised no major environmental objections.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. So while I think this is very interesting that Congress \nis trying to expedite a process here by which the TransCanada pipeline \nis approved and the Nebraska Supreme Court made a decision basically on \nstanding and had four of the seven justices say that this was \nunconstitutional--what the legislature did in trying to take away the \npublic interest standard--this company is not waiting one second to say \nthat property owners who never got the public interest standard met are \ngoing to get short-shrifted again and they are just going to go ahead. \nSo I don't see why Congress is trying to help a special interest hurry \nand make a decision when they are not trying to give any landowner the \nbenefit of a process or give landowners the ability to negotiate. They \nare just going to go ahead with eminent domain.\n  So it is a very interesting tale we are going to talk a lot more \nabout in the ensuing days about all the special attempts that \nTransCanada has done to try move ahead with this pipeline without \nfollowing due process.\n  As I noted earlier this morning I found it very interesting that at \nthe very time the State Department was saying to TransCanada that their \ncurrent proposal goes through an aquifer and really should go somewhere \nelse, TransCanada was looking for support in Congress to go ahead and \napprove the pipeline through the aquifer by saying the State Department \nhad to approve it. Clearly, here is somebody who just wants this \npipeline no matter what, no matter where, and is going to use every \nattempt to not follow the rules. So we hope that we will have a very \nhealthy debate about why Congress shouldn't be entering into this kind \nof special interest deal on behalf of this company.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Congratulating the North Dakota state University Bison On Winning The \n   2014 NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision Title Game\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I wish to make a number of points in \nregards to the Keystone XL pipeline approval bill, the legislation we \nare currently considering. But before I do so, I am planning to submit \na resolution on behalf of the North Dakota State University Bison who \nwon their fourth national championship on Saturday against the Illinois \nState Redbirds. It was a spirited and wonderful game in Frisco, Texas.\n  I know, Madam President, that you had a team that was in the hunt, so \nto speak, and played a tremendous game in New Hampshire against the \nIllinois State Redbirds. It is a testament to the quality of the teams \nin the FCS championship, the Division I playoff series. Teams such as \nthe University of New Hampshire had a tremendous year of outstanding \ncoaching and great student athletes.\n  I watched the game between the Illinois State Redbirds and the \nUniversity of New Hampshire. It was a fantastic game that went right \ndown to the wire. It just speaks to the fact that there are excellent \nteams in this division and tremendous athletes. A lot of teams had \ngreat seasons. So I certainly want to begin by commending all the teams \nthat were in the playoffs, including our opponent in the championship \ngame, the Illinois State Redbirds. They did a great job.\n  But North Dakota State University, the coaches, everybody on staff, \nthe leadership of the North Dakota State University and these student \nathletes had just a fantastic year. So I want to congratulate them. \nFour years in a row is unprecedented. Nobody has won the national \nchampionship in Division I football in their division in the playoffs \nin history. So this was certainty a great achievement.\n  I am planning to submit the following resolution to honor the North \nDakota State Bison. It says:\n\n       Whereas, the North Dakota State University (referred to in \n     this preamble as\n\n[[Page S191]]\n\n     ``NDSU'') Bison won the 2014 National Collegiate Athletic \n     Association (referred to in this preamble as the ``NCAA'') \n     Division I Football Championship Subdivision title game in \n     Frisco, Texas, on January 10, 2015, in a hard fought victory \n     over the Illinois State Redbirds by a score of 29 to 27;\n       Whereas, NDSU has won 12 NCAA football championships;\n       Whereas, NDSU has now won four consecutive NCAA Football \n     Championships since 2011, an unprecedented achievement in \n     Football Championship Subdivision history;\n       Whereas, the NDSU Bison have displayed tremendous \n     resilience and skill over the past four seasons, with 58 wins \n     to only three losses, including a streak of 33 consecutive \n     winning games;\n       Whereas, Coach Chris Klieman and his staff, through their \n     dedication and talent, have continued the excellence of the \n     Bison football program;\n       Whereas, the leadership of President Dean Bresciani and \n     Athletic Director Matt Larsen has helped bring both academic \n     and athletic excellence to NDSU;\n       Whereas, an estimated 17,000 Bison fans attended the \n     Championship game--\n\n  Including myself--a fantastic game--\n\n     reflecting the tremendous spirit and dedication of the Bison \n     Nation that has helped propel the success of the team; and\n       Whereas, the 2014 NCAA Division I Football Championship \n     Subdivision title was a victory not only for the NDSU \n     football team, but also for the entire State of North Dakota:\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1), congratulates the North Dakota State University \n     football team as the champion of the 2014 National Collegiate \n     Athletic Association Division I Football Championship \n     Subdivision title;\n       (2), commends the North Dakota State University players, \n     coaches, and staff for their hard work and dedication; and\n       (3), recognizes the students, alumni, and loyal fans for \n     supporting the Bison on the successful quest of the team to \n     capture another Division I trophy for North Dakota State \n     University.\n\n  I will be entering that resolution into the Record to honor and \nrecognize the team in a program that has done just an incredible job \nthis year. I know how hard those student athletes worked. It is a \nprivilege to honor them with this resolution and commend them on their \noutstanding achievement this year winning their fourth consecutive \nnational championship.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  Now I would like to shift to the continued discussion of the Keystone \nXL Pipeline approval legislation that is currently pending on the \nfloor. I am pleased to say that we have reached agreement now to \nproceed to the bill. In fact, we will be voting on amendments--not this \nweek. But we can at least tee up amendments this week, and we will be \nstarting votes on these amendments beginning next week.\n  That has been the idea all along--first, to advance to this bill; it \nis important energy infrastructure legislation--but also to have an \nopen process to return to what we have referred to as regular order on \nthe Senate floor in an effort to work truly in a more bipartisan way \nand to get the work of the Senate done for the American people.\n  That is the idea with this energy legislation--to make sure we are \nhaving the debate so we give everybody the opportunity to come forward \nand to present their amendments. We will debate them. They can then get \na vote. For the amendments that can command 60 votes--it takes a \nbipartisan vote to pass anything because neither party has 60 votes--it \nrequires bipartisanship. Any amendments that can garner 60 votes will \nbe added to the legislation, and I hope that fosters the best \nlegislation possible and enables us to get our work done on behalf of \nthe American people--not only on this bill but on other important \nlegislation to help move our country forward as well.\n  There are a number of arguments that have been made this afternoon by \nsome of the critics of the bill, and while greatly respecting their \nright to come forward and present their opposition to the legislation \nand any criticisms they feel they want to present, I also want to take \nthe opportunity to rebut a number of those. Of course, that is the \nwhole focus and effort here in terms of the debate--to have this debate \nand hopefully convince people that what we have is good legislation. If \nwe can make it better with amendments, great, but at the end of the \nday, we pass this legislation and get this project approved on behalf \nof the American people.\n  It is about energy, it is about jobs, it is about economic growth, \nand it is about national security. It is a great place to start in this \nnew Congress, where we are focused like a laser on growing our economy \nand creating jobs for the hard-working taxpayers and people of our \ncountry, for the middle class, for the folks out there working every \nday. And for those not working and looking for a job, let's find ways \nto make sure we get this economy going and that we get jobs for \nthem. This is a great example. This is the largest shovel-ready \nproject--at almost $8 billion--that we have, and it is ready to go. It \ndoesn't cost one single penny of government money. It is privately \nfinanced, and it is all about creating the kind of business climate and \npowering the kind of investment that will help grow our economy.\n\n  One of the discussion points I have been hearing is this whole issue \nof, well, this somehow is just for Canada and not the United States or \nthat we are doing this for Canada. I will start with the premise that \nour closest friend and ally in the world is Canada, so the idea of \nworking with Canada makes a lot of sense to me. They are our largest \ntrading partner. We work with them all the time. We have a unique and \nwonderful relationship that very few countries have.\n  So to start with this criticism that this is just for Canada and not \nfor the United States, I am thinking: Yes, and it is a bad idea to work \nwith your friends, why? It seems to me that that is a good selling \npoint. If this is good for Canada, then great. I hope we are doing good \nthings for Canada, and I hope they are doing good things for us. That \nis how friends and allies work together. The whole concept that somehow \nthis is a bad idea is lost on me. To me it seems as though it is a \npositive when we can work together with Canada.\n  The fact is it is not just good for Canada--it is good for Canada, \nbut it is really good for the United States too, and that is the whole \npoint. In that line of argument that it is somehow good for Canada and \nnot good for the United States--the critics say it is good for Canada \nbecause they produce oil up here in Alberta, and they are going to move \nthat oil down to our ports and they are going to export it. Well, that \nis not the case.\n  Is it possible that some oil could be exported? Yes. But the reality \nis a lot of this oil is coming to our country and will be used in our \ncountry, and even more than that, it is not just Canadian oil. The \nargument that this is somehow just Canadian oil and it is going to be \nexported is wrong. It is wrong on both counts. I wish to take a minute \nto rebut that because that argument has been brought up a number of \ntimes.\n  As a matter of fact, I believe it is the focus of one of the first \namendments that has been offered by the good Senator from \nMassachusetts. He wants to include a provision that says none of the \noil can be exported because it is all Canadian oil and it is all going \nto be exported. Well, on both counts, that is wrong. Oil from North \nDakota and Montana, out of the Bakken formation--our State oil in North \nDakota produces 1.2 million barrels of oil a day. We are second only to \nthe State of Texas. But because we don't have enough pipelines, we have \nto move 700,000 barrels a day on rail.\n  We are trying to move agricultural goods. We are the leader of 14 \ndifferent major agriculture commodities. We have all kinds of other \nproducts that we produce, as do the States in our region, which \nincludes Minnesota, South Dakota, and Montana. But we have tremendous \ncongestion on our rails because we are putting more and more oil on \nrail. We have 700,000 barrels a day going out on rail and growing as we \ncontinue to grow our production in this part of the country. So we need \nmore pipelines.\n  What you see on this diagram is the original Keystone Pipeline that \nwas constructed and built when I was Governor of North Dakota, and this \nyellow shows the sister pipeline we are trying to build.\n  As you can see, this goes right through our State, and the new \npipeline goes right next to our State. The whole point is we want to \nput 100,000 barrels a day--at least for starters--of our light sweet \nBakkan crude in this pipeline.\n  It is not just moving Canadian oil, it is moving domestic oil as \nwell. It is moving U.S. oil. When you hear that it is just going to \nmove Canadian oil,\n\n[[Page S192]]\n\nthat is already wrong. How about we stick to the facts? How about we \nmake sure we foster real understanding? How about we tell people what \nis really going on here? It is not just Canadian oil, it is Canadian \nand it is U.S. oil.\n  The whole point is this is the kind of infrastructure that helps us \nachieve North American energy security. What do I mean by that? I mean \nby the United States working with Canada, we can produce more energy \nthan we consume, and that is energy security. That means we don't have \nto depend on importing it from OPEC, that means we don't have to depend \non importing it from Venezuela. When push comes to shove, we produce \nmore oil and energy than we consume. That is a national security issue.\n  When you drive up to the pump today to fill up your car, take a look \nand check out the price at the pump. It is less than $2. It is about \nhalf of what it was maybe a year ago, right? That equates to $100 \nbillion to $125 billion in savings for American consumers. Why is that \nhappening? Is it that OPEC decided: Hey, let's give America a Christmas \npresent? Is it because Vladimir Putin decided: Hey, let's get some \nenergy over to America? Is it because Venezuela said: Hey, let's drop \nthe price at the pump in America? Why is that happening? The reason it \nis happening is because we are producing so much more energy in our \ncountry in places such as North Dakota and Texas and the Bakkan and in \nthe Eagle Ford. We are producing more natural gas in places such as the \nMarcellus and Utica, and the shale across our country, and because we \nare getting more oil from Canada because we have more supply, that is \nbringing the price down. More supply puts downward pressure on prices.\n  Every consumer is benefiting at the pump. A 60-cent drop in the price \nof gasoline translates from a $100 billion to $125 billion tax cut for \nthe people of our great country, for the small businesses, and for all \nthe industry sectors that rely on energy, and that is most of them, \nright? That is the benefit we are creating by working together with \nCanada to produce more energy. It truly is more energy, lower prices \nfor our energy, making us more competitive in a global economy, it is \njobs for our people, economic growth, and it is a national security \nissue. It truly is a national security issue.\n\n  Back to the point it is all going to be exported. First, it is not \njust Canadian oil. It is Canadian and U.S. oil, and I have gone through \nthat.\n  On the issue that it will be exported--they say, look, the pipeline \ngoes from Hardisty in Alberta all the way down to these ports--Port \nArthur. So that must mean it is all going to be exported. No. It is \ngoing from where it was produced to where it is refined and consumed. \nIt comes from Hardisty, down to Steele City, and from there it can go \nto Patoka, IL. Why? Because there are refineries there and pipeline \nnetworks where it can go into the eastern part of the United States.\n  It also goes to Cushing, OK--a huge pipeline network that goes all \nover the country, and it is based out of Cushing, OK, so it can go \nalmost anywhere.\n  The idea that building a pipeline is somehow an unusual or difficult \nthing to do--well, let's take a look at all the pipelines we have \nmoving oil and gas around this country. The whole point is when you \nbring that pipeline through, you can interface with all of these \nnetworks so you can move it all over the country.\n  For somebody to look at this and say: Oh, gee, look, because it goes \nfrom Hardisty down to here, it will all be exported. Come on, let's \ntell people what is really going on. There is the pipeline. It can go \nthrough many different routes and across the country. Don't just take \nmy word for it because I am an advocate for the pipeline. People say: \nWell, he is pushing for the pipeline, and that is what he says. Fine. \nLet's go to what the State Department and the Department of Energy say. \nLet's go to the Obama administration's State Department and the \nDepartment of Energy and see what they say.\n  Here in January of 2014, the State Department determined in its final \nenvironmental impact statement--\n\n       [The export of the oil] appears unlikely to be economically \n     justified for any significant durable trade given transport \n     costs and market conditions.\n\n  That was in the final environmental impact statement, section \n1.4.6.2. I will repeat that statement.\n\n       [The export of oil] appears unlikely to be economically \n     justified for any significant durable trade given transport \n     costs and market conditions.\n\n  So there we have the State Department and the environmental impact \nstatement saying they are going to use the oil in the United States.\n  How about the Department of Energy? In its report, the Department of \nEnergy determined that it does not make economic sense to ship the oil \nto China. Furthermore, any export would need to obtain a Department of \nCommerce license before it is exported. I am not saying that none of it \nwill be exported, I am saying that according to the State Department \nand the Department of Energy, it will be used in this country, and \nbefore it could be exported, you would have to have the Secretary of \nCommerce say it is OK for some of that oil to be exported. The Obama \nadministration would have to approve exporting some of that crude \nbefore it could be exported.\n  Furthermore, refiners that have contracts with TransCanada, which is \nValero, have publicly confirmed that the oil that will be shipped \nthrough the Keystone XL Pipeline will be used for U.S. domestic needs. \nThe United States retains 99 percent of all crude within the country \nand uses 97 percent of the gasoline refined in the country. A large \nmajority--over 90 percent--of transportation fuel refined in the United \nStates is for use in the United States.\n  Look, these are global markets. I am not saying that there is none \nthat would be exported, but my point is we are going to use this oil in \nthe United States, and if we don't build this pipeline, then one of two \nthings will happen--again, according to the environmental impact \nstatement that was done by the Obama administration.\n  If you can't build a pipeline, then it is going to have to be railed \ninto this country, the same way I got done telling you that we rail \n700,000 barrels a day out of my State of North Dakota. We will have to \nrail more of the domestic crude that I mentioned out of here, \ncontinuing the congestion on the rails, and we will have 1,400 railcars \na day moving that oil because you can't move it on the pipeline. All of \nthose locomotives produce emissions, right? We will either have to have \n1,400 cars a day railing it or you are not going to build the pipeline \nand Canada is going to build pipelines to the west coast of Canada, and \nthen they will load it on tankers and take it to China, thereby \nproducing more greenhouse gas emissions, and refining the oil in \nChinese refineries with higher greenhouse gas emissions.\n  And, by the way, since we are not getting that oil, we will have to \nbring more in from OPEC for us, right?\n  Under this scenario where they build the pipeline to the west coast \nand send it to China, how much of it will come to us then? Then it is \nall exported, isn't it?\n  This argument that some of it might get exported, then the converse \nof that--or the result is to say, we don't want the pipeline because \nsome of it might get exported. So, in essence, we blocked it from \ncoming here, and so then it will all be exported and it all goes to \nChina. Wow. That makes sense? Let's see, because some of it might get \nexported, then let's make sure we don't have the pipeline so make sure \nit all gets exported, but we don't want it exported.\n  What am I missing here? Where is the common sense? When push comes to \nshove and we are not in a situation like we are right now where prices \nare low, when prices start going back up based on supply and demand and \nall of those things, or when there is conflict in the world that \ndisrupts supplies, would we rather have control of that supply of oil \nfrom Canada or would we rather make sure it all goes to China?\n  When push comes to shove and we need the energy, when prices are \nhigh, or when there is volatility or conflict in the world, do we want \nto make sure that all of those resources are going to China and then we \ncan go hat in hand and ask them for it, or would we rather have control \nof it? That is why I wanted to take a few minutes to rebut the argument \nthat, oh, gee, it is all going to be exported rather than a more \ncommonsense view of, well, gee, some might be exported because it is a \nglobal economy, but if it is, they have to get the Obama \nadministration's approval to do it.\n\n[[Page S193]]\n\n  If you don't build the pipeline, you are either going to have it all \ncome by railcar or you are not going to have any of it, and 100 percent \nof it will be exported because we would force all of it to go to China. \nUnder any of those scenarios, you are still producing the energy up \nthere, aren't you?\n  I will shift to the environmental argument. I will go back to this \nchart. There is another argument I wish to rebut for a minute. The \nargument is, oh, gee, all of this might be exported so we don't want \nthe pipeline because we are trying to prevent the oil sands from being \nproduced because of the environmental aspect of greenhouse gas.\n  As I just pointed out, even without the pipeline, the oil is still \ngoing to be produced. Again, this is not me saying that. Go back to the \nenvironmental impact statement. Go back to the science. Go back to the \nreport done not once, not twice, not three times, not four times, but \nfive times by the Department of State and their environmental impact \nstatements--three draft statements, two final environmental impact \nstatements, five different studies. What they say is the oil is still \ngoing to be produced so if we don't build the pipeline, our emissions \nare going to be higher from greenhouse gases than if we build the \npipeline. Why is that? I went through some of that already. No. 1, we \nwill have it all moved through railcars, which produce more greenhouse \ngases than a pipeline--1,400 rail cars a day. It will be shipped to \nChina, which will refine it in refineries that have higher emissions \nthan ours. And we are going to have to haul it in from other places \nsuch as Venezuela. So we have greenhouse gas emissions from the ships \nas well. So the reality is--and the environmental impact statements \nshow it--that we have lower greenhouse gas emissions with the pipeline \nthan we would without it.\n  As we have talked about on the floor many times, everybody is \nentitled to their own opinions, but they are not entitled to their own \nfacts. Those are the facts as laid out very clearly, as I say, in not \none or two environmental impact statements but in three draft \nenvironmental impact statements and two final environmental impact \nstatements.\n  The other point I wish to make on the environmental aspect is that we \nproduce oil in California and we import oil from Venezuela that has \ngreenhouse gas emissions that are as high or higher than oil produced \nin the Canadian oil sands.\n  Another point I wish to make is that Canada is working to reduce both \nthe greenhouse gas emissions and the environmental footprint of their \nproduction in the oil sands. Since 1990, on a per barrel basis, in \nAlberta, Canada, the producers of oil from the oil sands have reduced \nthe greenhouse gas emissions by 28 percent--almost a third. So that is \na 28-percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in oil sands oil \nfrom 1990 to the present on a per barrel basis. So they have reduced it \nby almost a third, and they are continuing to find ways through better \ndrilling techniques, through cogeneration, and through other efforts to \nimprove the environmental stewardship of what they are doing there. \nThat is the way it works. Rather than blocking investment in needed \ninfrastructure, rather than blocking investment in new technologies, we \nneed to encourage that investment because when we encourage that \ninvestment in our country and work with Canada, we produce more energy \nmore cost-effectively with better environmental stewardship. When we \nblock it, we don't get that technology, we don't get the energy, and we \ndon't get the improvements in environmental stewardship.\n  That is the way we should be approaching this. We should be \nencouraging the investment.\n  As I said before, not one penny of government money is expended on \nthe pipeline. We are simply allowing a project to go forward. Private \ncompanies invested almost $8 billion in the largest shovel-ready \nproject we have after the project has been held up by the Federal \nGovernment for more than 6 years--held up after every single State--all \nsix States--every single one of them has approved it. But here we are 6 \nyears later and the Federal Government is saying to those States that \neven though every single one of those States on the route has approved \nit, even though they want it, even though all the States will realize \nhundreds of millions of dollars in cash revenues and benefits not only \nfrom construction but from property taxes and other sources of revenue \nin building the project, and even though it won't cost the government \none single penny, the Federal Government said no. Even though we have \nstudied it for 6 years, that is not good enough. Even though in poll \nafter poll 65 percent of the American people want it built, even though \nAmericans want energy security here at home and in Canada, even though \na bipartisan majority in the House and in this Senate support it, the \nPresident says: No, that is not good enough somehow. We would rather \nkeep importing oil from OPEC.\n  That has to be music to OPEC's ears. Oh, good, the Americans aren't \ngoing to get serious and work with Canada and make sure they are energy \nsecure. They are going to keep getting oil from OPEC.\n  That has to be music to China's ears. They want it. They are trying \nto buy these oil resources in Canada. They are not only trying to buy \nthe oil. They are trying to buy the resources in Canada. But last I \nchecked, we work for the American people, and the American people want \nenergy security.\n  So we have an absolute obligation to make sure that as we are talking \nabout this project, we are talking about the facts. We are not talking \nabout our opinions. I know we are striving for clarity and an \nunderstanding of what is really going on.\n  When it comes to the environmental aspects and when it comes to \nwhether the energy is going to be exported or used here, when it comes \nto the economic impact, when it comes to the job creation, and to all \nof these different issues, let's debate them. If somebody has an \namendment we can add, let's debate that, too. It needs to get 60 votes. \nBut let's make sure we are fostering understanding of what is really \ngoing on here so we talk about climate change and that type of issue \nthat is relative to this project. Let's make sure we are clear. Let's \nmake sure we are telling the people that this project will have no \nsignificant environmental impact, according to the U.S. State \nDepartment--the Obama administration's State Department. According to \nthe Obama U.S. State Department--the Obama administration--according to \ntheir environmental impact statements, including three draft statements \nand two final statements done over more than 6 years: no significant \nenvironmental impact. Then when we talk about greenhouse gas emissions \nand the oil that comes from the oil sands, let's be clear that this is \nnot just Canadian oil. It is also domestic oil from our country, from \nStates such as North Dakota and Montana. Let's also talk about how the \ninvestment in new technologies is reducing the environmental footprint \nand reducing the greenhouse gas for oil sands production. There has \nbeen a reduction of 28 percent in greenhouse gas emissions since 1990 \nin the oil sands because of their investment in new technologies, in \nbetter drilling techniques, as well as their efforts going forward.\n  I do believe we are going to have officials from Alberta and from \nCanada coming during the next weeks to talk about what else they are \ngoing to do to make additional improvements in terms of environmental \nstewardship and the efforts they are undertaking to reduce further the \nenvironmental footprint and the greenhouse gas impact of the energy \nthey are producing.\n  So with that, I wish to close. This really is an opportunity to work \nwith our good friend Canada on a project of great mutual benefit, and \nthat is energy security for North America and energy security for our \ncountry as well as for Canada. I think this is a project Americans very \nmuch want.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to come forward to engage in this debate \nand, at the end of the day, let's get this done for the American \npeople.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Boozman). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, this is my first speech to the Senate.\n  It is interesting because as a child I would read about how the \nSenate was a great deliberative body. I would read of the debates in \nwhich issues were discussed that changed the course of our country's \nhistory. The key issue here is that it is a deliberative body.\n\n[[Page S194]]\n\n  I was in the Senate energy committee the other day and one of the \nopponents of this Keystone bill said we need to be guided by science. I \nlike that thought. We are not to be guided by our prejudice. We are not \nto be guided by what we want to be the case. We are to be guided by the \nfacts, because just as when I was a kid and I would read about how this \ngreat deliberative body would decide issues that would then decide our \ncountry's future, this Keystone bill decides the future for many \nissues.\n  With that said, let me also say that I just came over from the House \nof Representatives and one of the nice things I had the privilege to do \nwas to enter a Keystone bill quite similar to this one, which passed. \nIn the course of that being introduced, debated, passed, et cetera, I \nheard the arguments of those who were opposed to the Keystone bill, and \nI have been able to think about them.\n  I am pleased to say I think there actually is common ground. If the \nAmerican people want the Senate to work together to come up with \nsolutions on a bipartisan basis, and if we are to be guided by science \nand the facts and not by our prejudice, and if what we deliberate will \nhelp determine the future of our country and the many families in our \ncountry, I am pleased to say that we have common ground.\n  The opposition is concerned about climate change, increased carbon \nemissions, the amount of oil that might be spilled, whether this \nencourages the use of fossil fuels, and are the jobs being created \nworth being created? We can address these factually, not by prejudice \nbut by using, actually, President Obama's own State Department \ninformation. With that kind of source--it is President Obama's State \nDepartment providing the answer to these questions. So let's go through \nthem.\n  First, the President's own State Department says that building the \npipeline will decrease carbon emissions, there will be less oil \nspilled. By the way, it will not only create jobs, but it will also \nsave workers' lives. We are deliberating a bill here which, according \nto President Obama's State Department, will save lives. That is truly \nchanging the future of somebody.\n  In detail, on page 34 of President Obama's State Department report, \nit says that the pipeline would have no significant environmental \nimpact. It will actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 28 to 42 \npercent relative to not building the pipeline at all.\n  President Obama's own State Department also acknowledges that these \noil sands are going to be developed whether we build the pipeline or \nnot. If they are not piped to the gulf coast of Louisiana and Texas to \nbe processed, they will be sent to overseas markets such as China, \ncreating Chinese jobs instead of American jobs.\n  I think it is also safe to say--we read about how in China people \ncan't see the blue sky. Their environmental standards are far more lax \nthan ours. If it goes to the gulf coast, I can tell my colleagues I \njust came from Louisiana yesterday and I saw blue skies.\n  With all of our environmental standards, this will be processed in \nsuch a way which is most environmentally friendly. If it goes to China, \nthere will be pollutants put out in the air which the jet stream will \nblow over the United States. If we are to be guided by science and not \nby prejudice, the science would say we should build the pipeline to \nallow the oil sands to be processed in the United States.\n  I heard one person say that he would be for the pipeline if he was \nsure the oil would not be exported. I don't quite know how to respond \nto that because if we don't build the pipeline it will absolutely be \nexported. It will be exported to China, and then quite likely we will \nbuy the refined products that the Chinese then produce. On the other \nhand, again referencing President Obama's State Department, they have \nsaid that if we pipe that oil to the gulf coast, our gulf coast \nrefineries are uniquely equipped to process that oil in an \nenvironmentally safe way, and so it is unlikely that it will be \nexported. I will add to that, according to the World Trade Organization \nguidelines, if we accept an import from another country, we cannot not \nexport it should there be higher value.\n  But I return to what President Obama's State Department said, which \nis that the gulf coast refineries' unique ability to refine this in an \nenvironmentally sensitive way means that despite World Trade \nOrganization restrictions, it is unlikely that it will be exported.\n  There are other benefits as well. It is clear that it will diversify \nour energy security. Instead of buying our oil from the Middle East or \nfrom countries like Venezuela who don't care for us--in fact, use the \nmoney we pay them in some cases to finance terrorism--it will come from \na trusted neighbor who will spend that money that we pay Canada for \nthis commodity back into the North American economy creating jobs \nindirectly in the United States that otherwise would not be, which \nleads us to the question, are these jobs worth having? In a word, the \nanswer is absolutely. Now, we all know that creating better jobs for \nAmerican families is what should be the Congress's priority.\n  For 6 years we have been talking about building the Keystone XL \nPipeline and we have, if you will, postponed the creation of these \njobs.\n  Let's just look at it. Refineries in my State of Louisiana and along \nthe gulf coast would benefit because it would be roughly 100,000 \nbarrels a day of crude oil transported to us. In Louisiana up to 12 \npercent of that oil would end up in our refineries, more than $1 \nbillion in revenue to our economy. It would create over 40,000 \nconstruction jobs over a 1-to-2 year period.\n  Some will oppose this and say these jobs only last for a week or two. \nI was outside the energy committee hearing room and there were a couple \nof fellows from trade unions who stopped me. They said, We need these \njobs.\n  I said, what about the argument of the other side that the jobs will \nonly last 2 weeks?\n  Those are the nature of our jobs. If you bring a master welder in, he \nor she will do their job for 2 weeks and then move on to another. But \nfor our union members to get their union benefits, they have to work a \ncertain number of hours per quarter or per month--I forget the unit of \ntime--but this will allow them to meet that minimum requirement in \norder to continue to receive their union benefits.\n  I can tell you the crafts unions think that these jobs are worth \nhaving. These are well-paying jobs with good benefits. They are not the \nservice sector in which hours might have been reduced from 40 to 30 \nhours a week. These are great jobs and great benefits.\n  The American people want Washington to work together. As I mentioned \nearlier, I introduced and passed Keystone legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives. Keystone has become a symbol for North American energy \nindependence. Approving this pipeline is not the final step in this \nindependence but it is the next step. It is a good step.\n  The case for approving this pipeline and other energy infrastructure \nprojects is clear. I encourage my colleagues to join in approving the \nKeystone XL Pipeline and putting this debate to rest because I truly \nbelieve we have common ground, if we are to be guided by the science \nand the facts and not by prejudice. We know from President Obama's \nState Department that it reduces carbon emission, it will decrease the \namount of oil spilled, it has minimal effect upon the environment, it \nwill save the lives of the workers while strengthening our national \nsecurity and enhancing our energy independence and creating 40,000 \nAmerican jobs. That is why more than 60 percent of Americans support \nthis bill. It is a jobs bill, a national security bill, and it is a \nbill which should be passed.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, might I say to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana, he indicated this was his maiden speech on the floor of \nthe Senate. If that is so, I urge him to make additional speeches. I \ndon't think I ever heard a more concise summary with regard to the \npipeline issue than he just gave. We can certainly see why the people \nof Louisiana sent him here. It was perfect, it was cogent, and it was \nshort. It was interesting. He had a bill very similar to this and \nSenator Cassidy passed it in the House and he is now in the Senate. We \nhope that with enough debate we can have truly\n\n[[Page S195]]\n\na bipartisan effort with comity. This is a new beginning. We are so \nhappy to have the Senator here. I thank him for his remarks.\n  Mr. CASSIDY. I thank the Senator from Kansas.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Roberts pertaining to the introduction of S. 168 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are getting close to a time when we are \ngoing to be able to see a reality here that we have been talking \nabout--the Keystone Pipeline--for a long period of time now. When I go \nback to Oklahoma, people say: If you have something that no one is \nagainst who does not have a particular institutional reason to be \nagainst it--everyone is for it. When you see the jobs--no single thing \nwe have dealt with in the last 3 or 4 years that I can recall has \ntalked about 42,000 new jobs that otherwise are not going to be there, \ngood-paying jobs.\n  I admit that I am biased a little bit because being from Oklahoma--\nCushing, OK, is right in the center of the State. It is the hub of all \nof the pipelines going through America. But I see that there is really \nno logical reason--I heard someone on the floor just a few minutes ago \nsaying: All those dirty oil sands up in Alberta are going to be--there \nis a great environmental risk from that. Yet they know full well that \nif for some reason the people who are opposed to fossil fuel \naltogether--such as President Obama--are successful, they are still \ngoing to produce that stuff up there.\n  China is chomping at the bit right now because China has a great need \nfor the very ingredients in the pipeline that we do here in this \ncountry. They already have talked about transportation to the western \npart of Canada to get it to China. So it is going to happen. In fact, \nyou could argue, if you are concerned about some of the environmental \nproblems, if they do exist, they would be greater if China did it than \nif we did it. For example, China does not have any emission controls on \nall of the stuff that we are talking about the way we do in this \ncountry.\n  I think there are some things that are factual. I think everyone is \naware of it. One is that President Obama has had a constant war on \nfossil fuels since the time before he was even President of the United \nStates. When we look at what he has done and how he has committed--and \nwe have heard all of those quotes from when he was talking to the far-\nleft environmental groups, the Tom Steyers and others like him who have \nput in the money to fight fossil fuels. He is one who is solidly \nopposed and doing everything in his power to keep us from finishing the \npipeline.\n  Having said that--I will put the chart up on what happened just a \nyear ago in my State of Oklahoma. The only visit the President has made \nto my State of Oklahoma was about a year ago--2 years ago. He came in \nand was--in the background there, that is a picture of him in Cushing, \nOK, and those are the barrels--this is what is taking place right now \nin Cushing.\n  He was talking about--his quote there, as you can read:\n\n       I am directing my administration to make this project a \n     priority--\n\n  He was talking about the Keystone Pipeline--\n\n     to go ahead and to get it done.\n\n  Well, he made that statement and he came down to hold that meeting in \nCushing, OK, to try to make them believe he was actually for a \npipeline. He went on to say that he was going to make sure that he was \nnot going to do anything to keep the pipeline from going on further \nsouth.\n  Now, let's get the picture here. You have Cushing, OK, which is right \nin the middle of the United States, and the pipeline will continue to \ngo south to the Texas coast. Well, he said he was not going to do \nanything to stop that. There is a good reason for this; that is, he \ncannot. He does not have any jurisdiction. That did not cross an \ninternational boundary. The borders--the international border that it \nhas crossed is in Canada. So that is the area where he is still to this \nday doing all he can to keep that from being a reality. The southern \nleg could be finished and he cannot do anything about that.\n\n  I mentioned Tom Steyer. I want to put up that chart so people know--\nin case they have not been introduced. He is probably a very fine \nperson. He has a strong commitment to try to stop fossil fuels. He is \nthe one who made the statement back before the November elections that \nhe was going to raise $100 million--put in $50 million of his own money \nand raise $50 million in addition to that--and put it in eight \ncampaigns--I think we know probably which campaigns they were--to see \nwhether he could resurrect the issue of global warming and whether he \ncould stop the pipeline.\n  Well, all that happened back then. I think it is important that \npeople understand that he was not able to--he was willing to put his \nmillions of dollars in, but he could not raise the 50. So instead of \nthat, he put $70 million of his money in the race. This is not me \ntalking; this is all--he is very proud of it. Frankly, I appreciate the \nfact that he is not trying to hide what he is doing. I know he has some \npolitical interests. I know he has a commitment to try to stop the \npipeline. I am not sure what that is based on other than just the \npeople to whom he caters.\n  But nonetheless he has a great deal of influence with this \nadministration. It was reported a couple of weeks ago that he had \nvisited the Obama White House 14 times--that is as of that time--which \nled a member of the watchdog group Public Citizen to say, ``Tom Steyer \nhas not just got the ear of the President, but he clearly has the \nPresident's attention.'' Again, that is this watchdog committee making \nthat statement.\n  So we are looking at it now. We know that the White House meetings \nwere often with President Obama's counselor and chief environmental \nadvisor, John Podesta. We remember John Podesta from the Clinton \nadministration. He has been a lobbyist now for quite some time. He is \nvery actively involved in this issue. Reports have also surfaced that \nSteyer and Podesta met with billionaire liberal activist George Soros \njust days after Steyer made his commitment.\n  Anyway, that is behind us now. That affected the election, there is \nno question about that; however, they still lost. If I am guessing \nright on the races he was involved in, there is not one of those who \nwon. Republicans took over 10 seats. That was quite a good year. So \nmaybe he wasted several million dollars. But when we looked at it and \nif you think about what he has done to fossil fuels, that has been his \nwar.\n  Twice today already I have heard people on the floor saying: Well, \nlook at the success the oil industry has had under the Obama \nadministration. Well, I have to suggest that it has been in spite of \nthe Obama administration. The proof is very easy. The revolution that \nis going on right now within the oil industry is one that has been very \nsuccessful. On private land and on State land, the amount of production \nsince Obama has been in office has actually increased by 61 percent. \nThat is incredible.\n  They say: Well, you must be really pro oil and gas because of that.\n  In reality, all of that, 100 percent of that 61-percent increase has \nbeen on State and private land. On public land, the Federal land that \nhe has control over, there has not be an increase of 61 percent or even \n6 percent. As a matter of fact, there has been a reduction of 6 \npercent.\n  So that is going on and it is all a part of this war that is taking \nplace right now. I am very anxious to see how these votes turn out. I \nknow that people, when they realize the number of jobs that are there, \nI get very excited about it, and I can't help but think we are going to \nbe successful.\n  I wish to mention though--I wasn't going to--a person whom I consider \nto be a very good friend is on the floor, and we have philosophically \ndisagreed with each other about as much as any two people can; that is, \nthe Senator from Vermont.\n  He is sincere. He believes what he says. Yet some of the things he \nsays I believe are wrong, but he believes\n\n[[Page S196]]\n\nthem. I don't want to question whether he is telling what he believes \nis the truth--and others too.\n  Another good friend of mine is the Senator from California, Mrs. \nBoxer. Frankly, I will miss her in the Senate. I understand she has \nannounced her retirement.\n  But nonetheless, on the issue they are talking about on global \nwarming, I listen and I think: Where do they come up with this stuff?\n  Because we know for a fact that many of the things that they talk \nabout are not true. We keep hearing that 97 percent of the scientists \nare saying they believe CO2 is the cause of the catastrophic \nclimate change, the world is coming to an end, and we are all going to \ndie.\n  This goes back to about 2002 when this became an issue. I will \nremember this for a long time because that was when the first bills \nwere introduced. At that time everybody thought global warming was \ntrue. They were all going to try to do what they could to stop it.\n  Frankly, at the very first I thought it must be true--that is what \neverybody said--until they did a study at the Wharton School. Some of \ntheir scientists, along with MIT, Charles Rivers and Associates, and \nothers said what the cost would be. Because everybody was talking about \nthe world coming to an end and they asked: But what is cost going to \nbe?\n  They all agreed on a range, and that range has not been refuted by \nanyone. The range is between $300 billion and $400 billion a year. I \nimmediately went back to see. Whenever I hear a big number, I go back \nto Oklahoma and I count the number of people, families who file a \nFederal income tax return and then I do my math.\n  That would cost the average person and family in Oklahoma $3,000. So \nwe think: All right. Are we sure we are going to get something for the \n$3,000?\n  I will share with you--because a lot of people have forgotten this--\nthat Lisa Jackson was the first Administrator of the EPA who was \nappointed by President Obama. I asked her on the record, live on TV, in \nour committee, I said: Now let's assume we passed some of this \nlegislation that puts in cap and trade or do it even by regulation. Is \nthis going to stop CO2 emissions or lower CO2 \nemissions worldwide?\n  She said: No.\n  These are her words, not mine. She said: The reason is the problem \nisn't here in the United States, the problem is in China, it is in \nIndia, it is in Mexico, and it is in other places.\n  So in the event they were able to do that, then this would not lower \nit. In fact, we could use the same argument and say if we passed a cap \nand trade and did something--as they are talking about doing and we \nhave heard on the floor today--then it would have the effect of not \nreducing but increasing CO2 emissions, and this is why.\n  As we chase our manufacturing base overseas where they have to \nsomehow find someplace where they can generate electricity, it will be \nin countries such as China and India where they don't have any of the \nrestrictions in emissions.\n  So even if someone is a believer that the world is coming to an end, \nthat global warming is going to kill everybody and it is all due to \nman-made gas, if they truly believe that still, even in spite of that, \nit is not going to reduce worldwide emissions. I guess that is what \nthey want to do, so we hear about the consensus.\n  I remember at that time I made a speech on this floor questioning the \nscience. I said: I assume there are scientists out there who are not a \npart of the IPCC--that is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange--and that those scientists know better. They know what the \nreality is.\n  I started getting phone calls. I got phone calls from scientists. On \nthis chart are recognized scientists. There are 58.\n  Richard Lindzen, I see his picture. He is a scientist at MIT. I think \nwe could argue he would be in contention with the very best informed \nscientists.\n  Richard Lindzen said:\n\n       Controlling Carbon is a bureaucrat's dream. If you control \n     carbon, you control life.\n\n  Is that real, these people, or what? I remember how upset he was with \nAl Gore. Richard Lindzen made the statement again--this is him, not me, \nRichard Lindzen of MIT:\n\n       To treat all change as something to fear is bad enough. To \n     do so in order to exploit that fear is much worse.\n\n  Now we have so many things that have happened. Just the other day--it \nwasn't long ago, I don't have the exact date--one of the universities \ndid a survey of all the weathercasters, and they came back that 63 \npercent of weathercasters believe any global warming that is occurring \nis the result of natural variation and not human activities.\n  To say ``97 percent of scientists'' is just not true, but if you want \nto believe it badly enough you will. So we have a lot of information.\n  Nature journal, which is a well-respected journal, in their 2013 \npaper said that ``there is considerable uncertainty as to whether \n[increases in extreme climate variability] is occurring.\n  Munich Reinsurance Company said: ``Global weather related disaster \nlosses have declined by 25% as a proportion of GDP.''\n  We have all these statements.\n  The IPCC, they are the ones that are always being quoted, and it is a \nbranch of the United Nations. That is where all this started and \ncertainly it would enure to their benefit to have people believe that \nwe have to look at some international organization such as the United \nNations to protect us from all these droughts and all these things that \nthey say are going to happen.\n  We had another little thing happen recently. I only mention this \nbecause nobody has yet on the floor. I think everyone used to believe \nthat everyone was already aware of it, but remember Climategate?\n  Climategate was when they were having one of the big United Nations \nparties. It was going to be in Copenhagen. I remember a lot of our \npeople went over there to tell the 191 countries that were \nparticipating that the United States was going to pass cap and trade, \nthey were going to do all of these things.\n  I went over at the very end of it, made my little talk, and assured \nthem that in spite of the fact that President Obama had been there, \nSecretary Clinton at the time had been there and now-Secretary Kerry \nand all the rest of them--to say we are not going to be doing it in the \nUnited States of America. If anybody believes what they said, that we \nare going to pass cap and trade, we are not going to do it. They had \ntried it already. There were 35 Members--and at that time it was a much \nmore liberal Senate than we have today--only 35 would actually vote for \nsomething like that.\n  Incidentally, it was at that time when Climategate came up. \nClimategate was when they analyzed some of the things IPCC had said, \nand they had all these quotes and emails that totally debunked the \ncredibility of IPCC. Still today they are talking about it.\n  To give us an idea, Christopher Booker, with the UK Telegraph, said: \n``Worst scientific scandal of our generation.''\n  That scandal he is talking about is to try to have them make people \nbelieve climate change is going to destroy the world.\n  Clive Crook of the Financial Times said:\n\n       The closed mindedness of these supposed men of science . . \n     . is surprising, even to me. The stink of intellectual \n     corruption is overpowering.\n\n  Again we are talking about Climategate. Nobody talks about it any \nmore, but still this is a fact.\n  A prominent physicist from the IPCC, who is no longer there, said: \n``Climategate was a fraud on a scale I've never seen,'' talking about \nhow they are rigging the information to try to cook the science.\n  So we have all of these--this is Newsweek. It said: ``Once celebrated \nclimate researchers feeling like the used car salesman.''\n  ``Some of the IPCC's most quoted data and recommendations were taken \nstraight out of unchecked activist brochures. . . . ''\n  So these are the things that are going on, and I hope the people, as \nwe develop this right now--we should be concentrating on the vote that \nis going to be coming up having to do with the pipeline. But as the \ncommittee of jurisdiction is looking at this, I can assure you we are \ngoing to be having hearings.\n  One hearing we are going to have is to get some of the best \nscientists\n\n[[Page S197]]\n\naround to evaluate and to see what the truth is on the global warming \nissue.\n  But in the meantime let's go back to the pipeline. I can't think of \nany argument against it that is overwhelming, and the mere fact that \npeople say they don't like the Alberta sands or the production, it \ndoesn't mean we in the United States of America are going to stop them \nfrom doing it because they will just do it and ship it to China.\n  So we have a huge issue we are concerned with. I can't think of \nanything I have seen in the past 4 or 5 years that is going to be \nproducing more jobs in America than this issue.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines).

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the issue of EPA \nregulation of waters of the United States rule. I see it as one of the \nbiggest power grabs by an agency in a long time--particularly the EPA.\n  Before I speak on that issue, I wish to bring attention to some \nheadlines that appeared both in Iowa and nationally on this issue. I \nwill quote the Wall Street Journal: ``Watch Out For That Puddle, Soon \nIt Could Be Federally Regulated.''\n  The next quote is from an Iowa Farm Bureau spokesman: ``Water rule is \nreally about control of land.''\n  The next quote is from a Farm Bureau spokesman: ``Water rule intrudes \non property rights, hurts conservation.''\n  Farm Bureau spokesman said: ``EPA proposal would regulate all water \nwherever it flows.''\n  Farm Bureau spokesman: ``Water rule threatens U.S. agriculture.''\n  The last quote is also from the a Farm Bureau spokesman: ``Rule is \nthreat to conservation momentum . . . a flood of red tape.''\n  Last spring the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers published a proposed \nrule to define ``waters of the United States.'' This is part of a long \nhistory of attempts to determine the scope of the Federal Government's \njurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. The latest proposal has \ngenerated no shortage of rhetoric from those concerned about the rule \nas well as those defending the rule. However, you would be hard pressed \nto call it a true debate.\n  Rather than making a serious attempt to address the numerous \nlegitimate concerns with the rule, the Environmental Protection Agency \nand their allies in the professional advocacy community have attempted \nto push a narrative that tries to portray critics of the rule as \nmisinformed, nutty or in favor of water pollution.\n  They, the advocacy community, claim the rule simply clarifies the \njurisdiction of Federal agencies, and they also claim it does not \nexpand that jurisdiction in any way. The EPA also promises that it will \nnot interfere with the farmer's routine use of their own land.\n  Given its history of ignorance and indifference toward the needs of \nrural America, it is no wonder EPA's assurances are met with skepticism \nby many in America, but it is particularly met with skepticism by \nAmerica's farmers.\n  The EPA will have another chance to consider the concerns of farmers \nand many other Americans as it reviews the formal comments it collected \nbefore issuing the final rule. Still, given the fact that EPA \nofficials--starting with Administrator McCarthy--went out of their way \nto be dismissive of legitimate criticisms even while the comment period \nwas still open, I am not going to hold my breath hoping for a change of \nheart on the part of the EPA.\n  First, it is important to understand that this debate is not about \nwhether we should have clean water protections but which level of \ngovernment is in the best position under our laws, and the intent of \nthose laws, to manage which bodies of water.\n  Despite what some interest groups would have you believe, no one is \narguing that farmers or anybody else should be allowed to dump \npollutants in the waterway. There is also no question that there is a \nvery important role for the Federal Clean Water Act to protect \ninterstate bodies of water.\n  However, the Clean Water Act itself clearly states:\n\n       It is the policy of Congress to recognize, preserve, and \n     protect the primary responsibilities and rights of States to \n     prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution, to plan the \n     development and use (including restoration, preservation, and \n     enhancement) of land and water resources, and to consult with \n     the Administrator in the exercise of his authority under this \n     chapter.\n\n  That is in the law right now, and it has been there a long time. The \ncomplicated Federal clean water permitting process is appropriate if a \nfactory is looking to discharge waste into a river, but does it make \nsense to require a farmer to apply for a Federal permit to build a \nfence on his own land?\n  There is clearly a limit to where Federal regulation is appropriate, \nwhere Federal regulation is effective, and where Federal regulation is \nlegal. In fact, expanding the cumbersome Federal permitting process to \ncover lands it was not designed for would actually be counterproductive \nin my State of Iowa and probably a lot of other States as well.\n  Forcing farmers to file for a Federal permit would add significant \nredtape for Iowa farmers as they make routine decisions about how best \nto use their land. Ironically, that could delay or deter farmers from \nundertaking projects to improve water quality, and that is why I quoted \nsome members of the Farm Bureau earlier.\n\n  There was one story that very specifically said farmers in Iowa were \nwilling to spend a lot of their own money to do some conservation \npractices that everybody would be very happy with, but they are not \ngoing to spend their own money because they cannot even get an answer \nfrom the Corps and the EPA on whether they even need a permit. They are \nnot going to pursue their conservation practices and invest all of \ntheir money if they could be violating a law, so you can see why they \nare very upset. Under the existing law, the EPA cannot even tell a \nfarmer whether they need a permit, and they want to assume a lot more \nresponsibility. It is kind of concerning considering that they cannot \ndo their job right now.\n  Having to constantly apply for Federal permits just to farm their \nland would be unnecessarily burdensome to farmers, a waste of Federal \nresources, and an intrusion on State and local land use regulations. \nWhat about the EPA's assertion that its proposed rule simply clarifies \nits existing jurisdiction and restores it to what it used to be? The \nfact is that in the past, the EPA has attempted to claim nearly \nunlimited jurisdiction well beyond what the law says and well beyond \neven an expansive reading of the Federal Government's constitutional \nauthority to regulate interstate commerce. However, those attempts were \nrepeatedly struck down by our U.S. Supreme Court.\n  The Court decisions in 2001 and 2006 made very clear that the Federal \nGovernment does not have unlimited authority over all bodies of water \nbut left the precise division between State and Federal or local \njurisdictions somewhat unclear.\n  In response, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA issued \nguidance in December 2008 in an attempt to comply with the Supreme \nCourt's rulings but did not engage in any formal rulemaking. \nSignificantly, legislation was routinely proposed in Congress by those \nwho wanted to push aside the Supreme Court rulings and give the EPA \nunlimited jurisdiction, but it never garnered enough support.\n  While legislation would not have resolved the constitutional \nlimitations to the EPA's authority, it is important to know Congress \npassed on several opportunities to amend the Clean Water Act to expand \nFederal jurisdiction.\n\n[[Page S198]]\n\nNevertheless, in April 2011, the Obama administration proposed to \nreplace the existing guidance with revised guidance that provided a \nvery expansive reading of Federal authority, leaving very little land \nunder State and local control.\n  This unilateral reassertion of expansive authority--in defiance of \nthe other two branches of government--was made even more egregious by \nbeing proposed through guidance outside of the formal rulemaking \nprocess. Fortunately, the outcry from the Republican Congress against \nthis power grab caused the administration to scrap guidance and pursue \na formal rule with public comment.\n  I do believe we need clarity about what is and is not covered by the \nClean Water Act, and particularly its permitting process, and that a \nformal rule with public comments is the best route.\n  However, the proposed rule that was formally published in April of \n2014 once again asserted an extremely expansive view of Federal \nauthority. This would increase the Federal Government's jurisdiction to \nregulate waters that had previously been the sole jurisdiction of \nStates and local governments. Moreover, rather than clarifying points \nof uncertainty remaining from original guidance, court decisions, and \nprecedents, the proposed rule would create a whole new definition of \nwaters of the United States that opens new areas of uncertainty and \nconfusion.\n  Rather than fixing the problem, this rule would make it much worse. \nIt would lead to another round of court cases and overwhelm the Federal \nagencies with requests for jurisdictional determinations, diverting \nscarce Federal resources away from enforcement in more critical areas.\n  The EPA and the Corps should withdraw the proposed rule and work \ncollaboratively with the States and other stakeholders to craft a \nsensible rule that will ensure clean water and provide much needed \nclarity about the scope of the Federal Clean Water Act jurisdiction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/13/senate-section/article/S198-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO TRISTRAM COFFIN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to publicly thank U.S. \nattorney Tristram Coffin for his service to Vermont and our country. I \nhave known Tris for decades, and I am proud that Vermont has been \nserved by someone as thoughtful and fair as Tris. I join my fellow \nVermonters in thanking him for his service to our State.\n  Tris earned his undergraduate degree from Wesleyan University and his \nlaw degree from Columbia University. He worked for me as a staff \nattorney on the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1991 to 1994 before \nbecoming an assistant U.S. attorney in Vermont's civil division from \n1994 to 1998 and in their criminal division from 1996 to 2006. He then \nworked in private practice in Burlington with the firm of Paul Frank & \nCollins, P.C. In 2009 I recommended Tris for the vacant U.S. attorney \nposition, and he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate in August 2009 \nto be Vermont's 36th U.S. attorney.\n  Throughout his time as U.S. attorney, Tris has demonstrated \nthoughtful leadership in partnering with State and local law \nenforcement agencies and Vermont communities on a wide range of issues, \nincluding efforts to confront the crisis of heroin and opioid \naddiction. In September 2010 he convened a timely and constructive \nsymposium in the State house in Montpelier to discuss the problem of \nopiate drug abuse. Impressed by his work, last year I invited Tris to \ndeliver testimony at a Judiciary Committee field hearing in Rutland \nexamining community solutions to the opioid crisis. At that hearing, I \nwas moved by the dedication and passion Tris has brought to developing \npartnerships with Vermont schools to raise awareness and focus on \nprevention.\n  Vermont is a safer and better place because of dedicated public \nservants like Tris. I commend Tris for his years of service to the \nGreen Mountain State and wish him the best in his future endeavors. He \nis a friend I treasure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/13/senate-section/article/S198-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S198-S199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE PATRICK R. DONAHOE\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the 73rd Postmaster \nGeneral of the United States, Patrick ``Pat'' R. Donahoe, upon his \nretirement, for his leadership, vision and commitment to the U.S. \nPostal Service, and for his service to our Nation. During his 39-year \ncareer, Pat ascended the ranks of the Postal Service and went on to \nhelp lead the 239-year-old agency during one of its most challenging \nperiods.\n  Pat's career with the agency began in 1975, when he started as \ntrainee on a mail-sorting machine in his native Pittsburgh. In 1976 he \nwas hired as a clerk at the same location, and from there he moved up \nthe ranks and went on to hold several leadership positions. Over the \nyears, he has served as Vice President of Allegheny Operations, Senior \nVice President of Human Resources, Senior Vice President of Operations, \nChief Operating Officer, and Deputy Postmaster General.\n  In his role as Chief Operating Officer, he helped the Postal Service \nnavigate back-to-back tragedies and challenges to mail operations \nfollowing the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the use of the mail to \ntransmit anthrax. He also played a key role in the recovery efforts \nfollowing Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.\n  Before he worked his way up the Postal Service's ranks, Pat graduated \nfrom the University of Pittsburgh with a bachelor of science in \neconomics. During his time with the Postal Service, he earned his \nmaster of science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan \nSchool of Management as a Sloan fellow.\n  In October 2010, Pat was appointed by his colleagues on the Postal \nService Board of Governors to be the Nation's 73rd Postmaster General, \nPMG. At the time, the outlook for the Postal Service was bleak and its \nfuture uncertain. It was hemorrhaging billions of dollars and saw its \nworkforce numbers slashed as it grappled with the rapid transition to \nelectronic communication and the fallout from the great recession in \n2009. It was teetering on the edge of collapse, and no one knew how \nlong the Postal Service could hold on. But Pat Donahoe accepted the \nchallenge.\n  During his 4-year tenure as Postmaster General, Pat proved himself to \nbe a dedicated public servant, a strong leader, and an innovative chief \nexecutive with the willingness to make tough calls and hard decisions. \nHe did what was necessary to help the Postal Service keep its lights on \nand compete in the age of the Internet. He did a remarkable job using \nlimited resources to keep the Postal Service alive during the second \nworst financial crisis in its history. With the help of a strong team \nat Postal Service headquarters and in postal facilities across the \ncountry, he sought to keep prices competitive, reduced costs, \nrightsized the enterprise, and explored a number of innovative and \nsuccessful business endeavors. His efforts have helped guide the \ncenturies-old agency through a remarkable transition that has better \nprepared it to compete and remain a linchpin of our economy in the \ndigital age. In fact, his work and his vision have put the Postal \nService in a position where, with the right tools and authorities from \nCongress, it can remain competitive and viable for generations to come.\n  Pat Donahoe had a vision for what the Postal Service could become and \nnever stopped working to build on its potential. During his tenure, the \nPostmaster General helped bring the Postal Service to a place where it \ncould better meet the demands of the 21st-century customers it serves. \nHe reimaged tried-and-true services to make them more user-friendly and \nmore valuable, like flat-rate shipping and priority mail. He created \nmore opportunities to innovate and grow using the Postal Service's \nunique distribution network by adding services like Sunday package \ndelivery and by exploring innovative partnerships with companies such \nas Amazon, FedEx, and UPS.\n  As someone who has watched the Postal Service both soar and struggle, \nPat provided guidance and leadership during tremendously challenging \ntimes. Despite the significant financial and legislative restraints \nthat face the Postal Service today, the Postmaster General kept the \nPostal Service on a course that would enable it to deliver on the high \nexpectations set by the American public.\n  The PMG has also been a strong voice for the agency and an important \npartner to Congress during our efforts to pass comprehensive postal \nreform in the 112th and 113th Congress. He has\n\n[[Page S199]]\n\nworked tirelessly on behalf of the Postal Service's customers, \nemployees, stakeholders, and the 7 to 8 million people whose jobs \ndepend on a healthy and robust Postal Service.\n  As I worked with my former partner on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Dr. Tom Coburn from Oklahoma, in \ndeveloping comprehensive postal reform legislation, Pat and his staff \nwere indispensable. We could always rely on the PMG and his team to \ncome with little notice to a meeting in the Capitol or to join a late-\nnight or weekend conference call.\n  As he would probably admit, Pat also took plenty of abuse from some \nof my colleagues here in Congress, from the press, and from the public. \nHe knew that some of the initiatives he put into place during his \ntenure as Postmaster General would be unpopular but stuck to his guns \nbecause he thought it was the right thing to do. Even in recent days, \nhe has continued to press for what he knows is right and what he knows \nwill sustain the Postal Service in the years to come.\n  Pat Donahoe has graciously shared decades of his life with the Postal \nService and has served the American people well. I sincerely thank him \nfor his dedication, and I deeply appreciate his tireless efforts to \nhelp the Postal Service and our country. While Pat is retiring from the \nPostal Service, his legacy will carry on, and the changes he made will \ncontinue to serve the Postal Service and its customers. I wish Pat, his \nwife Janet, their two sons, and their granddaughters Charlotte and Lucy \nall the best in the years to come. As we say in the Navy when people \ncomplete an especially difficult assignment and sail off into the \nsunrise, ``Fair winds and a following sea.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/13/senate-section/article/S199-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT COLONEL STEPHANIE RILEY\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the exceptional \nservice and the extraordinary life of Lt. Col. Stephanie Riley of \nConcord, NH.\n  Born and raised in Henniker, NH, Stephanie graduated from Henniker \nHigh School in 1984. An excellent student, Stephanie attended St. \nPaul's advance studies program the summer before her senior year and \nwas the valedictorian of her high school class. In 1988, she graduated \ncum laude from Boston College's School of Nursing and in 1989 was \ncommissioned into the U.S. Air Force, where she completed a 4-month \nnursing internship at Travis Air Force Base in California. Following \nher internship, she was stationed at the Barksdale Air Force Base in \nLouisiana for the remainder of her 3-year tour.\n  In 1992, Colonel Riley entered the Inactive Ready Reserve and became \na civilian travel nurse. Showing both her love for the military and her \nhome State, she returned to New Hampshire in 2000 and joined the U.S. \nAir Force Reserves in Westover, MA, and then the NH Air National Guard \nin 2003. She subsequently volunteered for a tour abroad and deployed to \nQatar in support of both Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. She held appointments in the Medical Group as officer in \ncharge of staff development, assistant chief nurse, and the chief of \neducation and training. Colonel Riley was employed by the New Hampshire \nArmy National Guard as a case manager and was active on State and \nnational committees. She became a voice for National Guard members and \nNew Hampshire veterans and was a key member of New Hampshire's State \nVeteran's Advisory Committee, the Military Officers Association of \nAmerica, and the national and State chapters of the National Guard \nAssociation. She served in key leadership positions on the New \nHampshire Legislative Commission on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, \nPTSD and Traumatic Brain Injury, TBI.\n  In October 2013, Steph was diagnosed with early stage breast cancer, \nand in what may have been her most heroic effort, she channeled her \nenergy into a personal and sustained effort to promote health \nscreenings and cancer awareness. She posted openly on social media and \nspoke courageously about her decision to undergo a preemptive double \nmastectomy. She sparked a team, ``Steph Strong,'' that helped raise \nseveral thousand dollars for Concord Hospital. Her important message \nfor all was to take preventative health screening seriously.\n  From her extensive military service, to her work as a civilian nurse, \nStephanie devoted her life to serving others--a commitment that endured \neven while battling her own illness. She was taken from us far too soon \nbut her legacy of compassion and her inspiring dedication to caring for \nher fellow citizens will live on through all those whose lives she \ntouched.\n  Steph leaves behind the love of her life, her husband Shawn Riley, a \ndeputy fire chief with the Laconia Fire Department, and their son \nShane, age 13, and daughter Sammie Riley, age 9. We are all deeply \nsaddened by the loss of our friend Lt. Col. Stephanie Riley, an \nextraordinary woman and proud New Hampshire daughter who served our \nState and Nation with honor, courage, and dedication. She represented \nthe very best of our State, and I ask my colleagues to join me in \nsending Shawn and his family our deepest condolences and our gratitude \nfor Steph's life and for her work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/13/senate-section/article/S199-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S199-S200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING DICK GAMMICK\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Washoe \nCounty district attorney Dick Gammick, of Reno, on his retirement. \nAfter decades of service to the people of Washoe County, District \nAttorney Gammick retired from public service on January 3, 2015. It \ngives me great pleasure to congratulate him, not only as a colleague, \nbut also as a friend, on his retirement after his years of hard work \nand dedication to the Silver State.\n  District Attorney Gammick stands as a shining example of someone who \nhas devoted their life to the betterment of their community. A devoted \nhusband and proud father, District Attorney Gammick's career in public \nservice began in 1973 when he became a Reno Police Officer while \nattending the University of Nevada, Reno. After earning a degree in \nbusiness administration, he went on to graduate from the McGeorge \nSchool of Law in Sacramento, CA, in 1982. District Attorney Gammick \nserved as chief deputy district attorney for Washoe County for 10 years \nbefore serving as deputy Reno city attorney. Aside from dedicating his \ncareer to Washoe County, he has devoted much of his time and efforts to \nthe betterment of his community through his roles as a board member of \nthe Boys and Girls Club of Truckee Meadows, a member of the \nProspector's Club, and former president of the Reno Rotary Club.\n  In 1994, he was elected Washoe County District Attorney, a post he \nserved in for 20 years. District Attorney Gammick's accomplishments, \nsuch as the opening of a sexual assault center for women and children, \nas well as the implementation of preventive programs to keep young \npeople out of prison, have made Washoe County a stronger and safer \ncommunity. A dedicated prosecutor and advocate of justice, District \nAttorney Gammick was recognized by his peers as the recipient of the \n2013 William J. Raggio Award, as he has committed his career to the \nadministration of justice throughout Washoe County.\n  His service to the Reno community extends far beyond the many \npositions he has held in the Silver State over the years. District \nAttorney Gammick also served his country and is a decorated veteran \nfrom his time serving as a captain in the U.S. Army and a major in the \nNevada Army National Guard. I extend my deepest gratitude to District \nAttorney Gammick for his courageous contributions to the United States \nof America and to freedom-loving nations around the world. His service \nto his country and his bravery and dedication earn him a place among \nthe outstanding men and women who have valiantly defended our Nation. \nAs a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I recognize that \nCongress has a responsibility not only to honor these brave individuals \nwho serve America, but also to ensure they are cared for when they \nreturn home. I remain committed to upholding this promise for our \nveterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout the Nation.\n  I am grateful for his dedication and commitment to the people of \nWashoe County and to the State of Nevada. He\n\n[[Page S200]]\n\nexemplifies the highest standards of leadership and community service \nand should be proud of his long and meaningful career. Today, I ask \nthat all of my colleagues join me in congratulating District Attorney \nGammick on his retirement, and I offer my deepest appreciation for all \nthat he has done to make Washoe County an even better place. I offer my \nbest wishes to Dick and his wife Norma for many successful and \nfulfilling years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/13/senate-section/article/S200-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DOUG GILLESPIE\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I congratulate Clark County \nSheriff Doug Gillespie of Las Vegas on his retirement. After more than \nthree decades of service to the people of Clark County, Sheriff \nGillespie retired from public service on January 5, 2015. It gives me \ngreat pleasure to congratulate him on his retirement after his years of \nhard work and dedication to the people of Southern Nevada.\n  Responsible for the safety of one of the world's top tourist \nattractions, Sheriff Gillespie stands as a shining example of someone \nwho has devoted most of his life to serving his community. Born in \nPennsylvania and raised in New York, Sheriff Gillespie's career in \npublic service began in 1980 when he joined the Las Vegas Metropolitan \nPolice Department as a patrol officer. Prior to serving as sheriff, he \nserved in both SWAT and the K-9 unit, eventually working his way to \nundersheriff in 2003.\n  In 2006, he was elected Clark County sheriff, where he served for 8 \nyears. Sheriff Gillespie's accomplishments, such as improving the Safe \nStrip Initiative to ensure tourist safety, civilianizing the LVMPD \ncrime lab to ensure proper investigations, and establishing the Fusion \nCenter to streamline and share information with different agencies, \nhave made Clark County a stronger and safer community I am proud to \nrepresent in the U.S. Senate. A dedicated police officer and public \nservant, Sheriff Gillespie was recognized by the National Sheriffs' \nAssociation as the 2014 Sheriff of the Year.\n  I am grateful for Sheriff Gillespie's commitment and dedication to \nthe people of Southern Nevada.

A bill to provide for a biennial budget process and a \nbiennial appropriations process and to enhance oversight and the \nperformance of the Federal Government; to the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am very pleased to announce today that \nthe biennial budget proposal introduced by Senators Isakson and Shaheen \nhas been dropped. There are 21 cosponsors, 15 Republicans, 6 Democrats, \nand 1 Independent, and the number is growing as we speak.\n  Senator Shaheen and I started this initiative 2 years ago and it \nreceived 68 votes and a test vote on the budget in 2013. We believe it \nwill receive the necessary votes to become the law of the land in the \nUnited States of America.\n  You might ask why a biennial budget or you might ask yourself why an \n$18 trillion debt and why hundreds of billions of dollars in deficit. \nWe don't have the oversight necessary with the spending that we do now \nto keep us from wasting money. It is time we ran our country like we \nrun our home. It is time we held our agencies accountable. It is time \nour appropriations weren't just idle promises but our oversight was the \nrule of law in the United States Senate.\n  Twenty States out of fifty in the United States have biennial \nbudgets. Countries around the world have biennial budgets. This \nCongress 3 years ago did a biennial budget for the Veterans' \nAdministration just to ensure we wouldn't have a break in funding if \nthe government shut down. Predictability of funding of government is \ncritical, but the oversight of that funding is more critical.\n  Picture this. You get elected in an even-numbered year, 2014. Your \nfirst order of business in 2015 is to pass a 2-year appropriations act \nand a 2-year budget. But then in the even-numbered year that comes up \nwhen you are running for reelection, your job is not spending, your job \nis oversight. Wouldn't it be nice, instead of going home and promising \nyou are bringing home the bacon, instead you are bringing home the \nsavings to see to it that taxpayers' money is better spent?\n  The biennial budget is an idea whose time has come. It is the only \nway we are going to measurably and sustainably reduce the deficits and \nreduce the debt in the United States of America and hold our spending \nmore accountable.\n  Just last night on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, \nthe Clay bill was passed on suicide prevention, a new program in the \nVA, and the funding mechanism was existing funds and fungibility. We \nalready know there is existing money in the appropriations to our \nagencies to pay for new ideas if we charge them to go find them. Some \nof the measures we have been funding for 40 or 50 years probably don't \nneed to be done anymore and some of the things we are not doing \nprobably need to be done. But the way to do it is not to spend more \nmoney and throw more money at the problem, but the way to do it is to \ndo it the way the American taxpayers do it back home--sit around the \nkitchen table, set their priorities, make their funding predictable, \nand from time to time go back and look at where they are spending money \nand see if they can't improve it. This is an idea that will make \nAmerica great.\n  Senator Shaheen is a former Governor of the State of New Hampshire. \nShe had a biennial budget process in her State, and I wish to yield to \nher to describe her cosponsorship of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank the Presiding Officer and I thank my colleague \nSenator Isakson, and I am pleased to join him on the floor today as we \nreintroduce this bipartisan legislation, the Biennial Budgeting and \nAppropriations Act. I want to start by recognizing the good work of \nSenator Isakson because he started working on this issue when he came \nto the Senate in 2005, and he has introduced this legislation in every \nCongress since then. I have been pleased to be able to join him in the \nlast two Congresses.\n  I think we have an opportunity in this Congress to pass this \ncommonsense bipartisan reform. As Senator Isakson pointed out, there is \nno question that the budget process in Washington is broken. Since 1980 \nthere have been only two budgets that have been finished on time, \naccording to the process. In that timeframe Congress has resorted to \nmore than 150 short-term funding bills or continuing resolutions, and \nwe all remember what it was like when the government shut down in \nOctober of 2013. It cost the economy $24 billion. It hurt small \nbusiness. It hurt people across this country. That is no way to govern.\n  While we have made significant progress to reduce deficits in recent \nyears, we need a new way to do business in Washington. Biennial \nbudgeting won't fix everything, but as Senator Isakson said, it is an \nimportant reform that will allow us to work across the aisle not only \nto make more sense of the budget process but to be better stewards of \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  We know that biennial budgeting works. I can attest to that \npersonally, coming from the State of New Hampshire where we have a \nbiennial budget. I served three terms as Governor. We were able in each \nof those bienniums to pass a budget that was balanced, that allowed us \nto get the budget done in the first year of the election cycle and in \nthe second year to be able to have oversight. It works in New \nHampshire, it works in 20 States around the country, and it can work in \nWashington.\n  Biennial budgeting offers a better process that encourages us to work \ntogether to pass budgets on time and to use taxpayer dollars more \nefficiently. As Senator Isakson says, in the first year congressional \nagencies would put together a 2-year budget. In the second year \nCongress would have time to conduct oversight to give agencies the \nability to focus on achieving their missions.\n  As we all know, there are regular reports from the Government \nAccountability Office, GAO, that identify areas of waste, fraud, and \nduplicative programs within government.\n  For example, they have identified ways to reform the farm programs, \nto cut down on inefficiencies in defense, to reduce fraud in health \nprograms, but the current budget process doesn't provide an effective \nmechanism to regularly review GAO's recommendations.\n  Under my annual budgeting, we would be able to take a close look at\n\n[[Page S203]]\n\nthose recommendations to implement savings in the second year which \nwill allow us to figure out how we can more effectively provide \nprograms to the American people and eliminate those that don't work and \nsupport those that do.\n  As we said, in 2013 we had a very strong vote with 68 Senators voting \nto endorse the concept of biannual budgeting. It was a very strong \nbipartisan vote. A similar biannual budget bill passed the House last \nyear with a bipartisan bill vote. It is clear the momentum is growing \nfor this concept because people understand we have to do something to \nreform our budget process.\n  The bill we are introducing today has 22 bipartisan cosponsors. I \nknow we are both working to get more bipartisan sponsors on the bill, \nand we think we have a great shot, with support from this body, to pass \nbiannual budgeting. We think there is support in the House to do that, \nand I look forward to working with Senator Isakson and my colleagues in \nthe Senate to get this done.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the Senator for her support, and I urge the \nother Members of the Senate to join us in this reform effort for the \nspending of the taxpayer's dollars.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBERTS (for himself, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Blunt, \n        Mr. Coats, Mr. Crapo, Mrs. Fischer, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hatch, \n        Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johnson, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Rubio, Mr. \n        Sessions, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Tillis, and Mr. Toomey):\n  S. 168. A bill to codify and modify regulatory requirements of \nFederal agencies; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I rise today to talk about a problem that affects \nvirtually every American, and that would be government regulations; to \nbe more accurate, government overregulation.\n  Let me point out something. In 2014, the administration issued 3,541 \nrules in 1 year. That cost $181 billion. The first week of this new \nyear brought us 35 new rules which added another 1,326 pages to the \nFederal Register. I would urge people back home in the business \ncommunity or any other endeavor in which they are bothered by \nregulations to read the Federal Register as opposed to the \nCongressional Record. The Congressional Record deals with natural gas. \nThe Federal Register deals with facts and regulations.\n  Yet just last night we learned that President Obama has threatened to \nveto a significant regulatory reform proposal now being considered by \nthe House of Representatives. It is interesting to me that the \nPresident is now threatening to veto his own ideas. Back in January of \n2011, President Obama issued an Executive Order. It was entitled \n``Improve Regulation and Regulatory Review.'' That is in quotes. \nUnfortunately, despite claims otherwise, the Executive order has \nlargely been ignored.\n  My bill takes this order and gives it the force of law. My bill would \nrequire that all regulations put forth by the current and future \nadministrations consider the economic burden on American businesses and \nensure stakeholder input during the regulatory process, thus promoting \ninnovation and new jobs.\n  Just as the President said in his order, this egregious assault on \nour economy must stop; it must end.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I have had a longstanding concern with \nthe regulatory process. Like other States, from every corner of Kansas, \nthe No. 1 topic of concern for all businesses, including agriculture, \nenergy, small shops on Main Street, healthcare, education, lending--\nvirtually every enterprise is harmed by overly burdensome and costly \nregulations. Whether it is the EPA'S Waters of the United States \nproposed rule or listing of the infamous lesser prairie chicken as an \nendangered species, the public is losing faith in our government.\n  Obamacare is a prime example of this administration's vast regulatory \noverreach. The bill, as signed into law by the President, as most of us \nknow, was no short read. It was over 2,000 pages. But as the rollout \ncontinues, the administration has now expanded Obamacare into over \n24,000 pages of regulations in the Federal Register.\n  Here is one example of the overly intrusive regulations this \nadministration used the Affordable Health Care Act to implement. It is \nHealth and Human Services' mandate requiring religious institutions to \nprovide insurance coverage for contraceptives and emergency \ncontraceptives.\n  Last year the U.S. Supreme Court had to intervene and determine that \nthe HHS mandate placed an excessive burden on the religious freedom of \nowners of family business.\n  Regrettably, costly and intrusive regulations are not limited to HHS \nand Obamacare and CMS and all of those regulations. Not to be outdone \nby HHS, the Environmental Protection Agency has its own set of overly \nburdensome regulations.\n  Let's take the proposed Waters of the United States rule. For \nexample, as the distinguished Senator from Arkansas knows, this \nproposal has caused a firestorm of opposition all throughout farm \ncountry. The EPA claims that the proposed Waters of the United States \nrule simply clarifies their scope of jurisdiction.\n  Well, therein lies the problem.\n  Farmers and ranchers do not believe it. I don't believe it. They fear \nthe rule would allow the EPA to further expand its control of private \nproperty under the guise of the Clean Water Act.\n  If finalized, this rule could have the EPA requiring a permit for \nordinary field work, construction of a fence, or even planting crops \nnear certain waters.\n  Kansans are justifiably worried the permits would be time consuming, \ncostly, and that the EPA could ultimate deny the permits, even for \nlongstanding and normal cropping practices.\n  This is another prime example of why many Kansans feel their way of \nlife is under attack by the Federal Government's overreach and \noverregulation. Simply put, they feel ruled, not governed.\n  Let's not forget the burdensome carbon regulations now being proposed \nby the EPA. Over the last 6 years, this administration's EPA has \npursued an agenda that can only be described as a war on fossil fuels \nand coal.\n  Just last week, in fact, the EPA announced that by June of this year \nit would finalize carbon reduction rules for both new and existing \npowerplants. That is going to be a move that will drive up the energy \ncost for all Kansans, all Americans, hoping to heat their homes during \nextremely cold winters or hot summers such as the ones we are \nexperiencing now.\n  This decision, which the EPA itself admitted would do nothing to \nreduce global temperature if similar plans are not adopted by Russia, \nChina, India and Brazil, will have unbelievable costs. According to a \nrecent study about the American Action Forum which cites the \nadministration's own estimates these rules are anticipated to cost \nindustry $8.8 billion to comply. That translates into a 6-percent rise \nin electricity prices. Sadly, these regulations will hurt low-income \nindividuals the most--folks who can least afford it and who spend a \ngreater percentage of their income to heat their homes and feed their \nfamilies.\n  Now let's look at what the Department of Labor is trying to do with \nPresident Obama's pen-and-paper dictates. Currently the Department of \nLabor has a regulation to eliminate the companion care exemption put \nforth by this body 40 years ago. This important exemption allows \nseniors and the disabled community access to affordable in-home care. \nIf eliminated, those who need in-home care the most, and their \nfamilies, would be forced to determine which hours are the most crucial \nin the day they receive assistance. In addition, caregivers who \ncurrently work over 40 hours would see their hours and paychecks cut \nbecause of this rule.\n  As the Department of Labor issued this rule and geared up for \nimplementation on January 1 of this year, benefit recipients, \nindividual States, and Members of this Chamber stood together to shine \na light on the negative effects this would have on communities all \nacross the Nation.\n  At the same time, a judge issued a partial determination on this \nregulation, and he stated the following:\n\n       The fact that the Department issued its Notice of Proposed \n     Rulemaking after all six of these bills failed to move is \n     nothing short of yet another thinly-veiled effort to do \n     through regulation what could not be done\n\n[[Page S204]]\n\n     through legislation. Such conduct bespeaks an arrogance to \n     not only disregard Congress's intent but seize unprecedented \n     authority to impose overtime and minimum wage requirements in \n     defiance of the plain language of Section 213. It cannot \n     stand.\n\n  My legislation addresses these abuses. Far too often the good \nintentions of regulations lead to job loss and red-tape that strangles \nbusiness. Worse still, the agenda of bureaucrats drives bad policies \nand stifles economy.\n  I have a solution. My comprehensive bill requires agencies to promote \neconomic growth and job creation by ensuring the benefits outweigh the \ncost of regulations. It is as simple as that.\n  We need to be listening to the folks as well who have to live with \nand pay for the effects of these rules. I am hearing from stakeholders \nthat they are weighing the time and expense of responding to \nregulations against the fact that this administration keeps giving them \nthe minimum allowable time and then doesn't even consider their input. \nBottom line, fewer Americans are bothering to participate in the \ncomment period process.\n  Stakeholder input is crucial and needs to be considered. Right now, \ntime varies on how long the comment period stays open. Sometimes it is \nas little as 2 weeks. My bill would ensure the period stay open for at \nleast 60 days. My colleagues, as we all well know, sometimes the people \nwho are most affected by these rules don't even know they are subject \nto the changes.\n  My bill would mandate that agencies provide warnings, appropriate \ndefault rules, and disclosure requirements to the public. Right now, \njust the opposite takes place. The administration skirts stakeholder \ninput by issuing interim final rules--called IFRs--and they become \neffective immediately upon publication. My bill allows delay of \nimplementation if that rule is challenged in court and until the court \nmakes a decision. All too often new regulations are proposed and \nfinalized while existing regulations are not being enforced.\n  I have heard from a lot of folks in Kansas that the problems these \nnew regulations claim to fix could be solved if the current regulations \nwere properly monitored. Simply put, the solution is not more rules and \nregulations; it is considering the existing ones.\n  My bill mandates an ongoing review of regulatory actions to identify \nthose outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, or excessively burdensome \nrules--or, as the President himself once put it, ``rules that are just \nplain dumb''--and allows agencies to streamline, expand, or repeal \nthose regulations.\n  We need regulatory reform. My bill codifies the President's Executive \norder while closing the loopholes and gives it the rule of law. I do \nnot know how the President could disagree with that.\n  The U.S. Chamber, the National Federation of Independent Business, \nthe Farm Bureau, and the Competitive Enterprise Institute have all \nendorsed my bill.\n  Last year I had 35 cosponsors. We have about thirteen. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation and stay engaged as this process \ncontinues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 169. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to disallow \nany deduction for punitive damages, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill close a tax loophole that allows companies to write off the \npunishment they receive for corporate wrongdoing. Under current law, a \ncorporation or individual business owner may deduct the cost of court-\nordered punitive damages paid to victims as an ``ordinary'' business \nexpense. For the victims of extreme corporate misconduct, there is \nnothing ordinary about this. It is simply wrong. This tax loophole \nallows corporations to wreak havoc and then write it off as a cost of \ndoing business. That undermines the whole point of punitive damages.\n  Punitive damage awards are designed to punish the wrongdoers and to \ncorrect dangerous or unfair practices. These awards are reserved for \nthe most extreme and harmful misconduct. Sadly, our country's history \nis replete with examples of serious corporate misconduct that resulted \nin injury and death to American citizens, but through our civil justice \nsystem and the thoughtful deliberations of our Nations' juries, this \nmisconduct is not only punishable by assessing punitive damages, it has \nled to broad changes to improve the safety and security of American \nconsumers. Unfortunately, our current tax laws shield the worst \ncorporate misconduct. The No Tax Write-Offs for Corporate Wrongdoers \nAct would change that by making a simple fix to our tax code.\n  In 2010, the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded and 11 Americans \nwere killed in the worst oil spill in American history. That same year, \nan explosion in the Upper Big Branch Mine in West Virginia claimed the \nlives of 29 miners. In 2009 and 2010, Toyota recalled more than 10 \nmillion vehicles because of a faulty acceleration system that has been \nlinked to at least 31 accidents and 12 deaths, and recently admitted to \nmisleading the public about these dangers. Let us also not forget \nExxon's misconduct in 1989, which led to an ecological and human \ndisaster that affects Alaskans even today. Vermonters and all Americans \ndeserve to have companies such as these held accountable for their \nactions. Why should hard-working taxpayers subsidize corporations who \ndeserve to be punished?\n  In 1994, a jury awarded $5 billion in punitive damages against Exxon \nfor its actions which caused the Valdez spill that devastated an entire \nregion, the livelihoods of its people, and destroyed a way of life. The \nrole of the jury is enshrined in our Constitution, and nothing is more \nfundamental to the American justice system than our trust in the \njudgment of those who serve on them. Rather than accept this reality, \nExxon paid its cadre of lawyers to fight the jury's measure of \naccountability all the way to the Supreme Court. In 2008, after 14 \nyears of appeals, an activist majority on the Court invented a novel \nrule and held that in maritime cases, punitive damage awards could not \nexceed twice the amount of compensatory damages, reducing Exxon's \npunitive damages to $500 million. Adding insult to injury to the \nvictims of the oil spill, Exxon was then able to use the federal tax \ncode to write-off the punitive damages as an ``ordinary'' business \nexpense. This is not how the system should work and it is long past \ntime for Congress to fix it.\n  I have previously supported legislation by Senator Whitehouse to \noverturn the Supreme Court's decision in Exxon, and I am disappointed \nthat not a single Republican joined this commonsense effort. If we \ncannot get bipartisan support to ensure corporations pay the highest \npossible price for actions that cause serious harm to health and public \nsafety, I hope we can at least agree that American taxpayers should not \nhave to subsidize their misconduct once a jury has determined they \nshould be punished.\n  The Obama administration requested eliminating this tax deduction in \nits 2014 budget proposal. The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated \nthat ending this deduction loophole will result in increased revenues \nof $355 million over 10 years. Members who have devoted so much of \ntheir focus to reducing the Federal deficit should support my \nlegislation. Anyone who cares about protecting consumers should agree \nthat extreme corporate misconduct should not be treated in our tax code \nsimply as a cost of doing business.\n  Right now, the new Republican majority in Congress is pushing \nlegislation to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline. Despite being billed \nas the safest pipeline in history, the existing Keystone pipeline has \nspilled 12 times in its first year of operation. This has a familiar \nring: Before the Valdez spill in Alaska, Exxon executives told us their \noil tankers were safe. I do not support Congress bypassing the \nenvironmental appeal process to fast-track further construction of the \nKeystone pipeline, which poses considerable safety and environmental \nrisks. But anyone who does want this pipeline should at a minimum \nconsider the communities and families who would be affected by its \nconstruction, and in the event of a spill, they should make sure \ntaxpayers are not subsidizing the damage. This speaks to our basic \nnotions of justice and fair play.\n  I hope all Senators will join me to end tax write-offs for corporate \nwrongdoers. When companies can write off a\n\n[[Page S205]]\n\nsignificant portion of the financial impact of punitive damages, the \nincentives in our justice system that promote responsible business \npractices lose their force. Corporate misconduct should no longer be \ntreated as a cost of doing business.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Kirk, \n        Mr. Hatch, Mr. Graham, Mr. Coons, Mr. Udall, Mr. Coats, Mr. \n        Crapo, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. Casey, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 178.
