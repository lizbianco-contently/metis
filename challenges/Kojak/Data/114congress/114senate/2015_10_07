Mr. President, before I speak on the legislation the \nSenate will consider this afternoon, I want to say a few words about S. \n1300, the Adoptive Family Relief Act. I spoke on this bill in July \nafter it passed the Senate with unanimous consent. Now I would like to \npraise the House of Representatives for passing this important piece of \nlegislation just yesterday.\n  The issue this bill addresses is of particular importance to me, and \nI am proud to be an original cosponsor of the legislation. More than \n400 American families, approximately 20 of them from Kentucky, have \nsuccessfully adopted children from the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo, or the DRC. However, due to the DRC Government's years-long \nsuspension of exit permits, many of these families have been unable to \nbring their adoptive children home to the United States.\n  To make matters worse, families have been financially burdened by the \ncost of continually renewing their children's visas while they wait for \nthe day the DRC decides to lift its suspension. In an attempt to help \nthese families, the Adoptive Family Relief Act would provide meaningful \nfinancial relief by granting the State Department authority to waive \nthe fees for multiple visa renewals in these and other extraordinary \nadoption circumstances.\n  This bill builds on Congress' bipartisan efforts on the adoption \nissue, including my amendment to this year's budget resolution to \nencourage a solution to the situation as well as numerous bipartisan \ncongressional letters sent to Congolese officials.\n  Later today I will have the opportunity to meet with the Brock family \nfrom Owensboro. I was grateful to assist in the return of their \nmedically fragile child from the DRC last Christmas. However, their \nother adopted son still remains in the country.\n  For this Kentucky family, and for many others still waiting, I again \nstrongly urge the Government of the DRC to resolve the matter \nexpeditiously and in a way that provides for the swift unification of \nfamilies. Until then, I want to praise the bipartisan action that led \nto the passage of the Adoptive Family Relief Act. I hope families see \nthis as a message that Congress is supporting them.\n  This bill will now go to the President for his signature. It is my \nhope it will bring needed assistance to so many loving families, like \nthe Brocks, who want nothing more than to open their homes to a child \nin need.\n  Allow me to also thank the sponsors of this bill, Senators Feinstein \nand Johnson and Representative Trent Franks, for all their hard work. \nThat thanks extends as well to the 78 other cosponsors in both Chambers \nand both parties, along with the Senate and House judiciary committees \nfor their hard work and truly bipartisan commitment to solving this \nheartbreaking issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/senate-section/article/S7173-7", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7173-S7175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on another matter before the Senate \nthis afternoon, I was glad to see the Senate come together yesterday to \nadvance the bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act. This \nbipartisan Defense bill will support our men and\n\n[[Page S7174]]\n\nwomen in uniform in many, many ways.\n  The bill attacks bureaucratic waste, authorizes pay raises, and \nimproves quality-of-life programs for our soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nand marines. It will strengthen sexual assault prevention and response. \nIt will help wounded warriors and heroes who struggle with mental \nhealth challenges. Most importantly, it will equip the men and women \nwho serve with what they need to defend our Nation.\n  The chairman of the Committee on Armed Services was unrelenting in \nhis work across the aisle to craft a serious defense bill with input \nfrom both parties. Senator McCain can and should take pride in \nyesterday's 73-to-26 vote to advance this bill. He should take heart in \ntoday's vote to send it to the President as well.\n  That is where this legislative process should end--with the \nPresident's signature, with a win for our forces, and with a win for \nour country at a time of seemingly incalculable global crises. But the \nWhite House has issued threats that the President might actually veto \nthis bipartisan bill for unrelated partisan reasons. That would be more \nthan outrageous--truly outrageous, Mr. President. It would be yet \nanother grave foreign policy miscalculation from this administration, \nsomething our country can no longer afford.\n  Just a year ago, the President announced a strategy to degrade and \ndestroy ISIL. Today, the threat remains as versatile and resilient as \never. ISIL has consolidated its gains within Iraq and within Syria. \nRussia is now deploying troops and attacking the moderate opposition \nforces in Syria. Iran is reportedly sending additional forces to the \nbattlefield. Civilians are dying and refugees are fleeing.\n  John Kerry calls the situation ``a catastrophe, a human catastrophe \nreally unparalleled in modern times.'' He is right.\n  According to news reports, this is all forcing the President to \nreconsider his strategy in that region and craft a new one. Regardless \nof what he decides, it is going to be a protracted area of struggle. It \nhas been profoundly challenging already. That is to say nothing of the \ncountless other mounting global threats, from Chinese expansion in the \nsouth China Sea to Taliban resurgence in Afghanistan.\n  Many Americans would say this is the worst possible time for an \nAmerican President to be threatening to veto their national defense \nbill, and especially to do so for arbitrary partisan reasons. I wish I \ncould say it surprises me that President Obama might, for the sake of \nunrelated partisan games, actually contemplate vetoing a bipartisan \ndefense bill that contains the level of funding authorization that he \nactually asked for. Let me say that again. This bill contains the \nfunding authorization the President asked for. So I am calling on him \nnot to, especially in times like these, but if he does, it will be the \nlatest sorry chapter in a failed foreign policy based on campaign \npromises rather than realistically meeting the threat before us.\n  The President's approach to foreign policy has been nothing if not \nconsistent over the past 7 years. I have described this in detail many \ntimes before. From repeatedly seeking to declare some arbitrary end to \nthe war on terror, to discarding the tools we have to wage it, to \nplacing unhealthy levels of trust in unaccountable international \norganizations, the President's foreign policy has been as predictable \nas it has been ineffectual.\n  Take, for instance, his heavy reliance on economy-of-force train-and-\nassist missions. This has been the primary tool of the President to \ncover our drawdown of conventional forces. The train-and-equip concept \nis to train indigenous forces to battle insurgencies in places such as \nYemen, Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. These forces ideally partner with \nU.S. capabilities, but under the President's policy, they have been \nleft to fight alone as we continue to draw down our conventional \nforces.\n  The essence of this was captured in a speech he delivered at West \nPoint just last May. In that speech the President described a network \nof partnerships from South Asia to Sahel to be funded by $5 billion in \ncounterterrorism funds. By deploying Special Operations Forces for \ntrain-and-equip missions, the President hoped to manage the diffuse \nthreats posed by terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda in the Arabian \nPeninsula, Boko Haram, the al-Nusrah Front, the Taliban, Libyan \nterrorist networks that threaten Egypt, and, of course, ISIL.\n  The President never explained the strategy--beyond direct action such \nas unmanned vehicle aerial strikes--for those cases when indigenous \nforces proved insufficient, as we have seen in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. \nNevertheless, this concept of operations suited the President because \nit allowed him to continue with force structure cuts to our \nconventional operational units. It allowed him to continue refusing to \naccept that leaving behind residual forces in places such as Iraq and \nAfghanistan might represent a means by which this Nation could preserve \nthe strategic gains made through sacrifice. It also allowed him to \ncontinue refusing to rebuild our conventional and nuclear forces.\n  This was never, never an approach designed for success. Today it is \nclear this is now an approach that has also reached its limits.\n  The New York Times is hardly an adversary of this administration, but \nit recently ran a story titled ``Billions From U.S. Fail to Sustain \nForeign Forces.'' Once again, this is the New York Times. Here is what \nit said:\n\n       With alarming frequency in recent years, thousands of \n     American-trained security forces in the Middle East, North \n     Africa, and South Asia have collapsed, stalled or defected, \n     calling into question the effectiveness of the tens of \n     billions of dollars spent by the U.S. on foreign military \n     training programs, as well as a central tenet of the Obama \n     administration's approach to combating insurgencies.\n\n  Without rebuilding the force, we cannot deter China's efforts to \nextend its conventional reach in the South China Sea. Without \nrebuilding the force, we cannot deter Russian adventurism in places \nsuch as Crimea. Without rebuilding and deploying the force, we cannot \nhope to deter Russia's gambit to increase its Middle East presence or \nits air campaign in Syria. And under this strategy, when the host \nnation militaries we trained and equipped proved inadequate to defeat \nthe insurgency in question, the strategy allowed for a persistent, \nenduring terrorist threat in those countries. That is just what we have \nseen with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, with the Taliban, and now \nwith ISIL.\n\n  I thought the growth, advance, and evolution of ISIL last year would \nhave presented a turning point for the President. I thought the fall of \nAnbar Province and the threat posed to allies such as Jordan, Saudi \nArabia, and Turkey would have provoked a reconsideration of his entire \nnational security policy, but it didn't. If the latest stories of White \nHouse efforts to revise its ISIL strategy are to be believed, then \nperhaps the President now finally realizes the threat from terrorist \ngroups like ISIL and Al Qaeda have outpaced his economy-of-force \nconcept. He may even be accepting the reality that withdrawing \narbitrarily from Afghanistan is neither consequence-free nor is it a \ngood idea.\n  One year after the President's ISIL speech, it is time to reverse the \nwithdrawal of our military from its forward presence. It is time to lay \nthe groundwork for the next President to rebuild America's credibility \nwith friend and foe alike. That is true of ISIL and it is true of \ndissatisfied powers such as Russia, China, and Iran, who are all \nlooking to exploit American withdrawal in pursuit of regional hegemony \nand dreams of empire.\n  To paraphrase the President: Russia is calling, and it wants its \nempire back. Russia wants its empire back. China is calling, too, and \nso is Iran. They have watched as both our economy-of-force efforts to \nmask American withdrawal and as other U.S. commitments have proven \nquite hollow--like the announcement of a strategic pivot to Asia, \nwithout the investments to make it meaningful. The next President, \nregardless of party, will need to craft plans, policies, and programs \nto balance against expansion. Signing the bipartisan National Defense \nAuthorization Act we pass today--and of course matching the \nauthorization with its corresponding funding--would represent a good \nfirst step along that path. If the President is serious in his just-\nrestated commitment to taking all steps necessary to combat ISIL,\n\n[[Page S7175]]\n\nthen he will know that signing this bipartisan National Defense \nAuthorization Act is anything but the waste of time some of his allies \nmight pretend it to be. In fact, this bill is essential.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/senate-section/article/S7175-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the bill before the Senate this afternoon, \nin spite of all the statements of my friend the Republican leader, is \nanother piece of political theater. Everyone knows the President is \ngoing to veto this. Everyone knows this. The House, if they are called \nupon first to sustain the veto, will do it. If we are called upon first \nto sustain the veto, we will do it.\n  Republicans are trying to paint Democrats as being soft on defense. \nBased on what we have heard from my friend today, I don't know where he \ndoesn't want American troops--China, Iran, Russia, all over the Middle \nEast. It is stunning to listen to what he has said. We have spent a lot \nof money training foreign troops. I was in Iraq. Who was training the \ntroops then? General Petraeus. I don't know what my friend wants, but I \ndo tell everyone the gimmick we have in this bill today; that is, \nhaving this funny money funding and that is what it is--I can't imagine \nmy Republican friends who have in the past been so supportive of not \ndoing things that deal with funny money, that their--Senator McCain, \nthe chairman of the committee, has acknowledged that sequestration will \ndestroy the military--that is my word--but will badly damage the \nmilitary. He has said that many times.\n  So we have a lot of problems here, but the gimmick my friend is so \ntouting today does nothing to support the security we need at home: The \nFBI, homeland security, border protection. I say to my friend, the \nPresiding Officer, today: You voted the way I thought Republicans \nshould vote when this matter came before the body yesterday.\n  It has been a week since it happened, but the American people are \nstill reeling from House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's admission \nthat the so-called Benghazi Select Committee is nothing more than a \npolitical hit job on Hillary Clinton. That is what he said. Speaking \nabout this committee, he told FOX News:\n\n       Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? \n     But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select \n     committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are \n     dropping.\n\n  It doesn't take much to figure out the point he was making; that this \nwas nothing more than a hit job on Hillary Clinton. According to Mr. \nMcCarthy, the so-called Benghazi Select Committee was orchestrated with \none goal in mind--to weaken Hillary Clinton's Presidential campaign. Of \ncourse that is shameful. House Republicans have used the tragic deaths \nof four Americans as political fodder to win an election. Don't the \nvictims deserve better? Don't their families deserve not to have their \ndeceased loved ones pulled into a political inquisition?\n  Even more shocking, this political farce continues now. House \nRepublicans are showing no signs of bringing this charade to an end. \nConsider the facts. These are a number of the select committees that \nhave been going on that we have had in the Congress in recent years: \nHurricane Katrina, Pearl Harbor, Warren Commission, Iran-Contra, \nWatergate, and the Benghazi Committee. This big red line sitting here \nshows this committee has spent far more time than any committee except \nWatergate. Look at that. It is hard to believe. For 16 months now we \nhave used the tragic deaths in a way that is not what we should be \ndoing. They have spent almost $5 million of taxpayer money on this so-\ncalled select committee, and the number continues to climb as I speak. \nNot only do they have a select committee, they have had six other \ncommittees that have held hearings on this. What a waste of taxpayer \ndollars. The select committee has investigated Hillary Clinton for 17 \nmonths, 517 days--longer than the investigations that I mentioned: \nPearl Harbor, the Kennedy assassination, and even, timewise, \nWatergate--close but still more time than on Watergate, and it is still \ngoing on. What have they accomplished? What have they achieved after \nall that time and money has been spent? What have they accomplished for \nthe American people? Nothing. And they have held three hearings in 17 \nmonths. Not one American is safer today because of the select \ncommittee, not one terrorist attack has been thwarted because of the \ncommittee's work, and Republicans are fine with that. They hail the \nBenghazi committee as a success because it was never the panel's \nintention to get to the truth. This committee's only real objective was \nto hurt Hillary Clinton--exactly as Congressman McCarthy said. The \nevidence makes that clear. In 17 months, the committee has interviewed \nor deposed eight Clinton campaign staffers. They are obsessed with \nHillary Clinton and her campaign status. Yet, stunningly, Chairman \nGowdy and Republicans have little interest in questioning intelligence \nand defense experts. They have held only one hearing with an expert \nfrom the intelligence community. They have never held a single hearing \nwith anyone from the Department of Defense. The Republican chairman and \nhis colleagues have abandoned their plans to interview Defense \nofficials and instead have gone after Secretary Clinton and her staff. \nThe evidence is clear. The Benghazi Select Committee is a sham. \nDemocrats have known this for 2 years, but now we have the man who is \ngoing to be--I understand after tomorrow at noon--running the House of \nRepresentatives come November 1. He has acknowledged it is a witch \nhunt. That is why the Democratic leadership of the Senate wrote to \nSpeaker Boehner asking him to disband the select committee. That is why \nI will not stop reminding Republicans of Congressman McCarthy's \nadmission.\n  If it were up to me, the House Democrats on that panel would nail \nthis quote on the committee room doors as a reminder to everyone that \nRepublicans have manipulated a true American tragedy and turned it into \na political circus:\n\n       Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? \n     But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select \n     committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are \n     dropping.\n\n  He is so proud of himself. Until House Republicans do the right thing \nand disband this committee, I will continue to tell the American people \nabout the disgrace that is the House Republicans' Benghazi committee.\n  Mr. President, would the Chair announce what we are going to be doing \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/senate-section/article/S7175-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 2 months ago I came to the Senate floor in \nmy capacity as President pro tempore to speak to my colleagues about \nthe importance of maintaining decorum and respect in this body. I \nreminded them that decorum is essential to the proper functioning of \nthe Senate and to its unique role in our constitutional structure. The \nFramers designed the Senate to be an institution of deliberation and \nreason, where Members would work to promote consensus and the common \ngood rather than their own narrow, partisan interests. Today I rise \nonce\n\n[[Page S7176]]\n\nmore in my capacity as President pro tempore, this time to discuss \nanother defining feature of this body--the right to extended debate.\n  The Framers designed the Senate to serve as a necessary fence against \nthe fickleness and passion that drives hasty lawmaking--what Edmund \nRandolph called the turbulence and follies of democracy. James Madison \nin turn described the Senate as a bulwark against what he called the \ntransient impressions into which the people may from time to time be \nled. Senators were to refine the popular will to wisdom and sound \njudgment, reaching measured conclusions about how best to address the \nNation's challenges. It is no accident that passing bills through this \nbody takes time. The Framers intended the Senate to be the cooler, more \ndeliberate, more reasoned branch. As Madison once said, the Senate was \nto ``consist in its proceedings with more coolness, with more system, \nand with more wisdom than the [House of Representatives].''\n  Key to the Senate's deliberative nature is its relatively small size, \nwhich enables a much more thoroughgoing debate and greater opportunity \nfor individual Members to improve legislative proposals. Longer, \nstaggered terms also give Members flexibility to resist initially \npopular yet ultimately unwise legislation, and statewide constituencies \nrequire Senators to appeal to a broader set of interests than do \nnarrow, more homogenous House districts. To these constitutional \ncharacteristics, the Senate has added a number of traditions--some \nformal, others informal--that have enhanced its deliberative character. \nForemost among these traditions is the right to extend debate--what we \ntoday call the filibuster.\n  For many years--indeed, for the first 130 years of this body's \nexistence--there was no formal way to cut off debate. Senators could, \nin theory, speak as long as they wanted, on whatever subject they \nwanted. In 1917, the Senate adopted the first cloture rule, which \nrequired a two-thirds vote to end debate. Filibusters remained rare, \nalthough they were used from time to time to delay legislation. In \n1975, under the leadership of Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, the \nSenate lowered the cloture threshold from two-thirds to three-fifths, \nwhere it has remained ever since, with the notable exception of Senate \nDemocrats' unilateral decision last Congress to lower the cloture \nthreshold for most nominations to a simple majority vote. The cloture \nthreshold for legislative filibusters remains three-fifths.\n  Now, one may wonder why a device that allows a minority of Senators \nto delay or block legislation is a good thing. My friends and \ncolleagues, the junior Senator from Oregon and the senior Senator from \nNew Mexico spoke on the Senate floor last week about the importance of \nmajority rule and the need to allow legislation to proceed. I do not \ndeny that obstructionism can be a serious problem. Obstinately refusing \nto allow any legislation to move forward or requiring complete \ncapitulation by opponents is not statesmanship, and it is not what the \nFramers had in mind. But when exercised properly, the right to extended \ndebate can measurably improve policy.\n\n  The filibuster furthers two of the Senate's key purposes. First, it \nhelps to guard against intemperate impulses that may from time to time \ninfect our political order. Second, it facilitates the process of \nrefining the popular will.\n  The way in which the filibuster guards against intemperate impulses \nis obvious. By requiring a supermajority to pass major legislation, the \nfilibuster ensures that a narrow partisan majority swept into office \nthrough a fluke election does not go about unravelling vast swaths of \nAmerica's legal architecture. The filibuster also ensures that the same \nnarrow majority does not run riot with new, pie-in-the-sky ideas that \ncost billions of dollars while producing little discernible benefit.\n  I would point my colleagues to two major, extremely controversial \nmeasures that passed the House in 2009 but went nowhere in the Senate: \nthe cap-and-trade energy tax and the so-called public option for health \ninsurance. Speaker Pelosi was barely able to ram through cap and trade \nby a vote of 219 to 212. The public option passed by an even slimmer \nmargin of 220 to 215. These two pieces of legislation received little \nconsideration in this body because there were nowhere near enough votes \nfor cloture. Absent the filibuster, however, it is likely both would \nhave passed the Senate and become law. Had that occurred, a temporary \nelectoral victory would have wrought fundamental changes to American \nenergy policy and put our Nation even more firmly on the path to \ngovernment-run health care.\n  Many on the left may point to the failure of cap and trade and of the \npublic option in 2009 as reasons to eliminate, not preserve, the \nfilibuster. After all, it prevented progressives from achieving two of \ntheir most sought-after policy goals. But consider what happened a mere \n2 years later, in the very next election: Voters delivered President \nObama and the Democratic Party a sharp rebuke, voting out of office the \nhighest number of Democratic officeholders in generations. Voters \ndisapproved of the Democrats' policymaking, and registered their \ndisapproval at the polls. Note, too, that the Democrats lost their \nmajority in the House--the body that passed cap and trade and the \npublic option--but retained their majority in the Senate--the body that \nnever even took up either proposal.\n  The filibuster prevented a transient Democratic majority from \nenacting far-reaching reforms that a majority of voters ultimately \nopposed. It didn't prevent all reforms. After all, the Democratic \nmajority still managed to enact many of its policy priorities. But the \nfilibuster prevented other extreme measures from becoming law and \nstopped a short-lived congressional majority from running roughshod \nover longstanding principles of federalism, free enterprise, and \nlimited government.\n  To my friends from Oregon and New Mexico and to others who argue that \nthe filibuster is anti-democratic, I would say that it is in fact the \nopposite. The filibuster ensures that fundamental change comes only \nthrough sustained victories at the ballot box. It typically takes two \nor three successive victories at the polls to build a filibuster-proof \nmajority. This multiyear window gives the public time to evaluate the \nmajority's platform and to determine whether it is in fact the better \ncourse of action.\n  If by democracy one means to win at all costs, perhaps one could say \nthe filibuster is anti-democratic. But if democracy, as I believe, \ninstead means the system for transforming the people's preferences into \nlaw, then the filibuster is not anti-democratic at all. Rather, it \npreserves the people's preferences until they decide emphatically, and \nwith the benefit of review, that it is time for significant change.\n  I have also said that the filibuster facilitates the process of \nrefining the popular will. It does this in two ways. First, it gives \nopponents of a particular piece of legislation additional time to \nexplain why the legislation is misguided or how it could be improved. \nIt also gives proponents of the legislation additional time to explain \nwhy the objections are unfounded. This helps to increase understanding \non both sides and also offers opportunities to correct problems with \nparticular provisions.\n  Second, by requiring 60 votes in order to proceed on controversial \nissues, the filibuster ensures increased buy-in. The process of \nrefining the public will works only if Senators actually pay attention \nto legislation and devote their resources to examining it. By requiring \n60 Senators to assent to legislation rather than a bare majority, the \nfilibuster ensures that no bill passes this body without first \ngarnering broad support. The process of getting to 60 requires more \nscrutiny, more investigation, and more consensus than the process of \ngetting to a bare majority. It also decreases the likelihood of deeply \nflawed legislation making it to the President's desk because more \nSenators have to agree that the legislation warrants passage.\n  To the extent there are problems with the filibuster, they are not \nproblems with the filibuster itself but with how it has sometimes been \nused in recent years, as a matter of fact. In April of this year, I \nspoke on the floor about the need for mutual restraint in the Senate, \nabout the need for both sides to exercise discretion in wielding the \npowers of the majority and the minority. Yes, the filibuster can be a \ntool for improving legislation and winning important promises from the \nExecutive,\n\n[[Page S7177]]\n\nbut it can also be abused for narrow partisan ends. It can be used to \nbring business to a halt for irrelevant or unimportant purposes or \nmerely to make a point. It can be used to win an unsavory favor for a \nparticular individual or constituency, and it can be used to create \nfalse narratives about the majority's ability to govern.\n  From time to time we hear calls--including by Members of this body--\nto strip the minority of certain rights. Lately, there have been calls \nby some in the media, on the campaign trail, and on the other side of \nthe Capitol to eliminate the filibuster. Though these calls to abolish \nthe filibuster may be instinctively appealing, we should reject them. \nWithout the filibuster and other important minority rights, the Senate \nwould lose its unique character. It would become less a body marked by \ndeliberation and reasoned debate and more a body where the majority \ngets whatever it wants. Indeed, stripped of minority rights, the Senate \nwould merely duplicate the work of the House of Representatives. That \nmay be advantageous for the current Senate majority, but it would not \nfulfill the constitutional design in creating a second House of \nCongress where the popular will would be refined through prudent \njudgment.\n  Those who call on the Senate to abolish the filibuster should keep in \nmind that this is not the first Congress to face institutional \nchallenges. Indeed, I would urge my colleagues to recall the example of \nMike Mansfield, the late Senator from Montana, whom I referenced \nearlier. Senator Mansfield served as Senate majority leader from 1961 \nto 1977, longer than any other Senator in history. During Senator \nMansfield's time as majority leader, the Nation confronted a number of \ndifficult, divisive issues. Chief among these were debates over school \nintegration and civil rights, which deeply split the Democratic caucus. \nNear the beginning of his tenure, when a determined minority stalled \nPresident Kennedy's legislative priorities, Senator Mansfield faced \ngreat pressure from within his own party to exert the majority's power \nmore assertively. In an act of great courage, Senator Mansfield \nresisted the calls of his colleagues to bend Senate rules. Though \ntempted by the prospect of important political victories, he instead \ncounselled that the remedy to gridlock ``lies not in the seeking of \nshortcuts, not in the cracking of nonexistent whips, not in wheeling \nand dealing, but in an honest facing of the situation and a resolution \nof it by the Senate itself, by accommodation, by respect for one \nanother, [and] by mutual restraint.''\n  Senator Mansfield was absolutely right. For the Senate to function \neffectively, Senators of all stripes must practice mutual restraint--\nRepublican and Democrat, conservative and liberal, majority and \nminority alike.\n  The solution to our current strife is not to change the rules but to \nfollow them and to wield them only as necessary to improve legislation. \nCooperation, not going nuclear, is what will restore this body to \nproper functioning. Going nuclear will only hollow out this institution \nand infect more of what we do with puerile partisan poison.\n  I wish to close by quoting two great statesmen who loved the Senate \nand who truly understood its unique role in our constitutional system. \nThe first quote is from the first Adlai Stevenson, who served as Vice \nPresident from 1893 to 1897. In his farewell address to the Senate, \nVice President Stevenson said the following:\n\n       In this Chamber alone are preserved without restraint two \n     essentials of wise legislation and good government: the right \n     of amendment and of debate. Great evils often result from \n     hasty legislation; [but] rarely from the delay which follows \n     full discussion and deliberation.\n\n  Vice President Stevenson understood that deliberation and reasoned \ndebate lead to better policy outcomes than the headlong rush to action. \nDelay rarely causes great evils. More commonly, it helps to avoid them.\n  The second quote comes from a man familiar to all of us, the late \nSenator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. Senator Byrd, who served in \nthis body longer than any other Senator in history and who spent the \nvast majority of his 51 years in the Senate in the majority, said this \nabout the filibuster and minority rights: ``[A]s long as the Senate \nretains the power to amend and the power of unlimited debate, the \nliberties of the people will remain secure.''\n  Senator Byrd recognized that the Senate's cooling function serves as \na crucial check on transient majority impulses and on the often \nmisguided desire to act quickly and to act at all costs.\n  The filibuster is a key bulwark against error and against the ability \nof short-lived political majorities to work fundamental changes to our \nNation. Although it can be deeply frustrating--particularly when \nmisused and overused by an intransigent partisan Senate minority--the \nfilibuster is an important element of the Senate's character and \ninstitutional structure. I urge my colleagues to resist calls to \nabolish the filibuster. Whatever we might win in the way of short-term \npolitical gain would be overwhelmed by the enduring, irreparable damage \nwe would do to the Senate as an institution.\n  I knew Mike Mansfield. I visited with him in Tokyo when he was the \nAmbassador to Japan. He was a great leader. He was a great human being.\n  I also knew very well Senator Robert C. Byrd. There were times when I \nled the fight against labor law reform in 1977, 1978, where I was hard-\npressed to like Senator Byrd because he used every tool at his \ndisposal--procedural and otherwise--to try to put that bill forward, \nwhich would have changed the whole character of America for the worse.\n  I was young. I didn't realize how important that man really was. But \nas I continued to serve in the Senate and saw his devotion to the \nSenate, his devotion to the Senate rules, his fairness when he dealt \nwith both sides, I got to really respect his understanding of the \nprocedural votes.\n  I venture to say I don't know that anybody has ever had that full \ncapacity as much as he did, with the possible exception of Senator \nAllen of Alabama, who I greatly admired also. He stood right over there \non that side of the floor and took on his own party time after time. \nThe filibuster was a very important instrument at that time, especially \nsince Mr. Byrd was a very strong personality. The longer I served in \nthe Senate, the more I appreciated Senator Byrd and his devotion to the \nrules, the Constitution, and the Senate itself. He cared for the \nSenate.\n\n  I can remember him sitting right here in this chair. I went up to him \nand I said: Bob, I love you. This was right before he died. He looked \nlike he was going to cry, and he said: Orrin, I love you too. That \nmeant so much to me because in the early days we were principal \nadversaries. He had more power than I could dream of.\n  We ended up winning on labor law reform through a miraculous sixth \ncloture vote. It was a great loss to Senator Byrd. He was not \nparticularly enamored with me for the first number of years. But as we \nserved together, fought together, and worked together, I gained \ntremendous experience from him and from his ability. I gained a great \nappreciation for Senator Byrd and his abilities and his dedication to \nthe rules of the Senate and his dedication to not changing them and \nkeeping those rules alive, and those rules have existed for almost a \ncentury.\n  Nobody I know of felt more sad when he had to leave the Senate than I \ndid. Keep in mind, that was after a lot of blood and guts fighting here \non the floor where I, as a young freshman Senator, had to take it on \nthe chin regularly because he knew the rules better than I did and he \nhad power that was much stronger than anybody on this side of the \naisle. He had a very forceful presence.\n  I will just say this: He believed in the rules, and he lived by the \nrules. Even when he lost, he was a gentleman. I think that man did more \nfor the Senate in many ways than very few other Senators did.\n  Let's not get so rambunctious about passing anything we want to pass \naround here. Let's think these rules through. The more you think, the \nmore you realize these rules are here for a reason, and they have been \nhere a long time for a reason and have functioned amazingly well and \nstopped the majority from running over the minority.\n  Every once in a while, the Democrats are in the minority, although \nnot very often. Over the last number of years, they had the majority \naround 22 times and we had it maybe 6 times. I can say\n\n[[Page S7178]]\n\nthis: There are Democrats on the other side who really know these rules \nare very important, and I hope they prevail as we move on to even more \ndifficult problems and processes in the future and in the time to come. \nThis is a great body. It remains great in large measure because of its \nrules and because of the people who serve here. We should all respect \nthe rules, and we should all respect each other for the privilege of \nserving in the U.S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                  Cuba\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today, as I have in the past, in \ndefense of the Cuban people, who long for the day when they are free of \nthe iron fist of the Castro regime, a day when we can honestly say \n``Cuba es libre'' and mean it. I rise with great concern over the \ntrajectory of the policy towards Cuba that President Obama announced on \nDecember 17 of last year.\n  In executing this new policy, the Obama administration has spared no \ngenerosity towards the dictatorship in Cuba. It commuted the sentences \nof three convicted Cuban spies, including one serving a life sentence \nfor murder conspiracy against Americans who died while flying a \ncivilian aircraft in international airspace that was struck down by \nCuban MIGs. It eased a host of travel and trade sanctions in spite of \nthe purpose and intent of U.S. law. It removed Cuba from the state \nsponsors of terrorism list, while it continues harboring fugitives from \nthe U.S. justice system and members of foreign terrorist organizations.\n  Among those people who are in Cuba is Joanne Chesimard, who killed a \nNew Jersey State trooper. She was convicted of doing so, escaped, and \nis on the FBI's top 10 most wanted terrorist list. Yet we took them off \nthe list of state sponsors of terrorism.\n  It negotiated an agreement to establish diplomatic relations with \nCuba that falls far short of international legal norms in terms of what \nthe people at our Embassy can and cannot do inside of Cuba. It upgraded \nCuba in the trafficking in persons report, despite its continued slave \nlabor and human trafficking practices. It even acquiesced to shunning \ndissidents from attending the U.S. Embassy's flag-raising ceremony in \nHavana.\n  Yet Cuban dictator Raul Castro refuses to reciprocate any of these \nconcessions. To the contrary, Castro has emphasized that he ``will not \ncede 1 millimeter.'' In his speech at last month's United Nations \nGeneral Assembly gathering, he demanded even more, namely for President \nObama to evade U.S. law as regards sanctions, to shut down Radio and TV \nMarti, which is, in essence, the equivalent of our Voice of Democracy \nso that the Cuban people can get free and unfettered information, to \nend democracy programs, to return the military base at Guantanamo, and \nto pay $1 trillion--not $1 million, not $1 billion, $1 trillion--in \ndamages to his regime.\n  So today, 10 months later, the metrics of this new policy show it is \nclearly headed in the wrong direction. The Castro family is poised for \na generational transition in power. The Cuban regime's monopolies are \nbeing strengthened. Courageous democracy leaders are being relegated to \nobscurity, their voices muffled by the actions of the United States and \nforeign nations alike.\n  Political repression has exponentially increased. The number of \nCubans desperately fleeing the island is rising, and the purpose and \nintent of U.S. law is being circumvented. The trajectory of our policy \nis unacceptable, and I urge President Obama to correct its course.\n  While speaking recently to a business gathering in Washington, \nPresident Obama argued how he believes this new policy is ``creating \nthe environment in which a generational change in transition will take \nplace in that country.'' But the key question is this: a generational \nchange in transition towards what and by whom?\n  Cuban democracy leader Antonio Rodiles has concisely expressed his \nconcern. He said: ``Legitimizing the [Castro] regime is the path \ncontrary to a transition.'' CNN revealed that the Cuban delegation in \nthe secret talks that began in mid-2013 with U.S. officials in Ottawa, \nToronto, and Rome, and which led to the December 17 policy \nannouncement, was headed by Colonel Alejandro Castro Espin. Colonel \nCastro Espin is the 49-year-old son of Cuban dictator Raul Castro. In \nboth face-to-face meetings between President Obama and Raul Castro this \nyear, the first at April's Summit of the Americas in Panama City, a \nsummit that is supposed to be a meeting of democracies within the \nWestern Hemisphere--Cuba in no way can qualify under those set of \ncircumstances--and just last month at the United Nations General \nAssembly in New York, Alejandro was seated next to his father with a \nwide grin.\n  Now, Alejandro holds the rank--this is him standing next to Raul \nCastro--of colonel in Cuba's Ministry of the Interior. Now, Cuba's \nMinistry of the Interior is, in essence, the state security that \noppresses its people, with its hand on the pulse and the trigger of the \nisland's intelligence services and repressive organs. It is no secret \nthat Raul is grooming Alejandro for a position of power.\n  Sadly, his role as interlocutor with the Obama administration seeks \nto further their goal of an intrafamily generational transition within \nthe Castro clan, similar to the Assads in Syria and the Kims in Korea. \nWe know how well those have worked out. To give you an idea of how \nColonel Alejandro Castro views the United States, he describes its \nleaders as ``those who seek to subjugate humanity to satisfy their \ninterests and hegemonic goals.''\n  But, of course, it also takes money to run a totalitarian \ndictatorship, which is why Raul Castro named his son-in-law, General \nLuis Alberto Rodriguez Lopez-Callejas, as head of GAESA, which stands \nfor Grupo de Administracion Empresarial, S.A., or, translated, the \nBusiness Administrative Group.\n  GAESA is the holding company of Cuba's Ministry of the Revolutionary \nArmed Forces, Cuba's military. It is the dominant, driving force of the \nisland's economy. Established in the 1990s by Raul Castro, it controls \ntourism companies, ranging from the very profitable Gaviota, S.A., \nwhich runs Cuba's hotels, restaurants, car rentals, and night clubs, to \nTRD Caribe, S.A., which runs the island's retail stores. GAESA, this \nholding company of Cuba's Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, \ncontrols virtually all economic transactions in Cuba.\n  According to Hotels Magazine, a leading industry publication, GAESA, \nthrough its subsidiaries, is by far the largest regional hotel \nconglomerate in Latin America. It controls more hotel rooms than Walt \nDisney Company. As McClatchy News explained a few years back, \n``Tourists who sleep in some of Cuba's hotels, drive rental cars, fill \nup their gas tanks, and even those riding in taxis have something in \ncommon: They are contributing to the [Cuban] Revolutionary Armed \nForces' bottom line.''\n  Now, GAESA became this business powerhouse thanks to the millions of \nCanadian and European tourists who have and continue to visit Cuba each \nyear. But these tourists--going over a decade and a half, maybe two--\nhave done absolutely nothing to promote freedom and democracy in Cuba. \nTo the contrary, they have directly financed a system of control and \nrepression over the Cuban people, all while enjoying cigars made by \nCuban workers paid in worthless pesos and having a Cuba Libre, which is \nan oxymoron, on the beaches of Varadero.\n  Yet, despite the clear evidence, some want American tourists to now \ndouble GAESA's bonanza--and, through GAESA, double the regime's \nbonanza. An insightful report this week by Bloomberg Business also \nexplained how:\n\n       [Raul's son-in-law, General Rodriguez] is the gatekeeper \n     for most foreign investors, requiring them to do business \n     with his organization if they wish to set up shop on the \n     island. . . . If and when the U.S. finally removes its half-\n     century embargo on Cuba, it will be this man--\n\n  Castro's son-in-law--\n\n     who decides which investors get the best deals.\n\n\n[[Page S7179]]\n\n\n  Of course, it is those investors in the company that ultimately is \nthe Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces, Cuba's military. In other words, \nall the talking points about how lifting the embargo and tourism \nrestrictions would somehow benefit the Cuban people are empty and \nmisleading rhetoric. It would only serve as a money funnel for Castro, \nInc.\n  Now, here is what over a dozen of Cuba's most renowned prodemocracy \nleaders, including the head of the Ladies in White--the Ladies in White \nare a group of women, composed of mothers, wives, daughters, and other \nrelatives of Cuban political prisoners. These are political prisoners \nwho basically have languished in Castro's jail, not because they did \nanything violent, not because they broke the common law, as we would \nunderstand it here in the United States, but because they sought to \ncreate peaceful change.\n  They march every Sunday, dressed in white, holding a gladiola, \npeacefully to church. They are beaten savagely and arrested. And yet \nthey do this every Sunday.\n\n  Berta Soler, shown in the middle, former prisoner of conscience Jorge \nLuis Garcia Perez ``Antunez,'' and Sakharov prize recipient Guillermo \nFarinas, who are all pictured here, warned in an open letter to the \nU.S. Congress, dated September 25, 2015:\n\n       The lifting of the embargo, as proposed by the [Obama] \n     Administration, will permit the old ruling elite to transfer \n     their power to their political heirs and families, giving \n     little recourse to the Cuban people in confronting this \n     despotic power. . . .\n       Totalitarianism communism will mutate into a totalitarian \n     state adopting minimal market reforms that will serve only to \n     accentuate the existing social inequality in the midst of an \n     increasingly uncertain future.\n\n  These are the people inside of Cuba languishing as they try to create \nchange in their country toward peaceful moves toward democracy.\n  It is very interesting, as you can see, that despite the talk about \nthe Cuban regime creating greater equality, these pro-democracy movers \nin this picture who wrote this letter to Congress are all Afro-Cubans. \nSo much for the equality that the regime created and this mysticism or \nromanticism that some have about the regime.\n  From an economic perspective, the very concept of trade and \ninvestment in Cuba is grounded in a misconception about how business \ntakes place on the island. Right now, the Commerce Secretary of the \nUnited States is there talking about business. With whom are you \ntalking business? With the regime.\n  In most of the world, trade and investment means dealing with \nprivately owned or operated corporations. That is not the case in Cuba. \nIn Cuba, foreign trade and investment is the exclusive domain of the \nstate; for instance, the Castro family. There are no exceptions.\n  In the last five decades, every single foreign trade transaction with \nCuba has been with the Castro regime or an individual acting on behalf \nof the regime. The regime's exclusivity regarding trade and investment \nis enshrined in article 18 of Castro's 1976 Constitution. He changed \nthe Constitution and gave exclusivity to the state as it relates to \ntrade and investment. That has not changed.\n  Moreover, there is no real private sector in Cuba. We often hear the \nObama administration and the media refer to Cuba's small ``self-\nemployment'' licenses as private enterprise, which implies private \nownership. Yet Cuba's self-employed licensees have no ownership rights \nwhatsoever--be it to their artistic or intellectual outputs, commodity \nthat they produce or personal service that they offer.\n  Licensees have no legal entity to transfer, sell or leverage. They \ndon't even own the equipment essential to their self-employment. More \nto the point, licensees have no right to engage in foreign trade, seek \nor receive foreign investments.\n  Effectually, licensees continue to work for the state. When the state \ndecides such jobs are no longer needed--and we have seen this \nexperiment before--licensees are shut down without recourse, which has \nhappened several times in the past. Why? Because when you permit \nsomebody to have a little barbershop and people congregate at the \nbarbershop and begin to talk, that is a threat to the regime. When you \npermit people to assemble legally under the law, even if it is for the \npurposes of getting, for example, a haircut or eating at a restaurant--\nalthough that is normally for foreigners, not for locals--the bottom \nline is that when that gets out of hand, the regime, as it has in the \npast, will stop it. So this suggestion that there is this private \nenterprise is such a huge false fact.\n  The fact is, we already know what expanded U.S. trade with Cuba would \nlook like. Since the passage of the 2000 Trade Sanctions Reform and \nExport Enhancement Act, over $5 billion in U.S. agricultural and \nmedical products have been sold to Cuba. It is, however, an unpleasant \nfact--and facts are stubborn--that all those sales by more than 250 \nprivately owned U.S. companies were made to only one Cuban buyer: the \nCastro regime.\n  Don't believe me. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nitself: ``The key difference in exporting to Cuba, compared to other \ncountries in the region, is that all U.S. agricultural exports must be \nchanneled through one Cuban government agency, ALIMPORT.''\n  Exporting to Cuba is not about trading with small- or mid-sized \nfarmers, private businesses and manufacturers around the island, as \nsome of my colleagues would have Americans believe. So it should be no \nsurprise that U.S. products end up on the shelves of regime-owned \nstores that accept only what? Hard currencies. Meaning what? The U.S. \ndollar or a euro--with huge price markups.\n  Shoppers at these ``dollar stores'' are mainly tourists or those \nCubans who happen to have U.S. families who will send them money, but \nat the end of the day, those stores have these huge markups. And where \ndoes the money go to? Not a private enterprise but the regime.\n  Little imported food or medicine ever makes it into stores where \nCubans shop. Neither is it available on ration cards. It requires a \ntremendous leap of faith or belief in some extreme and unprecedented \neconomic model--call it dictator-down economics, from my perspective--\nto argue or theorize that current or more U.S. sales to Castro's \nmonopolies have or can ever benefit the Cuban people.\n  The facts prove otherwise, as has been the case with sales of U.S. \nfood and medicine. So what makes us believe expanded trade with the \nUnited States would be any different? As a matter of fact, since \nDecember 17 of this past year--when the agreements between the United \nStates and Cuba were announced and despite the Obama administration's \nefforts to improve relations with the Castro regime, which have \nincluded an increase in travel and eased payment terms for agricultural \nsales--U.S. sales to ALIMPORT, that Cuban regime company which they \ncontrol, during the same period have plummeted by over 50 percent. So \nthe question is, Why would even more concessions make this manipulation \nby the Castro regime's monopolies any different?\n  Let's stop talking about the embargo in vague terms. The embargo, as \ncodified by the U.S. Congress into law, simply requires the fulfillment \nof some very basic conditions which are consistent with the democratic \nand human rights standards of 34 out of the 35 nations in the Western \nHemisphere--Cuba remaining the sole exception and, of course, \nironically Venezuela heading into a downward spiral with a lot of \ninfluence by the Castro regime.\n  When President Obama or some of my colleagues call for lifting the \nembargo, they are asking Congress to unilaterally discard these \nconditions. So I want to ask them, which of these conditions--codified \nin U.S. law--do they disagree with or oppose that they are willing to \nunilaterally discard them? Which one are they willing to live without?\n  Is it, for example, the condition that Cuba ``legalizes all political \nactivity'' or the condition that Cuba ``releases all political \nprisoners and allows for investigations of Cuban prisons by appropriate \ninternational human rights organizations''? As I understood part of \nthis agreement, the Red Cross--I think it was the International Red \nCross--was going to be able to go into Cuban prisons. The regime said: \nNot interested in that.\n  Is it the condition that Cuba ``dissolves the present Department of \nState Security in the Cuban Ministry of the Interior, including the \nCommittees for\n\n[[Page S7180]]\n\nthe Defense of the Revolution. . . . ''? What is the Committee for the \nDefense of the Revolution? It is a block-watch entity in every \nneighborhood, in every village, in every hamlet inside of Cuba whose \nonly job is to spy on their neighbors, and when their neighbor says \nsomething critical of the regime, they get ratted out.\n  Is it the rapid response brigades? What are those? Those are state \nsecurity dressed as civilians who go take people such as the Ladies in \nWhite--people like these three pro-democracy individuals--and arrest \nthem so it seems as if the populace is the one doing it when it is \nstate security.\n  Is it the condition that Cuba ``makes a public commitment to \norganizing free and fair elections for a new government'' or the \ncondition that Cuba ``makes public commitments to and is making \ndemonstrable progress in establishing an independent judiciary; \nrespecting internationally recognized human rights and basic \nfreedoms as set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to \nwhich Cuba is a signatory nation; allows the establishment of \nindependent trade unions as set forth in conventions 87 and 98 of the \nInternational Labor Organization'' among others.\n\n  Is it the condition that Cuba give ``adequate assurances that it will \nallow the speedy and efficient distribution of assistance to the Cuban \npeople'' or the condition that Cuba is ``effectively guaranteeing the \nrights of free speech and freedom of the press, including granting \npermits to privately owned media and telecommunications companies to \noperate in Cuba''?\n  Is it the condition that Cuba is ``assuring the right to private \nproperty'' or ``taking appropriate steps to return to United States \ncitizens (and entities which are 50 percent or more beneficially owned \nby United States citizens) property taken by the Cuban Government from \nsuch citizens and entities on or after January 1, 1959, or to provide \nequitable compensation to such citizens and entities for such \nproperty''?\n  Is it the condition that Cuba has ``extradited or otherwise rendered \nto the United States all persons sought by the United States Department \nof Justice for crimes committed in the United States''?\n  Which one of these conditions do they not agree with? Are they all \nwilling to just throw them all out, require nothing?\n  If President Obama, as media reports indicate, takes the \nunprecedented step of abstaining from voting against a Cuban resolution \nin the United Nations General Assembly criticizing our own Nation's \nlaw--which is what the Cuban embargo is--he would be disavowing these \nbasic conditions because these basic conditions are what is written \ninto the law. I know. At the time, I was one of the authors who wrote \nthe law in the House of Representatives.\n  Think about the horrible message that turning a blind eye to these \nbasic conditions in U.S. law would send to the Cuban people about the \npriorities of the United States. Think of the horrible message it would \nsend to Cuba's courageous democracy leaders.\n  Since December 17, scores of foreign dignitaries, businessmen, and \nMembers of the U.S. Congress have descended upon Havana to meet with \nRaoul Castro and his cronies, while sidelining Cuba's courageous \ndissenters.\n  As independent journalist and blogger Yoani Sanchez lamented, ``A \ntrue shower of presidents, foreign ministers and deputies has \nintensified over Cuba without daily life feeling any kind of relief \nfrom such illustrious presences.''\n  Sadly, as the AP reported, ``more than 20 U.S. lawmakers have come to \nCuba since February without meeting with opposition groups that once \nwere an obligatory stop for congressional delegations.''\n  The reason U.S. lawmakers don't meet with human rights activists and \npolitical dissidents is because if they do, then they don't get a \nmeeting with Raoul Castro. So I guess the photo op with Raoul Castro is \nmore important than meeting with human rights activists and political \ndissidents.\n  Perhaps the biggest affront was during the flag-raising ceremony \nduring the opening ceremony of the U.S. Embassy in Havana--to which no \nCuban dissidents were invited. The Secretary of State said publically \nthis was due to ``a lack of space'' and that it was a ``government-to-\ngovernment'' function. Yet images clearly showed there was plenty of \nspace and lots of nongovernmental figures on the invitee list.\n  Can you imagine what the world would be like today if this had been \nthe attitude of the United States toward Sakharov, Solzhenitsyn, Vaclav \nHavel, Lech Walesa, and Nelson Mandela?\n  Meanwhile, adding insult to injury, Cuba's courageous dissident \nleaders--now neglected by the administration and congressional \nsupporters of the new policy and even further neglected by foreign \ndignitaries and unscrupulous businessmen searching for a profit at \nwhatever cost--are facing a dramatic increase in repression. Since \nDecember 17, when President Obama announced his new policy, Raoul \nCastro's dictatorship has exponentially increased the number of \npolitical arrests, beatings, and detentions. Just between January and \nMarch of this year, politically motivated arrests increased nearly 70 \npercent, from 178 arrests in the former month to 610 in the latter.\n  According to the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National \nReconciliation--an internationally recognized human rights watchdog--\nthe total number of political arrests during the first 9 months of this \nyear were 5,146. In just 9 months, these 5,146 political arrests \nsurpassed the year-long tallies recorded for 2010, which was 2,074; \n2011, which was 4,123; and 2015 is tragically on pace to become one of \nthe most repressive years in recent history.\n  The official number of September arrests alone--the month just \npassed--was 822, the most in 15 months. They include Danilo Maldonado, \na 31-year-old artist known as El Sexto who was imprisoned on December \n25 of this past year, one week after the new policy was announced. El \nSexto was arrested for painting the names Fidel and Raul on two pigs, \nwhich was considered an act of ``contempt.'' He remains imprisoned \nwithout trial or sentence or any justice. Amnesty International has \nrecognized him as a prisoner of conscience.\n  They also include Zaqueo Baez Guerrero, Ismael Bonet Rene and Maria \nJosefa Acon Sardinas, a member of The Ladies in White. These three \ndissidents sought to approach Pope Francis during his recent mass in \nHavana to ask for his solidarity with Cuba's political prisoners and \ndemocracy movement. They were dragged away and arrested under the eyes \nof the international media. They have been on a hunger and thirst \nstrike since September 20 and are being held at the infamous secret \npolice center for ``investigations'' at Aldabo and 100th Street in \nHavana. I am very concerned about their well-being.\n  They also include the case of Digna Rodriguez Ibanez, an Afro-Cuban \nmember of The Ladies in White in Santa Clara, who was attacked by \nCastro regime agents and pelted with tar. That is right, with tar. Also \nincluded is Eralisis Frometa Polanco, another member of The Ladies in \nWhite, who was pregnant and forcefully aborted due to the violent blows \nto the stomach she received during a beating for her peaceful activism, \nand Daisy Cuello Basulto, also a member of The Ladies in White, whose \ndaughter was arrested, stripped naked, and forced to urinate in front \nof male state security officers as a means of tormenting her mother.\n  For 24 straight Sundays in a row, Cuban dissidents have tried to \npeacefully demonstrate after Mass under the slogan ``Todos \nMarchamos''--we all march. And for 24 Sundays in a row they have been \nintercepted, violently beaten, and arrested.\n  This image is of Cuban dissident leader Antonio Rodiles, a 43-year-\nold intellectual, after having his face literally shattered during one \nof those peaceful Sunday marches. Yet, despite the tremendous \nindignities at the hands of the Castro regime, they remain undeterred \nin their struggle for freedom and democracy for all Cubans. Rather than \nshunning these courageous individuals, the United States should be \nembracing them.\n  On the same day the news hit that 882 political arrests were made in \nSeptember alone by the Castro regime, Secretary Kerry was in Chile \ntalking about some marine life agreement with Cuba. What about the \nhuman lives in Cuba suffering under this oppression? The Obama \nadministration's policy seems to be bringing little comfort to the \nCuban people generally, as they\n\n[[Page S7181]]\n\ncontinue to flee by land, by air, and the perilous journey by sea \nacross the Florida straits, where countless Cubans have lost their \nlives in search of freedom.\n  Nearly 32,000 Cubans entered the United States in the first 9 months \nof the fiscal year that ended on September 30, up from about 26,000 \nmigrants who entered last fiscal year, according to the Department of \nHomeland Security. Fewer than 7,500 Cubans came in 2010.\n  Finally, Mr. President, as one of the authors of the Cuban Liberty \nand Democratic Solidarity Act of 1996, known as the Libertad Act, and \nhaving served as a manager in the conference committee, I am concerned \nthat the recent regulations and actions being taken by the Treasury and \nCommerce Departments contravene the purpose and intent of the law. As \nthe final conference committee report of the Libertad Act made clear, \n``It is the intent of the committee of conference that all economic \nsanctions in force are March 1, 1996, shall remain in effect until they \nare either suspended or terminated pursuant to the authorities provided \nin section 204 of this (requiring a Presidential determination that a \nDemocratic transition is under way in Cuba).''\n  Those are the conditions I had previously addressed. The report also \nstates that ``the explicit mandates in this legislation make clear \ncongressional intent that U.S. law be enforced fully and, thereby, \nprovide a basis for strict congressional oversights of executive branch \nenforcement measures henceforth.''\n  In furtherance of this intent, the prohibition on U.S. assistance and \nfinancing of agricultural sales to Cuba, the prohibition on additional \nimports from Cuba, and the prohibition of travel relating to tourist \nactivities in the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of \n2000 are explicit, clear and leave no room for exceptions.\n  These provisions were precisely written to deny U.S. funds to the \nCastro regime's repressive machinery and prohibiting them from being \nfunneled through Castro's monopolies. Yet that is the direction--\nperhaps unintended--the new regulations are headed in, with the tragic, \nrepressive consequences on full display.\n  Any hope that President Obama's goodwill would elicit a different \ntone from Raul Castro was further diminished by the Cuban dictator's \nspeech to the U.N. General Assembly last month. Castro dedicated his \n17-minute speech almost entirely to bashing the policies of the United \nStates from Latin America to Eastern Europe to the Middle East. He \npraised Latin American autocrats in the mold of Hugo Chavez, sided with \nPutin and Assad, criticized representative democracy, and dismissed \nhuman rights as a ``utopia.'' While President Obama referred to the \nconcessions he has already made in his remarks to the U.N. General \nAssembly, Raul Castro audaciously demanded even more.\n  So let me close by saying we all remember the message President Obama \nsent to the foes of freedom in his first inaugural speech. He said, \n``[W]e will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.'' I \nurge the President to follow his own doctrine and reconsider some of \nthe unmerited and unreciprocated generosity in this new policy, for \nRaul Castro's fist clearly remains clenched, yet the President's hand \nis still fully extended.\n  The President claims those who don't agree with his Cuba policy are \nstuck in the past, but it is the Castro regime that is stuck in the \npast, still living their misguided Cold War dreams in a world that \nhasn't insisted they move forward. And when you own everything in the \ncountry--which the regime does--why would you be willing to give it up \nafter 50-some-odd years? Instead, we are rewarding them for their \nintransigence. Unless we challenge them, we will not see change.\n  The fact is that hope and change do not come easily. They do not just \nhappen. Like any parent with a child, they won't change unless you \nchallenge them and give them a reason. Like Congress, it needs to be \nchallenged to change. And so with Cuba the world needs to challenge the \nregime or change will never come--not give in and give everything. To \ndo so only strengthens their resolve to hold on to their dictatorship \nand prolong the day when we can truly say to the world that ``Cuba es \nLibre''--Cuba is free.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, while he is still on the floor, I want to \nthank the Senator from New Jersey for his remarks. He is clearly one of \nthe institution's experts on Cuba and the Castro regime, and I think we \nneed to pay attention to what he is saying.\n  Unfortunately, we seem to be dealing with other countries and other \nregimes as we hope they will be, not as they are in reality. That was \nan important set of remarks, so I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, yesterday the United States Senate voted to advance \nthe National Defense Authorization Act--what we call the NDAA. I worry \nsometimes we talk in Senate-speak, and we don't actually communicate \nwhat legislation is, so I want to talk a little about what this \ndefense--or national security--legislation is and why it is so \nimportant that it passes.\n  After passing both the House and the Senate earlier this summer, \ncolleagues worked in a conference committee led by Mac Thornberry from \nTexas, chairman of the House Committee on Armed Services, and Senator \nJohn McCain, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Services. I \nknow they had a tough job in reconciling those two different versions \nof the legislation, but now they have come forward with strong \nbipartisan legislation that supports our military and our families.\n  My dad served for 31 years in the United States Air Force. He flew B-\n17s in World War II in the Army Air Corps. I proudly grew up as an Air \nForce brat, so this is personal to me, as I know it is to the Presiding \nOfficer, who has served in the Marine Corps for a long time and for \nwhom this is a very personal issue as well.\n  In my State of Texas we are very proud of our connection with the \nmilitary. We claim--I am not sure it is exactly true but we make this \nclaim--that one out of every ten persons in uniform calls Texas home. I \nthink that is probably roughly correct, but we want to make sure that \nthrough this legislation we do our job to make sure our military gets \nthe equipment and the training they need in order to perform the \ndangerous missions we ask them to perform here in the United States and \naround the world. That is what this legislation does.\n  For example, the bill authorizes funding for the Corpus Christi Army \nDepot. This installation is a true national treasure because what it \ndoes is to refurbish the rotary-wing aircraft that come from overseas. \nAfter they are battered and beaten up, they come back and make them \nlike new. So when these army helicopters serve overseas, they come back \nfor a pit stop in Corpus Christi at the depot, and they make sure they \nare ready for the next challenge our military faces. This legislation \nwe will be voting on at 2 p.m. this afternoon authorizes funding for \nthe construction of a new facility at the depot where helicopter \nengines and transmissions can continue to be repaired, and we can \ncontinue to equip, as we should, our military.\n  This Defense authorization bill also authorizes critical military \nconstruction, such as the barracks at the Air Force basic training \nprogram at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, where thousands of \nairmen start their service to this Nation every year.\n  That was the first assignment for my dad, at Lackland Air Force Base \nin San Antonio, TX, when I was a freshman in high school. I have had \nthe privilege of attending some of the graduation ceremonies there, and \nthey are really an inspiration. You see this whole football field full \nof trainees learning, through their basic training, how to become \nairmen and to serve our country in the U.S. Air Force.\n  The real people and real installations are dependent upon this \nauthorization bill becoming law. This defense legislation is integral \nto ensuring our military is well resourced, well trained, and ready for \naction when called upon. Importantly, this legislation also helps \nclarify the United States' long-term defense priorities and authorizes \nfunds to equip our military to handle the multiple evolving conflicts \naround the world.\n  I am reminded that in August I visited the Pacific Command with some \nof\n\n[[Page S7182]]\n\nour colleagues here in the Senate, where we asked Admiral Harris, the \nfour-star commander of the Pacific Command, what keeps him up at night. \nWhat are you most concerned about? At the top of his list was North \nKorea, governed by a volatile dictator with nuclear weapons and \nintercontinental ballistic missiles. I know General Dunford, the new \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the former Commandant of the \nMarine Corps, had a little different ordering. He put Russia at the \ntop, I think, then China, North Korea, and then ISIL, if I am not \nmistaken. But regardless of the exact order, we know there are numerous \nthreats to world peace and regional security.\n  We learned the lesson on 9/11 that what happens overseas doesn't stay \noverseas. It directly affects our security right here at home too. That \nis why this legislation is so critical.\n  This Defense authorization bill also includes provisions that fund \nefforts to counter Russian aggression in Eastern Europe, where Vladimir \nPutin is trying to intimidate and coerce countries that are part of \nNATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and threatening them with \nthe kind of aggression we have seen in Crimea and Ukraine. This bill \nhelps counter that aggression. It also provides resources to help train \nand assist our partner nations in the Asia-Pacific, it provides help \nfor Israeli missile defense and anti-tunneling defense, and it supports \nour partners in Afghanistan and throughout the Middle East to combat \nrampant terrorist activity.\n\n  So what we do here in the Senate and in this Congress and here in \nWashington, DC, is important to our national security and the safety of \nour Nation. That is why for over 50 years Congress has made passing the \nDefense authorization bill--what we sometimes refer to as the NDAA, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act--that is why we have always made \nthat a priority. All of us, regardless of political affiliation or \nideology, believe it is fundamentally important to make sure our men \nand women in uniform, who are fighting on our behalf or standing ready \nto fight when called upon, faced with unprecedented threats around the \nworld--we need to make sure, as a moral obligation, that they have what \nthey need and that they know we are solidly behind them. That is what \nsignal this legislation sends.\n  Now we have a chance to send this to the President--after we vote on \nthis legislation--send it to him for his signature. But here is where I \nam troubled. President Obama has indicated he may well veto this \nlegislation. And what, we might ask, would be his reason? Is there some \nprovision of the legislation that he finds so repugnant or difficult \nthat he wants to veto the legislation? Frankly, what the President and \nthe White House have said is--they claim the funding levels outlined in \nthe Defense authorization bill are ``irresponsible.'' But get this: \nThese same funding levels are reflected in the President's own budget \nrequest. So we gave the President what he asked for, and he calls them \n``irresponsible.'' What kind of hypocrisy is that?\n  I hope the President and his counselors at the White House will \nreconsider playing fast and loose with support for our troops and this \nimportant piece of legislation. This bill is bipartisan. We can have \nour fights over all sorts of things--and Heaven knows we will--in this \npolarized political environment, but if there is one thing on which we \nall ought to agree on a bipartisan basis, it is that this legislation \nneeds to pass.\n  This support for our troops in an ever-dangerous world should be a \npriority. Fortunately, many of our Democratic friends understand this, \nand they have worked with us, and that is the way it should be. So I \nhope they aren't tempted to block this legislation in order to give \ncover to the President and to prevent him from being held accountable \nfor his own decisions. This is not a time to play games, particularly \nwith our national security and our men and women in uniform at stake.\n  Today our Armed Forces face a world with growing challenges in almost \nevery corner of the world. As a matter of fact, I think the Director of \nNational Intelligence, James Clapper, said he doesn't remember a time \nin his long career in the Air Force and now in the intelligence \ncommunity where the world has faced more diverse threats and \nchallenges. And, like it or not, the United States is the point of the \nspear in addressing those challenges. If the United States doesn't step \nup and lead, there is a vacuum created which does nothing but encourage \nthese tyrants, these thugs, the dictators and other people who will \ntake advantage of that void.\n  We can't tie our own hands behind our backs while asking our troops \nto fly into harm's way to support efforts against ISIS and Syria and \nIraq or sail to the edges of the Pacific to keep Chinese ambitions in \ncheck or to accompany Afghan soldiers in deadly firefights against a \nresurgent Taliban. Right now, as I stand in this Chamber, we have \nAmericans--soldiers, sailors, and marines--who are putting their lives \nat risk to defend this Nation. By definition, when they are deployed \noverseas, they are far away from home, separated from their loved ones \nand their families. We ought to always remember that for every man or \nwoman who wears the uniform, there is a family back home who is serving \nour Nation as well who deserves our gratitude and our support. The last \nthing our military needs is a reason to question the strength of our \nconvictions, and they need Congress to support them.\n  Our adversaries watch this sort of thing, too, because what they read \ninto political dysfunction--particularly when it comes to something as \nimportant as our national security--is they see encouraging signs that \nmaybe they can push the envelope a little further. Maybe they can \nchallenge the United States and our allies a little more. Maybe they \ncan grab a little more property, real estate. Maybe they can plant a \nflag someplace they otherwise would not because they see in our \nactions--particularly on something as important as this--a certain \nreticence, perhaps not a willingness to lead but, rather, an America \nretreating from our international responsibilities, and that is \ndangerous. That is dangerous.\n  I encourage all of our colleagues to simply vote once more in support \nof this legislation so we can send it to the President's desk. What he \ndoes is his responsibility. This legislation passed last June with more \nthan 70 votes. If we can send this bill to the President with that same \nsort of overwhelming bipartisan support, the President won't be able to \nveto this legislation because he knows his veto can be overridden by a \ntwo-thirds vote in the House and the Senate.\n  So let's do our part together to show our men and women in uniform \nthat our support for them will never ever waiver.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of my friend from \nTexas. I just want to point out that our military is fully funded and \nthat some of us believe our military is so important that it ought to \nbe funded by real dollars, not make-believe smoke and mirrors.\n  I have a press release from the ranking member, the top Democrat on \nthe Armed Services Committee, who said he opposes using budget gimmicks \nto fund the Pentagon, and he declined to sign the NDAA, which is very \nunusual.\n  If we really care about our military, and everyone does, we ought to \nfund with real dollars, not make-believe money--this one called OCO.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this press release be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Reed Opposes Fundamentally Flawed NDAA\n\n\nTop Democrat on Armed Services Committee opposes using budget gimmicks \n     to fund the Pentagon & declines to sign NDAA conference report\n\n       Washington, DC.--Today, U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), the \n     Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee announced that \n     he will not sign the Conference Report for the Fiscal Year \n     2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Reed opposes \n     the Conference Report because it uses an inefficient budget \n     gimmick that underfunds the Pentagon's base budget while \n     inflating the emergency war spending account known as the \n     Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) fund, which is exempted \n     from Budget Control Act spending caps. As a result, about one \n     out of every six dollars in this year's NDAA, nearly $90 \n     billion, is counted off the books. ``There are many needed \n     reforms in the Conference Committee Report, but the use of\n\n[[Page S7183]]\n\n     emergency war funds does not realistically provide for the \n     long-term support of our forces,'' said Senator Reed. ``I \n     cannot sign this Conference Report because it fails to \n     responsibly fix the sequester and provide our troops with the \n     support they deserve.'' ``I remain committed to working \n     toward a more balanced, responsible way to fix the sequester \n     so our defense and domestic needs are met. Achieving that \n     goal is essential to the security and financial well-being of \n     the American people. The Department of Defense is critical to \n     national security, but so are the FBI, Homeland Security, the \n     Department of Justice, and many other federal agencies that \n     help keep Americans safe,'' Reed concluded.\n\n\n                              Highway Bill\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I came over here because the American \npeople keep hearing: Government shutdown. Government shutdown. What is \ngoing to happen?\n  The opinion of Congress is the lowest of all times because we are not \ndoing our job. We are not doing our work.\n  We are facing three possible shutdowns.\n  The first one is the possible shutdown of our entire transportation \nprogram, and that has 22 days left. On this one, I want to praise the \nSenate because we stepped up, Democrats and Republicans together, and \nwe said: We are not going to let this happen; we are going to work \ntogether and get a bill. I am going to talk about that in a bit.\n  The second date we face is in early November, when, if we don't raise \nthe debt ceiling so we can pay for the programs everyone here voted \nfor, the government will shut down and we will become, frankly, the \npeople who have overseen for the first time a bankruptcy. We have to \nraise the debt ceiling. As Ronald Reagan said very eloquently--I don't \nhave his exact quote, but he said something like this: Even the thought \nof not paying our bills, even the thought of not raising the debt \nceiling should be avoided. But we face that made-up crisis.\n  The third one is December 11, where all of our budget has to be \nlooked at and we have to come to some agreement on the fair level of \nspending for both defense and nondefense and all the things we do.\n  I am here to talk about the first deadline because I am intimately \ninvolved with this as the ranking member on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. I want to start off by praising my chairman, Jim \nInhofe. He and I don't see eye to eye on a lot of things, but we sure \ndo when it comes to transportation.\n  One hundred days ago--my colleague knows this--the Senate Environment \nand Public Works Committee unanimously approved the DRIVE Act. It has \nbeen 68 days since the Senate passed the bill by a vote of 65 to 34--\nthat is an overwhelming vote in a bipartisan way--and now we are down \nto 22 days before we shut down. People can say: Why are we going to \nshut down when the Senate has done its job? Because the House hasn't \ndone its job. It is inexcusable.\n  If we can find the bipartisan will to work together to pass a long-\nterm transportation bill that increases funding for roads and bridges \nand transit projects, certainly they can find it in the House, and they \nshould find that consensus there. We are up against this deadline. We \nkeep hearing that the House--or I did--is going to act. Now, as far as \nwe know, they have put off the markup of the bill until the day before \nwe have a shutdown. That is ridiculous.\n  I call on Republicans and Democrats over there to come together, just \nas we came together. It is painful here on so many issues, but we found \nthe political will to do the right thing. Where is the House bill?\n  In September, 68 organizations sent a letter to the House calling on \nthe House to pass the Transportation bill. Look who signed this. I will \nmention a few: the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, the Associated General Contractors, the Travel \nAssociation, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the Laborers International \nUnion, the American Bus Association, the AAA, the American Trucking \nAssociation, the Society of Civil Engineers, the American Public Works \nAssociation, the National Railroad Construction and Maintenance \nAssociation. This is pretty amazing. This goes on and on.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 11, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: The undersigned organizations \n     representing every sector of the U.S. economy urge all \n     members of the House to pass a six-year reauthorization of \n     the federal surface transportation program in 2015 that \n     increases investment in highway and public transportation \n     improvements.\n       America's transportation infrastructure network is the \n     foundation on which the nation's economy functions. American \n     manufacturers, industries and businesses depend on this \n     complex system to move people, products and services every \n     day of the year. It is also a direct contributor to enhanced \n     personal mobility and quality of life for all Americans.\n       The Senate passed a multi-year surface transportation bill \n     with substantial bipartisan support in July. It is now \n     incumbent on the House of Representatives to keep the \n     reauthorization process moving forward to ensure a six year \n     bill is enacted before the latest short-term program \n     extension expires October 29.\n       The U.S. economy and all Americans require a surface \n     transportation infrastructure network that can keep pace with \n     growing demands. A six-year federal commitment to prioritize \n     and invest in our aging infrastructure and safety needs is \n     essential to achieve this goal.\n       Temporary program extensions and eight years of recurring \n     Highway Trust Fund revenue crises do not provide a path to \n     future economic growth, jobs and increased competitiveness. \n     We urge you to end this cycle of uncertainty by advocating \n     and voting for a six-year surface transportation program \n     reauthorization bill during 2015.\n           Sincerely,\n       National Association of Manufacturers, U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce, American Road & Transportation Builders \n     Association, Associated General Contractors of America, U.S. \n     Travel Association, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, \n     International Union of Operating Engineers, Laborers \n     International Union of North America, Building America's \n     Future, AAA, National Retail Federation, American Association \n     of State Highway and Transportation Officials, American \n     Public Transportation Association, American Trucking \n     Association, American Society of Civil Engineers.\n       American Public Works Association, American Highway Users \n     Alliance, National Ready Mixed Concrete Association (NRMCA), \n     Associated Equipment Distributors, American Concrete Pressure \n     Pipe Association, American Association of Port Authorities, \n     Coalition for America's Gateways & Trade Corridors, National \n     Stone, Sand & Gravel Association, Industrial Minerals \n     Association--North America, Auto Care Association, National \n     Recreation and Park Association, National Electrical \n     Contractors Association (NECA), National Tank Truck Carriers, \n     Inc., American Concrete Pavement Association, North American \n     Equipment Dealers Association, American Bus Association.\n       Transportation Intermediaries Association, Association of \n     Equipment Manufacturers, National Steel Bridge Alliance \n     (NSBA), Metropolitan Planning Council, Chicago, American \n     Institute of Steel Construction (AISC), American Concrete \n     Pipe Association, Institute of Makers of Explosives, National \n     Safety Council, National Precast Concrete Association, The \n     National Industrial Transportation League, Corn Refiners \n     Association, Specialized Carriers & Rigging Association, \n     National Asphalt Pavement Association, Construction & \n     Demolition Recycling Association, American Council of \n     Engineering Companies.\n       Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute, Governors Highway \n     Safety Association, North America's Building Trades Unions, \n     National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), \n     International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association, Energy \n     Equipment and Infrastructure Alliance, American Iron and \n     Steel Institute, American Traffic Safety Services \n     Association, The Association of Union Constructors (TAUC), \n     Asphalt Emulsion Manufacturers Association, Asphalt Recycling \n     & Reclaiming Association, International Slurry Surfacing \n     Association, Airports Council International-North America.\n       American Rental Association, Commercial Vehicle Safety \n     Alliance, Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute, National \n     Railroad Construction & Maintenance Association (NRCMA), \n     Motorcycle Riders Foundation, Intelligent Transportation \n     Society of America (ITS America), Farm Equipment \n     Manufacturers Association, NATSO, Representing America's \n     Travel Plazas and Truckstops, National Association of \n     Development Organizations (NADO), National Utility \n     Contractors Association (NUCA).\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. All of these extraordinary organizations are behind the \nSenate bill--the Governors Highway Safety Association, American \nConcrete. This is America together. They are calling on us. And this is \nnot a partisan issue.\n  It is incumbent on the House to keep the reauthorization process \nmoving forward and not wait until October 29 when we are on top of the \ndeadline and we have to do another extension. We\n\n[[Page S7184]]\n\nare all sick of it. Let me just say it doesn't work.\n  If you went to the bank and wanted to buy a house and they said, ``I \nhave great news from you, Mr. and Mrs. America: You have been approved \nfor a loan, but it is only for a year,'' you are not going to buy the \nhouse. It is the same way with our State highway people. They are not \ngoing to build a new highway or fix a road or invest in a transit \nprogram if they only have a few days of an extension that they can rely \non. They want us to have a long-term bill. We passed the 6-year bill \nhere with 3 years of pay-fors.\n  We have seen the organizations. I am saying that our people who drive \non roads are Democrats, Republicans, Independents, liberals, \nconservatives, rightwing, leftwing, ``middlewing.'' It doesn't matter. \nThis is one issue where we can come together, and the Senate proved we \ncan come together. So our words--and I really speak for everyone. I \nknow. I talked to Senator Inhofe, and he knows I am speaking today. The \nwords we have for the House: Just do it. Just do it. If we can do it, \nyou can do it. Short-term extensions don't work.\n  I gave the example of going for a mortgage. You are not going to \ninvest in a house if you can only get a year's mortgage. The same thing \nis true if you want to buy a new car. If you go to the bank and they \nsay, ``Great news: You are approved, but it is only for 3 months, or 90 \ndays,'' you are not going to buy the car. It is the same way for our \nStates.\n  I have a chart--I don't have it with me now--that shows how much the \nStates rely on the Federal Government. I don't have it blown up, but I \nam going to go through this. It is so interesting. We have States that \nrely on the Federal Government highway program for anywhere from 30 \npercent all the way up to 100 percent. Many States rely on the Federal \nGovernment for over 70 percent. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat this list of the percentages by State be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n  Federal Share of Each State's Capital Outlays for Highway & Bridge \n                                Projects\n\n\n        State                                                Percentage\nRhode Island........................................................102\nAlaska...............................................................93\nMontana..............................................................87\nVermont..............................................................86\nSouth Carolina.......................................................79\nHawaii...............................................................79\nNorth Dakota.........................................................78\nWyoming..............................................................73\nSouth Dakota.........................................................71\nConnecticut..........................................................71\nNew Mexico...........................................................70\nIdaho................................................................68\nAlabama..............................................................68\nNew Hampshire........................................................68\nMissouri.............................................................65\nMississippi..........................................................65\nColorado.............................................................64\nMinnesota............................................................64\nOklahoma.............................................................63\nArkansas.............................................................62\nGeorgia..............................................................62\nTennessee............................................................62\nWest Virginia........................................................61\nIowa.................................................................59\nOhio.................................................................58\nVirginia.............................................................57\nMaine................................................................57\nWisconsin............................................................55\nOregon...............................................................54\nIndiana..............................................................54\nNew York.............................................................54\nDistrict of Columbia.................................................52\nCalifornia...........................................................49\nNevada...............................................................49\nArizona..............................................................49\nNebraska.............................................................49\nKansas...............................................................49\nLouisiana............................................................48\nNorth Carolina.......................................................48\nMaryland.............................................................48\nTexas................................................................47\nPennsylvania.........................................................46\nWashington...........................................................45\nKentucky.............................................................44\nMichigan.............................................................41\nDelaware.............................................................41\nFlorida..............................................................39\nIllinois.............................................................39\nUtah.................................................................38\nMassachusetts........................................................37\nNew Jersey...........................................................35\n\n  We know Delaware is 41 percent reliant on the Federal Government; \nRhode Island is 100 percent reliant on the Federal Government; Vermont, \n80 percent; Hawaii, 79 percent; Alaska, 93 percent.\n  This is something that is a partnership. This is a partnership. We \nwork together with the States, but we are so disadvantaging our States. \nIn my State, it is about 50-50. We raise our resources about 50 \npercent. But do you know what the other 50 percent means to California, \nbecause we have almost 40 million people? It is $4 billion a year. We \ncan't do our program on our own.\n  As my friend Jim Inhofe says, it is a need that he feels as a \nconservative he can support. When you read the Constitution, we are one \nNation; we are connected. We need to build these roads.\n  There are over 61,000 bridges that are structurally deficient. We \nknow this. We have worked together to fix this problem, because we \nknow, in a way, it is a moral issue. Once you know something is \ndangerous, you have to fix it. We did with the Senate bill. We call on \nthe House to do the same. Now, 50 percent of our roads are in less than \ngood condition. This is not news to most of our people. They understand \nit. They drive on these roads. It takes a toll on their cars. I forget \nthe exact amount, but I think it is about $1,000 a year of costs for \npeople who use their cars a lot from roads that are not in good \ncondition.\n  Every day, there are over 215 million crossings by motorists on \nstructurally deficient bridges in every single State in our great \nUnion. Let's show you a list of some of these bridges that are in need \nof repair: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California--our Golden Gate \nBridge, our famous, incredible bridge. I crossed that bridge when I \nlived in Marin County every day for work. Seriously, the bottom line is \nthat we need to act. Connecticut, District of Columbia, Colorado, \nFlorida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa--these are bridges in \ngreat need of repair. Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, \nMassachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New \nHampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York--the Brooklyn Bridge, that \niconic bridge, is dangerous and in need of repair. In North Carolina, \nthere is a Greensboro bridge. Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania--the \nBenjamin Franklin Bridge--Pennsylvania is the home of the chairman over \nthere. In Oregon--the ranking member--there is the Columbia River \nCrossing. The Columbia River Crossing and the Benjamin Franklin Bridge \nare in the homes of the chairman and ranking member of the committee \nwho have the obligation to get this done. There is South Carolina, \nTexas, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin.\n  I have rushed this, but I don't want to spend the time naming every \nbridge. But this is where we are. A multiyear surface transportation \nbill is going to solve these problems, and we are going to start the \nwork that needs to be done. We know there are still 1.3 million fewer \nconstruction workers today than in 2006, when the recession started. \nAccording to the Associated General Contractors, 24 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia lost construction jobs between July and August. No \nwonder people look at Congress and they don't think we are doing a good \njob. We know all this.\n  The Senate has passed a good bill, bipartisan. All we are asking is \nwhat construction industry officials want us to do, and that is to stop \nthe uncertainty about future Federal funding levels for highway and \ntransit repairs. We know that the bill we passed in the Senate is a \ngood bill. It is not as big as a lot of us wanted, and it is not as \nsmall as other people wanted. We found a sweet spot.\n  I am going to conclude by saying this. The reports I have heard \nindicate that the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee may \nwell take action at the end of this month. That is so late. Let's go \nback to the 22 days chart. We are 22 days away from a transportation \nshutdown. They are going to mark up on the very day that we lose the \nauthorization to spend funds.\n  We know the writing is on the wall. They are going to send us some \nshort-term legislation. I want to say I am not going to allow that \nbecause I will oppose any short-term extension that pulls pieces out of \nour bill and takes the pressure off of passing a bill, such as positive \ntrain control. We have taken care of positive train control in our \nbill. I am not going to pull it out and put it on a short-term \nextension--no. They will get nothing.\n  They have to do their job. That is why they are here. We know we can \ndo\n\n[[Page S7185]]\n\nit. We proved it over here. We have really serious problems over here, \nbut we did it. We did it. When you have 65 votes for something over \nhere and you pull equally from both parties, you have a good product. \nWe have serious issues, and they have to be addressed. We are not going \nto pull out special favorite pieces out of the highway bill and stick \nit on a short-term extension or have some stand-alone bill that solves \npositive train control or any other of the special issues that we have \naddressed in the bill. Everyone knows we have to act.\n  I know my friend is waiting patiently to make a few remarks. I simply \nwant to conclude with this. We passed a good bill--over $55 billion for \n6 years. There are two new programs, including a formula freight \nprogram that provides funds for all States to improve goods movement. \nWe have included the McCaskill-Schumer rental cars bill so rental cars \nwill be safe. We have the first-ever commuter rail fund for positive \ntrain control.\n  These are some of the good things we have done. Let's not throw it \nall away and get it all glommed up into the other problems we are \nfacing, which are the date on the debt ceiling and the December 11 date \non funding the budget. We don't have to do it. This is a special fund. \nIt is the highway trust fund. It should not get enmeshed in the end-of-\nbudget-year issues. We should take that crisis off the plate. We did it \nin the Senate. They should do it in the House. That is our message \ntoday to the House: Please, Republicans, Democrats, liberals, \nconservatives, moderates, everyone in between, come together for the \ngood of this country and pass a highway bill. Let's get to conference. \nLet's get the best bill we can get and be done with it and, at least \nthen, send a signal to the people of this country that we are doing our \njob.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise to discuss the legislation before \nthis body, the National Defense Authorization Act. Before doing so, I \nwant to take a minute and address the DRIVE Act. I strongly support the \nDRIVE Act. It is very important that we have a 6-year highway bill for \nour country and that we get it in place. It was passed in a bipartisan \nbasis. I think there are many provisions in it that will be very \nhelpful, not only to our country but to each and every one of our \nStates. We have worked on that legislation; we have passed it through \nregular order. It is vitally important.\n  When I go home and talk to my constituents in North Dakota, as I know \nis the case for all Members of this body, they express how important it \nis that we get not only a highway bill passed but a 6-year highway \nbill, a long-term highway bill passed so that these multiyear projects \ncan go forward. We do need to get that done and get it done now so that \nwe don't have an interruption in the Federal highway program.\n  To my esteemed colleague, I want to express my support as well for \nthis important legislation. I appreciate both the work of the chairman \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee and of the ranking \nmember--my colleague who is the ranking member on EPW. This is \nimportant legislation. We need to continue to work in a bipartisan way \nin both Houses--the Senate and House--and get this legislation done.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator yield so I could thank him for a \nminute?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I will.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Through the Chair, I want to thank the Senator so much \nbecause he was one of those people who really helped us. In addition, \nevery member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, on both \nsides of the aisle, was terrific on this. In addition to the chairman, \nSenator Inhofe, I also want to single out Senator Durbin and Senator \nMcConnell, because they stepped up from both sides of the leadership \nwhen it really looked as if it would never happen. We proved that we \ncould do it. I am so grateful to my friend for showing his support \nbecause we have so many contentious issues. This is not one of them. I \nwant to thank him very much for his comments.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, again, I thank the Senator from \nCalifornia. This is important bipartisan legislation, and we need to \ncontinue to work to get it done.\n  I rise today to discuss the NDAA--the National Defense Authorization \nAct. It is likewise incredibly important legislation, in this case for \nour military--for our military and for the defense of this great \nNation. I want to begin by commending the members of the Armed Services \nCommittee, and especially Chairman McCain, but all of them for their \ndiligence. That means Members of both the Senate and the House, working \ntogether in conference committee after both Houses passed this \nlegislation, passed the legislation through regular order. I emphasize \nthat because it is so important that we follow regular order in this \nbody and in the House, where we bring forward the legislation from the \ncommittees, bring it to the floor, have the debate, have the \nopportunity to offer amendments, debate those amendments, vote on those \namendments, and then vote on the legislation. Let these bodies work \ntheir will. Send the legislation to the President. He makes his \ndecision and we move forward.\n  I emphasize this right at the outset because it is so important that \nwe work in this way through regular order so that we get to the \nimportant work of this country. I use this legislation as a great \nexample--the National Defense Authorization Act, the defense of our \nNation. We are moving forward because we are following regular order. \nWe are working in the way I just described in both the Senate and the \nHouse, and that is what we need to do.\n  It is hard to overstate the importance of this legislation for our \nmen and women in uniform and for the security of our Nation. I am \npleased that we are now debating this conference agreement, and I look \nforward to moving to final passage. In just a few hours, at 2 p.m. \neastern time today, we will be voting on final passage on this \nlegislation.\n  There are several features of this bill that I want to highlight, and \nI am going to talk about a few of them. There are many important \nprovisions, but I do want to highlight some of them here over the next \nfew minutes. The first is in the area of personnel and benefits, taking \ncare of those who put on the uniform--men and women who wear the \nuniform and put it all on the line for us and for our country.\n  This bill represents a continuing commitment to the well-being of our \nservice men and women. It makes significant improvements to the \nbenefits we offer to those who serve, particularly, by allowing \nmilitary participation in the Thrift Savings Plan, as recommended by \nthe Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission.\n  We recognize that we need to reward those who stay in the military \nfor 20 years with a strong retirement package. We also recognize \nthrough this legislation that those who serve less than 20 years \ndeserve something in retirement as well. The Thrift Savings Plan \nprovides a great mechanism to do that. I am very glad that we are able \nto include that in this legislation.\n  Let me touch for a minute on international security assistance. We \nface an incredible array of threats to our security and to the security \nof our allies. Those threats require immediate and careful attention, \nand this legislation points us in that direction and provides important \ntools. Because of the serious concerns many of us have about the \nefforts to fight ISIL, the National Defense Authorization Act increases \ncongressional oversight of the effort to support the fight against ISIL \nin Syria.\n  We should not wait to pass this legislation. There is too much at \nstake in critical regions of the world, and we need to move forward. We \nshould pass this legislation immediately, and the President should sign \nit right away so that our military has all of the authorities it needs \nto address threats such as ISIL as soon as possible.\n  I will talk for a minute about some of the critical defense programs. \nOf course the military needs the best tools available in order to meet \nthe security threats of today and tomorrow.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 provides \nauthorization for a number of key weapon systems, including the Air \nForce's new long-range strike bomber and the aerial refueling tanker \nprograms, missile\n\n[[Page S7186]]\n\ndefense, and a wide range of other procurement priorities. Delaying \nthese programs now will harm our national security in the future, so it \nis important to keep them on track by passing this legislation and \ngetting it signed into law.\n  I am also very pleased that the fiscal year 2016 legislation provides \nfull authority for the Air Force's nuclear forces, including the B-52 \nbomber and the Minuteman III ICBM as well as the Global Hawk unmanned \naircraft. Our Global Hawks provide incredible intelligence, \nsurveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities. In North Dakota, we are \nproud to host the capabilities that make such vital contributions to \nthe defense of our Nation--two of the legs of the nuclear triad--the \nintercontinental ballistic missiles and the B-52 bombers, as well as \nthe unmanned Global Hawk.\n  I also want to say another word about remotely piloted aircraft, \nRPAs. The Air Force has been squeezed by the demand for the \ncapabilities we have in the Predator and the Reaper, and it has been \ndifficult to meet those demands and still have the capacity to train \nnew pilots for these RPAs, remotely piloted aircraft.\n  I wish to commend the members of the conference committee for a very \nstrong section in this legislation that requires the Air Force to \nconsider all of its options to train additional RPA pilots. I have been \nadvocating using the private sector to increase our capability to train \nthose pilots. That is a step that can be done in the short term without \ndrawing down our ability to support commanders in theater.\n  Right now the commanders in theater want those remotely piloted \naircraft for the mission. That is a very high operations tempo. That \ndoesn't leave pilots available here at home to train new pilots to fly \nthese aircraft. That is why a private sector solution can be so helpful \nto our Air Force, and that is the language I worked so hard to include \nin this legislation.\n  I also have language in the report that goes along with the fiscal \nyear 2016 Defense appropriations bill. The companion bill to the \nauthorization bill is the appropriations bill. I included language in \nthe appropriations bill that instructs the Air Force to look at private \nsector-led training. My hope is that between that language and what we \nare passing in this authorization bill, the Air Force will find a way \nto leverage the private sector to enhance what the Air Force can do \nwith its RPA fleet, meaning a higher ops tempo, and at the same time \ntrain new pilots and bring them into the system to fly unmanned \naircraft.\n  Finally, I will highlight a couple of items that are important to \nNorth Dakota specifically. One is an amendment I offered during floor \nconsideration of the NDAA in the Senate. This language directs the Air \nForce to determine the feasibility of partnering the Air National Guard \nwith the Active-Duty Air Force to operate and maintain the Global Hawk. \nSimilar to what it does in support of the Predator and Reaper missions, \nI believe the Air National Guard can provide a valuable contribution to \nthe Global Hawk missions. I am very grateful that the conferees \nretained this amendment in the bill, and I hope that it will prove to \nbe valuable not only in North Dakota but will set an example that can \nbe followed with other aircraft and the Air National Guard units in \nother States across the country.\n  I also wish to thank the conferees for including a $7.3 million \nauthorization to construct a new Intelligence Targeting Facility at \nHector Field in Fargo. Our Air National Guard is taking on an exciting \nnew targeting mission and this much needed facility will give them the \nspace required and the capability--the facilities and resources \nnecessary--to do that job right. They are already doing an outstanding \njob, but they need this secure facility as part of this highly \nspecialized and highly important mission.\n  I worked on this project through the military construction \nappropriations subcommittee, and I look forward to completing the \nauthorizing and appropriating legislation so we can get construction \nstarted on this new facility in Fargo.\n  The bottom line is that this legislation includes many provisions \nthat are important for our men and women in uniform, that are critical \nto our national security, and that are vital to each of our States. The \nbill is well crafted, and it has received bipartisan support. It is \nabsolutely necessary that we move forward and pass it and that it \nbecomes law, so I will touch on that aspect of the legislation for just \na minute as well.\n  The President has indicated that he intends to veto this legislation. \nSo he intends to veto legislation that is passing through this body \nwith very strong bipartisan support. The irony is that he is vetoing \nthis legislation because we included additional funding in the \nlegislation for our military that is incredibly important and is very \nmuch needed. But he is saying, nope, that is not what he wants done and \nhas indicated that he will veto the legislation.\n  It is very important today that we have strong bipartisan support to \nsend a clear message that if this legislation is vetoed, this body and \nthe House will override that veto. We have to stand strong on a \nbipartisan basis. We have to make sure that we get this legislation \npassed, not just for our men and women in uniform but for the good and \nfor the security of our country.\n  This is vitally important legislation. This is about making sure that \nwe join together in a bipartisan way and get it done for our men and \nwomen in uniform, and then there is still more to do.\n  This is the authorizing legislation. Then we have to pass the \nappropriating bill that goes with this legislation so that we fund the \nauthorizations provided in this legislation, and not until all three \nthings are done have we stepped up and got the job done for our \nmilitary. We need to pass this authorization. We need to make sure that \nwe override any veto--should the President decide to veto this very \nimportant legislation--and then we need to stand strong, come together, \nand make sure we do not have a filibuster of the companion bill, the \nDefense appropriations bill, which goes with this authorization. Then, \nand only then, will we have the job done that we need to do for our men \nand women in uniform. That is the task before us, and that is what we \nneed to get done. We need to keep our eye on that ball very clearly, \nand we need to make sure the American people understand that we have to \npass this legislation, override any veto, and then pass the companion \nDefense appropriations bill. Only then have we got the job done for our \nmen and women in uniform who put it all on the line for us.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                              Section 1045\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I want to thank Chairman McCain and \nRanking Member Reed for their efforts to include an anti-torture \nprovision in the conference report on the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, H.R. 1735. As a coauthor of \nthis provision--Section 1045 of the conference report--I am pleased \nthat there will now be clear limits on interrogation techniques so that \nthe United States can never again conduct coercive and abusive \ninterrogations or indefinite secret detentions.\n  Section 1045 applies the restrictions on interrogations in the Army \nField Manual under current law to the entire U.S. Government. The \nprovision therefore extends to the whole of government what Congress \ndid in 2005, by a vote of 90-9, with the Detainee Treatment Act, which \nbanned the Department of Defense from using techniques not authorized \nby the Army Field Manual. The Detainee Treatment Act also banned across \nthe government the use of cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment or \npunishment.\n  Section 1045 also requires prompt access by the International \nCommittee of the Red Cross to any detainee held by the U.S. Government.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator McCain, to \nprovide clear legislative history as the coauthors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like to start by asking the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, a question concerning this anti-\ntorture provision, Section 1045.\n  Some have raised the concerns about the exemption in this provision \nfor Federal law enforcement agencies. The concern is that this new \nprovision\n\n[[Page S7187]]\n\nmight supersede other laws, rules, and guidance that apply to Federal \nlaw enforcement agencies. The language in the Senate-passed bill made \nclear that Federal law enforcement agencies could use interrogation \ntechniques outside of the Army Field Manual if those techniques are \nauthorized, noncoercive, and ``designed to elicit voluntary statements \nand do not involve the use of force, threats, or promises.''\n  Does the absence of this language in the conference report somehow \nopen the door to the use of coercive interrogation techniques by those \nagencies? Is that the intent of the law enforcement exception in \nSection 1045?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No. I assure the Senator from California that this is not \nthe case and that I would not have agreed to any such provision if it \nwere. The conferees decided that the requirement that all U.S. \ninterrogations be conducted in accordance with the Army Field Manual on \ninterrogations should not apply to Federal law enforcement officials \nfor two simple, straightforward reasons.\n  First, Federal law enforcement agencies already have an extensive and \nwell-established set of rules and procedures concerning interrogations \nbecause law enforcement interrogations are by definition conducted to \nproduce statements that are voluntary and admissible in court. Those \nrules and procedures strictly prohibit the use of coercive techniques.\n  Second, the U.S. Army Field Manual was not written with law \nenforcement circumstances in mind, and it is unnecessary to ask law \nenforcement agencies to use or adapt the Army Field Manual when they \nalready have their own rules and procedures for noncoercive \ninterrogations.\n  Since at least 2004, it has been the policy of the FBI that ``no \nattempt be made to obtain a statement by force, threats, or promises,'' \naccording to the Legal Handbook for FBI Special Agents, as publicly \nrecounted by the FBI general counsel in July 24, 2004, congressional \ntestimony. This and other such rules and applicable restrictions are \nunaffected by this provision.\n  In short, we did not ``open the door'' to coercive techniques by law \nenforcement in any way. We left the existing law enforcement rules \nunder current law and Executive order in place. Indeed, as the joint \nexplanatory statement of managers in this conference report states: \n``The conferees recognize that law enforcement personnel may continue \nto use authorized non-coercive techniques of interrogation, and that \nArmy Field Manual 2-22.3 is designed to reflect best practices for \ninterrogation to elicit reliable statements.''\n  Also, it should go without saying that the exemption for ``Federal \nlaw enforcement entities'' does not apply to the Central Intelligence \nAgency, Department of Defense, and the like, but rather includes \nentities like the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of \nHomeland Security, as specified.\n  It is false to suggest that the conferees in any way agreed to allow \nthe use of coercive interrogations by law enforcement agencies. We have \nbanned coercive interrogations because they are a stain on our national \ncharacter, ineffective, and counterproductive to our foreign policy \ngoals.\n  I did not work for more than a decade to preclude coercive \ninterrogations only to agree to permit them so long as they are carried \nout by a different set of agencies. I did not, and this provision does \nno such thing. The rules and strictures on coercive interrogations by \nFederal law enforcement agencies are completely unaffected by this \nprovision. I say that as the coauthor of the Senate amendment and as \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee, who negotiated the \nagreement on the final language.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I want to thank Chairman McCain for explaining the \nlegislative intent of the provision and for making clear that this \nlegislation does not allow the use of coercive interrogations by \nFederal law enforcement agencies.\n  I would also like to ask the Senator for his view on one additional \nchange made to the anti-torture provision in the conference process. \nThe Senate bill required the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with \nother specified officials, to review the Army Field Manual for update \nand revision. The Senate bill required this to be completed within a \nyear from the date of enactment and once every 3 years thereafter. The \nconference report changes the timeline for that review, so that it \noccurs not sooner than 3 years from the date of enactment, and then \nevery 3 years thereafter. Can the chairman of the committee clarify the \nreasoning behind that change?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator for the question. There was a concern \namong the conferees that the Senate provision would not allow adequate \ntime for the mandatory review, especially given the broadening of the \napplication of the Army Field Manual to the rest of government. In \nlight of this change, and the importance of the review, the conferees \ndecided that 3 years was a more appropriate timeline.\n  I would also like to clarify one point, as there has been some \nconfusion. It has been pointed out that the conference report requires \nthe mandatory review of the Army Field Manual to be completed ``not \nsooner than'' 3 years from the date of enactment. This should not be \nread as allowing the review to be done far in excess of 3 years or \npotentially not at all. This language appears under the heading \n``Requirement to Update,'' and it is the conferees' view that this \nreview must be completed on or shortly after 3 years from the date of \nenactment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Again, I thank the chairman and congratulate him for \nhis very important legislative achievement.\n  Madam President, I want to thank Chairman McCain and Ranking Member \nReed for their efforts to include an anti-torture provision in the \nconference report on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2016, H.R. 1735.\n  Section 1045 of the conference report establishes clear limits on \ninterrogation techniques so that the United States can never again \nconduct coercive and abusive interrogations or indefinite secret \ndetentions.\n  Section 1045 applies the restrictions on interrogations in the Army \nField Manual under current law to the entire U.S. Government. The \nprovision therefore extends what Congress did in 2005, by a vote of 90-\n9, with the Detainee Treatment Act, which banned the Department of \nDefense from using techniques not authorized by the Army Field Manual, \nand also banned across the government the use of cruel, inhumane, and \ndegrading treatment or punishment.\n  Section 1045 also requires prompt access by the International \nCommittee of the Red Cross to any detainee held by the U.S. Government.\n  Both of these provisions are consistent with U.S. policy for the past \nseveral years, but Section 1045 will now codify these requirements into \nlaw.\n  President Obama banned the use of coercive and abusive interrogation \ntechniques by Executive order in his first few days in office, on \nJanuary 22, 2009.\n  That Executive order, No. 13491, formally prohibits--as a matter of \npolicy--the use of interrogation techniques not specifically authorized \nby Army Field Manual 2-22.3 on human intelligence collector operations. \nSection 1045 places that restriction into law, which is long overdue.\n  What this means is that a future President can't simply rewrite the \npolicy--these limitations are now a matter of law and can't be undone \nwithout a future act of Congress.\n  Section 1045(a)(2) states that an individual in custody or otherwise \ndetained ``shall not be subjected to any interrogation technique or \napproach, or any treatment related to interrogation, that is not \nauthorized by and listed in the Army Field Manual.''\n  Section 1045(a)(2)(B)(i) makes clear that the ban on interrogation \ntechniques not authorized by the Army Field Manual applies to all \nindividuals ``in the custody or under the effective control of an \nofficer, employee, or other agent of the United States Government,'' \nwhether during or outside an armed conflict.\n  This is a very important change. Unlike the Executive order, which \nonly applies to armed conflict, we are saying with this law that \ncoercive interrogations will never again be used, period.\n  Section 1045(b) codifies a separate section of President Obama's \nJanuary 2009 Executive order, requiring access by the International \nCommittee of the\n\n[[Page S7188]]\n\nRed Cross to all U.S. detainees in U.S. Government custody--which has \nbeen historically granted by the United States and other law-abiding \nnations and is needed to fulfill our obligations under international \nlaw, such as in the Geneva Conventions.\n  I know my colleagues are well aware of the executive summary of the \nstudy released by the Intelligence Committee in December 2014 on the \ndeeply flawed detention and interrogation program carried out by the \nCIA beginning in 2002.\n  During my floor speech on the study in December 2014, I described how \nthe interrogations of CIA detainees from 2002 onward were absolutely \nbrutal and ineffective.\n  In August of 2014, President Obama said what many of us have known \nfor years: that the CIA's now-defunct interrogation program amounted to \ntorture.\n  CIA Director John Brennan has clearly stated he agrees with the ban \non interrogation techniques that are not in the Army Field Manual. \nDirector Brennan wrote the following to the Intelligence Committee in \n2013 about the President's 2009 Executive Order:\n  ``I want to reaffirm what I said during my confirmation hearing: I \nagree with the President's decision, and, while I am the Director of \nthe CIA, this program will not under any circumstances be reinitiated. \nI personally remain firm in my belief that enhanced interrogation \ntechniques are not an appropriate method to obtain intelligence and \nthat their use impairs our ability to continue to play a leadership \nrole in the world.''\n  More recently, in a September 11, 2015, letter to me, Director \nBrennan wrote that ``CIA strictly adheres to Executive Order 13491, 3 \nC.F.R. 199 (2009), and fully supports efforts to codify key provisions \nof the executive order in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY \n2016.''\n  As a result of the anti-torture statute (18 U.S.C. Sec. 2340A) and \npassage of the Detainee Treatment Act in 2005, current law already bans \ntorture, as well as cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or \npunishment.\n  However, the provision in this bill is still necessary because the \nCIA was able to employ brutal interrogation techniques based on deeply \nflawed legal theories that those techniques did not constitute \n``torture'' or ``cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment.''\n  Opinions written by the Department of Justice's Office of Legal \nCounsel, OLC, which could not withstand scrutiny and have since been \nwithdrawn, managed to twist legal reasoning beyond all recognition and \nfind that waterboarding, sleep deprivation up to 180 hours at a time, \nstress positions, slamming a detainee into a wall, and other similar \ntechniques were not torture.\n  OLC reached these erroneous legal judgments by ignoring the inherent \nbrutality of the CIA's so-called enhanced interrogation techniques. \nWhile ignoring that fact, OLC claimed CIA's techniques were a necessity \nto keep Americans safe and OLC mistakenly found the CIA program was \nmanaged and implemented with great care, which it was not.\n  This stood in stark contrast to the clear language of the anti-\ntorture statute in the U.S. Code, and the Convention against Torture, \nwhich the U.S. Senate ratified in 1994.\n  That convention, clearly and absolutely, bans torture. It says: ``No \nexceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a \nthreat of war, internal political instability or any other public \nemergency, may be invoked as a justification of torture.''\n  And yet so-called enhanced interrogation techniques--not allowed by \nthe Army Field Manual, were approved, used, and abused by the Bush \nadministration.\n  Section 1045 will serve as an additional bulwark to prevent similar \ntechniques from ever be used again by imposing--on all of the U.S. \nGovernment--the same restrictions that apply to the U.S. military today \nunder the Detainee Treatment Act.\n  In order to make sure that the legislative history is clear, I'd like \nto describe the minor changes that were made to the language of this \nanti-torture provision during the conference.\n  As described in the joint explanatory statement of the committee of \nthe conference, the following two minor changes were made to the \namendment.\n  First, regarding the applicability of this new provision to law \nenforcement interrogations, Section 1045 makes clear that the new \nlimitations ``shall not apply to officers, employees, or agents of the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security, \nor other Federal law enforcement entities.''\n  The version that passed the Senate and this final version both have \nan exemption for law enforcement because law enforcement agencies do \nnot use the Army Field Manual and are already required to use \nnoncoercive interrogation methods in which officers question suspects \nin order to elicit voluntary statements.\n  This exemption is consistent with and reinforces the relevant \nrequirements of Executive Order 13491 on ``Ensuring Lawful \nInterrogations,'' which allows law enforcement agents to use only \n``authorized, non-coercive techniques of interrogation that are \ndesigned to elicit voluntary statements and do not involve the use of \nforce, threats, or promises.''\n  For example, since at least 2004, it has been the policy of the FBI \nthat ``no attempt be made to obtain a statement by force, threats, or \npromises,'' according to the Legal Handbook for FBI Special Agents \nwhich was publicly recounted by the FBI general counsel in July 24, \n2004, congressional testimony.\n  As the conferees to the defense bill wrote in their joint explanatory \nstatement: ``The conferees recognize that law enforcement personnel may \ncontinue to use authorized non-coercive techniques of interrogation.'' \nThe absence of this language in the final bill text should not be \ninterpreted as any authorization for law enforcement to use any \ncoercive interrogation techniques.\n  The second minor change to the anti-torture amendment that was made \nin the conference committee is that the timing for the completion of \nthe required update to the Army Field Manual--after the specified \n``thorough review''--was changed from ``[n]ot later than one year'' to \n``[n]ot sooner than three years'' in subsection (a)(6)(A) of Section \n1045.\n  This change does not alter the importance of the required review, the \nimperative that it be initiated in the immediate future, and that it be \ncompleted in 3 years' time.\n  The language of the provision is clear: the conferees wanted the \nSecretary of Defense to be thorough and gave him 3 years to complete \nthe review. But the amendment says that he ``shall complete'' a \nthorough review after 3 years, not that he ``shall initiate'' a \nthorough review after 3 years.\n  It is also important to point out that, regardless of the timing of \nthis statutorily required review, this administration or the subsequent \nadministration may at any time revise portions or the entirety of the \nArmy Field Manual.\n  As Section 1045(a)(6)(A) states, revising the Army Field Manual is \nnot optional; it is a ``requirement to update.'' Moreover, the \nprovision makes clear that this requirement must be undertaken every 3 \nyears. Therefore, it would be inconsistent with the title, structure, \nand purpose of this subsection to suggest that the initial review \nfollowing enactment can be postponed indefinitely.\n  Also, as the amendment notes, revisions to the Army Field Manual may \nbe necessary to ensure that it complies with the legal obligations of \nthe United States, a requirement that the executive branch is obligated \nto adhere to at all times.\n  In addition, no matter when the updates to the Army Field Manual are \nmade, the manual ``is designed to reflect best practices for \ninterrogation to elicit reliable statements,'' as the conferees also \nwrote their joint explanatory statement. America's best and most \nexperienced interrogators have consistently and emphatically stated \nthat best practices for eliciting reliable, actionable intelligence \nsolely involve noncoercive techniques that elicit voluntary statements.\n  Let me now turn briefly to part (b) of Section 1045, which codifies \npart of President Obama's Executive order of January 2009 requiring \naccess by the International Committee of the Red Cross, ICRC, to all \nU.S. detainees in U.S. Government custody.\n  This requirement--which is based on our obligations under \ninternational\n\n[[Page S7189]]\n\nlaw--has had bipartisan support in previous Congresses.\n  As we know from our own history and from the experiences of detainees \naround the world, closing the door to the ICRC opens the door to \ntorture and other forms of mistreatment. Providing ICRC access is also \nnecessary for our moral standing and critical to our efforts to defend \nhuman rights abroad.\n  Finally, our troops depend on the promise of ICRC access should they \nbe taken prisoner. Now is the time to ensure that we live up to the \nvalues--in practice and in law--that we expect will be accorded to our \nown members of the military.\n  I have been opposed to coercive interrogations and the use of so-\ncalled enhanced interrogation techniques since I first learned of their \nuse at Abu Ghraib and by the CIA. This bill, at long last, puts the end \nto them. I am very proud to have been part of the process to author and \nsupport this provision and very much thank the bill managers for their \ninsistence that it remain in the final legislation.\n  Whatever one may think about the CIA's former detention and \ninterrogation program, we should all agree that there can be no turning \nback to the era of torture. Coercive interrogation techniques do not \nwork, they corrode our moral standing, and ultimately, they undermine \ncounterterrorism policies they are intended to support.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                            YouTube Kids App\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, a few weeks ago I brought to the \nattention of the Senate the continuing new challenges that we have with \nthe Internet and the fact that so much material is available to all of \nus, including our youngest citizens, indeed, our toddlers.\n  The question is: What is appropriate content for our toddlers? Google \nhas put up a YouTube application for kids. They call it YouTube Kids. I \nhave some pictures here that show some of the content on that \napplication. First of all, I think this picture is self-explanatory. It \nsays: How to open a beer with another beer. Mind you, this is a YouTube \nKids application. Toddlers can access this information. It says: How to \nopen a beer, and it goes through the sequence. This is another fairly \ngraphic picture of how to open a beer with a beer.\n  Is that appropriate for young children? It is readily available and \npromoted by Google. I doubt that we would conclude that it is. Here is \nanother one.\n  This one has wine-tasting tips. What is tannin in wine? Identifying \nacidity in wine.\n  Here is the cutest baby song in the world, ``Everybody Dance Now.'' \nThat doesn't look too bad. Here is Alvin and the Chipmunks. This has \nnursery rhymes for babies, but when you play it, there are some unusual \nwords in there, and so forth and so on. You get the picture. This is \nfor children. This is for little ones.\n  Now here is a picture that shows how to make sulfuric acid two ways. \nIs that appropriate for toddlers?\n  I have another example. This shows how to make toxic chlorine gas. Is \nthat appropriate for young children? I don't think so.\n  I wrote to Google, and fortunately Google responded. I wish to share \nwith the Senate what I believe are steps in the right direction, but \nnot enough. For example, I asked: What policies and procedures govern \nthe inclusion of the videos on this app?\n  The answer in the Google letter is that Google uses algorithms that \ngovern the automated system. Parents can notify Google of problem \nvideos. Google will be informing parents on how to change its settings \nto allow parents to be more restrictive with the range of videos their \nkids can access.\n  Well, why should parents have to intercede when their algorithms--if \nyou type in a search for beer--come up with what I showed you? It shows \nus how to open a beer with another beer. That seems contrary to common \nsense.\n  Then we ask: What factors determine whether content is suitable for \nchildren?\n  Google's answer is: An automated system and parental complaints.\n  I ask in my letter: For what age range must content be suitable?\n  Google did not answer that question.\n  I additionally ask: What steps, such as filtering, does Google take \nto ensure unsuitable content does not appear in search results on \nYouTube Kids? Do these steps apply to new content uploaded to YouTube \nKids?\n  Google's answer was: Google uses algorithms in the automated system. \nGoogle will soon be informing parents on how to change settings and \nrestrict the range of videos. That is the same answer that applied to a \nprevious question.\n  So I ask: How long after content is flagged does Google assess its \nsuitability?\n  The answer is quite unclear. The statement in this letter was: Google \npersonnel quickly manually review any videos that are flagged.\n\n  So I additionally ask: How does Google remove content that is deemed \nunsuitable for YouTube Kids and ensure that it continues to be \ninaccessible to YouTube Kids?\n  The answer from the letter is: The video is manually removed by \nGoogle employees. That is the automatic way of what is deemed \nunsuitable to ensure that it continues to be inaccessible.\n  So I ask: What policies and procedures govern how Google determines \nthe suitability of advertisements and whether they can appear on this \napp?\n  The answer is: Advertising must abide by three core principles which \ninclude that ads maintain an appropriate viewing environment, that they \nnot be based on data tracking, and that they are formatted to enable \nexclusive YouTube Kids control.\n  That is nice. How do we get those beer advertisements off of there?\n  Then I ask: What policies and procedures does Google use, if any, to \ndistinguish advertisements and paid content from unpaid content on \nYouTube Kids?\n  The answer is: Paid advertisements are clearly labeled.\n  We have constantly had this tension with any publication as to what \nis appropriate content. The movie industry years ago went through this \nwith the rating system. But now we are in the age of the Internet and, \nas such, it is ubiquitous and it is available to very small children \nwho want to know how to use a device that they see everybody else \nusing. On an application that is specifically designed for children, if \nwe allow this kind of stuff to go on, then where are our commonsense \nvalues? We don't want to be teaching a toddler about beer and wine and \nabout how to open a beer bottle with your teeth, and we certainly don't \nwant to be throwing out pictures such as these for toddlers to see. \nMaybe there is a time and place for that under parental discretion and \nguidance--but not available on an app for children.\n  I want to thank Google publicly for making a first step, but it is \nonly that. It is a first step. Since this is an app by Google for small \nchildren, Google has a responsibility. If there is a privilege of doing \nan app like this, then there must be accountability, and Google has to \naccept that responsibility to be accountable.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Madam President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act. I strongly urge my colleagues in \nthis body to vote for the NDAA and send it to the President's desk for \nsignature. Let's move to fund our military.\n  The threats to our Nation have never been greater or more complex in \nmy entire life. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \nI am given daily briefs of what I believe is an emerging global \nsecurity crisis.\n  This administration just completed a nuclear deal with Iran that \nstokes the fears of our friends and allies in the region and releases \ntens of billions of dollars in sanctions relief to a regime that is the \nworld's worst state sponsor of terrorism. We have had to bolster our \nsupport to allies in the region in an attempt to mitigate the impact of \nfurther Iranian spending to support Assad in Syria, the Houthi rebels \nin Yemen, Hezbollah, Hamas, and terrorism worldwide. We have seen the \nastonishing rise of ISIS as they have taken advantage of the power \nvacuum we left\n\n[[Page S7190]]\n\nbehind by prematurely withdrawing our troops from Iraq. I would hate to \nsee history repeat itself in Afghanistan, which is actually being \ndiscussed as we speak today.\n  Meanwhile, traditional rivals are aggressively posturing on two other \nfronts. China is antagonizing our allies in the Pacific Rim, and Russia \nis testing the resolve of our NATO alliance, blatantly grabbing \nsovereign territory in Ukraine, Crimea, and injecting troops and war \nmateriel into Syria.\n  At the same time we see an increase in symmetric and asymmetric \nthreats, we are headed in a direction where we are about to have the \nsmallest Army since World War II, the smallest Navy since World War I, \nand the smallest Air Force ever.\n  Meanwhile, the Chinese alone are rapidly expanding their investment \nin their military and their forces in the Asian Pacific region and are \nset to double their defense budget by 2020. As a matter of fact, I was \nrecently briefed at U.S. Pacific Command headquarters on the \ndevelopments of U.S. forces in the Asia-Pacific in comparison directly \nto those of China. This is very alarming. In 1999, the U.S. military \nhad a dominant and protective position in the Asia-Pacific and was \ntotally capable of protecting our interests in the region. Today, \nhowever, China has reached military parity in the region. What is \nreally troubling are the projections for 2020, however, in which \nChina's relative combat power and presence in the region will be \nsignificantly more dominant than that of the United States.\n  That is why we need to ensure that we continue funding our military \nat the appropriate level. We need to ensure that our brave service men \nand women have the tools, training, and technology they need to meet \nthe current threats we face on a daily basis but also to tackle what is \ncoming in the future.\n  This year's NDAA reinforces the mission against ISIS and Operation \nInherent Resolve. It provides assistance and sustainment to the \nmilitary and national security forces of Ukraine, including the \nauthority for lethal aid to Ukraine for defensive purposes. This NDAA \nfills critical gaps in readiness, ensuring that our service men and \nwomen meet their training requirements and have mission-capable \nequipment.\n  The convergence of our fiscal debt crisis and our global security \ncrisis is indeed a sobering reality, and they must be resolved \nsimultaneously. In order to have a strong foreign policy, we have to \nhave a strong military, and to have a strong military, we have to have \na strong economy. We have to solve our debt crisis at the same time \nthat we continue to dominate militarily.\n  As former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Mullen once said, \n``The most significant threat to our national security is our [Federal] \ndebt.'' That fact still rings true today.\n  Having recently visited our troops and military leaders in the Middle \nEast and the Asia-Pacific regions, I can tell you that the very best of \nAmerica is in uniform around the world in our military, putting their \nlives in jeopardy every day to protect our freedom here at home. Our \nmilitary is made up of some of the finest, smartest, and bravest people \nI have ever met. They are true American heroes committed to defending \nour freedom. They deserve our unwavering support.\n  One of the 6 reasons--only 6 reasons--why 13 Colonies came together \nin the beginning of our country to form this Nation, as enshrined in \nour Constitution, was to provide for the common defense. As George \nWashington said, ``To be prepared for war is one of the most effective \nmeans of preserving peace.'' Indeed, as we have learned over and over, \nmaintaining a strong national defense can actually deter aggression. We \nabsolutely must maintain a military force so strong that no enemy in \nits right mind would challenge us and those who dare have no hope in \ndefeating us.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 1:30 p.m. will be controlled \nby the Democratic manager or his designee and the time from 1:30 p.m. \nuntil 2 p.m. will be controlled by the chairman of the Committee on \nArmed Services or his designee.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise once again to speak about the \nfiscal year's national defense authorization conference report. \nYesterday I spoke at length about the OCO funding issue, and that, to \nme, is the most critical issue in the bill and one that has caused me \nto reluctantly not support the conference report. But this time I will \ndiscuss the conference report in its entirety.\n  Again, I would like to thank Chairman McCain, Chairman Thornberry, \nand Ranking Member Smith for a very thoughtful and cooperative process \nwhich allowed us to reach agreement on some very difficult issues. I \nalso thank in particular the staff of the House and Senate Armed \nServices Committees, who worked tirelessly over several months to \nresolve differences on over 800 different provisions.\n  As I stated yesterday, in many respects this is a good conference \nreport which supports our men and women in uniform and establishes many \nmuch needed reforms and, with the exception of the OCO position, would \nbe something that would have widespread support.\n  There are many provisions in the bill that are commendable. This \nconference report authorizes a 1.3-percent pay raise for servicemembers \nand reauthorizes a number of expiring bonuses and special pay \nauthorities to encourage enlistment, reenlistment, and continued \nservice by Active-Duty and Reserve component military personnel.\n  Significantly, it includes much needed reform of the military \nretirement system and brings the military retirement system into the \n21st century for a new generation of recruits.\n  It also deals with the need to begin to bring into better control \npersonnel costs at the Department of Defense because, as we all \nrecognize, there is a huge trendline of personnel costs that would \noutstrip at some point the training and equipment that are necessary to \nthe vitality and agility of the force.\n  One example is the pilot program to test approaches to the commissary \nand exchange system to see if there are ways in which that can be \nhandled more efficiently without preventing military personnel from \nenjoying that benefit they have earned.\n  The report also includes a commitment to seriously consider reforms \nto military health care in the coming year. All told, these personnel \nauthorities and reforms will serve tomorrow's servicemembers and their \nfamilies, and they will save the Department of Defense annually in its \ndiscretionary budget, allowing that funding to be reapplied to \nreadiness and modernization or even to maintaining a larger force.\n  The conference report includes roughly 60 provisions on acquisition \nreform. I commend in particular Chairman McCain for his efforts in this \narea. It is a long history and a proud history. He worked with Chairman \nLevin. Previously he has worked with so many others. He has made this a \npersonal area of not only concern but of notable action. The provisions \nwill help streamline acquisition processes, allow DOD to access \ncommercial and small businesses, and improve the acquisition workforce. \nThey build on the success of the reforms led by the chairman in the \nWeapons System Acquisition Reform Act of 2009.\n  The report also includes a number of provisions that will strengthen \nDOD's ability to develop next-generation technologies and weapons \nsystems and maintain our technological superiority on the battlefield. \nThe report strengthens the DOD laboratories and increases funding for \nuniversity research programs and STEM education. It also contains a \nnumber of provisions that will make it easier for the Pentagon to work \nwith high-tech small businesses, bringing their innovative ideas into \nthe defense industrial base.\n  With respect to cyber security, this report includes multiple \nprovisions, some of which I sponsored and all of which I support. These \ninclude a requirement for biannual whole-of-nation\n\n[[Page S7191]]\n\nexercises on responding to cyber attacks on critical infrastructure, \nindependent assessment of Cyber Command's ability to defend the Nation \nagainst cyber attack, comprehensive assessments of the cyber \nvulnerabilities of major weapons systems, and the provision of limited \nacquisition authorities to the commander of Cyber Command.\n  The conference report also has over $400 million in additional \nreadiness funding for the military services--across all branches: \nActive, Guard, and Reserve. It fully authorizes the programs for \nmodernizing our nuclear triad of sea, ground, and airborne platforms. \nThere are also specific recommendations on many procurement programs \nthat will help the Department improve management and cope with \nshortfalls. All of these provisions will ensure that our military \npersonnel have the equipment and training they need to succeed in their \nmission.\n  For the various overseas challenges facing the United States, and \nthey are considerable, this conference report provides key funding and \nauthority for two major U.S.-led coalition operations: the mission in \nAfghanistan and the counter-ISIS coalition in Iraq and Syria. It also \nincludes additional funding for initiatives to expand the U.S. military \npresence and exercises in Eastern Europe, reassuring allies and \ncountering the threat of Russian hybrid warfare tactics, and authorizes \nadditional military assistance, including lethal assistance for \nUkraine. I had the privilege of visiting Ukraine recently and being \nwith the paratroopers of the 172nd Airborne Brigade who are training \nUkrainian forces. They are doing a commendable job and it represents a \ntangible commitment by the United States to support friends across the \nglobe.\n  The conference report also includes, very notably and very \nimportantly, the Senate provisions codifying the current policy that \ninterrogations of detainees in the custody of any U.S. Government \nagency or department must comply with the Army Field Manual on \nInterrogation. These provisions, sponsored by Senator McCain, Senator \nFeinstein, and I, will ensure that detainee interrogations are \nconducted using noncoercive techniques that do not involve the threat \nor use of force, consistent with our values as a nation. I know how \nimportant this was, particularly to Chairman McCain and Senator \nFeinstein. It represents our best values and also from the testimony we \nhave heard over many years, the most effective way to obtain \ninformation in circumstances as we have witnessed in the last few \nyears.\n  All of these provisions are commendable. They are the result of \nsignificant effort by Chairman McCain, Chairman Thornberry, Ranking \nMember Smith, and the staff who worked tirelessly. However, there are \nprovisions that do in fact cause some concern. Let me first talk about \nthe issue of Guantanamo Bay. The report continues the restrictions on \nthe President's authorities relating to the Guantanamo detention \nfacility.\n  In previous Defense authorization bills, we had made progress in \ngiving the President greater flexibility in streamlining the process of \nmaking transfers from Guantanamo to other locations, bringing us closer \nto the goal of closing Guantanamo. The Guantanamo provisions in this \nyear's conference report, however, are in a sense a step backward. They \ncontinue to maintain the prohibitions on the transfer of Guantanamo \ndetainees to the United States and on the construction or modification \nof a facility in the United States to hold such detainees.\n  This deprives the President of a key tool for fighting terrorism, the \nability to prosecute Guantanamo detainees in Federal court. To make \nmatters more complicated, the conference report proposes additional \nhurdles on the transfer of Guantanamo detainees overseas, requiring the \nSecretary of Defense to complete a checklist of certifications for \noverseas transfers and prohibiting such transfers to certain specified \ncountries altogether.\n  Further, the conference report does not include a provision from the \nSenate bill that authorized the temporary transfer of Guantanamo \ndetainees to the United States for medical reasons in the event of \nlife-threatening emergencies. As the Guantanamo detainees get older, \nthere is an increasing risk of a detainee suffering serious harm or \ndeath because the military is legally prohibited from bringing that \nperson to the United States to receive necessary medical care.\n  Both President Bush and President Obama have called for closing \nGuantanamo Bay. Our military leaders have repeatedly said that \nGuantanamo harms our national security and serves as a propaganda and \nrecruiting tool for terrorists. This is an issue we have been wrestling \nwith for over a decade, and I regret that we are no closer to resolving \nit with this conference report.\n  This conference report also does not contain many of the cost-saving \nproposals that the Department of Defense requested. For example, the \nretirement of many aging aircraft and ships is prohibited and a BRAC \nround was not ever considered. Without such authorities, we in Congress \nare making it even more difficult for the Department of Defense to \nacquire and maintain the things they need because we are forcing them \nto keep what they consider no longer cost- or mission-effective.\n\n  Finally, as I have said it many times consistently throughout this \nprocess, the one item that I find is most objectionable, and indeed \nreluctantly forced me to argue against the conference report, is the \nfact that it shifts $38 billion requested by the President in the base \nmilitary budget, in the routine base budget--it shifts it to the \nOverseas Contingency Operations account or OCO.\n  Essentially, it skirts the BCA. This transfer from base to OCO raises \nseveral concerns. First, it violates the consensus that was agreed to \nwhen we passed the BCA that both defense discretionary spending and \ndomestic discretionary spending would be treated equally. Now, we find \na way to avoid that consensus. In fact, that was one of the premises \nmany of us found persuasive enough to support the BCA, but the concerns \nthat are raised are many.\n  First, adding funds to OCO does not solve--it actually complicates--\nthe Department of Defense's budgetary problems. Defense budgeting needs \nto be based on our long-term military strategy, which requires DOD to \nfocus at least 5 years into the future. A 1-year plus-up to OCO does \nnot provide DOD with the certainty and stability it needs when building \nits 5-year budget. This instability undermines the morale of our troops \nand their families who want to know their futures are planned for more \nthan 1 year at a time and the confidence of our defense industry \npartners that we rely on to provide the best technology available to \nour troops.\n  Second, the transfer does not provide additional funds for many of \nthe domestic agencies which are also critical to our national security. \nWe cannot defend our homeland without the FBI. In fact, we just heard \nreports today of FBI activities disrupting a potential smuggling of \nnuclear material in Eastern European, headed--the suggestion is--toward \nISIL or other radical elements. We need the FBI. Yet they remain \nsubject to the Budget Control Act.\n  We need to fund the Justice Department, other aspects of their \nactivities, the TSA, Customs and Border Protection, and the Coast \nGuard. These later agencies are funded through the Department of \nHomeland Security. Without adequate support for the State Department, \nthe danger to our troops increases. In addition, failing to provide BCA \ncap relief to non-DOD departments and agencies would also shortchange \nveterans who receive employment services, transition assistance, and \nhousing and homeless support.\n  Third, moving funding from the base budget to OCO has no impact on \nreducing the deficit. OCO and emergency funding are outside the budget \ncaps for a reason; they are for the costs of ongoing military \noperations or to respond to unforeseen events, such as the flooding we \nare witnessing in South Carolina. To transfer funds for known day-to-\nday operations into war and emergency funding accounts to skirt the law \nis not fiscally responsible or honest accounting.\n  The OCO was designed for the contingencies that were non-routine and \nwould not be recurring. In fact, we have seen OCO funds go up \ndramatically as our commitments both in Afghanistan and Iraq went up \nand then go down as you would expect. Suddenly that curve is beginning \nto shift up and go up, not because of the increased\n\n[[Page S7192]]\n\nnumber of military personnel deployed--in fact, there are fewer \nmilitary personnel deployed in these areas today--but because we have \nfound a way--at least we think we have found a way--to move around the \nBCA for defense and defense alone.\n  Many have argued: Well, that might be true, but this is not the place \nto talk about this issue. I disagree. This is not a debate about which \nappropriations account we put the money in; it is a fundamental debate \nabout how we intend to fund the workings of the government today and in \nthe future, all parts of the government, because if we can use this \ntechnique for defense, it, frankly and honestly, relieves the pressure \nto take the constraints off other agencies. It sets the whole table, if \nyou will, for our budget for every Federal agency.\n  So this is not a narrow issue of appropriations, whether it is the \ncommittee on housing and urban development or the committee on interior \nand environment; this is a fundamental issue. The BCA is a statute, not \nan appropriations bill, per se. It came to us as an independent \nstatute. We have a responsibility to respond to the challenge it poses \nto the defense budget and to every other budget.\n  This is just not a 1-year fix. If this were a bridge that we knew \nwould take us from this year to next year, well, we might do these \nthings in a different way. Unfortunately I think this conference report \nis going to be replicated in the future, because if we rely on this \napproach this year, there is huge pressure next year to do the same \nthing, unless we can resolve the underlying problems of the Budget \nControl Act.\n  I believe it is essential for us to do this for the best interests of \nour country, for the best interests of our military personnel. I don't \nthink by standing up and casting a vote in this light we are \ndisrespecting or not recognizing the men and women who wear the uniform \nof the United States. In fact, it has not been uncommon over the years \nthat because of issues, this bill has been objected to by both sides.\n  Indeed, since 2005 my colleagues on the Republican side have cast \nvotes against cloture on the NDAA 10 times and successfully blocked \ncloture 4 times over such issues as Senate rules and procedures, the \nrepeal of don't ask, don't tell, and in one case gasoline prices. So to \nargue today that the only reason we should vote for this bill is \nbecause it is procedurally not appropriate to discuss this, well, was \nit procedurally appropriate to use the Defense bill to essentially \nregister anguish about gasoline prices?\n  This goes to the heart not just of this bill but every bill. \nTherefore, I don't think it is something we have to shy away from. In \nfact, I think we have to take it on. If we cannot fix this Budget \nControl Act straightjacket we are in, it will harm our national \nsecurity. If we don't have the FBI agents out there trying to disrupt \nsmuggling of uranium and other fissile materials, that hurts us. It \nhurts our national security. If we don't have the Department of Energy \nlaboratories that are capable of doing research, helping us and working \nwith foreign governments about detection of radioactive material, that \nhurts our national security. This is about national security, and I \nthink we have to consider it in that light.\n\n  So we are here today, and we are dealing with an issue of the \nauthorization act in the context of the continuing resolution because \nwe have not resolved the Budget Control Act. These are all roads coming \ntogether: the conference report, the continuing resolution, all of them \nin the context of trying to respond to the Budget Control Act. I think \nwe should step up and deal with the Budget Control Act.\n  We have had many months to try to find the answer. We haven't. When \nwe considered this legislation previously in the Senate, it was summer \ntime, and it appeared that there might be a coming together on a \nbipartisan basis and a thoughtful basis, trying to provide the relief \nso we wouldn't have to rely on OCO when the conference report arrived, \nbut we are here today and OCO is still staring us right in the face.\n  I think we have to ensure that we stand and say that is not the way \nwe want to go forward for the defense of our country in the broadest \ncontext and for the support of our military personnel.\n  There is one other issue I do wish to raise, too, because it has been \nbrought up; that is, the suggestion that if this bill does not pass \ntoday, then our military will not receive their pay raises and bonuses. \nThe provisions in this bill go into effect January 1, 2016. We still \nhave time. I would hope we would use that time not only to make some \nchanges--technical here and there--but also to deal with the central \nissue which I hope we all agree is driving everything; that is, fixing \nthe Budget Control Act in a way that we can provide across-the-board \nsupport for our Federal agencies, particularly our national security \nagencies which go beyond simply the Department of Defense.\n  I think the time is now. This is a moment to deal with the issue, not \ndefer it and hope something happens in the future. We have to resolve \nthe Budget Control Act.\n  I urge, for that reason as much as anything, that my colleagues would \nvote against this conference report as an important step in the process \nand a necessary step, in my view, in the process of resolving the great \nbudget crisis we face in terms of the Budget Control Act.\n  In fact, one of my concerns is that if we do in fact pass this \nconference report and it subsequently becomes law or just the simple \nfact that we pass it, it gives some people the excuse of saying: Well, \nwe have fixed the only problem that we think is of some significant \nconcern, the Department of Defense, so we don't have to do anything \nelse.\n  Again, we have to fund the FBI, we have to fund Homeland Security, \nand we have to fund a vigorous State Department. All of those agencies, \nif we do nothing on BCA, will see sequestration arise, diminish their \ncapacity, and in some way diminish our national security.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, in about half an hour, the Senate \nwill vote on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2016, and I hope that an overwhelming majority of my colleagues will \nunderstand the importance of this legislation in these very turbulent \nand difficult times.\n  The Constitution gives the Congress the power and the responsibility \nto provide for the common defense, raise and support armies, provide \nand maintain a navy, and make rules for the government and regulation \nof the land and naval forces. For 53 years, Congress has fulfilled its \nmost important constitutional duties by passing the National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  It is precisely because of this legislation's critical importance to \nour national security that it is still one of the few bills in Congress \nthat enjoys bipartisan support year after year.\n  Indeed, this year's NDAA has been supported by Senators on both sides \nof the aisle. The Senate Committee on Armed Services overwhelmingly \napproved the NDAA in a 22-to-4 vote back in May. The full Senate \nfollowed by passing the NDAA in a partisan vote of 71 to 25.\n  In recent weeks, some of my Democratic colleagues and the President \nhave threatened to block this legislation because of disagreements \nabout broader spending issues that are totally unrelated to defense and \ntotally unrelated to authorizing. Everything to do with their problems \nhas to do with appropriations spending, not authorization.\n  The President made it clear that he will ``not fix defense without \nfixing nondefense spending.'' In this day of multiple crises around the \nworld--as these crises and wars and conflicts and refugees unfold--the \nPresident's priority seems to be the funding mechanism, which has \nnothing to do with the defense authorization.\n  Henry Kissinger, as well as many of our most respected national \nsecurity leaders, has called it the most diverse and complex array of \ncrises around the world since the end of World War II, and there are \nmore refugees in the world than at any time since World War II.\n\n[[Page S7193]]\n\n  The President is threatening to veto this legislation, which contains \nvital authorities--not just authorities but the ability of our men and \nwomen who are serving in uniform to defend this Nation--so he can prove \na political point. The President is threatening to veto this bill to \ndefend the Nation in order to prove a political point.\n  As I mentioned, the threats we confront today are far more serious \nthan they were a year ago and significantly more so than when the \nCongress passed the Budget Control Act in 2011. That legislation \narbitrarily capped defense spending and established the mindless \nmechanism of sequestration. As a result, with worldwide threats rising, \nwe as a nation are on a course to cut nearly $1 trillion of defense \nspending over 10 years with no strategic or military rationale \nwhatsoever for doing so.\n  Every single military and national security leader who has testified \nbefore the Committee on Armed Services this year has denounced \nsequestration and urged its repeal as soon as possible. Indeed, each of \nour military service chiefs testified that continued defense spending \nat sequestration levels would put American lives at risk--I repeat: \nwould put American lives at risk.\n  Unfortunately, the Defense bill does not end sequestration. Believe \nme, if the Defense bill were capable of that, I would have done all in \nmy power to make it happen. But the simple reality is that this \nlegislation cannot end sequestration and it cannot fix the Budget \nControl Act.\n  This legislation does not spend a dollar. It is not an appropriations \nbill; it is a policy bill. It provides the Department of Defense and \nour men and women in uniform with the authorities and support they need \nto defend the Nation.\n  This legislation fully supports Presidents Obama's request of $612 \nbillion for national defense. Let me repeat that. The legislation gives \nthe President every dollar of budget authority he requested. Yet the \nPresident and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nthreatening to oppose this bill because it authorizes--not spends--$38 \nbillion in funding for readiness and training of our troops in the \noverseas contingency operations, known as the OCO account.\n  Democrats believe that by placing these funds in the OCO account, the \nlegislation would minimize the harm sequestration would do to our \nmilitary but fail to do the same for domestic spending programs. This \ncomplaint fails to understand a basic fact: The only legislation that \ncan stop sequestration, whether for defense or nondefense, is an \nappropriations bill. In fact, Republicans and Democrats are engaged \nright now in negotiations to find a bipartisan budget deal that would \nprovide sequestration relief. I hope they succeed. But the idea that \nthe precise location in the NDAA of certain funds for our troops will \nhave any impact on the substance or outcome of these negotiations is \nludicrous.\n  The choice we faced was between OCO money and no money. When I have \nasked senior military leaders before the Armed Services Committee which \nof those options they would choose, they have said they would take the \nOCO. So do I.\n  With global threats rising, it simply makes no sense to oppose a \ndefense policy bill--legislation that spends no money but is full of \nvital authorities that our troops need and need badly--for a reason \nthat has nothing to do with national defense spending, and it certainly \nmakes no sense when the negotiations that matter to fixing \nsequestration are happening right now. That is where the President and \nSenate Democrats should be focusing their energy, not on blocking the \nDefense bill and denying our men and women in uniform the authorities \nand support they need to defend the Nation. Unfortunately, that has not \nbeen the case. In fact, the White House has doubled down and vowed that \nthe President will veto this legislation.\n  So let's be clear. The President isn't threatening to veto because of \nthe existence of an overseas contingency account, which the Pentagon \nhas been using for years--for years--to fund everything from readiness \nand training for our troops to Israeli missile defense, all without a \nword of protest from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle or a \nveto threat from the President. This veto threat is about one thing and \none thing only, and that is one word: politics.\n  The President wants to take a stand for greater domestic spending, \nand he wants to use the vital authorities and support the men and women \nin uniform need to defend the Nation as leverage. At a time of \nincreasing threats to our Nation, this is foolish, misguided, cynical, \nand dangerous. Vetoing this legislation will not solve the spending \ndebate happening right now in Washington. That is something which can \nonly be done through the appropriations process--not a defense \nauthorization bill, not a defense policy bill. Vetoing the NDAA will \nnot solve sequestration. Vetoing the NDAA will not solve the Budget \nControl Act. Rather than fixing the Budget Control Act, vetoing the \nNDAA would repeat its original sin by continuing the disturbing trend \nof holding our military men and women hostage to the whims of our \ndysfunctional politics.\n  So let's be absolutely clear on what a vote against or a veto of this \nlegislation really means. This is what it really means, my friends. If \nyou say no, you will be saying no to urgent steps to address critical \nshortfalls in fighter aircraft across our military. You will block 12 \nF-18 Super Hornets for the Navy and 6 F-35Bs for the Marine Corps.\n  If you say no, you will be saying no to $1 billion in accelerated \nNavy shipbuilding, including an additional Arleigh Burke-class \ndestroyer.\n  If you say no, you will be saying no to upgrades to Army combat \nvehicles deploying to Europe to deter Russian aggression against our \nallies.\n  If you say no to this legislation, you will be saying no to $200 \nmillion to strengthen our cyber defenses as China, Russia, Iran, and \nNorth Korea attack our government and our companies relentlessly and \nwith impunity.\n  If you say no to the NDAA, you will be saying no to significant steps \nto improve the quality of life of the men and women serving in the All-\nVolunteer Force and the needs of our wounded, ill, and injured \nservicemembers.\n  If you say no to the NDAA, you will be saying no to over 30 special \npays and bonuses that are vital to recruiting and retaining military \ndoctors, nurses, nuclear engineers, and language experts.\n  If you say no to the NDAA, you will be saying no to greater access to \nurgent care facilities for military families and steps taken in the \nbill to make military health care plans more portable.\n  If you say no to the NDAA, you will be saying no to making it easier \nfor our veterans to get the medicines they need. You will be saying no \nto the provision in this legislation that would ensure that \nservicemembers are able to get the same medicines for pain and other \nconditions when they transition from the Department of Defense to the \nVeterans' Administration.\n  If you say no to the NDAA, you will be saying no to new steps to \nimprove sexual assault prevention and response. You will be saying no \nto additional tools to enhance support of victims of sexual assault, \nincluding needed protections to end retaliation against those who \nreport sex-related offenses or who intervene to support victims. You \nwill be saying no to provisions that strengthen and protect the \nauthority and independence of the special victims' counsel for sexual \nabuse.\n  If you say no to the NDAA, you will be saying no to some of the most \nsignificant reforms to the Department of Defense in a generation. You \nwill be saying no to the modernization of an outdated, 70-year-old \nmilitary retirement system--a system that excludes 83 percent of all \nthose who serve in the military from receiving any retirement assets \nwhatsoever, including veterans of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, some \nof whom have served two, three, four tours of duty but left the \nmilitary with nothing because they retired before reaching 20 years of \nservice.\n  If you say no to the NDAA, you will be saying no to a modern military \nretirement system that would extend better, more flexible retirement \nbenefits to more than 80 percent of servicemembers; a system that would \ngive servicemembers the choice to use a portion of their retirement \nbenefits when they leave the military to help them transition to a new \ncareer, start a business, buy a home, or send their kids to college; a \nnew system that not only improves life for our servicemembers and \nfuture retirees but does so while also saving the taxpayers $12 billion \nonce it is fully implemented.\n\n[[Page S7194]]\n\n  If you say no to the NDAA, you will also be saying no to the most \nsweeping reforms to our defense acquisition system in 30 years. You \nwill be saying no to reforms that are essential to preserving our \nmilitary technological superiority as our adversaries develop and field \nmore advanced weapons. You will be saying no to reforms that would hold \nPentagon leaders more accountable for the decisions they make. You will \nbe saying no to reforms that would improve the relationship between the \nPentagon and our Nation's innovators, helping to ensure that our \nmilitary can gain access to the most cutting-edge technologies.\n  If you say no to the NDAA, you will be saying no to significant \nreforms to defense management. A ``no'' vote is a vote to stand in the \nway of important steps to reduce the amount of money the Department of \nDefense spends on bureaucracy and overhead, even as it cuts Army \nsoldiers, Air Force fighter aircraft, and Navy ships. A ``no'' vote is \nalso a vote to continue a backwards personnel system that judges our \nPentagon's civilians not based on their talent but their time served.\n  If you say no to the NDAA, you will squander a historic opportunity \nto ban torture once and for all, to achieve a reform that many of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle--especially the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein--have sought for a decade or more: making \nthe Army Field Manual the uniform interrogation standard for the entire \nU.S. Government. Voting no will squander an opportunity to stand up for \nthe values that Americans have embraced for generations, while still \nenabling our interrogators to extract critical intelligence from our \nenemies. By vetoing legislation that bans torture forever, the \nPresident would be vetoing his own legacy. Worst of all, if you say no \nto the NDAA, you are saying no to vital authorities in support that our \nArmed Forces need to defend our Nation as we confront the most diverse \nand complex array of crises in over 70 years.\n\n  As we speak, there are nearly 10,000 American troops in Afghanistan \nhelping a new Afghan Government to secure the country and defeat our \ncommon terrorist enemies. But since President Obama hailed the end of \ncombat operations in Afghanistan last year, ISIL has arrived on the \nbattlefield and Taliban fighters have launched a major offensive to \ntake territory across the country.\n  So what message would it send if the President and some of my \ncolleagues say no to $3.8 billion for the Afghan Security Forces to \nfight back against terrorists that wish to destroy the progress \nachieved at so costly a sacrifice?\n  In the Asia-Pacific region, China's military buildup continues with a \nfocus on countering and thwarting U.S. power projection. At the same \ntime, China is asserting vast territorial claims in the East and South \nChina Seas. Most recently, China has reclaimed nearly 3,000 acres of \nland in the South China Sea and is rapidly militarizing these features, \nbuilding at least three airstrips to support military aircraft. With \nthe addition of surface-to-air missiles and radars, these new land \nfeatures could enable China to declare and enforce an air defense \nidentification zone in the South China Sea and to hold that vital \nregion at greater risk. Our allies and partners throughout the region \nare alarmed by China's behavior and are looking to the United States \nfor leadership.\n  So what message would it send if the President and some of my \ncolleagues say no to $50 million to assist and train our allies in the \nregion to increase maritime security in the maritime domain awareness \nin the South China Sea?\n  Last year, Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine and annexation of \nCrimea forced us to recognize that we are confronting a challenge that \nmany had assumed was resigned to the history books--a strong, \nmilitarily-capable Russia that is hostile to our interests and our \nvalues and seeks to challenge the international order that American \nleaders of both parties have sought to maintain since the end of World \nWar II. Russia continues to destabilize Ukraine and menace our NATO \nallies in Europe with aggressive military behavior. And now, in a \nprofound echo of the Cold War, Mr. Putin has deployed troops and tanks \nand combat aircraft to Syria, and they are conducting operations as we \nspeak to shore up the Assad regime--the Assad regime--which has \nslaughtered 240,000 of its citizens and driven millions into refugee \nstatus. And who are Mr. Putin's forces bombing most of all? ISIL? No. \nModerate opposition groups backed, trained, and equipped by the United \nStates of America.\n  So what message would it send if the President and some of my \ncolleagues say no to $300 million in security assistance for Ukraine to \ndefend its sovereign territory, say no to $400 million in lethality \nupgrades to U.S. Army combat vehicles deploying to Europe to deter \nRussian aggression, and say no to $800 million for the President's own \nEuropean Reassurance Initiative, which seeks to reassure allies of \nAmerica's commitment to their security and the integrity of the NATO \nAlliance?\n  In the Middle East, a terrorist army with tens of thousands of \nfighters has taken over a vast swath of territory and declared an \nIslamic State in the heart of one of the most strategically important \nparts of the world. Yet more than a year after the President declared \nthat we would degrade and destroy ISIL, it appears that nothing we are \ncurrently doing is proving sufficient to achieve that strategic \nobjective. The United States and our partners do not have the \ninitiative. ISIL does, and it is capitalizing on our inadequate policy \nto maintain and enhance our initiative, as they have for the past 4 \nyears. Indeed, the situation on the ground is now taking yet another \ndramatic turn for the worse, as several recent events have made clear.\n  So what message would it send if the President and some of my \ncolleagues say no to $1.1 billion of security assistance and \ncooperation for our allies in the region to help us fight ISIL? What \nmessage would it send to our ally Israel to say no to hundreds of \nmillions of dollars of vital support for our common efforts in missile \ndefense and countering terrorist tunnels? These capabilities are more \nimportant than ever for Israel and the United States in the wake of the \nPresident's nuclear agreement with Iran, and this legislation fully \nauthorizes those programs. Saying no to the NDAA means saying no to \nthis vital security cooperation with Israel.\n  For 4 years, Bashar al-Assad has waged war on the Syrian people. The \nUnited States has stood idly by as well over 230,000 have been killed, \n1 million injured, 8 million displaced, and 4 million forced to seek \nrefuge abroad. The Syrian conflict has now created the largest refugee \ncrisis in Europe since World War II. Now Russia has stepped in to prop \nup the murderous regime and kill more Syrians. With Syria descending \ndeeper into chaos, and the world more unstable than ever, what message \nwould it send if the Commander in Chief and some of my colleagues see \nthis as a good time to say no to the National Defense Authorization \nAct?\n  This is the same conclusion that some of the major military service \norganizations have also reached, and they have written open letters to \nthe President urging him not to veto the NDAA. Their message should be \nheeded by all of my colleagues as we prepare to cast our votes. The \nMilitary Officers Association of America wrote:\n\n       [T]he fact is that we are still a nation at war, and this \n     legislation is vital to fulfilling wartime requirements. With \n     multiple contentious issues remaining for Congress to tackle \n     this year, and very little legislative time to complete those \n     crucial actions, this is not the time to add the already \n     extremely daunting burden of legislative challenges by \n     vetoing the defense authorization bill.\n\n  The Reserve Officers Association wrote:\n\n       [The NDAA] contains crucial provisions for the military, \n     nation's security, and the welfare of those who serve. [The \n     Reserve Officers Association] has a membership of 50,000 \n     former and currently serving officers and noncommissioned \n     officers [and] represents all the uniformed services of the \n     United States who would be favorably affected by your signing \n     this bill into law.\n\n  I also want to read from a recent Washington Post editorial:\n\n       American Presidents rarely veto national defense \n     authorization bills, since they are, well, vital to national \n     security. . . . Refusing to sign this bill would make \n     history, but not in a good way. Mr. Obama should let it \n     become law and seek other sources of leverage in pursuing his \n     legitimate goals for domestic sequestration relief.\n\n  Time and again, President Obama has failed to do the right thing when \nit\n\n[[Page S7195]]\n\ncould matter most--in Afghanistan, in the Pacific, in Ukraine, in Iraq, \nand in Syria. Vetoing the NDAA would be yet another of these failures, \nand it would be reminiscent of a bygone day, when the fecklessness of \nthose days were so accurately described by Winston Churchill. On the \nfloor of the House of Commons, he said:\n\n       When the situation was manageable it was neglected, and now \n     that it is thoroughly out of hand we apply too late the \n     remedies which then might have effected a cure. There is \n     nothing new in the story. It is as old as the sibylline \n     books. It falls into that long, dismal catalogue of the \n     fruitlessness of experience and the confirmed unteachability \n     of mankind. Want of foresight, unwillingness to act when \n     action would be simple and effective, lack of clear thinking, \n     confusion of counsel until the emergency comes, until self-\n     preservation strikes its jarring gong--these are the features \n     which constitute the endless repetition of history.\n\n  My colleagues, for 53 years Congress has passed a National Defense \nAuthorization Act, and at perhaps no time in the past half century has \nthis legislation been more important. Everywhere we look around the \nworld there are reminders of exactly why we need this National Defense \nAuthorization Act. I understand the deeply held beliefs of many of my \ncolleagues about the spending issues that have divided the Congress for \nthe last 4 years. But this is not a spending bill. It is a policy bill. \nIt is a reform bill. It is a bill that accomplishes what the \nConstitution demands of us and what the American people expect of us. \nIt is a bill that gives our men and women in uniform, many of whom are \nstill in harm's way around the world today, the vital authorities and \nsupport they need to defend our Nation. And it is a bill that deserves \nthe support of the Senate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the bill before us is not fiscally \nresponsible. Our troops deserve real funding, not budget gimmickry. \nThis bill does not do the job. My Republican friends like to talk about \nthe deficit and the debt and the need to get our fiscal house in order, \nbut their actions speak louder than their words. Now they are \nsupporting legislation that increases deficit spending and increases \nthe burden on our children and grandchildren. As a result, this bill \nviolates the budget law.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending measure \nviolates section 3101 of S. Con. Res. 11, the concurrent resolution on \nthe budget for fiscal year 2016.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of \napplicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections \nof that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 1735, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 96, \nH.R. 2028.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 96, H.R. 2028, a bill \n     making appropriations for energy and water development and \n     related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2016, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                       Trans-Pacific Partnership\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the recent \ndevelopments in U.S. trade policy and their implications for the \nfuture. Over this past weekend, officials from the Obama \nadministration, along with 11 other countries, reached what they \nbelieved will be the final agreement on the terms of the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership or TPP.\n\n[[Page S7196]]\n\nIf enacted, the TPP would be the largest trade agreement in history, \nencompassing approximately and roughly 40 percent of the world economy \nand setting standards for one of the most dynamic parts of the world, \nthe Asia-Pacific.\n  I will repeat what I have said many times before. I believe a strong \nTPP agreement is essential for advancing our Nation's economic and \nstrategic interests in the Asia-Pacific region. However, while I have \noften touted the potential benefits of the TPP, I have also been very \nclear that I will not support just any TPP agreement. The United States \nhas only one chance to negotiate, consider, and implement the TPP. We \nhave to get it right. Under our system of government, both the \nexecutive and legislative branches play essential roles in developing \nand implementing our trade policy.\n  While the administration has the power to reach agreements with other \ncountries, no such agreement can go into force without Congress's \napproval. Congress is not just a rubberstamp in this process. We have \nan obligation to evaluate every trade agreement and determine if it \nadvances our Nation's interests and serves the needs of our \nconstituents. Toward that end, as I continue to review the deal that \nwas struck in Atlanta, three important considerations will determine \nwhether I can support this agreement.\n  First, the deal must be balanced to meet the U.S. negotiating \nobjectives established under our trade promotion authority or TPA \nstatute which Congress passed earlier this year with strong bipartisan \nmajorities in both the House and the Senate. Second, I must have \nconfidence that our trading partners will actually live up to the \ncommitments they have made under the agreement by implementing the \nterms and obligations included in the deal. Third, the agreement must \nbe subjected to a thorough and rigorous congressional review, including \nindepth consultation with the administration.\n  Before I talk about these factors in more detail, I want to \nacknowledge the many years of hard work officials in the \nadministration, particularly those at the office of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, have put in to get the agreement this far. I \nparticularly want to acknowledge the hard work of the lead negotiators \nat USTR who have sacrificed for years to bring this agreement to \nconclusion. I also want to acknowledge that over time they made a great \ndeal of progress on a variety of fronts, but now that the \nadministration says it has reached an agreement, it is time for \nCongress to intensify its review of TPP.\n  The primary standards by which I--and I would hope all of my \ncolleagues--will judge this trade agreement are set forth clearly in \nour TPA statute. As one of the original authors of the current TPA law, \nI worked hard to ensure that it did not just represent my priorities \nfor trade agreements but those of a bipartisan majority in both the \nHouse and the Senate.\n  The congressional negotiating objectives that we included in the \nstatute spell out in detail what must be included in a trade agreement \nin order for it to get Congress's approval. The negotiating objectives \nwe included in our TPA law are not just pro forma, they are not \nsuggestions or mere statements of Members' preferences. They represent \nthe view of the bipartisan majority in Congress as to the rights and \nobligations a trade agreement must contain when it is finalized and \nsubmitted for our consideration.\n  I have to say no one in Congress worked harder and longer than I did \nto get that TPA bill across the finish line. I was joined by many of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle who put in significant time and \neffort as we drafted the bill, got it through the committee, and passed \nit on the floor. In fact, if you will recall, in the Senate we ended up \nhaving to pass it twice.\n  Since the day we passed the bill, I, as well as many of my colleagues \nin both the House and Senate, have been urging officials and the \nadministration to do all they can to conclude a TPP agreement that a \nmajority in Congress can support. Unfortunately, when we look at some \nof the outcomes of the final round of negotiations, it is not clear if \nthe administration achieved that goal.\n  For example, it is not immediately apparent whether the agreement \ncontains administrable and enforceable provisions to protect \nintellectual property rights similar to those found in U.S. law. As you \nwill recall, this was a key negotiating objective that we included in \nour TPA law and a necessary component if we want our trade agreements \nto advance our Nation's interests in the 21st century economy.\n  I have serious concerns as to whether the administration did enough \nto accomplish this objective. This is particularly true with the \nprovisions that govern data exclusivity for biologics. As you know, \nbiologics are formulas that are on the cutting edge of medicine and \nhave transformed major elements of the health care landscape, thanks in \nlarge part to the effort and investment of American companies. I might \nadd, it is one of the principal industries where we might not only be \nable to find treatments but also cures. It is one of the three or four \nthings that I think can bring down health care costs immeasurably.\n  I am not one to argue that parties to a negotiation should refuse to \ncompromise. In fact, I have come to the floor many times over the years \nand espoused, sometimes at great lengths, the merits of being able to \nfind a compromise. But--and this is an important point--a good \ncompromise usually results in something of greater overall value for \nall the parties involved, and, at least according to the information \nnow available, it is unclear whether this administration achieved that \nkind of an outcome for American innovators.\n\n  Aside from biologics, there are other elements that, according to \ninitial reports, may have fallen short of Congress's negotiating \nstandards. For example, there are issues with some of the market-access \nprovisions on agriculture, the inclusion of product--and sector-\nspecific carveouts from some of the obligations, as well as some \npotential of overreaching on labor commitments. While we can't make \nfinal determinations on any of these issues without seeing the final \ntext of the agreement, initial indications are that these items could \nbe problematic when the agreement is submitted to Congress for \napproval.\n  In the end, Congress will need to take a good look at the entire \nagreement and judge whether the agreement satisfies the standards we \nhave put forward in our TPA law.\n  Beyond the negotiating objectives, we need to have confidence that \nkey elements of a TPP agreement will be implemented and respected by \nour trading partners. There are a number of important elements to \nconsider when we talk about enforcement and implementation but, for \nnow, I will speak once again about the intellectual property rights.\n  For too long--indeed, for decades now--American innovators and \ninvestors haven't been able to take full advantage of our trade \nagreements because, quite simply, many of our trading partners either \nrefuse to enforce intellectual property obligations or fail to \nimplement them all together. All too often, this administration has \nlooked the other way as other countries steal U.S. innovation and \nintellectual property.\n  If countries want to trade with the United States, we should demand \nthat they respect and enforce the intellectual property rights of \nAmerican businesses and individuals. That means including strong \nprovisions protecting intellectual property in our trade agreements and \na requirement that intellectual property rights commitments be \nimplemented before allowing the agreement to enter into force for our \ntrading partners.\n  Unfortunately, implementation of these types of commitments is one \narea where this administration has come up short in the past. Before \nCongress can approve an agreement as vast as the TPP, we need to be \nsure this has changed. We need to have detailed assurances that our \ntrading partners will live up to all of their commitments and a clear \nroadmap as to how the administration intends to hold them accountable.\n  Finally, I expect that pursuant to both the letter and the spirit of \nTPA, the administration will communicate and work closely with Congress \nover the coming weeks and months. In the short term, that means deep \nand meaningful consultations before the President signs the agreement.\n\n[[Page S7197]]\n\n  Under our TPA law, the President must inform Congress of his intent \nto sign an agreement at least 90 days before doing so. This period is \nan essential part of congressional consideration of the deal. Congress \nreserved this time in the statute to ensure that we would have ample \nopportunity to review the content of a trade agreement before it is \nsigned by the President.\n  In order for that review to take place, Congress must have access to \nthe full text of the agreement, including annexes and any side \nagreements, before the President provides his 90-day notice. This is a \nvital element of TPA. The law was designed specifically to give \nCongress all the necessary tools to conduct an exhaustive evaluation of \nany and all trade agreements and to ensure that the administration is \nfully accountable both to Congress and to the public.\n  There are a number of provisions and timelines in the law that help \nus achieve these goals. I will not list them all on the floor today. \nInstead, I will just say that I expect the full cooperation of the \nadministration in meeting all of these mandates.\n  The American people demand no less. There are no shortcuts. Let's be \nclear. Our Nation could clearly benefit from a strong TPP agreement, \nand I hope that in the end that is what we get--and these other nations \ncan too. In the end, I hope this agreement meets all of these \nchallenges that we have thrown out.\n  Unfortunately, I have real reservations as to whether the agreement \nreached over the past weekend meets the high standards set by Congress. \nI will not make a definitive statement on the overall merits of the \nagreement until I have a chance to review it in its entirety. For now, \nI will just say that I am worried. I am worried that we didn't get as \ngood a deal as we could have. I am worried that the administration \ndidn't achieve a balanced outcome covering the congressional \nnegotiating objectives set out in TPA. And, ultimately, I am worried \nthere won't be enough support in Congress for this agreement and that \nour country will end up missing out on important opportunities.\n  I hope I am wrong. I will continually scrutinize this agreement as \ndetails emerge. Before I can support the TPP deal struck in Atlanta, I \nmust be convinced that the TPP is a balanced agreement that complies \nwith the TPA law and that it has clear, implementable rules that our \ntrading partners will follow.\n  The TPP is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to define high-standard \nrules for the Asia-Pacific and to gain real access to overseas markets \nthat our businesses and our workers need. I intend to do all I can to \nensure that the agreement meets these goals.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  National Defense Authorization Bill\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor today to \nexpress my support for the final conference report on the National \nDefense Authorization Act, what we need to do as a Congress to \nauthorize the work that can be done to defend the country. I urge the \nPresident to sign this bill.\n  For 54 straight years the Senate has done its job in authorizing the \nthings that need to be done to defend the country. We have passed the \nbill. This fulfills part of that responsibility to defend the country. \nIt is the first responsibility of the Federal Government to defend the \ncountry. This is something that can't be better done somewhere else. It \nis something that has to be done by us, and two things have to happen \nfor that to be done. We have to authorize the spending in the way this \nbill does and then we have to appropriate the money once that spending \nhas been authorized.\n  The majority voted several weeks ago to debate the appropriating \nbill, but we couldn't get even six Democrats to join us to debate that \nbill. Well, now this bill has passed. So maybe the next move is to pass \nthe bill that funds what has just been authorized. It has passed the \nHouse, it has passed the Senate, and the Commander in Chief of the \nUnited States is saying he would veto the National Defense \nAuthorization Act?\n  The President apparently believes the defense of the country is a \nlegitimate bargaining chip in how we spend all other money. The \nPresident somehow has latched onto this idea that he proposed a few \nyears ago that all spending be equal, that you take all of the \ndiscretionary spending in the country and half of that would be for \ndefense and half of that would be for everything else that is \ndiscretionary--an increasingly small part of the budget, because \nmandatory spending is what continues to grow. The discretionary \nspending, the spending that people think about when they think about \nthe Federal Government, gets smaller every year.\n  But even with that challenge in front of us, the President apparently \nhas the position that no matter how dangerous the world is, no matter \nwhat is happening in Ukraine or no matter what is happening in Crimea, \nno matter what is happening in Syria, no matter what is happening in \nresponse to the Iranian agreement, you have to have more money for \neverything else if you are going to have more money for defense. \nSomehow more money for the EPA and more money for the IRS are equal to \nthe responsibility that the Federal Government has to defend the \ncountry.\n  We saw a little of that, again, just a few weeks ago when the \nappropriators brought the Defense appropriations bill to the floor with \na vote of 23 to 7. That means many Democrats and many Republicans voted \nfor that bill, but when we got it to the floor, we couldn't get the \nnumber it took to bring it up.\n  This bill, the authorizing bill, just passed the Senate with 70 \nvotes. It passed the House with 270 votes. This bill fully supports the \nnumber the President said we needed to defend the country. This is like \nnot taking yes for an answer. When the President says this is how much \nmoney we need to defend the country, the Congress appropriates the \nmoney the President says we need to defend the country, and then the \nPresident says: Well, but we need a lot of money for a lot of other \nthings too, and I am only going to be for what I was for--this is the \nPresident's number--the amount of money I was for to defend the country \nif I get the amount of money I want to do everything else.\n  That is not a very good formula for either democracy or making the \nsystem work. This has the base funding for the Department of Defense. \nIt has the defense funding and the national security funding for the \nDepartment of Energy. It has money involved for the overseas \ncontingency fund that was created for when things are happening outside \nof the country that we didn't anticipate. And surely that is the case.\n  The President was just saying 3 years ago that the Russians weren't a \nproblem. That was a Cold War idea that the Russians could be a problem. \nHe was saying 3 years or 4 years ago that Assad must go.\n  Clearly, things are not working out as we thought. So it is probably \ntime to use the overseas contingency fund, as this does. This provides \nmoney for the intelligence-related programs. I am on the Senate \ncommittee that the CIA, the Director of National Intelligence, and \nothers report to. They are publicly not at all shy about saying that \nmore things are coming at the country from more different directions \nwith more potential danger than ever before and so they need to be \nfunded. The activities have stressed those agencies in a lot of ways, \nbut another way you can stress them is not to let them know whether \nthey are going to have the money necessary to do their job.\n  Our allies are constantly confused by the lack of resolve on our \npart. In fact, when you are looking at this from some other country and \nyou say that the President got the amount of money he wanted in a \ndefense bill that met the needs that the President proposed, but he \ndoesn't want to sign the authorization bill now because he is not happy \nwith all the other spending, that is a pretty confusing message.\n  It is like the confusing message when the President draws a redline \nin Syria but it doesn't mean anything. But when you don't enforce the \nredline, then not just Assad is emboldened but all of our adversaries \nare determined at that point that there may be new ways\n\n[[Page S7198]]\n\nto test the United States and its allies they hadn't thought of before. \nSo, before you know it, the Russians are in Crimea, the Russians are in \nUkraine, and now the Russians are in Syria. What we are watching unfold \nin Syria--and I would want to emphasize ``watching unfold'' as if we \nwere spectators in an area of the world that since World War II the \nUnited States of America has done what was necessary to see that there \nwasn't a Russian presence there--is clearly the result of a strategy \nthat is confusing, but it is also pretty darn confusing when the \nPresident says he is going to veto the Defense authorization bill.\n  We see China moving in the South China Sea in ways that we wouldn't \nhave anticipated, taking a 5-acre island and turning it into a 3,000-\nacre military base.\n  We see Iran spreading its bad influence with the new resources that \nit now has.\n  When the United States leaves a leadership vacuum in the world today, \nbad things rush to fill that vacuum. And when that happens--when there \nis less U.S. leadership, when there is less U.S. presence, when there \nis less positive U.S. encouragement in the world--that almost always \nproduces the wrong kinds of results, and it almost always produces \nhasty decisions that cost America more in lives and international \nrespect than we would have had otherwise.\n  The President can take a positive step here by just saying: OK. I am \ngoing to sign this bill because 70 Senators and 270 House Members voted \nfor this bill. If the President wants to have a fight, there is still a \nfight to be had. We shouldn't be having a fight about authorizing the \nmoney that would then be appropriated, but there is still a fight to be \nhad because, remember, this bill doesn't spend one dime. It just \ncreates the authorization to spend money if that money is appropriated.\n  This is a good bill. It is a responsible bill. It eliminates waste \nand unnecessary spending. It trims down bloated headquarters and \nadministrative overhead at the highest levels of the military so that \nmore money goes to the places where the fight is and more money goes to \nthe families and the troops that defend us. It contains the most \nsweeping defense acquisition reforms in a generation. It helps sustain \nthe quality of life for the people who serve and their families.\n  By the way, yesterday I introduced a bill along with Senator \nGillibrand--a bill that focuses on family stability. When we were doing \nthat, I was able to quote the recently retired Chief of Staff of the \nArmy, General Odierno, who said the strength of the military is in the \nfamilies of the military.\n  This bill does things that move in the right direction. It authorizes \na pay raise for those people serving below the grade of colonel. It \nrequires the Department of Defense and the Veterans' Administration to \nestablish a joint uniform formulary to ensure our troops have timely \naccess to the medicines they need.\n  The bill authorizes commonsense reforms in a 70-year-old, outdated \nretirement system. Currently, 83 percent of the people who serve in the \nmilitary don't benefit from the retirement system. If this bill would \npass, servicemembers exiting the military have more choices, resulting \nin about 80 percent of the people who leave the military getting a \nretirement benefit instead of 80 percent not getting a retirement \nbenefit.\n  The bill keeps in place restrictions that bring detainees to \nGuantanamo and keep them there. It prohibits the transfer of Guantanamo \ndetainees to places such as Yemen, Libya, Syria and Somalia. Six and a \nhalf years after taking office, the President has never produced a plan \nto close Guantanamo. The Congress and the chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Armed Services are still waiting to hear what his plan \nmight be. As terrorism spreads across the globe, we also don't appear \nto have a plan to do what needs to be done with the law of war \ndetainees that are brought under our control and the control of our \nallies around the country.\n  The challenges faced by the intelligence community are unlike any \npast challenges we have seen--cyber security, maybe it is more cyber \ninsecurity than cyber security--from defending the critical \ninfrastructure of the country to too much information on too many \npeople in too many places. Previously, people who wanted to get our \ninformation had to be pretty close and were likely to be detectable. \nNow our adversaries can be in the middle of the desert, somewhere in \nSyria or anywhere around the world, using satellite technology to hack \ninto us--as it turned out recently our U.S. Government personnel \nrecords. One has to hope the military, the dot-mil, is more secure than \nthe dot-gov, but that doesn't happen if we don't provide the money.\n  There are a number of priorities in my State that are reflected in \nthis. We have a great training base at St. Joseph, MO, where C-130 \naircraft pilots from all over our country and from 16 of our allied \ncountries trained last year. This bill would provide the aircraft \nupgrades for that C-130 training.\n  It provides the necessary resources for geospatial intelligence \nactivities in the country.\n  The bill includes military construction funding for a new \nconsolidated nuclear stealth and deterrence facility at Whiteman Air \nForce Base. Missouri is proud to have Whiteman Air Force Base as the \nhome of the B-2 bomber, the stealth bomber system, where dedicated \nairmen stand by at a moment's notice to let our allies know we can \nreach anywhere, anytime from that base, and they are unlikely to know \nwe are there until we get there.\n  Finally, this bill includes critical funding to keep the Army ready, \nequipped, and trained. At Fort Leonard Wood the Army trains \napproximately 80,000 soldiers every year. While I was disappointed with \nthe announced reductions at Fort Leonard Wood, which are scheduled to \noccur in 2017, the number of uniformed positions at that installation \nwill still be higher than they were in 2001. The Army's decision to \nminimize reductions at Fort Leonard Wood was a decision that I think \nanybody who understands the Fort would agree with.\n  In summary, I want to say to the President of the United States that \nthis bill provides for our common defense. That is his No. 1 \nresponsibility as Commander in Chief. Blocking this bill will keep us \nless safe and less secure. So Mr. President, sign this bill.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, it is not uncommon for me when I am at \nhome in Oklahoma to have a mom approach me at a townhall meeting or in \nconversations or even at a store or restaurant. What she will want to \ntalk to me about is very interesting. Almost always the moms who \napproach me lately want to talk to me about national security. They \nwant to talk to me about the fear they have that the world is spinning \nout of control, and they are very concerned about their kids. They are \nconcerned about terrorism coming to the United States. With a lot of \nmoms in Oklahoma, there is a sense of a loss of trust that this is a \nsafe world and a safe place.\n  I can't say that is isolated. As I have talked to other Members in \nthis body, I seem to find the same theme coming up over and over again. \nAs I talk to people at home, they want to know: Is the American \ngovernment performing its primary responsibility of maintaining \nsecurity and protecting American citizens around the world?\n  I would love to be able to tell them yes, but quite frankly this has \nbecome a very chaotic world, and the challenges we face need clear \nmessaging about what we plan to do and our intent to actually follow up \non that plan. We need to have a national policy plan for defense, and \nthen we need to follow through on that.\n  That seems straightforward and simple. Well, the national defense \nauthorization is one of those areas where Congress and the President \nhave for decades agreed on a national policy for defense. They have \nlaid out that perspective, and then it is the President's \nresponsibility as Commander in Chief to fulfill. That is the primary \nresponsibility of the U.S. Government. The\n\n[[Page S7199]]\n\nchallenge is, our world is in utter turmoil and that primary \nresponsibility is not being fulfilled.\n  Passage today of the National Defense Authorization Act by 70 to 27--\nwhich is a rare vote in the Senate, to have that much bipartisan \nagreement on something--is a significant next step. It has passed the \nHouse already, it has now passed the Senate with a veto-proof majority, \nand it is headed to the President's desk, and he has threatened a veto, \nof all things, for a national plan for defense.\n  There is a sentiment, an emotion from Americans: Please get a clear \nnational policy. We feel like the world is on fire, and somebody needs \nto provide a clear path. That is what this is, and I am astounded by \nthe conversation about a possible veto threat from the President of the \nUnited States, even when it passes the Senate by a veto-proof majority.\n  Where are we and what is really going on right now? Let's take a look \nat the world and what is happening in real time. The Middle East is \nabsolutely rocked to its core with violence, and there is this \nperception that the United States is disconnected from it. I would say \nthat is untrue. We are just not providing clarity in the plan.\n  At a time when we have men and women in harm's way across the entire \nMiddle East, I am astounded that the President is talking about a veto, \nwhich will provide even more instability. Let me give an example. When \nI talk about men and women in harm's way, there are many Americans who \ndon't hear about the ongoing battle happening now in Iraq and Syria and \nhow our sons and daughters are already very engaged in what is \nhappening there. There is this belief--I believe fostered by the \nPresident--that we are really not there because we never talk about it.\n  So let's talk about yesterday. This is yesterday over Iraq and Syria \nand what happened. Near Abu Kamal, there were three strikes from the \nAmericans on two separate ISIL crude oil collection points. That was in \nSyria yesterday. In Iraq, one strike destroyed two ISIL rocket rails. \nNear Kirkuk, two strikes struck two separate ISIL tactical units and \ndestroyed two ISIL heavy machine guns and an ISIL fighting position. \nNear Kisik, three strikes suppressed two ISIL rocket positions, an ISIL \nmortar position, and an ISIL sniper position. Near Makhmur, one strike \nsuppressed an ISIL heavy machine gun position. Near Mosul, three \nstrikes struck an ISIL tactical unit and destroyed three ISIL heavy \nmachine guns and three ISIL fighting positions and suppressed an ISIL \nrocket position and an ISIL mortar position. Near Ramadi, five strikes \nstruck four separate ISIL tactical units and destroyed three ISIL \nfighting positions, three ISIL weapons caches, two ISIL buildings, an \nISIL bunker, and denied ISIL access to terrain they were pursuing. Near \nSinjar, one strike struck an ISIL tactical unit and destroyed an ISIL \nheavy machine gun and two ISIL fighting positions. Near Sultan \nAbdallah, one strike suppressed an ISIL rocket position. Near Tal Afar, \ntwo strikes destroyed an ISIL fighting position, an ISIL trench, and an \nISIL berm, and suppressed an ISIL mortar position. Near Tikrit, one \nstrike destroyed four ISIL obstacles. That was yesterday.\n  Americans have this belief that we are disconnected. We are a nation \nthat is engaged, but the challenge is that there is no clear plan, \nthere is no end game that is being laid out. In a moment when we have \nthis many strikes that are happening in Syria and in Iraq--and I can go \non and on about what is happening with our Special Forces in \nAfghanistan and across the rest of the region, as I will describe in a \nmoment, but at this moment, with this going on, the President is going \nto veto a national defense authorization with this kind of bipartisan \nsupport, when the whole Nation is saying: Give us a plan because we \nfeel insecure.\n  Currently, we are trying and failing to train and equip moderate \nopposition forces against ISIL in Syria. Currently, we are trying to \ngive Kurds all the equipment they need to hold the line against ISIL. \nThere are millions of displaced people who are fleeing across Europe, \nwho are trying to find some place of respite.\n  In Yemen, we are supporting the Saudi-led coalition as the Iranians \nare causing a coup to become a reality in Yemen by the Houthi rebels.\n  In Libya, there is still an unbelievable vacuum left by the \nincomplete campaign, which resulted in ISIS getting a foothold in Libya \nand a bloody civil war in a very divided Libya. They have not been able \nto form a central government in several years now.\n  Egypt is facing a growing terrorist threat in Sinai. There are all \nkinds of tit-for-tat violence happening right now in Israel between the \nPalestinians and Israelis.\n  In Africa, we are still hunting Joseph Kony--a despicable madman--but \nwith no success. AFRICOM is also trying to assist forces working to \nkick al-Shabaab out of Somalia. Bloody sectarian violence is breaking \nout in the Central African Republic. South Sudan has an extremely \nfragile peace agreement. Boko Haram continues to rapidly grow in West \nAfrica.\n  In Mexico and other parts of Latin America, drug thugs are running \nrampant, and they are pushing drugs into the United States in record \namounts, destabilizing many of our cities.\n  In Afghanistan, a new offensive by the Taliban threatens to roll back \nthe progress we have made.\n  DNI Clapper testified that the world is still facing an emerging and \nrapidly growing cyber threat. It is not just a cyber threat to the \nAmerican Government, it is a threat to every American citizen, as many \nAmerican citizens have personally experienced in recent days.\n  Let's look to the future and some of the plans that are ongoing.\n  Iran. We heard from Secretary Kerry and this administration that a \nnuclear deal with Iran would lead to a more peaceful Middle East. Since \nthe agreement was announced, we have seen Iran continue to arm the \nHouthi rebels in Yemen, continue to support Hezbollah and their \nexpansion, and continue to aggressively prop up the Syrian dictator \nBashar al-Assad. Some of us have stated quite blatantly our suspicion \nthat this deal would make the region less stable. Indeed, in just 5 \nyears Iran could begin importing large amounts of conventional weapons \nunder this deal. So an Iran that is already supporting large amounts of \nterrorism will only become better equipped in the days to come.\n  China. They had a state visit here recently with lots of broad \npromises about cooperation. Meanwhile, we know that much of the cyber \nthreat emanates from China. They are building islands in disputed \nwaters--airfields capable of hosting military assets there. They are \nbeginning to build a world-class navy that could threaten our closest \nallies in the region. China continues to be one of the world's leaders \nin human rights violations.\n  Russia. We have heard several of our top military commanders say \nthere is a long list of threats, but the threat they are most concerned \nabout is a growing Russia. Putin walked into Crimea, and the world \nwatched. He continues to threaten eastern Ukraine, and the world \nwatches. He is now expanding Russian adventures into the Middle East, \nsupporting Iranian-backed Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and attacking the \nmoderate opposition forces attempting to defend their own families. \nThis is not a new vanguard against terrorism; this is an expansion of \nthe ``Russian Bear.''\n  So what are we doing about it? We are trying to actually put out a \nclear plan. Where are we going in national defense? What are we going \nto do to stop terrorism and the expansion of terrorists around the \nworld? Instead of the White House cooperating with us, they are \nthreatening to veto the NDAA. It is unbelievable. It is astounding that \nthe White House is spending more time trying to make a deal with Iran \nthan they are trying to actually support our own military. What does \nthis do? What does this agreement really accomplish?\n  For those who aren't familiar with the national defense \nauthorization, let me share a few things that are in this national \ndefense authorization that the President is now saying he is going to \nveto.\n  Here is one: personal carry of firearms. Post commanders are \nempowered to permit a member of the Armed Forces to carry appropriate \nfirearms on our posts or bases. After the attack that happened in \nChattanooga, this is something the American people have called out for. \nIt is included in this bill, to allow it.\n\n[[Page S7200]]\n\n  It provides for stronger cyber operations capabilities and looks to \nsafeguard our technological superiority.\n  It ensures that military intelligence analysis remains a priority at \nthe national level.\n  The NDAA extends vital authorities for our forces in Afghanistan as \nwe try to deal with what is happening on the ground there. It \nauthorizes the Iran military power report for 10 additional years, \nreflecting Congress's view that Iran's illicit pursuit of a nuclear \nweapons capability and its malign military activities constitute a \ngrave threat to regional stability and U.S. national security \ninterests. The NDAA reinforces the mission against the Islamic State of \nIraq and the Levant, ISIL.\n  Congress authorizes through this the European Reassurance Initiative \nto address Russia's employment of conventional and unconventional \nwarfare methods to counter U.S. and Western interests, whether it be in \nthe Ukraine or across the area--bicameral, bipartisan efforts to \nprovide assistance and sustainment for the military forces in Ukraine.\n  The NDAA allocates $30 million for DOD-unique capabilities to address \nthe threatening levels of violence, instability, illicit trafficking of \ndrugs, and transnational organized crime in Central America.\n  Dealing with the Pacific region, this conference remains concerned \nabout America's strategy in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region, and the NDAA \nrequires the President to make a clear strategy for this ``pivot to \nAsia.''\n  The Defense Department has also placed greater emphasis--under this \nagreement, the NDAA--on security cooperation with all parts of the \nworld to make sure we have a consistent strategy.\n  If we want to talk about individual members of the military, this \nNDAA changes how retirement is done. Now, 83 percent of the individuals \nwho serve in our military don't receive any kind of retirement at the \nend. This allows those individuals to actually be able to participate \nin retirement benefits, in their retirement from the military, even if \nthey don't make it all the way to 20 years. This is a dramatic shift \nnot only in supporting the warfighter but in actually setting a \nstrategy for where we need to go to provide some clarity to individuals \nat home and to our troops in the field.\n  The President's statement that he is going to veto this has come \nunder two areas. He said he is going to veto this because the funding \nmechanism comes from the Overseas Contingency Operations Fund, OCO. \nBecause the funding is coming from OCO, he is going to veto it. The \nsecond thing he said: I am going to veto it because I don't like what \nit says about Gitmo--about Guantanamo--and keeping those individuals \nwho are terrorists who have attacked our Nation at Guantanamo.\n  The ironic part is that when I started to pull this to be able to \nlook at the figures--let me just give the last several years. In 2013, \nthe OCO funding was $89 billion. The President signed that. In 2014, \nOCO funding was $81 billion. The President signed that. In 2015, OCO \nfunding was $64 billion. The President signed that. This year's OCO \nfunding is $89 billion, which is right there in the same range as the \nprevious 4 years, but this year he is saying: I can't sign it; it has \nOCO funding. Can somebody tell me the difference on this? This is very \nsimilar to what has been done the last 4 years.\n  His statement about Guantanamo Bay and preventing funding--moving the \nterrorists from Guantanamo Bay to the United States--I can tell you \nthat in my State people are adamantly opposed to moving the terrorists \nfrom Guantanamo Bay to the United States. Going all the way back, let's \nsay, to 2011, that NDAA prevented moving prisoners from Guantanamo; \n2012, prevented it; 2013, prevented it; 2014, prevented it; 2015, \nprevented it. All of those, the President signed, but for some strange \nreason, this year the President has said: It has OCO funds and it deals \nwith Guantanamo--just like every other year in the past.\n  This is the season when we need to bring clear voices and a clear \nmission, not politics. This is the primary mission we have as a federal \ngovernment: Take care of our national defense and provide a clear \nmessaging.\n  I am proud of this Senate for finishing the conference report on the \nNDAA and sending it to the President's desk. Now I would ask the \nCommander in Chief to stand with the troops, to sign this, and let's \nget on to providing some clarity in the days ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, first, I want to commend my colleague, my \npartner on the Senate Intelligence Committee, for his recent remarks \ndelivered here on the floor.\n  It was our Director of National Intelligence, Admiral Clapper, who \nsaid that in all of his 50-plus years of serving in intelligence \nfunctions--first in the military and now as the Director of National \nIntelligence--he has never seen a world so troubled, he has never seen \nsuch a proliferation of threats, threats to our way of life, threats to \nour country, threats to our allies, threats to world order. And my \ncolleague from Oklahoma, Senator Lankford, just laid out in specific \ndetail the multitude of threats, the multitude of dysfunction and chaos \nthat exists not just in the Middle East but throughout the world. I \nwon't repeat any of it, but I thank him for bringing attention to the \nfact that we live in very uncertain times, times which require decisive \nleadership, and that leadership--over the years and over the centuries, \nworld nations have pointed to the United States as the democratic \nleadership absolutely necessary to deal with these types of issues and \nprovide directional leadership to our allies and to the world, as well \nas show strength to our adversaries that has restrained some of their \nactions. That is missing.\n  There is a huge void being left by the lack of any kind of sensible \npolicy--if there is a policy at all--coming out of this particular \nWhite House and from this President. This vacuum that has been created \nhas allowed the opportunity for those who seek to do us harm, to do \nothers harm, and those who seek to use power to achieve their means--\nliterally, a blank check and a free hand, knowing there is no order \nhere in terms of addressing this in a successful way.\n  So I thank my colleague for defining this on the floor, and I \ncertainly want to support--and hopefully my colleagues will pay \nattention to this serious challenge that America faces with the lack of \na coherent strategy and lack of decisive leadership that is coming to \nus from the White House.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. President, today we face something far less consequential but \nstill consequential from the standpoint that it is a contributor to \nanother major threat that Americans face.\n  I have been engaged in everything from major programs--done in a \nbipartisan way, with support from the President, all of which have \nfailed--to address this and bring us to the small, sometimes almost \nridiculous and embarrassing, spending that has taken place here for \nthose who are looking at it from bottom up instead of from top down. It \nis something I have tried to identify every week--now for 23 weeks--\ncalled the waste of the week, hopefully it will provide the kind of \nembarrassment to my colleagues and knowledge of the fact that we simply \ncannot keep spending money that we do not have.\n  These waste of the week sums are substantial, into the tens of \nbillions of dollars. Some are there to show the American people or \ndescribe to the American people the fact that there is a significant \namount of unneeded spending, of waste, fraud, and abuse that occurs on \nan almost daily basis throughout all of our agencies and throughout \nFederal spending. People are saying: Given the kind of debt crisis we \nare looking at, why are we spending hard-earned tax dollars to address \nthis or that or whatever?\n  Today I want to address one small but yet another example of \nunnecessary Federal spending, and it involves the role of robots \nreplacing humans for certain functions. Those who have watched ``The \nJetsons''--I don't really tune in, but my grandkids do--perhaps wish \nthat they, too, could have a Rosie the maid, the robot that cooks, \ncleans, and tells jokes to the Jetson family. This obviously is a \ncartoon presentation, but it reflects a role for robots that provides \nus interesting entertainment or perhaps the robot from ``Lost in \nSpace'' that played the electric guitar and exhibited human emotion or\n\n[[Page S7201]]\n\nMichael Knight's trusted robot sidekick KITT on ``Knight Rider.''\n  This is a little bit beyond my generation, but I am told robots are \nnow part of the entertainment scene. While this makes for good \ntelevision and draws viewers, we all know robots can never replace the \ncare of a human being, the care of a parent, the efforts of a teacher, \nthose who are reaching out to provide support and encouragement for \nyoung people. Yet the National Science Foundation is currently spending \n$440,855 trying to do that with robots. The agency recently awarded a \ntaxpayer-funded grant to develop the use of ``autonomous, personalized \nsocial robots'' in the classroom.\n  The first thing that came to my mind was what in the world does a \npersonalized social robot look like and how do you personalize a robot \nto provide social interaction with children? The purpose of this grant, \nwhich began last month and continues until August 2017, is to create \nrobots that can tell stories to children.\n  This might be a cute thing to do. I don't know. Is this something the \nFederal Government, at a time when we are in the middle of deficit \nspending, evermore borrowing, should ask the taxpayer to send out their \nhard-earned tax dollars for--this kind of thing? If private industry \nwants to do this and can sell the product to schools, more power to \nthem, but why do we have to go to the Federal Government to do a test \ncase to see if this works? We know we do basic research here. We \nsupport that through NIH and the National Science Foundation. This is \nnot basic research. I am questioning this.\n  Let me quote from the grant description. This will ``offer unique \nopportunities of guided, personalized and controlled social \ninteraction, whatever that means, during the delivery of a desired \ncurriculum. They can play, learn and engage with children in the real \nworld--physically, socially, and emotively.''\n  Maybe the effort here is to build a robot that can physically, \nsocially, and emotively connect with children. That might work on ``The \nJetsons.'' That might work on television. I can't believe how that \nworks in real life.\n  What parent wants a preschooler to be read to by a so-called social \nrobot instead of a teacher or a parent? And why are we spending \ntaxpayer dollars on reading robots? Actual human teachers provide what \nrobots cannot. They relate to our children. They understand their \nindividual needs, and they tailor their instruction to bring out the \nvery best in our children and on a personalized basis. I don't think a \nrobot can adjust emotively and socially to different children in the \nclassroom. Yet obviously the teacher is trained to do that.\n  Even the most advanced robot can't sense when a child is going \nthrough a rough time or provide the right touch to ensure a child's \nlearning. Should the Federal Government, which is over $18 trillion in \ndebt, be spending any money, let alone $440,000, on this research? Is \nthis something the private sector could be conducting instead? \nCertainly, if that is what the goal is.\n  My purpose throughout the Waste of the Week Initiative is to drive \nhome the point that the Federal Government should be stewarding \ntaxpayers' dollars for essential functions and in a way that truly \nhelps people.\n  Let me be clear. I am not criticizing all Federal research spending \nor the National Science Foundation. The government does play an \nimportant role, as I have said, in promoting basic science research \nthat cannot be done elsewhere, but there are many private companies \nthat offer products that use technology to help children learn. Is it \nthe role of the government to also perform this sort of research? Just \nbecause something is interesting to do doesn't mean it rises to the \nlevel of priority, particularly at a time when we are continuing to \nspend more money and go deeper into debt each and every day.\n  Families and small businesses have to prioritize all the time. The \nFederal Government needs to do the same. So let's pull the plug or take \nout the battery and short circuit this funding for this grant.\n  Today I am marking more money on our ever-increasing amount of waste, \nfraud, and abuse. We are adding $440,855 to the nearly $117 billion \nthat over the last 22 weeks we have brought to this floor.\n\n\n            60th Anniversary of Crispus Attucks Championship\n\n  Mr. President, while I am here, let me switch and for a couple of \nminutes speak to something that I think speaks well of our State; that \nis, celebrating an important anniversary.\n  In Indiana, few things better personify the Hoosier spirit of hard \nwork and overcoming adversity, persistence, and sportsmanship more than \nhigh school basketball. It is rabid in our State, and it always has \nbeen. It defines our State.\n  Every year the high school basketball season culminates in February \nand March with what we call Hoosier Hysteria--the postseason \ntournament. Half a century ago, the height of Hoosier Hysteria was \nbefore school consolidation and before the advent of class basketball. \nAt that time we had one single athletic class and crowned one high \nschool basketball team State champion each year. For the final game of \nthe tournament, fans would fill Butler University's historic Hinkle \nFieldhouse to standing-room-only capacity. Throughout those weeks of \ntournament, as the small, medium, and large-sized schools worked their \nway through the system to that championship game, it captured the \nhearts and minds of Hoosiers in a way that nothing else does.\n  This phenomena was immortalized by the award-winning 1986 movie \n``Hoosiers''--one of my personal favorites--and based on an improbable \nbut true story. Back in the 1950s, hundreds of small high schools \nexisted across our small State, but no small school had ever won the \nbasketball State championship. In 1954, Mylan High School--a rural \nschool with an enrollment of only 161 students in all four grades--\nfaced a much larger school, Muncie Central High School, whose \nenrollment was 2,200 students in the State championship game. The Mylan \nIndians defeated the Muncie Central Bearcats to win the State title. It \nhas been immortalized through the movie ``Hoosiers,'' which any \nHoosier, and hopefully people outside the State, watched more than \nonce. I watch it on a regular basis. It is a great story.\n  Even today, Mylan's incredible accomplishment is widely admired and \ndiscussed by Hoosier basketball fans. Indiana high school basketball in \nthis era produced not only this ``David and Goliath'' episode but also \nanother truly inspirational team. This is their 60th anniversary.\n  En route to winning the 1954 State championship, Milan defeated the \nCrispus Attucks Tigers in the semi-State. That is no small \naccomplishment. That was a large school with an exceptional team. At \nthat time, Crispus Attucks was an all-Black high school in \nIndianapolis. Despite their loss to Milan in 1954, the Tigers were back \nthe next year. On March 19, 1955--60 years ago--Crispus Attucks won the \nState title by defeating Gary Roosevelt High School 97 to 74 in that \nchampionship game.\n  The next year Crispus Attucks went undefeated, riding a 45-winning \nstreak to State title. The Tigers finished the 1950s with a third \nchampionship in 1959.\n  Crispus Attucks High School's 1955 State title was one of several \nfirsts. Not only were they the first team from Indianapolis to win the \nState title, they were the first African-American school in the Nation \nto win an open State tournament.\n  Through the perseverance and leadership of their coach, Ray Crowe, \nthe players learned not just the game of basketball but also valuable \nlessons about discipline, patience, and perseverance. These lessons \nresulted in back-to-back State titles, as I have said.\n  On the court, the Crispus Attucks teams of the mid-1950s were led by \na future professional all-star, champion, and Hall of Famer named Oscar \nRobertson. Oscar Robertson said of those Crispus Attucks teams: ``The \nway we played and won, we did it with a lot of class.''\n  The Tigers' success on the basketball court helped tear down many \nlingering racial barriers of that time. This team inspired the State of \nIndiana with their hard work, graciousness, and sportsmanship. Today I \njoin my fellow Hoosiers in marking the 60th anniversary of this \nmilestone and honoring this team of champions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7202]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for up to 10 minutes; that following my remarks, Senator \nSchatz be recognized for up to 10 minutes; and that following his \nremarks, Senator Whitehouse be recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Climate Change and Technology\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, the evidence and impacts of climate change \nare clear and they are undeniable. Scientists can measure the increase \nof carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. They can measure the rising \ntemperatures. They can measure the increasing level of the sea. They \ncan measure the increase in extreme rainfall. All of this increases the \nrisk for extreme weather events that threaten people and the economy. \nWhile addressing the challenges of climate change will take a \ncomprehensive approach, we have many of the policies, the workforce, \nand the technologies we need to address the problem already.\n  To illustrate that point, I want to tell you a tale of two tax \npolicies--one for wind and solar and one for oil, gas, and coal. Let's \nlook at the last decade of our tale of two tax policies.\n  In 2005, we, the United States, installed 79 total megawatts of solar \nin the United States. Seventy-nine megawatts was a teeny amount back in \n2005. Last year we deployed nearly 100 times that amount--7,000 new \nmegawatts in the year 2014. Look at that. We have nearly 100 times more \nsolar.\n  Well, what happened? First, technology costs plummeted. Everybody has \nheard of a Moore's law for semiconductors. It told us that today's \niPhones would be more powerful than last generation's supercomputers. \nWe all know Moore's Law. We knew we would move from this pocket phone \nto an iPhone because the technology keeps getting more powerful.\n  There is a Moore's law for solar as well. Every time solar panel \ndeployment doubles globally, the cost of solar falls by 18 percent. It \nis predictable. It is why we are seeing the cost of a solar panel drop \n70 percent since the year 2010, and it is why costs will continue to \nfall.\n  Next, 30 States enacted renewable electricity standards. Yes, now \nmore than half of the States in our country have a standard to get a \nsizable portion of their electricity from renewable sources, and \nfinally, and most importantly from a national policy perspective, we \npassed an 8-year extension of the Solar Investment Tax Credit in 2008. \nWe gave this industry and these companies certainty. We now have more \nthan 20,000 megawatts of installed solar capacity in the United States. \nMore than 60 percent of it was added in just the last 2 years, and we \nare projected to double that installed solar capacity over the next 2 \nyears. We are forecast to add 8,000 megawatts this year and 12,000 \nmegawatts next year, and that is because we put smart tax policies on \nthe books 7 years ago.\n  Look what happened. If we go from the beginning of the American \nRevolution until 2005, we were still only installing 79 megawatts--just \na teeny, tiny amount of solar energy. But when we started putting State \nrenewable electricity standards on the books and a new tax policy, it \nstarted to explode 100 times--1,000 times more solar in America, by the \nway, with all the experts saying: This can't happen. Solar isn't real. \nWind isn't real. You Senators, you House Members, you have to get real. \nWell, this is the proof that bad policies had stopped this explosion of \nthese technologies.\n  By the way, the same thing is true for wind power. We are projected \nto add 9,000 new megawatts of wind power in our country this year, and \nwe are projected to add another 8,000 megawatts of wind power next \nyear. We can see what is happening with the combined totals of wind and \nsolar once we put the new policies on the books. It was basically an \nera where almost no electricity in the United States was generated by \nwind and solar to the next year having 5 to 6 percent of all the \nelectricity in America coming from wind and solar. It is like the \nexplosion of cellphones that turned into smartphones. People didn't \nhave anything in their pockets just 20 years ago--it was like the wind \nand solar industry--but we changed policies in the United States. We \nsaid: We can do it. We can untether ourselves from a telephone line in \nour living rooms. We can let people walk around with their phone, and \nwe began to make the same decisions on wind and solar. We can untether \nourselves in the United States from coal-generated electricity that \nemits greenhouse gases that dangerously warm our planet, and we are now \ndoing it. It is accelerating, and that is the beautiful part of the \nstory.\n  By the end of next year, there are going to be 300,000 people \nemployed in the wind and solar industry in the United States. Right \nnow, there are 73,000 people building these wind turbines. Steel and \niron workers are out there doing this work right now, and it generates \nclean, renewable, nonpolluting energy. We can do this. We are the \nUnited States of America. We are the innovation giant on the planet. We \ncan solve this problem.\n  What has happened with the wind industry? Well, their tax break has \nnow expired. Has the tax break for the oil industry expired? Oh, no. \nHas the tax break for the coal industry expired? Oh, no.\n  Those tax breaks have been on the books for 100 years. They will \nnever expire--never. There are too many people who want to help the \nfossil fuel industry here in the Senate and over in the House of \nRepresentatives, but the tax breaks for the wind and solar industry--\nthe ones that are showing the tremendous growth, innovation, and \ncapacity to develop new technologies that we can export around the \nplanet--are expiring.\n  If we look at the green generation--young people within our society--\nwhich technology do they want us to invest in? Do they want black \nrotary dial phones and coal-burning powerplants or do they want the new \ntechnologies of the 21st Century, their generation? Do they want the \npast dirty carbon pollution or do they want future clean energy? It is \nnot even close. This is a choice that has to be made by this \ngeneration. The green generation expects us to be the leaders on this \nissue.\n  The oil and gas industry get $7.5 billion a year in tax breaks. The \noil industry doesn't need a subsidy to drill for oil any more than a \nbird needs a subsidy to fly or a fish needs a subsidy to swim. They are \ngoing to do it anyway. What they do though is lobby to take away the \ntax breaks for solar and wind because they know that will displace \nthem. Our goal, of course, should be to have a massive ramping up of \nthese energy technologies.\n  Do you want to hear an incredible number? The Chinese government, \nwhile the Pope was in town here in Washington, announced that China was \ngoing to deploy wind and solar and other renewable technologies by the \nyear 2030 that would equal the total of all electrical generation \ncapacity in the United States of America. They are going to deploy all \ntheir coal, natural gas, hydropower, wind, and solar. Again, I said \nearlier that every time there is a global doubling of the deployment of \nsolar on the planet, the price of solar drops by 18 percent. China is \ngoing to be doing that.\n  Last week India announced that they are going to have a massive \nincrease in their renewable energy resources as well.\n  Unfortunately, the tax breaks in our own country have already expired \nor are going to expire for the wind and solar industries. Our country \nis supposed to be the leader. We are supposed to be the technological \ngiant on this planet.\n  All I can say is, if we want the jobs, this is the sector where the \njobs are being created. There will be 300,000 jobs in this sector by \nthe end of next year. If we want to reduce greenhouse gases, this is \nthe sector that can make it possible for the United States to be the \nleader.\n  If we want to be the leaders to ensure that we are acted on the \nmessage that Pope Francis delivered to the Congress just 2 weeks ago, \nwe have to move toward these technologies. The Pope asked us to use our \ntechnological capacity in order to solve this problem. The Pope pretty \nmuch said three things. No. 1, the planet is warming dangerously, and \nthe science is clear. No. 2, the cause of the warming is\n\n[[Page S7203]]\n\nlargely by human beings, and the science is clear. No. 3, we have a \nmoral responsibility.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a huge day because we have Members \ncoming out to the floor to talk about this revolution and how we can \nfind a solution so we can deal with this issue in a positive, \naffirmative job-creating way. We can engage in massive job creation in \norder to save all of God's creation. We can do it, but we have to \ndecide that we are going to be the leaders in this sector, and all I \ncan say is that in the end we are going to win because technology \nalways triumphs--always. You can hold it back for a while, but in the \nend it is going to ultimately change our world. By the year 2100 people \nwill look back and wonder why we ever did generate electricity by the \nuse of fossil fuels on our planet.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I see that Senator Schatz and \nSenator Whitehouse have arrived.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nexplaining to the public and this body what we are all becoming \nincreasingly aware of. The technology is there. This is no longer pie \nin the sky. This is not hopeful ecological utopia thinking. This is \nreal stuff. These are real jobs that are being financed by banks and \nfinancial institutions. This is already upon us.\n  I wish to tell the story of Hawaii's clean energy transformation. Of \ncourse the clean energy transformation is taking place across the \ncountry, but it is especially true in Hawaii. For decades--since the \ndemise of the sugar plantation--Hawaii relied on imports of fossil fuel \nfor our energy needs. As recently as 2010, we derived nearly 90 percent \nof our electrons from burning oil. In just 4 years we have driven this \nnumber down to around 80 percent, and we are on our way to a 100 \npercent clean energy target.\n  Hawaii's reliance on imported fuels isn't just bad for the climate, \nit is also bad economics. We have the highest electricity rates in the \ncountry. Our rates are three times higher than the national average. \nFor the privilege of burning LSFO, low sulfur fuel oil, we are paying \nhigher prices than anywhere in the Nation, and so something had to \ngive.\n  In order to bolster our own energy security and economic prospects, \nwe made the decision to transition away from fossil fuels to solar, \nwind, and geothermal. Clean energy is Hawaii's future, but it is \nimportant to point out that in the beginning we had naysayers on the \nleft, right, and center, much like the current debate in the Congress. \nThere are those who think that what we do in the clean power plan or \nwith the carbon fee will not be nearly enough, and there are those who \nthink that we are doing too much too fast.\n  I remember having this exact conversation in Hawaii in 2001. In 2001, \nwe started small and passed a voluntary renewable portfolio goal that \nencouraged utilities--didn't mandate--to generate 9 percent of their \nelectricity from clean energy by the year 2010. The target, frankly, \nwas unambitious. It was voluntary and it was unenforceable, but it was \nimportant because it was a start. For some it was little and for others \nit was too radical, but it was a start. So we kept pushing.\n  In 2004, we replaced the original goal with a requirement of 20 \npercent clean energy by 2020. Two years later, we added incentives for \ncompliance and established penalties for noncompliance.\n  In 2008, Hawaii partnered with the USDOE to identify the technical, \nregulatory, and financial barriers preventing the State from reaching \nits clean energy potential. This partnership, the Hawaii Clean Energy \nInitiative, was crucial to helping Hawaii realize that a 100 percent \nclean energy goal was actually realistic.\n  A year after starting this partnership, the State increased its Clean \nEnergy Standard to 40 percent by 2030, establishing an energy \nefficiency standard of 30 percent and enshrining into law the \nrequirement to reduce emissions from the power sector by 70 percent by \nthe year 2030.\n  I want to give context here. People thought this was totally \nunrealistic and that we would even at the first 2- or 3-year increment \nalready miss our goals, but what happened was the opposite. We started \nexceeding our interim targets, and then we ratcheted up our goals. \nProgress toward these goals demonstrated that an even more ambitious, \naudacious goal of 100-percent clean energy was a real possibility.\n  So this year Governor Ige in Hawaii signed the law requiring \nutilities to generate all of their electricity from renewable sources \nby 2045. We are currently meeting or exceeding our interim targets, \nthanks in large part to big increases in wind power and in distributed \ngeneration, especially solar rooftops.\n  It is important to say that progress towards our clean energy goals \nhasn't impeded economic growth. Hawaii's unemployment rate is among the \nlowest in the Nation and 1.5 percent below the national average.\n  Strengthening this law required consistent efforts by advocacy \ngroups, businesses, and government agencies to bring about the change. \nIt also showed the importance of taking those first steps down the road \nto a low-carbon economy. Whether they seem too small to make a \ndifference or too large to be possible, we have to start. Once we do, \nambitious goals are more within reach than they may have originally \nseemed.\n  Now, Hawaii is blessed in a number of ways, including with ample \nsunlight, steady winds, and volcanic energy. But Hawaii is not unique \nin its ability to generate substantial quantities of electricity from \nclean renewable resources.\n  The National Renewable Energy Laboratory analyzed clean energy \npotential across the country and found that ``[r]enewable electricity \ngeneration from technologies that are commercially available today . . \n. is more than adequate to supply 80 percent of the total U.S. \nelectricity generation by the year 2050.''\n  That is with technologies available today. As these technologies \nimprove and the cost of clean energy continues to fall, wind and solar \npower will be increasingly competitive with electricity generated from \nfossil fuels in States across the country. As my home State of Hawaii \nillustrates, we just have to start.\n  This is a lesson that we must take to the international context as \nwell. As the world meets in Paris later this year, I urge \nrepresentatives from all countries to think of Hawaii's experience \nmoving towards a zero carbon energy system. The climate negotiations in \nParis are shaping up to be at least a moderate success. But whatever \nagreement emerges from Paris will likely be a political Rorschach test, \nwhich is to say that some will say that we are promising too much and \nothers will say that we should be offering more. Whatever one's \npredisposition about climate, Paris will prove it to the world.\n  But what truly matters is not exactly what the particulars of each \nagreement in Paris are but what happens next. It is doing the work. It \nis power purchase agreements. It is public policy. It is tax \nincentives. It is permits. It is public utilities commissions. It is \nactually getting the work done across the country and across the \nplanet.\n  When something as consequential as climate change is on the table, it \nis going to require global capital, technological breakthroughs, and \npolitical will. That political will will only occur if people \nunderstand that, yes, this is a problem. It is real. Yes, it is urgent, \nand yes, it is caused by humans. But, most importantly, we can, in \nfact, fix it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleagues from \nMassachusetts and Hawaii to talk about the tax credits for wind.\n  We have had a remarkably exciting new thing happen in Rhode Island \nthis summer. From time to time, I am able to get out on Narragansett \nBay and, over and over, whether driving on the bridges over \nNarragansett Bay or actually out on Narragansett Bay, we saw the sites \nof these enormous barges traveling down the bay, bringing these huge \nstructures that were carried out, located off of Block Island, and sunk \nto the ocean floor to provide the platforms for the first steel-in-\nwater offshore wind energy in the country.\n  Now, we can go over to Europe and see wind energy all over the place. \nWe are behind them in developing it, but\n\n[[Page S7204]]\n\nRhode Island is the start. And whether we saw these enormous structures \nthat were the legs--the frames for the pylon and the turbine--or \nwhether we saw enormous pilings that get carried out there and in the \nsame way that you drive a nail through the hole for a hanger and put it \nthrough wall, they take these enormous pilings that reach way up into \nthe sky and drive them through the hollow legs of the framework and \ndown to anchor them in the ocean floor.\n  So this is under construction right now. It is big. We see these \nbarges coming by and they are enormous. The structures run hundreds of \nfeet in the air. It is exciting to see this happening, and it is part \nof the wind revolution that Senator Markey and Senator Schatz talked \nabout.\n  So there is a conflict in my mind between this exciting sight in \nRhode Island--these big yellow structures coming down the bay in the \nbright light--and then coming to the darker Halls of Congress and \nmoving from that exciting sight to the tedious fight that we have over \nand over to protect the wind production tax credit. Over and over we \nhave to go through this fight. Why? I will tell my colleagues why. It \nis because opposition to the wind tax credit is one more little \nwriggling tentacle of the fossil fuel industry. They have huge tax \nsubsidies, tax credits, and tax advantages baked permanently into the \nTax Code, and they sit on those and they defend them and they are \nmerciless about anybody who tries to take those away. But let a little \nwind come along and try to get a competing tax credit of its own, and \nthey try to crush it, over and over and over.\n  Nobody runs for office to come to the Senate and says: The thing that \ndrives me, the thing that motivates my candidacy is to make sure that \nour wind energy in the United States gets knocked down; let's take \ntheir little tax credit away. Nobody runs on that. In fact, if I recall \ncorrectly, the Presiding Officer ran for office with a picture of a \nwind turbine in Colorado. So it is not as if there aren't friends to \nwind in this Chamber.\n  But once someone gets here, the oil and fossil guys are very \npowerful. They are very remorseless. They have made immense threats to \nsquash any action on climate change. And as a little sidebar, they \nalways try to beat the little wind energy subsidy. They will never give \nup their own, and their own are much bigger. We have probably $50 \nbillion over 10 years in cash tax benefits going to these companies, \nwhich are the most profitable companies in the history of the planet. \nThey are the last companies that need any help.\n  If we look at people such as the International Monetary Fund--not \nexactly a liberal, green group--the International Monetary Fund \nestimates that if we put in all of the subsidies that fossil fuel gets \naround the world, it adds up to more than $5 trillion--trillion. I am \nfrom Rhode Island. I think $1 million is a lot of money. I am starting \nto get used to talking about billions of dollars being here. Trillions \nis what the fossil fuel subsidy, in effect, is around the world, and \njust in the U.S. it is $700 billion in a year. Yet, greedy, big \ncorporations that sit and defend that benefit to the last trench also \nwant to crush the poor little wind benefit. It is just not fair and it \nis just wrong.\n  But I think we are going to be able to prevail. We have seen some \nreal progress here. Bloomberg just published an article that wind power \nis now the cheapest electricity to produce--cheaper than anything \nelse--in both Germany and in the United Kingdom. It is a powerful \nindustry in States such as Colorado and in Wyoming, where they have so \nmuch wind that they export wind energy to other States. Iowa is \nprobably our leader. Iowa generates nearly 30 percent of its \nelectricity from wind. TPI Composites is a Rhode Island company. It \nbuilds composite materials in Warren, RI. They have a facility in Iowa \nwhere they manufacture wind turbine blades and, in the last decade, \nthey have manufactured 10,000--10,000--wind turbine blades. There had \nbeen a Maytag factory in a town called Newton, IA, and the Maytag \nfactory went bust because, of course, we are offshoring jobs to China. \nBut guess what. They came in and started building these wind turbines. \nThey are really too big to ship from China, so it has been a boom \nindustry. It has put little Newton back on its feet.\n  If we don't pass the wind production tax credit, then States such as \nWyoming and Colorado and Iowa that depend on this are really going to \nbe hurt. This is bipartisan in these States. I don't know why the \nfossil fuel industry primarily runs its mischief through the Republican \nParty here in Congress, but it doesn't work in Iowa. In Iowa, a year \nago, the Iowa State Senate unanimously passed a resolution supporting \nextension of the production tax credit--unanimously.\n  So we have a really strong case to make that this is the technology \nof the future. We have a fairness case to make that the great big \nbrutal fossil fuel lobbyist organization shouldn't be allowed to hold \non to all of its subsidies--depending on how we measure, they are \nmeasuring into the hundreds of billions of dollars--and, at the same \ntime, try to squash poor little wind when it wants to get some \nsubsidies in order to compete with this massive and malevolent \nincumbent.\n  Then I think we have the practical politics of this, which is that in \nState after State after State, wind has become real enough that it is \ngoing to be very hard for some of our colleagues on the Republican side \nto go home and say to their home State industry: Sorry, we put you \nunder the bus. We put you under the bus. We protected your competitors \nin oil and gas; we absolutely would never touch them. We protected \nthem. They are sacrosanct on our side. But we put you under the bus. \nThat is going to be a little hard to explain.\n  So I very much hope that as we come together and pull together the \ncontinuing resolution or the omnibus--that avoids, I pray, another \nshutdown and that puts our country on a sensible budgetary footing \ngoing forward--this tax credit is a part of it, because we need these \njobs. People are working in Rhode Island, and I will tell my colleagues \nthis: When you are building a giant, enormous, big frame offshore, you \nare paying good wages. You are paying good wages to the people who \noperate the barges. You are paying good wages to the ironworkers, the \nsteelworkers, and the electrical workers. You are paying good wages to \nthe stevedores who are helping to load it up. These are really strong \neconomic businesses, and we want to support them.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the issue of the fiscal \nyear 2016 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill--the bill \nthat, in fact, is now before the Senate.\n  We just voted at 2 o'clock this afternoon on the NDAA, the National \nDefense Authorization Act. That is very important because we need to \npass that legislation for our military. In fact, we did, and we passed \nit with 70 votes. That is incredibly important because the President \nhas threatened a veto on the National Defense Authorization Act.\n  This is legislation that has passed the House, and now it has passed \nthe Senate and it is going to the President. If he vetoes it, we have \nto have the votes to override because we have to get that legislation \ndone for our men and women in uniform. Not only, as I spoke earlier on \nthe floor, is it about making sure we are doing our job on behalf of \nour military but also on behalf of our Nation's defense.\n\n  The other thing I mentioned in regard to that legislation is we also \nneed to pass the companion bill, which is the Defense appropriations \nbill. So very soon we will be taking up the Defense appropriations \nbill, which is the funding that goes with the National Defense \nAuthorization Act. We authorize those military programs and then we \nhave to fund them. That is why the Department of the Defense \nappropriations bill has to be passed along with the Defense \nAuthorization Act in order to get the job done for our military. I make \nthat point because until we have done both of those things, we have not \nfunded the military the way we need\n\n[[Page S7205]]\n\nto. I make that point as part of a bigger point and that is this: The \nAppropriations Committee, of which I am a member, has passed all 12 \nappropriations bills out of committee, and they are awaiting action on \nthe floor of the Senate. Those bills have been passed with strong \nbipartisan votes. Instead of having each and every one of those bills \nfilibustered, we need to take those bills up and debate those bills. \nPeople should offer the amendments they have, we can debate those \namendments, and then we can vote. That is our job. That is how the \nSenate works. That is what the people of this great country send us to \ndo. That is the work of the Senate. That is regular order.\n  As we talk about authorizing programs for men and women in uniform, \nwe also have to pass the Defense appropriations bill. That will be \ncoming before this Senate. I make that point because what we have been \nfacing is a filibuster of all these appropriations bills. We will have \nanother test. We will have another test now this week, and this is on \nthe Energy and Water Development appropriations bill. This is energy, \nCorps of Engineers, vital fundamental infrastructure for this great \ncountry. So we will see if our colleagues will join us. Can we join \ntogether in a bipartisan way and advance through this appropriations \nbill, have the debate, offer the amendments, and get this work done? I \nhope the answer to that is yes. We will find out over the course of \ntoday and tomorrow if our colleagues would join together and get this \nwork done for the American people and then on we go.\n  We may have to deal with a Presidential veto on the National Defense \nAuthorization Act. If so, let's do so. Let's do so in a bipartisan way. \nThen let's take up the appropriations bill that goes with that Defense \nauthorization. Let's make sure all 12 of these bills, all of these \nappropriations bills are brought to this floor, people have their \nopportunity for the debate, people can offer their amendments, and we \nwill have our votes. If something can get 60 votes, it passes. That is \nthe work of the Senate. That is the work of the Senate. If it is not \ndone, the reason it will not be done is because there will be an \nongoing filibuster. It is very important that the American people \nunderstand that because this is the work of the Senate, this is the \nwork of the Congress, and we need to be clear about whether we are \ngetting that work done or whether we continue to face a filibuster that \ndoes not allow us to bring this legislation forward to debate it in an \nopen, transparent debate. Put it out there in front of the American \npeople, make the argument, offer the amendments, and vote. That is how \nit is done. That is how it is done in this democracy. That is how it is \ndone in this Senate.\n  So I rise to talk about the merits of the Energy and Water \nDevelopment appropriations bill. This measure appropriates funding for \nthe U.S. Department of Energy, including national nuclear security and \nenergy research and development, as well as critical infrastructure \nprojects administered by the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of \nReclamation. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved this bill in \nMay. I am a member not only of this Appropriations Committee but this \nsubcommittee, and we voted out of committee 26 to 4. So there are 30 \nmembers on the full Appropriations Committee, Republicans and \nDemocrats, and by a vote of 26 to 4 we voted in favor of this \nlegislation. That is about as bipartisan as it gets. It was supported \nby all of the Republican members of the committee and 10 of the \nDemocratic members.\n  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and \nWater Development, I thank Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member \nFeinstein. They have crafted a bipartisan bill within our budget \nframework that balances our energy priorities and our national security \npreparedness.\n  I also commend Senate Appropriations Chairman Cochran and Ranking \nMember Mikulski. They brought the measure up in regular order, allowing \namendments and debate, and they advanced this bill, as I said, with a \nvery strong bipartisan 26-to-4 vote. The fact is, this is the first \ntime in 6 years the Appropriations Committee has passed all 12 \nappropriations bills. All 12 have been passed in a bipartisan manner, \nawaiting action on the floor.\n  As I said, this legislation is within the budget guidelines. The \nSenate Energy and Water bill includes $35.4 billion in overall funding, \nwhich is $1.2 billion more than last year's funding level.\n  The Energy Department's nuclear security program is funded at $12.3 \nbillion, which is $856 million more than last year. The Department of \nEnergy programs receive an additional $270 million. This is important \nbecause our Nation has significant infrastructure needs, and that is \nwhat we are addressing, basic infrastructure needs of this kind. The \nlonger we wait to improve America's infrastructure, particularly our \nwaterways, the higher the cost will be. So it is very important that we \nget this legislation moving.\n  One of the ways we can cost-effectively improve the Nation's \ninfrastructure is by using public-private partnerships, P3s, to fund \nwater projects. I worked closely with Senator Alexander, the chairman \nof the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee to include support for \nP3-style projects in this legislation.\n  I see that our chairman has joined us. Again, I commend him for not \nonly the overall legislation but for his support for the P3s, public-\nprivate partnerships. By leveraging the resources of the private \nsector, we can accelerate construction and reduce overall project \ncosts. This creates a win for citizens who benefit from the project and \na win for taxpayers who save money on projects that are constructed on \na more cost-effective basis. I look forward to passing this legislation \nso we can advance this P3 concept.\n  In fact, we have a project in Fargo, ND, that is perfectly suited for \nthis type of approach. A P3 project can save the government hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in construction costs, but we need to get this \nlegislation passed so the Corps has the ability to start these types of \nprojects and get them constructed for our country.\n  I am also pleased the legislation permits the Army Corps of Engineers \nto get a handful of new feasibility studies. Mother Nature doesn't wait \non the Senate or Congress, so we have to keep looking at areas where we \nneed to upgrade infrastructure and respond to things as they occur; for \nexample, some of the recent events, as the Presiding Officer knows, \nwhich occurred in Colorado, the Animas River. One area I am very \nfamiliar with that needs better protection is Minot, ND, where we had a \ndevastating flood in 2011. We need to do a feasibility study to \ndetermine how best to make sure that flood protection is put in place.\n  Finally, I am strongly supporting funding included in the legislation \nfor improvements to water infrastructure across this country. Whether \nit is our ports or whether it is large or small, this is basic \ninfrastructure we need for quality of life in this country. This is a \nlong-term investment for the future of our country, the quality of \nlife, the welfare of our people, and the ability to grow our economy.\n\n  Let me touch on a couple of areas before I turn over the floor to our \nchairman. In addition to the Corps of Engineers, this legislation \nprovides funding for the National Nuclear Security Administration, the \nagency that develops and maintains the Nation's nuclear warheads. NNSA \nrelies on the funding provided every year in the Energy and Water bill \nto preserve the Nation's nuclear deterrents. It is critical that this \nlegislation moves forward. I am particularly pleased the legislation \nmeets the fiscal year 2016 budget request for funds needed to refurbish \nthe W80 warhead, which is the warhead that goes on our nuclear cruise \nmissiles.\n  The W80 warhead is aging and needs to be refurbished so it can move \nto the new cruise missile being developed by the Air Force. The W80 is \ncritical to the air leg of the Nation's nuclear triad. I am glad this \nlegislation provides the funding to help keep our triad intact and in \nfact modernized.\n  The bill also makes advances in our energy security priorities. It \nincreases funding for the Energy Department's energy research and \ndevelopment, which will help provide the research for technologies that \nwill advance coal, natural gas, oil, and other fossil energy resources \nand innovations. This is important in order to pursue a true ``all of \nthe above'' energy policy that enables our country to produce both \ntraditional and renewable energy with better environmental stewardship.\n\n[[Page S7206]]\n\n  The bill also provides support for the coal Advanced Energy Systems \nProgram to research the efficiency of coal-based power systems and \nenabling affordable, commercially viable CO2 capture \ntechnologies.\n  It continues funding for many other research and development programs \nthat will strengthen our energy future, not only by enabling us to \nproduce energy more cost-effectively and more dependably but also with \nbetter environmental stewardship.\n  I will start to wrap up and turn the floor over to our esteemed \ncolleague from the other side of the aisle and the outstanding Senators \nwho are members of the committee who are here and looking to speak in \nsupport of this very important legislation, but I want to finish on the \naspect I started on earlier.\n  We have passed all 12 appropriations bills out of committee. This is \nthe fundamental work of the Senate, making sure we fund the government, \nwe fund the enterprise we are talking about, and we do so within the \nbudget that was duly and properly passed by this Senate and by this \nHouse--by the Congress. This is the work we need to do. That means we \nhave to proceed to these bills, that we have to offer the opportunity \nfor debate, the opportunity for amendments, debate those amendments, \nand vote. That is our job. That is our responsibility. That is how we \nget the work done for the American people who sent us to do just that.\n  This is good legislation. These bills were passed with bipartisan \nsupport. As I said in the case of this bill, 26 in favor, only 4 \nopposed. Let's get going. Let's get the work done we were sent to do.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n           Wisconsin-Lake Michigan National Marine Sanctuary\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, this week I was pleased to hear some good \nnews about a very special place in the Great Lakes. On the bottom of \nLake Michigan, right off the shores of Wisconsin, lies an incredible \ncollection of shipwrecks. People across the Great Lakes region, \nespecially in Wisconsin but also in my home State of Michigan and \nelsewhere, recognize that this stretch of Lake Michigan is a national \ntreasure because of its historical significance and its great beauty.\n  Through a bottom-up community-driven process, many people teamed up \nto put together a proposal to protect this area as a National Marine \nSanctuary. The Obama administration listened, and this week they \nannounced they will be moving forward to establish a Wisconsin-Lake \nMichigan National Marine Sanctuary.\n  A National Marine Sanctuary designation, as Michiganders know from \nfirsthand experience, helps to improve access and resources for special \nmaritime places in order to enhance visitor access and preserve \nirreplaceable resources for future generations.\n  The Wisconsin-Lake Michigan sanctuary proposal would preserve an 875-\nsquare-mile area of Lake Michigan with waters extending from Port \nWashington to Two Rivers. As Michiganders watch a pure Michigan sunset \nover Lake Michigan on beaches from Ludington south to Muskegon, the Sun \nwould set over the new sanctuary directly across the lake. The new \nsanctuary has 29 known shipwrecks, 15 of which are listed in the \nNational Registry of Historic Places, with many of those wrecks almost \ncompletely intact--a very rare occurrence. Research shows the proposed \nsanctuary includes 123 reported vessel losses, so there are many more \nwrecks to discover in these waters.\n  Local community leaders in Wisconsin deserve much of the credit for \nbuilding the support needed to move this proposal forward, but it would \nnot have made it to this point without the tireless work of my friend \nand colleague Senator Baldwin of Wisconsin.\n  In 2013, Senator Baldwin urged the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, or NOAA, to reopen the public nomination process for \nthe first time in 20 years, and she continues to advocate for \nadditional funding for national marine sanctuaries through her role on \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  Earlier this year, I was pleased to introduce a bill with Senator \nBaldwin and my good friend Senator Stabenow called the Great Lakes \nMaritime Heritage Assessment Act, which would require NOAA to review \nmaritime heritage resources in the Great Lakes and suggest areas worthy \nof designation.\n  In addition, I teamed up with Senator Baldwin to introduce the \nWaterfront Community Revitalization and Resiliency Act, which can work \nhand in hand with marine sanctuaries to boost the local economies of \nwaterfront communities across the Great Lakes and the country. The bill \nwould improve areas along the water to increase access to public space, \ngrow business development, and create a new vision for waterfronts that \ncan boost tourism, recreation, and small business.\n  The administration also identified another new potential sanctuary, \nthe Mallows Bay--Potomac River National Marine Sanctuary, which is a \n14-square-mile stretch of the tidal Potomac River with the largest \n``ghost fleet'' of World War I wooden steamship wrecks and one of the \nmost ecologically valuable waterscapes and landscapes in Maryland.\n  These two sanctuary proposals, if finalized, would be the first \nsanctuaries established since 2000 and would be just the 15th and 16th \nadditions to the national marine sanctuaries network. The last addition \nto the network was in 2000, and that was Michigan's very own Thunder \nBay National Marine Sanctuary and Underwater Preserve, located in Lake \nHuron, with the main NOAA office based in the great city of Alpena. The \nThunder Bay sanctuary is a remarkable maritime treasure. It is known as \nShipwreck Alley. Throughout history, it has been one of the most highly \ntraveled and dangerous parts of the Great Lakes system. Nearly 100 \nshipwrecks have been discovered within the sanctuary, with a wide range \nof vessel types that makes the collection nationally significant.\n  The cold, clean, fresh water of the Great Lakes keeps shipwrecks in \nexcellent condition, and the archaeological research that is conducted \nat Thunder Bay is world class.\n  Pictured here is the helm of the F.T. Barney, a two-masted schooner \nlocated at a depth of 160 feet near Rogers City. On October 23, 1868, \nthe F.T. Barney was en route from Cleveland to Milwaukee with a cargo \nof coal when it was run into by the schooner T.J. Bronson. The ship \nsank in less than 2 minutes in very deep water. The wreck is one of the \nmost complete you will find anywhere, with masts and deck equipment \nstill in place.\n  Another impressive wreck, lying at a depth of only 18 feet near \nAlpena, is the wooden steam barge Monohansett. On November 23 of 1907, \nthe ship burned at the water's edge at Thunder Bay Island. Today, the \nMonohansett's wreck lies in three sections. The stern portion has hull \nfeatures, propeller, and shaft all in place, and the boiler is nearby.\n  You can still go up to Alpena and take a glass-bottom boat to tour \nthese wrecks and see the crystal waters of Lake Huron, and you can even \nsnorkel or scuba dive amongst some of the most well-preserved ships. It \nis truly a one-of-a-kind and once-in-a-lifetime experience.\n  Not only is Thunder Bay the only freshwater marine sanctuary among \nthe 14 marine-protected areas--at least until these two new proposals--\nbut it is unique in that it is also a State underwater preserve. It is \njointly managed by NOAA and the State of Michigan. A joint management \ncommittee makes major policy, budget, and management decisions, and an \nadvisory council represents the community's interests. It is part of \nthe local community up north, and it is refreshing to see local, State, \nand Federal officials all working together to protect a national \ntreasure.\n  The Thunder Bay sanctuary is a major tourist draw and economic driver \nfor the area, and the Great Lakes Maritime Heritage Center in Alpena \nattracts out-of-State visitors and educates school groups.\n  Over the last decade or so, the benefits of preserving Thunder Bay \nwere widely recognized, and a process was set in motion to expand the \nboundaries of the sanctuary. In September of 2014, after holding many \nmeetings and completing a thorough environmental impact statement, \nThunder Bay was expanded from 448 square miles to 4,300 square miles, \ndriven by strong public and congressional support. This map shows the \noriginal boundaries and the\n\n[[Page S7207]]\n\nnew expanded boundaries. The process was successful in part because of \nthe work of Senator Stabenow, and, of course, my predecessor, Senator \nCarl Levin, who was a champion for the Great Lakes every day of his \nlong service here in the Senate.\n  As we move forward to protect the Great Lakes and other valuable \nmarine resources in the Great Lakes and across the country, we must \ndevote robust resources to these deserving places. Many agencies, \nincluding NOAA, are operating on shoestring budgets. While their work \nis impressive as they stretch their funding, the benefits these \ndesignations bring to communities such as Alpena and the surrounding \narea are sustainable and provide a foundation for the local economy.\n  As a member of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, \nwith jurisdiction over NOAA and the National Marine Sanctuary System, I \nam committed to working every day on protecting the Great Lakes and the \nfantastic waters and marine places within the boundaries of the United \nStates of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                EB-5 Regional Center Investment Program\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there is an immigration program that is \nout of control and not conforming to the reason the program was put \ninto effect in the first place. It needs to be reformed or it needs to \nbe eliminated. So I come to the floor to talk about this immigration \nprogram known as the EB-5 regional center investment program and the \nserious concerns I have about continuing this program without reforms. \nThe program was just extended in the continuing resolution to keep the \ngovernment funded, but I want to talk about changes that need to be \nmade before and if it is extended again.\n  The EB-5 program was created in 1990. A foreign national under this \nprogram can invest $1 million in a new commercial enterprise that \ncreates 10 full-time jobs, and then, in turn, that person receives \nlawful permanent residence and then, if they want to, citizenship. The \nrequired investment amount is only $500,000 if the investment is made \nin what is called a targeted employment area, defined to be a rural \narea or an area with high unemployment. The EB-5 program allows \ninvestors to pool their investments for a project, and they can meet \nthe job-creation requirements by providing evidence of not direct jobs \nbut evidence of indirect jobs.\n  In previous speeches on the floor, I have talked about the national \nsecurity and integrity issues associated with the program. I have \ndetailed the risks, and I have expressed concern about the lack of \noversight by the administration. Today, I will focus on one particular \nabuse of the program and how this program does not fulfill the intent \nof the law passed in 1990.\n  Perhaps the greatest violation of congressional intent that has \nevolved over the years is the manner in which so much of the investment \nmoney coming into targeted employment areas has been directed toward \nlavish--and I mean lavish--building projects in well-to-do urban areas, \nnot in the areas of high unemployment and not in rural areas, as the \n1990 law implied. Four-star hotels and commercial office buildings are \nbeing built with foreign investment dollars in very affluent urban \nneighborhoods rather than the high-unemployment and rural areas which \nCongress intended to benefit. This has been done by gerrymandering the \nboundaries of the targeted employment areas to include at one end the \naffluent census tract in which the building project is located and at \nthe other end, perhaps many miles away, a census tract with high \nunemployment.\n  In other words, the word ``gerrymandering'' is the word that is used \nin forming some congressional districts that are very strangely \narranged so somebody can be reelected to office. The same approach is \nbeing used here to form a targeted employment area to get all of this \nmoney into urban areas that are very affluent.\n  One of the most notorious examples of this gerrymandering, to push \nthe boundaries, is the Hudson Yards project, a group of luxury \napartment buildings and office towers in Midtown Manhattan--in midtown \nManhattan, meaning New York.\n  Even the Wall Street Journal, which never met a business project it \ndid not like, reported on how this program has been abused. The Wall \nStreet Journal explained how the Hudson Yards project qualifies for the \nlower investment threshold despite the affluent Midtown location of the \nproject because the boundaries of the targeted employment area were \nmanipulated--or let me say gerrymandered--to include a public housing \nproject in Upper Manhattan.\n  Another project that flies in the face of congressional intent--\nmeaning the intent of the 1990 law--is located in Lower Manhattan near \nWall Street. As the New York Times reported, the Battery Maritime \nBuilding has been classified as being located in a targeted employment \narea based on a gerrymandered area that ``snakes up through the Lower \nEast Side, skirting the wealthy enclaves of Battery Park City and \nTriBeCa, and then jumps across the East River to annex the Farragut \nHouses project in Brooklyn.'' In other words, the developers did \neverything they could to include the Farragut Houses project, which is \na public housing community, to come in at the lower investment level. \nThe New York Times went on to say that ``the small census tract that \ncontains the Farragut Houses has become a go-to-area for developers \nseeking to use the visa program: its unemployed residents have been \ncounted towards three projects already.'' That is the New York Times.\n  Watchdog.org, a national watchdog group that has followed abuses of \nthe program closely over many years, has also identified another \nproblematic, gerrymandered targeted employment area. They reported that \na 21-story residential building project, which included trendy \nrestaurants and shops, was built with foreign investments despite its \nlocation in an upscale neighborhood with only 0.8 percent unemployment.\n  These are just a few examples, yet they point to a clear problem with \nthis program.\n  When it was created by Congress, we set two different investment \nlevels and clearly tried to steer foreign capital to high-unemployment \nand rural areas. Obviously, I am showing you that has not been \nfulfilled by the way this program has finally evolved.\n  The Wall Street Journal reports that at least 80 percent of program \nmoney is going to projects that wouldn't qualify as being in targeted \nemployment areas without ``some form of gerrymandering.'' Meanwhile, \nthe article adds, people wanting to raise money for projects in rural \nareas and low-income parts of cities say they find it increasingly hard \nto compete.\n  Even the Washington Post has become fed up with the way in which the \nintent of Congress has been violated. In a September 6 editorial, after \ndiscussing the program's numerous economic and integrity failings and \nsuggesting that the program lapse, the Post writes: ``The EB-5 program \nis supposed to favor distressed economic areas, but the definition of a \nneedy zone has been stretched to include nearly the whole country, \nincluding hot downtown real estate markets.''\n  I wish to end by saying, again, that the program is in need of \nreform. In June, Senator Leahy and I introduced S. 1501, a bill that \nwould substantially reform the program by improving program oversight, \naddressing national security vulnerabilities and restoring the program \nto its original intent. I hope my colleagues will look at this very \nbipartisan bill and will take an opportunity to understand how this \nprogram is being used and abused and review the proposal that Senator \nLeahy and I have put out there.\n  Mr. President, I refer my colleagues to the Wall Street Journal \narticle ``U.S. Visa For Cash Plan Funds Luxury Towers--Program to spur \njobs in poor areas supports projects in well-off neighborhoods,'' dated \nSeptember 10, 2015, by Eliot Brown; the Watchdog.org article ``Upscale \nDallas project cashes in on EB-5 visa program,'' dated September 24, \n2015, by Kenric Ward; an article from the Washington Post ``It's time \nfor the corporate visa giveaway to go away,'' dated September 6, 2015; \nand the New York Times article ``Rules Stretched as Green Cards Go to \nInvestors,'' dated December 18, 2011, by Patrick McGeehan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n[[Page S7208]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n          Arkansas and 25th Anniversary of National Rice Month\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, the rare blend of soil type, environment, \nand availability of water make Arkansas an ideal location for rice to \nthrive and grow, making Arkansas the Nation's largest producer of rice.\n  Last year, production in the Natural State accounted for more than 50 \npercent of rice produced in the country. Farmers in more than half of \nArkansas' counties grow rice; 96 percent of those are family owned and \noperated.\n  As the No. 1 producer of this crop, Arkansas has a unique role in the \nindustry. That is why I am proud to recognize the 25th anniversary of \nNational Rice Month. I am also proud to promote policies that enable \nour farmers to manage risk and ensure that high-quality U.S. rice \nremains a staple on tables throughout the globe.\n  This industry is not only contributing to a nutritious and balanced \ndiet, it is also an economic engine. Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, \nMissouri, California, and Texas all produce rice. Nationwide, this \nindustry accounts for 125,000 jobs and contributes more than $34 \nbillion to the economy. In Arkansas, it accounts for more than 25,000 \njobs. The rice industry stands to benefit from a change in policies \ntoward Cuba because it is a staple of the Cuban diet.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that U.S. rice exports \ncould increase up to $365 million per year if financing and travel \nrestrictions were lifted. Arkansas's agriculture secretary recently \nsaid that the economic impact on the Natural State's rice industry \ncould be about $30 million. Rice production is efficient. More rice is \nbeing produced on less land, using less water and energy than 20 years \nago. As great stewards of the land, rice farmers are committed to \nprotecting and preserving our natural resources.\n  Arkansas' location on the Mississippi Flyway makes it a duck-hunting \ncapital of the world and draws hunters from around the globe.\n  I am proud to support our rice industry and celebrate 25 years of \nrecognizing National Rice Month.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic Senators for \ntheir courtesy. We are running a little behind, and they have allowed \nme to go on and make my remarks.\n  I ask the Chair to let me know when 12 minutes have expired of my 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, tomorrow we will be voting on the \nEnergy and Water Development appropriations bill. I come to the floor \nto make two points about that very important legislation.\n  No. 1: if our Democratic friends would allow us to vote on it, allow \nus to debate it, amend it, pass it, send it to the President, and do \nthe same with the other 11 appropriations bills that our Appropriations \nCommittee has reported, we could easily say that this year in the \nSenate is one of the most productive years in a long, long time.\n  No. 2: the other point I wish to make is the importance of this bill. \nBen Bernanke, the retired Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board wrote \nan article in the Wall Street Journal this week in which he said that \nyou cannot rely on the Federal Reserve Board to create jobs in a growth \neconomy in the United States, and that what you need to do is have \nbetter educational opportunities, more research, and you need \nsupercomputing. I would add to this that you need to have \ninfrastructure. This bill, the Energy and Water bill, has all of those \nthings. It is a pro-growth bill for the United States of America.\n  Let me take the first point first. This is the first time in 6 years \nthat the Appropriations Committee has reported all 12 appropriations \nbills. You might find that unusual because that is the Appropriations \nCommittee's basic job. As much as it is for the Grand Ole Opry to sing, \nour job is to pass appropriations bills. That is article I of the \nConstitution. It is the first time in 6 years. The bills are all \nsitting there waiting. Most of them passed in a bipartisan way.\n  The one that we are bringing to the floor tomorrow passed 26 to 4 on \nMay 2. Senator Feinstein and I worked on it with most of the Members of \nthis body. It is a very good bill, passed in a bipartisan way.\n  What would usually happen in a properly functioning Senate is that we \nwould spend the two months of June and July dealing with those 12 \nappropriations bills. That would mean that not just the members of the \nAppropriations Committee would have a chance to vote on them. It would \nmean that the Senator from Utah, who is not on the Appropriations \nCommittee, would have a chance to make his points about the \nappropriations bills, which is part of his job here, yet he is shut out \nof that.\n  Why? Because Democrats say: We won't even let you bring them to the \nfloor.\n  It is an extraordinary thing to do.\n  But despite that, I want you to know what this body has accomplished. \nIn the last 7 months or 8 months we passed the Keystone Pipeline. The \nPresident vetoed it. We overruled the ambush elections rule from the \nNLRB, and the President vetoed it.\n  But listen to all the things we accomplished with the cooperation of \nDemocrats on the other side of the aisle. Then, as I said, if we could \nadd the appropriations bills, we would have the most productive Senate \nin many, many years. There is the trade authority law. It passed, and \nit is law.\n  We fixed No Child Left Behind, and we ended the common core mandate.\n  We reversed the trend of the national school board, and we did it \nwith 81 votes in the Senate. It was a bipartisan bill.\n  We passed a long-term highway bill after we had 34 short-term highway \nbills.\n  There was a permanent fix of what we call the doc fix--the way we pay \ndoctors for Medicare payments. A long-term permanent solution passed \nthis body. It is now the law after 17 short-term fixes. This law \nchanged the way we pay for doctors so that we pay them more for quality \nrather than fee-for-service.\n  We have dealt with what happens when a terrorist calls from \nAfghanistan to Nashville on the phone. That is the USA FREEDOM Act. It \nis now the law.\n  We passed the Defense authorization bill, terrorism risk insurance, \nand the Iran review act. Waiting in the wings is the chemical safety \nbill, which has bipartisan support, and--believe this--it is 39 years \nsince it has last been touched. And there is a cybersecurity bill right \nafter that.\n  That is an impressive list of accomplishments for this Senate. Think \nof what we could say if we had spent June and July, as we should have, \ndebating the appropriations bills.\n  Now let's move to the Energy and Water appropriations bill. On May \n21, it was approved by the Appropriations Committee. The Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein, and I recommended it, and 26 Senators voted \nfor it and 4 voted against it. It stays within the law. The law that we \npassed and the President signed tells us what we have to spend.\n  Yet Democrats said: Well, we are not going to let you bring it to the \nfloor because we think you should spend more than that.\n  Well, maybe we should, but the law says we should spend what we \nspent. So we followed the law.\n  When you block our bill and don't allow it to be brought to the \nfloor, what do you do? You cut 70 Senators out of having a say on the \nEnergy and Water appropriations bill. And what does that mean? They \ndon't have a say over it. They don't have a say over nuclear weapons.\n  Half of our bill is about national defense. Are we properly funding \nnuclear weapons? They don't have a say over National Laboratories, the \nlaboratories where we are inventing new ways to manufacture that will \nhelp grow jobs. They don't have a say over how much money we are going \nto spend on the Missouri River floods. They don't have a say over how \nmuch money we are going to spend on the locks and the dams that we \nhave. The Panama Canal is widening, and if we don't deepen our harbors, \nthe ships are going to go to Cuba. So we want them to go to Savannah, \nMobile, and to other places like that.\n  They don't have a say over nuclear waste. Where do we put nuclear \nwaste? So the Democrats, by blocking the bill from coming to the floor, \nhave cut\n\n[[Page S7209]]\n\ntheir own Members out of having a say about this. Half of the Energy \nand Water bill funds national defense activities, and the other half of \nit funds other essential non-defense items. And all the Democrats asked \nfor was 3 percent more funding than what we're already spending in the \nbill.\n  What I said in the Appropriations Committee was this: You know, this \nis really a pretty good way to budget. Let's appropriate it as if we \nhad 97 percent of what you want, and if we get 3 percent more in the \ndiscussion at the end of the year, then we will add it. That shouldn't \nbe hard to do. We could do it in 24 hours.\n  The way the Senate is supposed to work is the Energy and Water bill \nis supposed to come to the floor. We are supposed to debate it, we are \nsupposed to amend it, and we are supposed to send it to the President. \nIf he doesn't like it, he can veto it and send it back. That is what \nshould happen.\n  If Senators don't like the bill now, they can block it. They can vote \nagainst it after we amend it. They can vote against it after we \nconference with the House. That takes 60 votes too. If the President \nvetoes it, it takes 67 votes to override the President's veto.\n  My friends on the other side said: Well, that takes too much time.\n  What do you mean it takes too much time? That is what we are here to \ndo. We are elected to have a say on these issues. This is $1 trillion \nin funding for the national defense of the United States of America and \nfor its essential services--locks, dams, national laboratories, and \nwhere we put the nuclear waste--and the Democrats are saying: We don't \neven want to vote on the appropriations bills. We don't even want to \nhave a say about them. We don't even want to send them to the President \nfor him to consider.\n  Let's take an example. The bill includes funding for inland \nwaterways. Those are the avenues that carry the commerce that creates \nthe jobs in America. They need to be in good shape. We have agreed on \nthat in a bipartisan way. We have even asked the barge owners to pay \nmore to go through the locks, to which they have agreed, and our bill \nmatches what the barge owners are paying and increases the funding for \ninland waterways in Kentucky--Olmsted Locks and Dams, and Kentucky \nLock--and Chickamauga Lock in Tennessee.\n  It also provides $1.254 billion from the harbor maintenance trust \nfund. That means we will be spending more to deepen harbors in \nSavannah, Charleston, Texas, Memphis, Jacksonville, Mobile, and \nLouisiana, in Pascagoula, Big Sandy Harbor, Cleveland Harbor, Anchorage \nHarbor, and Wilmington Harbor. Do Senators not want to have a say about \nthat? Do you not want to support that or oppose that if you think it is \ntoo much?\n  What about the National Laboratories? The National Laboratories are \nthe source of the research that produces the jobs that gives us our \nfamily incomes. One of them is in Tennessee, the Oak Ridge National \nLaboratory. I was there the other day. They have a new thing called \nadditive manufacturing, where they are 3-D printing automobiles. Let me \nsay that again: 3-D printing automobiles or parts of automobiles. It \nmay revolutionize manufacturing in America and the world as much as \nunconventional gas and oil has revolutionized our national energy \npolicy.\n  Do other Senators--the other 70 who are not on the Appropriations \nCommittee--not want to have a say about how much we spend on our \nNational Laboratories?\n  What about how much we spend for nuclear weapons? We had a big debate \nin this body over the proper level of spending for nuclear weapons. We \nhad a big debate over something called the START treaty, which \nregulated the weapons that we were getting rid of. We agreed at the \ntime that we would spend a certain amount of money to make sure we \ncould defend the country. Do Senators not want to have a say about \nthat?\n  So why do we not pass appropriations bills that were ready in May, \ndebate them in a day or two, and send them to the President? If the \nPresident doesn't like them, under the Constitution he can veto them \nand send them back.\n  If we are spending 97 percent of what he thinks he should spend and \nhe wants to veto it for that reason and then send it back to us and if \nwe decide after negotiations to spend 3 percent more, we can add 3 \npercent in 24 hours, send it back to him, and that is the end of the \nresult.\n  This is not the way the Senate is supposed to operate.\n  I hope that my friends on the Democratic side will recognize that \nthey would like to have a say in our nuclear weapons policy, and that \nthey would like to have a say in how much we spend on our National \nLaboratories.\n  This bill has a record level of funding for the Office of Science--as \nwritten, the highest ever in this bill. You don't want to vote on that? \nYou don't want to support that? You want to cut that? You want to stop \nthat?\n\n  I don't want to stop it. I want us to support research. I want to \nsupport our national laboratories. I want to support national defense. \nI want deeper harbors all around our coast. I want inland waterways \nthat aren't broken down. I want us to move ahead in this country.\n  This bill is a pro-growth national defense bill. It came out of the \nCommittee on Appropriations with 26 votes for it, 4 votes against it. \nSenator Feinstein and I worked with almost every Senator in this body \nfor it. Why should we not consider an appropriations bill that has that \nkind of support?\n  Now, if we get on that path every time we change majorities here--\nlet's say the Democrats win the next election and Republicans say: \nWell, look at what you did to us in the last election. We are going to \nblock all your appropriations bills because we would like to spend \nless. We won't ever do any appropriations bills again in the Senate \nbecause one body or the other blocks the amount of money. We are \nsupposed to vote on that.\n  In the last Congress the Democrats were in control, and they wouldn't \nbring the appropriations bills to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 12 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair. I will conclude within the next 3 \nminutes, and I thank my Democratic friends for their courtesy.\n  In the last Congress, when Democrats had the majority and Republicans \nhad the minority, the Committee on Appropriations completed its work in \na bipartisan way on most bills, but the majority wouldn't bring the \nbills to the floor last year. Or when it did, it wouldn't let the \nRepublicans offer amendments to it. They were afraid Senators might \nhave their say.\n  This year we are in the majority for the first time in 6 years. In a \nbipartisan way we produced 12 appropriations bills out of 12. We would \nlike to bring them to the floor, but they are saying no. We are not \neven going to vote on them. We are not even going to amend them. We are \nnot even going to debate, even though if they do not like the bill at \nthe end of that process, they can kill it with 60 votes. They can kill \nit after it comes out of conference with 60 votes. And if the President \nvetoes it, it can take 60 votes to override.\n  We don't have time to do appropriations bills here? Traditionally, we \nhave always consumed June and July for the 12 appropriations bills. \nPrevious Congresses have had time to do it. We should have time to do \nit.\n  Let me conclude where I started. This has been a very productive \nSenate. Most of that work has been because of bipartisan cooperation, \nwhether it was the trade bill, the bill to fix No Child Left Behind, \nthe highway bill, the doc fix--paying doctors for quality instead of \nfees--the USA Freedom Act, the Defense Authorization Act, the Terrorism \nRisk Insurance Act, or the Iran review act. And we have chemical safety \nand cybersecurity waiting. That is all the result of cooperation \nbetween Democrats and Republicans. Why can we not do that on \nappropriations bills, which is our most basic responsibility?\n  We did it in committee. I couldn't have a better person to work with \nthan Senator Feinstein. That vote was 26 to 4. It involves our national \ndefense, it involves our growth, and it involves our security. I would \nhope every Senator would want to have a say on those issues tomorrow \nwhen we vote. So I hope they will vote yes on the Energy and Water bill \ntomorrow--yes to considering it; and then after we have considered it \nand debated it, we can send it\n\n[[Page S7210]]\n\nover to the House, come up with a conference, and we can see what they \nthink.\n  That is the way the Senate ought to work. I am eager to see the \nSenate get back to that, and I think the American people are as well.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues for their courtesy, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                    Land and Water Conservation Fund\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor tonight to talk \nabout something I would like to see done in the United States Senate--\npassage of reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  Definitely the Senate and Congress have disappointed us in not \npassing the Export-Import Bank reauthorization--which is something I am \na big proponent of. And now, here we are with the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n  For the first time in 51 years since this program was created, it has \nexpired.\n  My colleagues are here on the floor to join me--I thank the Senator \nfrom Montana and the Senator from New Mexico--to talk about why this is \nsuch a vital program to all of our States and why we should have it \nreauthorized immediately.\n  The bill creating the Land and Water Conservation Fund was championed \nby Senator Scoop Jackson at the request of then President Kennedy. Why? \nBecause the American population was growing and there was a need for \noutdoor recreation, open space, and public lands.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund was created to help protect some \nof our most popular national parks, forests, public lands, and iconic \nplaces.\n  For me, this is an incredibly important program because it has \nprovided opportunities for hunting, fishing, hiking and other \nrecreational uses that so many people use when traveling to the Pacific \nNorthwest for vacation or for their livelihood.\n  Those of us who are from States with large amounts of public lands \nrecognize the importance of outdoor recreation.\n  Nationwide outdoor recreation supports more than 6 million jobs. This \nis an economy in and of itself. In the State of Washington, outdoor \nrecreation contributes more than $11.7 billion annually to Washington's \neconomy. It is clear that protecting our public lands is good for both \nour environment and our economy.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund has been credited each year with \nfunds from outer continental shelf oil and gas revenues. The success of \nthat program has helped us authorize and make these investments for the \nAmerican people, as I said, for more than 50 years.\n  We are here to remind our colleagues that we are going to put up a \nfight until we get the conservation fund reauthorized. And to make sure \nthat people in our states and all across the Nation that enjoy public \nlands have access to them.\n  The issue is important to us, and in the energy bill we passed out of \nthe Senate Energy Committee, I worked with my colleague, Senator \nMurkowski, on a bipartisan basis to include a permanent reauthorization \nof the LWCF.\n  And I was joined by 31 Senators to introduce the American Energy \nInnovation Act that also permanently reauthorized and fully funded the \nLWCF.\n  So you can see from these two pieces of legislation that there was a \nlot of support from our colleagues for maintaining this vital program \nthat is used by cities, counties, and jurisdictions in my State and in \nmy colleagues' states and many others across the nation and that it is \na vital tool for helping us to thrive in our outdoor economy. We want \nto see this legislation reauthorized as soon as possible.\n  I thank my colleagues again from New Mexico and Montana again for \nbeing here and for their leadership on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I want to thank Senators Cantwell and \nHeinrich for not giving up on the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and \nI need to point out that while there are three of us Democrats standing \nhere, we speak for our entire caucus. We believe that the LWCF is \nsomething that needs to be reauthorized and, quite frankly, needs to be \nfully funded.\n  We are not going to play games with this issue. We are working to get \nthis bill passed--not for show, not for politics, but because it is \ngood for our economy. And I will get into that in a second.\n  There was a Republican gentleman who served in the Presidency of this \ngreat country some time ago--Teddy Roosevelt--who called on Americans \nto cherish our Nation's vast natural resources and to ensure that we \nsafely pass them on to future generations. After all, they are the \nbirthright of every American. That is what the Land and Water \nConservation Fund is all about.\n  We take special pride in our public lands in Montana. They are a part \nof our way of life. We have just over 1 million people in our great \nState, but we lead the Nation in the percentage of residents who hunt, \nfish, hike, and enjoy our public lands. And the Land and Water \nConservation Fund is a big reason for that.\n  Montana's outdoor economy brings in nearly $6 billion a year. Let me \nsay that again. The outdoor economy, supported by the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, brings in nearly $6 billion a year.\n  Last week, when I flew out of Montana, there were several fishermen \nwho were flying out with me. They didn't live in Montana. All the money \nthey brought into the State while they were fishing was outside dollars \nthat wouldn't have been there otherwise. They probably used some of the \nfishing access--some of the 150-plus fishing access the Land and Water \nConservation Fund has helped developed--when they enjoyed the great \noutdoors in Montana.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund also supports over 60,000 jobs. \nWe talk about economic development all the time. We talk about how if \nwe tweak our Tax Code or if we build this piece of infrastructure or if \nwe make this education program more affordable, it can have an \nincredible impact on our economy. But the fact is, if you want to talk \nabout economic development, if you want to talk about dollars invested \nfor a return, the Land and Water Conservation Fund is an incredible \ninvestment.\n  To help preserve these lands and create these accesses, Montana has \nreceived some $540 million from the Land and Water Conservation Fund--\nmoney that has been very well spent. Montanans used this Land and Water \nConservation Fund to preserve more than 8,000 acres of elk habitat in \nMeagher County, known as the Tenderfoot.\n  Montanans used the Land and Water Conservation Fund to protect some \nof the most pristine habitat in the lower 48, from conservation \neasements in the Rocky Mountain Front to acquisitions in the Crown of \nthe Continent.\n  While Montanans certainly benefit from the fund, there are Land and \nWater Conservation Fund projects in nearly every county of the United \nStates. Yes, this fund is responsible for protecting prime hunting and \nfishing, but it is also responsible for building trails and improving \nparks, playgrounds, and ball fields in every State in the country. That \nis why Congress must reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund--\nto protect our best outdoor places and to reestablish this critical \ntool to build our communities in a way that will make future \ngenerations proud.\n  With that, Mr. President, if it is appropriate, I would like to ask \nmy good friend from New Mexico a question.\n  I thank Senator Heinrich for being here today. My question is, As he \ncomes from New Mexico, is the Land and Water Conservation Fund \nsomething Senator Heinrich hears about from his residents?\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Montana. \nI think one of the great things about New Mexico and Montana is that we \nare both from States that absolutely cherish the outdoors, and we have \na lot of constituents who care about the activities that generate so \nmuch income from the outdoors.\n  Obviously, I hear from an enormous number of my constituents asking \nus to reauthorize and permanently authorize the Land and Water \nConservation Fund--to fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund. In \nfact, recently there was a letter which was sent to me but was also \nsent to the chair of the\n\n[[Page S7211]]\n\nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee--to the chair and to the ranking \nmember, the good Senator from Washington. It was signed by dozens of \nbusinesses saying: Hey, this is important to our bottom line. Please \nextend the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Please continue to support \nthis bipartisan legacy of standing up for our natural resources in this \ncountry.\n  My good friend from Montana mentioned the scale of what that means in \nhis State, and it is not a dissimilar story in New Mexico. In fact, \nover $6 billion annually comes from outdoor recreation activities, and \n68,000 jobs in our State are directly related to outdoor recreation.\n  In fact, when I go home this weekend, we are going to be celebrating \nthe Valles Caldera National Preserve and its management by the National \nPark Service. That was a property that for decades my constituents \ncould not access. They could not hunt; they could not fish. It was \nprivate property. It was because of the Land and Water Conservation \nFund that this place, which had really been on the radar screen of the \nNational Park Service since the early part of the last century--\nprobably since the 1930s--could come into public ownership and now be \none of the true gems in the entire Nation of our public lands.\n  We are going to be celebrating that with our constituents on \nSaturday. The Secretary of Interior is coming. There are literally \n100,000 acres of some of the most spectacular high-elevation grasslands \nand conifer forests and trout streams and elk habitat that we have ever \nseen, and there are businesses that rely on that. Tourism is an \nenormous part of our economy in New Mexico. So this is something which \nhas been absolutely crucial to our State's economy, especially in the \nmidst of the last decade and the challenges we have had economically. I \nknow one of the groups who will be there on Saturday are the sportsmen, \nwho care about utilizing the outdoors.\n  I would ask my colleague from Montana if in Montana he hears from \npeople who hunt and fish, as I do in New Mexico, about the importance \nthis particular legislation has had in protecting habitat and \nprotecting access to the places that regular, blue-collar folks can go \nto hunt and fish.\n  Mr. TESTER. Absolutely. We hear from sports men and women nearly \nevery day, if not every day.\n  Here is where the problem is, and this is why we need to get the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund authorized and funded--and funded at $900 \nmillion, I might add. If you want to go hunting and fishing today in \nthis country, things have changed from the way they were 30 or 40 years \nago. You used to be able to access private lands and go hunting and \nfishing, and you still can, but there are many fewer acres. So the real \nopportunity to go hunting and fishing in this country is on our public \nlands, whether those are State or Federal, and this Land and Water \nConservation Fund allows access to those public lands.\n  There are some in this body and there are some in this country who \ndon't think the Federal Government should own one stitch of land. Well, \nwithout those opportunities and our outdoor economy, No. 1, our way of \nlife would change forever in States such as Montana, and No. 2, our \neconomy would be severely distressed.\n  So, you bet, I hear from sports men and women, because when they want \nto go hunting and fishing, they go to those Federal public lands. That \nis where the good habitat is that they can access, and that is where \nthe good fisheries are that they can access.\n  So this is very important. For those in this body who want to see \nthis program go away, they are literally driving a nail in the coffin \nof rural America's economy.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I would ask my colleague from Montana--we have heard a \nlot about reform. When we had the hearing in front of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, we heard people on both sides of the aisle \ntalking about how well this program works.\n  Does the Senator think the opposition that is holding this up, that \nis holding back the majority of this body--a bipartisan majority, I \nwould add--does the Senator from Montana think that reform is really \nwhat this is about or is it about a more basic, more ideological \nopposition to public lands and the current efforts to either sell off \nor transfer those public lands that our constituents rely on for access \nto go camping, to go hunting, to go rock climbing, to recreate, to \nspend time with their families?\n  Mr. TESTER. It is hard to say what the agenda is. I do know that \nearlier this year there was a proposal put out to use the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund for fighting forest fires. Now there is a \nproposal put out to use the Land and Water Conservation Fund to manage \nforests.\n  The fact is, the Land and Water Conservation Fund works. It works to \ncreate habitat, and it works to access that habitat. It also works for \nplaygrounds and parks and ball fields all across this country.\n  If we take a look at our overall budget and what we spend on a lot of \nstuff around here, $900 million for a nationwide program that impacts \nso many people, that impacts our economy in such a very positive way--\nthere must be some agenda out there that I cannot see to do away with \nthis fund. It makes no sense to me. And it is particularly frustrating \nto see folks on the other side of the aisle come down here to the floor \nand bring their friends in and say: I am going to make this glorious \nspeech about this Land and Water Conservation Fund, and then I want you \nto stop the unanimous consent.\n  The bottom line is that things get done in here when we work in the \nmiddle. As I told some folks the other day in Montana, we need to bring \nthese folks around who think this is just excess government spending \nbecause, quite frankly, there are a lot of places where there is excess \ngovernment spending in our budget. This is not one of them. This is a \ngood program that helps promote a great way of outdoor life and also \nhelps promote our economy.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Ironically, the money in the Land and Water \nConservation Fund is not tax dollars. It is literally a deal that goes \nback five decades now where we opened up large swaths of our natural \nresources, our oil and gas offshore, and took a percentage of that and \ninvested it back into protecting our natural resources. Obviously, \nthose are natural resources that are one-time. You only get to drill \nfor oil and produce natural gas one time. So the idea was that we would \ninvest that in something to protect our environment, to protect our \nconservation lands, and to make a permanent contribution to that level \nof conservation.\n  Mr. TESTER. That is absolutely correct.\n  One of the things that makes this moment in time so important when it \ncomes to the Land and Water Conservation Fund is that we are losing \nhabitat, we are losing fisheries every day. There will be limited \nopportunities to keep these pristine lands available for hunting and \nfishing in the future, but the habitat will be gone if we don't deal \nwith it. That is why it is very important not only to reauthorize the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund but to fully fund it so we can take \ncare of these landscapes that help support incredibly great elk and \ndeer and trout fisheries. It is very important. Plus, there are a lot \nmore opportunities in our great outdoors, and the Land and Water \nConservation Fund really helps people enjoy life and have quality of \nlife. And I am not just talking about the folks who have incredibly \nthick wallets; I am talking about everyday, average Americans who work \nfor a living and work darned hard for a living and want to be able to \nenjoy some of the great things this country has to offer.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. That is absolutely right. I hear from constituents all \nthe time who will never be able to afford one of those $5 or $10,000 \nelk hunts on private land but who can enter the lottery every year and \nwho do and oftentimes rely on that to get their family through the \nwinter and to also just pull their family together in a tradition they \nhave had as a part of who they are for years and years.\n  On Saturday, when we go to celebrate the Valles Caldera National \nPreserve, I am going to be taking my fly rod, and I am looking forward \nto spending the dollars that will go back into our State's game and \nfish coffers to make sure that resource is there again and again and \nagain. That is what this Land and Water Conservation Fund is all about.\n\n[[Page S7212]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Religious Freedom\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, a few weeks ago I inaugurated a series of \nspeeches about religious freedom. In the first speech, I said that the \nrights of conscience and religious exercise go to the very heart of who \nwe are as human beings and how we make sense out of this world. No \ndecisions are more fundamental to human existence than those regarding \nour relationship to the Divine, and no act of government is more \ninvasive of individual liberty than compelling a person to violate his \nor her sincerely chosen religious beliefs. This is why religious \nfreedom in and of itself is so important and must be specially \nprotected.\n  Last week I spoke about religious freedom in practice here in \nAmerica. At no time in world history has religious freedom been such an \nintegral part of a nation's origin and character. As Congress said when \nwe unanimously enacted the International Religious Freedom Act in 1998, \nthe right to freedom of religion undergirds the very origin and \nexistence of the United States.\n  Professor Michael McConnell, director of the Constitutional Law \nCenter at Stanford, describes how, by the time the Bill of Rights was \nratified, America had ``already experienced 150 years of a higher \ndegree of religious diversity than had existed anywhere in the world.''\n  Together, those two speeches told some of the story of religious \nfreedom in America. Today I will build on that foundation and examine \nthe status and the substance of religious freedom. More fully \nunderstanding these three aspects of religious freedom--its story, its \nstatus, and its substance--will help us better evaluate where we are \ntoday and inform where we should go in the future.\n  The status of religious freedom can be summarized as inalienable and \npreeminent. James Madison repeatedly identified the free exercise of \nreligion according to conviction and conscience as an inalienable \nright. To America's Founders, as they expressed in the Declaration of \nIndependence, inalienable rights have two dimensions. They come from \nGod, not from government, and these rights are endowed--that is, they \nare inseparable from us and part of our very humanity. Government did \nnot provide them, and government cannot take them away.\n  When Virginia developed its Constitution in 1776, George Mason's \ndraft of a declaration of rights said that the exercise of religion \nshould receive the fullest toleration by government. Madison objected \nand offered language that became section 16 of the Virginia Declaration \nof Rights, setting what one scholar calls a new standard for freedom of \nconscience. Here is Madison's language. He said:\n\n       That religion, or the duty which we owe to our Creator, and \n     the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason \n     and conviction, not by force or violence; and therefore all \n     men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, \n     according to the dictates of conscience.\n\n  This understanding of religious freedom did not end with America's \nfounding generation. In 1853 the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \napproved a resolution asserting that in treaties with foreign nations, \nthe United States should secure for our citizens residing abroad ``the \nright of worshipping God, freely and openly, according to the dictates \nof their own conscience.'' The committee report on this resolution \ndescribed religious freedom as fundamental, allowing the ``utmost \nlatitude and freedom of conscience'' so that each individual ``is \nabsolutely free to act in conformity to his own convictions.''\n  The fact that religious freedom is inalienable leads to another \naspect of its status. In his 1785 ``Memorial and Remonstrance against \nReligious Assessments,'' Madison explained that religious exercise ``is \nprecedent, both in order of time and in degree of obligation, to the \nclaims of civil society.'' Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg once \nwrote that to America's Founders, religious freedom was preeminent \namong fundamental rights.\n  Presidents and Congress have similarly identified the status of \nreligious freedom as preeminent among rights. In his 1941 State of the \nUnion Address, for example, President Franklin Roosevelt included \nreligious freedom as one of four essential human freedoms. Just 4 years \nlater, the United States signed the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights, which asserts that religious freedom is an inalienable right \nuniversal to all members of the human family.\n  The last several Presidents have issued annual proclamations \ndeclaring January 16 to be Religious Freedom Day. Those proclamations, \nby Presidents of both parties, have said that religious freedom is a \ncore value of our democracy, that it is essential to our dignity as \nhuman beings, and that no freedom is more fundamental than the right to \npractice one's religious beliefs.\n  Turning to Congress, the House Foreign Affairs Committee in 1955 \napproved a resolution ``reaffirming the rights of the people of the \nworld to freedom of religion.'' The committee said that this resolution \n``recognizes that the basic strength of the United States is spiritual \nand that all races, people, and nations of the world share with us a \ndependence on such strength.''\n  I mentioned earlier that Congress in 1998 unanimously enacted the \nInternational Religious Freedom Act. This body passed it by a vote of \n98 to 0. Twenty-one Senators serving today--12 Republicans and 9 \nDemocrats--voted for this legislation. So did Vice President Joe Biden \nand Secretary of State John Kerry when they served here. That law \ndeclares religious freedom to be a universal human right, a pillar of \nour Nation, and a fundamental freedom.\n  In subsequent speeches, I will explore the responsibility of \ngovernment regarding an inalienable and preeminent right such as \nreligious freedom, but I want to note two things at this point. First, \nas the Declaration of Independence asserts, government exists to secure \ninalienable rights. Second, if a right is preeminent, it must be \nproperly accommodated when government takes actions such as enacting \nlegislation and issuing regulations.\n  The status of religious freedom is that it is inalienable and \npreeminent. Let me turn now to exploring the substance of religious \nfreedom in terms of both its depth, or what religion freedom is, and \nits breadth, or those to whom religious freedom belongs.\n  First, depth. Starting in the early 17th century, religious freedom \nin America has been understood to be grounded in the individual right \nof conscience. Roger Williams established a settlement in 1636 for \nthose he described as the distressed of conscience, and subsequent town \nagreements and ordinances restricted government to civil things and \nprotected the liberty of conscience.\n  This liberty of conscience encompasses not only what an individual \nbelieves but also how an individual acts on that belief. The Maryland \nToleration Act of 1649, for example, provided that no person shall be \ntroubled ``in respect of his or her religion nor in the free exercise \nthereof.''\n  The Virginia Declaration of Rights was the model for the Bill of \nRights in the U.S. Constitution. The free exercise of religion is the \nfirst individual right listed in the First Amendment. That phrase, the \n``free exercise of religion,'' is very important--extremely important. \nThe First Amendment protects not simply certain exercises of religion \nor the exercise of religion by certain parties but the free exercise of \nreligion itself.\n  Religious freedom is more than religious speech, which would be \notherwise protected by the First Amendment, or attending a worship \nservice on the Sabbath. It is, as Madison put it, the freely chosen \nmanner of discharging the duty an individual believes he or she owes to \nGod.\n  This robust substance of religious freedom is described in the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, which the United States signed \nin 1948. Article 18 states: ``Everyone has the right to freedom of \nthought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change \nhis religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with \nothers and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in \nteaching, practice, worship and observance.''\n  That is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n  The United States signed the Helsinki Accords in 1975. Section VII \ndeclares the signatories ``will recognize\n\n[[Page S7213]]\n\nand respect the right of the individual to profess and practice, alone \nor in community with others, religion or belief in accordance with the \ndictates of his own conscience.'' Such rights derive from ``the \ninherent dignity of the human person and are essential for his full and \nfree development.''\n  In 1992, the United States ratified the International Covenant on \nCivil and Political Rights. Article 18 echoes the same robust \ndefinition of religious freedom as the right, individually or in \ncommunity with others, in public or in private, to believe and to \npractice one's religion. This robust description expresses the depth of \nreligious freedom.\n  The second dimension to the substance of religious freedom is its \nbreadth or its application across society. Earlier I mentioned the \nMaryland Toleration Act of 1649, which protected the free exercise of \nreligion. It did so, however, only for Trinitarian Christians. The \nPuritans of Massachusetts Bay Colony outlawed the Quakers and punished \nheretics. In fact, Roger Williams went to what would become Rhode \nIsland after being banished from Massachusetts because of his religious \nbeliefs.\n  In those days, religious freedom had depth but not much breadth. Yet \nseeds were being planted. In 1657, residents of a community known today \nas Flushing, NY, signed a petition called the ``Flushing \nRemonstrance.'' This petition protested a ban on certain religious \npractices that prevented the Quakers from worshipping, and the signers \nstated they would let everyone decide for themselves how to worship.\n  America's Founders were the ones who asserted most directly that \nreligious freedom is inalienable and, accordingly, established its \nbreadth in the First Amendment. Rather than being limited to adherents \nof a particular faith, this protection applies to anyone acting \naccording to the dictates of conscience.\n  The status and substance of religious freedom became concretely \nreflected in Supreme Court decisions in the 20th century. In Sherbert \nv. Verner, a woman was fired from a State government job for refusing \nto work on Saturday as required by her Seventh-Day Adventist faith. The \nSupreme Court affirmed that the door to government regulation of \nreligious belief was ``tightly shut'' and set a standard that only \nbarely opened the door to government regulation of religious behavior.\n  The Court said that government limitations on religiously motivated \nconduct could be justified only by ``the gravest abuses, endangering \ninterests.'' Therefore, the Court said, Government must have more than \na mere rational reason for restricting religious practice. In 1981, the \nSupreme Court reaffirmed the Sherbert standard by holding that \ngovernment may ``justify an inroad on religious liberty by showing that \nit is the least restrictive means of achieving some compelling state \ninterest.''\n  This holding was consistent with the path of American history \nregarding religious freedom. The protection of something, after all, \ngoes hand in hand with that thing's value. If religious freedom is \ninalienable and preeminent, then it must be properly protected by law.\n  All of that changed in 1990. In a case titled ``Employment Division \nv. Smith,'' two Oregon State employees were fired for using peyote, a \ncontrolled substance, in their Native American religious ceremonies. \nThe law did not single out religious use of this drug, but its \napplication to these individuals seriously inhibited the practice of \ntheir religion. The Court should have applied the Sherbert standard and \nrequired the State to show a compelling justification for applying this \nlaw against religious adherents.\n  Instead, the Court turned the Sherbert standard on its head. The \nCourt did exactly what it had rejected in Sherbert less than 30 years \nearlier, holding that the government needs nothing more than a rational \nreason for a general law or regulation that restricts the practice of \nreligion. In other words, so long as the government is not explicitly \ntargeting religion, the First Amendment provides no protection at all \nfor the free exercise of religion, as that case held. The Court \neffectively demoted religious freedom from a fundamental right to \nlittle more than an optional fringe benefit.\n  In my opening statement at the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing \nin September 1992 on a legislative response to this decision, I said \nthe Smith standard is ``the lowest level of protection the Court could \nhave afforded religious conduct.''\n  In Smith, the Court made it sound as if the Sherbert decision had \nspawned an epidemic of people using religious objections to obeying \nlaws. The truth is that Courts had not applied the Sherbert standard \nstrictly at all but with what the Congressional Research Service has \ndescribed as a light hand. In the years between the Court's decision \nand Sherbert establishing the compelling interest standard and its \ndecision in Smith abandoning that standard, Federal courts rejected \nmore than 85 percent of religious exercise claims.\n  Government today compromises, burdens, and even prohibits the \nexercise of religion not by overt assault but by covert impact. Zoning \nordinances can restrict where churches may meet, whether they may \nexpand their meeting places, and what services they may offer; \nreligious institutions may be forced to hire individuals who do not \nshare their faith; and regulations may prohibit individuals from \nwearing items required by their faith or require employees to work on \ntheir Sabbath.\n  If government exists to secure inalienable rights such as religious \nfreedom, it must properly respect and accommodate that right even as it \nbecomes more and more intrusive. In fact, it is the increasing reach of \ngovernment that makes vigilance about protecting religious freedom \nmore, not less, important. Requiring a compelling reason to restrict \nreligious practice identifies religious practice as important. \nRequiring only a rational reason to restrict religious practice \nidentifies it as worth very little.\n  It is hard to overstate the impact of the Smith decision. It stopped \ndead in its tracks the long and steady progress toward real protection \nfor religious freedom. Government has its greatest impact on religion \ntoday not by direct suppression but by indirect restriction. If the \nstatus of religious freedom as inalienable and preeminent compels its \nprotection, then reducing that status, as the Court did in Smith, opens \nreligious freedom to restriction and prohibition.\n  Congress responded to the Smith decision by enacting the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act, or RFRA. We were motivated by the very \nunderstanding of religious freedom that the Supreme Court had \nabandoned; namely, that religious freedom is inalienable and \npreeminent. RFRA does by statute what the First Amendment is supposed \nto do. Under RFRA, government may substantially burden the exercise of \nreligion only if doing so is the least restrictive means of achieving a \ncompelling governmental purpose.\n  Congress enacted RFRA for one simple reason. While the First \nAmendment protected the free exercise of religion itself, by changing \nwhat First Amendment means, the Supreme Court in Smith put the free \nexercise of religion itself at risk. The Court made every exercise of \nreligion by everyone vulnerable to governmental restriction, \ninterference, and even prohibition. RFRA restored religious freedom by \nsetting a standard of protection that reflects the true value of what \nit protects and applies that standard across the board.\n  This principle is so powerful that RFRA not only passed Congress \nalmost unanimously, but it was supported by a coalition of \nunprecedented ideological breadth. That consensus existed because we \nrejected numerous requests to go beyond setting the standard and \ndictate how it should be applied in certain cases. We refused to do \nthat in RFRA because the First Amendment does not do that. We set the \nright standard and left its application to the courts in individual \ncases.\n  In a 1994 religious exercise case, Justice David Souter urged the \nCourt to reconsider its decision in Smith and described what is truly \nat stake. He wrote: ``The extent to which the Free Exercise Clause \nrequires government to refrain from impeding religious exercise defines \nnothing less than the respective relationships in our constitutional \ndemocracy of the individual to government and to God.''\n  Properly understanding the status and substance of religious freedom \nnaturally puts those relationships in\n\n[[Page S7214]]\n\norder. Misunderstanding or distorting those principles interferes with \nthese relationships and imperils this fundamental human right.\n  In 1997, the Supreme Court held that RFRA applies only to the Federal \nGovernment because the Congress did not have authority to extend its \nprotection to State and local government. As Smith had done, this \ndecision made every religious practice by everyone vulnerable to \ngovernment restriction. By these two decisions, the Supreme Court \nensured that no one in America had either constitutional or statutory \nprotection to practice their faith.\n  I introduced the Religious Liberty Protection Act in June 1998 to \nreestablish the religious freedom that the Supreme Court had again \ntaken away, having been an author of the Religious Freedom Restoration \nAct. Like RFRA did, this legislation set a tough legal standard \nreflecting the true status and substance of religious freedom and left \nit to the courts to apply this standard to individual cases. \nUnfortunately, although it had bipartisan support, consideration of \nthis bill stalled in the 105th Congress.\n\n  I next introduced a Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons \nAct to protect religious freedom for as many and as completely as \npossible. It set the same rigorous standard for government interference \nin the practice of religion, requiring that such actions be the least \nrestrictive means of achieving a compelling government purpose. Within \n2 weeks both the Senate and House had passed this legislation without \nobjection. As he had done with RFRA, President Bill Clinton signed this \nlegislation into law.\n  It is shocking how little it took--just two Supreme Court decisions--\nto stall America's centuries-long journey of religious freedom. As a \nresult, the law today does not adequately protect religious freedom. \nYou and I can claim the First Amendment's protection only if the \nFederal Government explicitly targets our religious practice. The First \nAmendment is not available at all when State and local governments \nrestrict or even prohibit religious practice altogether. Even the \nlegislation passed unanimously by Congress is unavailable when State \nand local governments restrict religious freedom.\n  We live in troubled times, and many things we once took for granted \nare being challenged and even attacked. Today the rhetoric about \nreligious freedom does not match the reality.\n  In his 1810 State of the Union Address, President James Madison said \nthat a well-instructed people can alone be a free people. The more we \nunderstand how religious freedom is inalienable and preeminent, how it \nis deep in substance and broad in application, the better equipped we \nare to promote and defend it. Only then will government not only pay \nlipservice to the fundamental right to religious freedom but will \nprovide for and properly accommodate it so that it will be a reality \nfor all of us.\n  These remarks are very important because a lot of people don't \nrealize that religious freedom is not as free as the original Founding \nFathers expected it to be. Even though we have had some very \ninteresting cases, not the least of which was the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act case, we are not there as far as true and noble \nprotection of religious freedom throughout this country.\n  Fortunately, most States do respect this, and fortunately, hopefully, \nmost governmental people respect this as well. But that is not enough. \nWe need to change these things and get religious freedom the preeminent \nposition it really holds as the first clause of the First Amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n             International Commitments on Carbon Emissions\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are a little more than a month away \nfrom the United Nations climate conference in Paris. The countries \ncontinue to roll out their international pledges to reduce carbon \nemissions in an attempt to control global warming. I can't believe it, \nbut this is the 21st year they have done this.\n  I wrote a book once about this, and the last chapter is the longest \nchapter. It talks about the motivation and why the United Nations wants \nto get into this thing and what is in it for them.\n  I think we all know that every time the United Nations does \nsomething, it is contrary to the interest of the United States. We \nwrite a letter, which is usually a threat to withhold funding, and that \nreally gets them upset. Of course, what they really want is to have \nsomething there that they can draw on so that they don't have to be \nobligated to any of the countries that are participating.\n  Anyway, this is not the time to get into that, but I am just saying \nthat this is the 21st year they have had this conference, and every \nyear the same thing happens: The 192 countries get in there and they \nfollow the lead of the United States by saying that they are going to \nbe reducing their emissions, and of course it doesn't happen.\n  In 2009, Copenhagen hosted such a meeting. I remember going over \nthere, and some of the people who attended at that time were Barack \nObama, Hillary Clinton, and John Kerry--Clinton and Kerry were in the \nSenate at that time--Barbara Boxer, and Nancy Pelosi. They all went \nover to assure everyone in Copenhagen that the United States was going \nto pass cap-and-trade legislation.\n  So I waited until they had all finished their business, and I went \nover. It was the shortest trip to Europe I had ever taken. I was there \n3 hours. I was the one-man truth squad. I said: You have been hearing \nfrom all of these leaders, but it is not going to happen. We are not \ngoing to pass it. And of course we didn't.\n  We are going through the same thing now. While the verbal commitments \nare creating positive press coverage for a lot of people who want to \nbelieve this stuff--and the President is seeking to solidify his \nlegacy--most of these pledges are empty and only place the United \nStates in a position of economic hardship, while other countries \ncontinue on their current trajectory with CO2 emissions.\n  Let's start with India. On Friday we received a report from India. I \ndidn't see it personally until 2 days ago. It was the most recent \ncountry to submit its domestic global warming plan. India's plan will \ncost--and I am stating what they have in the plan they have presented--\n$2.5 trillion over the next 15 years. Do the math. That is \napproximately $160 billion a year in costs in order for them to do what \nis expected of them as a developing country. Their pledge is based on a \npremise that developed countries--that is us, the United States, always \npicking up the bills--will pick up these costs by financing the Green \nClimate Fund.\n  President Obama has pledged $3 billion to go to the Green Climate \nFund, but the Senate and House appropriators have pledged zero, \nnothing, no money. If you stop and look at one country, such as India, \nwith an estimated cost of $2.5 trillion, $3 billion is such a minuscule \nfraction, it is not even measurable. That isn't going to happen, and so \nthe President cannot deliver on that promise.\n  India's approach to addressing its carbon emissions is a continuation \nof the rich-poor country divide that has plagued the United Nations \nprocess in achieving climate agreement from the very start. That is \nwhat prompted the Byrd-Hagel resolution of 1997. I remember it so well. \nI was sitting in this Chamber. I had only been here for 3 years at that \ntime. We all agreed to it. It passed 95 to 0. It was unanimous. \nEveryone who was in the Chamber at the time voted for it. It said: We \nare not going to come back. They were really addressing this to Clinton \nand Gore during their administration. Gore had gone down to see his \nfriends in Central America, I guess it was--I am not sure--to put this \nthing together. He said: We are going to join you in this commitment to \nreduce CO2 emissions.\n  Well, that sounded good until they came back and they had the Kyoto \nConvention. They never submitted it to this body because no treaty can \nbe ratified unless it is ratified by the Senate. We never even saw it. \nWhat is the reason for that? The reason is they knew it wouldn't pass \nbecause the Byrd-Hagel amendment--and several of us were cosponsors of \nthat--said that we won't agree and ratify any convention that comes to \nus and doesn't treat the developing countries like the developed \ncountries. Unless it does one of two things, we will reject it: one, if \nit hurts us economically--of course they all do--and two, if China \ndoesn't have to do the same thing we have to do. Well, that is what \nhappened, and of course none of these things have passed.\n\n[[Page S7215]]\n\n  Now the President is trying to do with regulations what he failed to \nbe able to do through legislation, and we are seeing that every day in \nthe committee that I am fortunate enough to chair, the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. All of these rules are coming before us, and \nthese rules are a result of things they tried to do legislatively, but \nthey couldn't do--the WOTUS rule.\n  If you talk to farmers and ranchers in America, they will say that of \nall the regulations that come from the EPA that are the most damaging \nto farmers and ranchers, it is the WOTUS rule, and that is the waters \nof the United States. The Chair is certainly very familiar with this. \nThat means that while we have had State jurisdiction over our water for \nmany years, it had one exception, and that is for navigable waters.\n  I think all of us who are conservatives would agree that the Federal \nGovernment should have jurisdiction over navigable waters because that \naffects a lot more than just States. So they tried to do that with \nlegislation. That legislation was offered 6 years ago by Senator \nFeingold of the Senate, who is from Wisconsin, and Congressman \nOberstar, who is from Minnesota. Not only did we overwhelmingly defeat \ntheir legislation, but we defeated them at the polls in the next \nelection, so it gives you an idea of the unpopularity of this. Since \nthe President was not able to do it with legislation, he tried to do it \nwith regulation. Well, that is the way it is with CO2 \nemissions.\n  So India sent their plan over. They are the third largest \nCO2 emitter, only behind China and the United States. Its \ndemand for coal is expected to surpass U.S. consumption by the end of \nthe decade unless the United States helps front India the cash it needs \nto execute its trillion-dollar climate plan, but that is not happening. \nAs a Member of this body, we will do everything we can to stop it, and \nwe will be successful. We know for a fact that is not what America \nwants to do.\n  Now we have China. It has pledged to peak its carbon emissions around \n2030 and increase its renewables to 20 percent of the primary energy \nuse. Subsequent to its commitment, China also announced a nationwide \ncap-and-trade system alongside a newfound partnership between U.S. \ncities. While all of these commitments--that is, they have partnership \ncities that say ``We will do it in our State if you do it over \nthere''--they sound good to the media, but the facts don't pan out \nbecause it is nothing more than business as usual. At the end of the \nday, the country gets to increase its emissions for the next 15 years. \nHere is what they call an agreement that is in the best interest of \nreducing CO2 worldwide. Yet they are committing not to \nreduce but to increase their emissions for the next 15 years, until \n2030.\n  When they first made their commitment--I called it a nonbinding \ncharade because as China's economy has grown, so has its demand for \nelectricity. China is the largest consumer and importer of coal in the \nworld, accounting for 50 percent of global consumption. Fifty percent \nof the global consumption of coal is in one country--China.\n  Over the next decade, China is expected to bring a new coal-fired \npowerplant online every 10 days to give it the electricity it demands. \nUnlike the United States, China does not have other inexpensive energy \nsources. Where we in the United States are benefiting from cheap \nnatural gas, China doesn't have the technology and resources to do it, \nso they can't do that. Even though we have this huge shale revolution \nin this country where we are producing oil and natural gas--which \nbrings up the other thing we need to do, and that is to do away with \nthe export ban on natural gas and oil. But China doesn't have the \ntechnology to do that, so all they can use is coal. And to continue to \nsupport the world's largest economy, which China is, China will have no \nchoice but to break its promise of hitting its emission peak by 2030, \nand that is not going to happen.\n  Russia has pledged to reduce its carbon emissions between 25 and 30 \npercent by 2030. Here is the sticking point. Russia made this \nprojection based on its carbon emissions baseline of 1990. By playing \nwith numbers, Russia's commitment will actually allow it to increase \nemissions between 700 and 900 tons in 2030.\n  Then there is Mexico, South Korea, and South Africa. All of them will \nhave made pledges not cut emissions but to slow the growth--not to cut \nemissions but slow the growth. In other words, these countries are \ncommitting to increased emissions through 2030. In the meantime, \nPresident Obama is committing the United States to cut--not slow the \ngrowth but cut--its emissions from 26 to 28 percent by 2025. Nobody \nknows how they came to those years. There is no plan that we have seen \nthat would do that. But this promise is also just as hollow as what we \nhave been hearing from these other countries that I previously \nmentioned.\n\n  Not only does the President not have the backing of the Senate and \nthe American people, but outside groups are finding that the \nPresident's methods to achieve these reductions through climate \nregulations--primarily the Clean Power Plan--are faulty. According to a \nrecent analysis by the U.S. Chamber, the President's intended \nnationally determined contribution is about 33 percent short of meeting \nits stated target. So that is not going to work\n  On July 8, David Bookbinder, former Sierra Club chief climate \ncounsel, testified before the committee that I chair about his own \nanalysis that has found an even greater gap. It was in this same \nhearing where it was stated that to close the gap in the President's \nclimate commitment, the United States would likely have to consider \nregulating other industrial sectors, including agriculture. So it is \nnot just oil and gas and some of these emitters. It is everybody, and \nit is not going to happen because it can't happen. It doesn't work.\n  After that committee hearing, I led a letter with 10 other Senators \nto the President requesting a detailed response for just how the United \nStates intends to meet the pledge of 26- to 28-percent emissions \nreduction by 2025. It has been 3 months, and we still haven't received \na response. So they have been saying this. We are saying: How are you \ngoing to do it? Three months have gone by, and we still don't know how \nhe plans to do it.\n  When we go to these other countries, they assume that America is like \nthey are; if the President says it, he means it, and he is going to try \nto make it happen. With his pledge to the international community, the \nPresident is setting up the American economy to suffer great pain for \nno gain.\n  Now, his Clean Power Plan lacks credibility. The EPA does not even \nbother to assess the minuscule environmental benefits associated with \nthe Clean Power Plan and with the cost of the plan. We are talking \nabout something that would be upwards of $400 billion a year. That is \nvery similar to when they tried to do this with cap-and-trade \nlegislation.\n  I had the occasion and I do this: Every time I hear a big number, I \ngo back to my State of Oklahoma and I do a calculation. I find out how \nmany families in my State of Oklahoma filed a Federal tax return, and \nthen I do the math. As it turned out, that would cost about $3,000 per \nfamily. Now, to some people who believe the world is coming to an end \nand global warming is causing it, that might sound like: Well, $3,000 a \nfamily is not that big a deal. But let's remember--and I would remind \nthe Chair--that it was just a short while ago when Lisa Jackson, who \nwas the President's nominee and eventually became the Director of the \nEPA, was asked by me on live TV in our committee: If we do pass any of \nthese things, either by regulation or by legislation, will that have \nthe effect of reducing CO2 emissions worldwide? She said: \nNo, because this isn't where the problem is. It is in China. It is in \nIndia and in these other countries that I mentioned before. So we would \nbe doing that. Even if you are a believer in the doom philosophy, we \nwould be doing it in a way that is not going to work.\n  So despite all the costs they have, the President's climate \nregulations would only reduce CO2 concentrations by 0.2 \npercent. Global average temperature rise would be--would be, I say, not \nwill be but would be--reduced only by .0016 degrees Farenheit. It could \nnot even be measurable. And the sea level rise would be reduced by 0.2 \nmillimeters, which is the thickness of two human hairs.\n  So it is no wonder the President is working so hard to circumvent\n\n[[Page S7216]]\n\nCongress's role in committing the United States to the agreement.\n  I only say this because we are now getting close to December and we \nhave been through this so many times before, and this isn't going to be \nany different. There is going to be a difference, and that is that they \nare not going to attempt to do it by passing legislation. They want to \ncircumvent Congress because they know Congress reports to the people \nand the people don't want this.\n  I can remember when global warming--when they had their annual Gallup \npoll every March. It used to be that when asked what were the critical \nconcerns about America, global warming was always--in 2002, 2003, 2004, \nand 2005--between first and second place of the greatest concern. Do we \nknow what it is today? Out of 15, it is number 15. So the people have \ncaught on. They know it will be the largest tax increase in history and \nthat it will not accomplish anything.\n\n  Mr. President, what is our timing situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are no time limitations.\n\n\n                  National Defense Authorization Bill\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to make some other comments because \nsomething very good happened, and it is not normally the case. We \npassed the Defense authorization bill. Here we are in the midst of over \ntwo decades of wars and we are being challenged on all fronts--from \nnational states to terrorist organizations and extremists to cyber and \nlone-wolf attacks. Our military is directly engaged in Asia, Africa, \nEastern Europe, Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq, and the demands that this \ncountry is placing on them continues to increase. It is greater than \nanything I have ever seen in the years I have been here and probably \nthe greatest in history in terms of the numbers of threats to America \nfrom different countries.\n  Yesterday we voted to pass the National Defense Authorization Act, or \nthe NDAA, for the 54th consecutive year. I have been worried. The last \nfew years we ended up passing it not this early but passing it in \nDecember. If we had gone to December 31 in those years or even in this \nyear, all of a sudden our people wouldn't get hazard pay and they \nwouldn't get reenlistment bonuses and we couldn't let that happen. So I \nam glad we did it earlier this year. I think it is the most important \nbill we pass every year.\n  It is our constitutional duty to provide oversight over the President \nand his administration. There is an old wornout document that nobody \nreads anymore. It is called the Constitution. If we read article I, \nsection 8 of the Constitution, it tells us what we are supposed to be \ndoing--No. 1, defending America, and No. 2, roads and highways. I am \nvery glad we passed the highway bill. It is over in the House, and I am \noptimistic they will be able to pass it over there as well.\n  So the Constitution says the most important thing we do is defending \nAmerica. It is our constitutional duty to do it.\n  The NDAA contains provisions that take care of military men and \nwomen--the pay, the benefits, the bonuses, the new starts, the \nreenlistment bonuses, military construction, and all of this stuff. \nThis bill addresses things such as additional protections for victims \nof sexual assault. It is a good bill, and most of the members of this \ncommittee have been to the floor today and have talked about.\n  I just wanted to mention a couple of things that may have been \noverlooked by some of the other speakers. They should be focusing on \naccomplishing their missions instead of wondering if this bill \nauthorizes spending priorities critical to our national security and \nsupports the resources requirement of the Department of Defense. While \nthis bill does not contain every provision that the Senate wanted, that \nI wanted, that the House wanted, and that the President would like to \nhave, the final language is overall good policy for our national \ndefense. It provides authorizations in a timely manner. This vital \npiece of legislation sets the course for our national security and \nprovides for our Nation's nearly 2.1 million all-volunteer force.\n  I was a product of the draft many years ago. I have often said that \nis one of the things that this country probably ought to go back to. We \nwouldn't have a lot of the problems today if we had to have kids go \nthrough the discipline and the appreciation for our country. But \nnonetheless, this is an all-volunteer force, and it has worked \nbeautifully.\n  I make it a point, when I go to Afghanistan or Iraq or Africa and \nthese places where we have troops stationed, to sit down in the mess \nhalls, to go out in the field and eat with them or listen to the \nproblems they have and try to boost them up a little bit because they \nknow that under this administration, which I have called the disarming \nof America, defending America is not the high priority that it should \nbe. This is a time when each service chief, secretary, and combatant \ncommander has testified that no service will be able to meet the \nwartime requirements under sequestration.\n  The President and many people in this body wanted sequestration to \ntake place but only for domestic purposes as well as military, and we \nare saying this is where the problem is. Let's look at Secretary \nCarter, our Secretary of Defense. He said recently:\n\n       Readiness remains at troubling levels across the force. \n     Even with the fiscal year 2016 budget, the Army, Navy, and \n     Marine Corps won't reach their readiness goals until 2020 and \n     the Air Force until 2023.\n\n  At a time when former Secretary Hagel says--listen to this. I don't \nknow why more people in America didn't hear this. This is the Secretary \nof Defense, Secretary Hagel, who said: ``American dominance in seas, in \nthe skies, and in space can no longer be taken for granted.'' This is \nAmerica, and people are thinking that the President might even veto \nthis bill.\n  Admiral Winnefeld, who is Vice Chief of Staff, said: ``There could be \nfor the first time in my career instances where we may be asked to \nrespond to a crisis and we will have to say that we cannot.''\n  General Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says we are \nputting our military on a path where ``the force is so degraded and so \nunready'' that it would be ``immoral to use it.''\n  General Dempsey labels it ``unlike any in his lifetime.''\n  So the passage of this legislation is absolutely necessary. We have \npassed it. We have done the responsible thing. And I think we need to \nbe sure that we use full pressure to make sure the President does not \nveto this bill, because he is toying with a veto.\n  We have never seen anything like this in the history of this country. \nWe have a level of threat to America, and we are going to have to make \nsure that we pass this bill. I am very proud that it was passed by the \nmajority in the Senate.\n  I know I am the last speaker tonight. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum, just to see if there is any last message that has to be given.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This year, Coastal Ridge Elementary was \none of only 335 schools across the country and one of only two schools \nfrom Maine to receive this prestigious recognition of high \naccomplishment by the U.S. Department of Education.\n  Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Award honors schools that \nare either academically superior in their States or that demonstrate \nsignificant gains in student achievement. The schools singled out for \nthis national recognition are models of high educational standards and \naccountability.\n\n[[Page S7217]]\n\n  This award recognizes Coastal Ridge Elementary as a model of \nexcellence and high achievement. The students' success can be \nattributed to the school's focus on creating a healthy climate where \nadults model respect and selflessness. Principal Sean Murphy noted that \nwhile the award is based on exemplary test scores in math and reading, \nthe school's emphasis on the arts, sciences, and social development has \ncontributed to the students' overall achievement.\n  I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has selected \nCoastal Ridge Elementary School for this well-deserved honor and \ncongratulate not only the students, but also the administrators, \nteachers, staff, and parents on this outstanding achievement.

This year, Minot Consolidated was one of only 335 \nschools across the country and one of only two schools from Maine to \nreceive this prestigious recognition of high accomplishment by the U.S. \nDepartment of Education.\n  Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools award honors schools that \nare either academically superior in their States or that demonstrate \nsignificant gains in student achievement. The schools singled out for \nthis national recognition are models of high educational standards and \naccountability.\n  With just 240 students from prekindergarten to sixth grade, Minot \nConsolidated takes pride in a strong sense of community that \ncontributes to the success of its students. Staff, families, and \ncommunity members have come together to create a welcoming school \nenvironment where students are challenged, motivated, and rewarded for \ngood work. Self-confidence and personal responsibility are strongly \nencouraged and have produced positive results for Minot Consolidated's \nhigh-achieving student body.\n  I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has selected Minot \nConsolidated School for this well-deserved honor and congratulate not \nonly the students, but also the administrators, teachers, staff, and \nparents on this outstanding achievement. Together, they are making a \ndifference in the lives of hundreds of students by helping them become \nenergetic learners and engaged citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/07/senate-section/article/S7217-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7217]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                TRIBUTE TO ETHEL LA ROCK AND ANDREW KIM\n\n Mr. DAINES.

Despite \nhis retirement and to the delight of the people of Maine, Mr. \nShettleworth will continue to hold the esteemed position of Maine's \nState historian.\n  Mr. Shettleworth's interest in historic preservation was sparked when \nhe was just 13 years old, after witnessing the destruction of \nPortland's Union Station. Shortly after this defining event, Mr. \nShettleworth became the youngest founding member of Greater Portland \nLandmarks and has had a distinguished career in public service ever \nsince. Throughout his life, Earle has greatly appreciated architecture \nand art, which have added to his passion and devotion to preserving \nMaine's history.\n  Mr. Shettleworth has served on a wide range of historical commissions \nand societies, including the Maine Historic Preservation Commission. \nDuring his years with the commission, Earle helped designate over 1,500 \nproperties in Maine as historic places in the National Register, and by \nthe time he retired, he was the longest serving State historic \npreservation officer in the United States.\n  Mr. Shettleworth holds a bachelor's degree from Colby College and a \nmaster's degree from the American and\n\n[[Page S7218]]\n\nNew England Studies Program at Boston University. He has published \ndozens of articles and authored numerous books. As a reporter at the \nPortland Evening Express, Mr. Shettleworth authored a series of 52 \narticles called ``Portland Heritage,'' which explored the history of \nthe city's notable buildings. Mr. Shettleworth has received honorary \ndoctorates of humane letters from Bowdoin College and the Maine College \nof Art for his scholarship in the fields of history, historical \npreservation, and art history.\n  I would like to join the Maine Historic Preservation Commission and \nthe people of Maine in recognizing and thanking Mr. Shettleworth for \nhis tireless work and dedication to the great State of Maine. Earle not \nonly preserved Maine's history, but also inspired greater public \ninterest in our State's rich heritage. The State of Maine owes Mr. \nShettleworth immensely for all his hard work, and we cannot begin to \nthank him enough.

Following graduation, he \nattended Yeoman ``A'' School in Meridian, MS. He reported to his first \nsea assignment with the Seabees assigned to Naval Mobile Construction \nBattalion 7. He later reported to the USS Rainier, AOE-7, participating \nin Operations Southern Watch and Enduring Freedom and earning his \nenlisted surface and air warfare pins. His final sea assignment was \nwith Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron 2 out of Whidbey Island, WA.\n  Yeoman Chief Petty Officer Cook also served with distinction in a \nvariety of assignments ashore: as executive assistant to the Deputy \nChief of Staff--Operations and Intelligence, Supreme Headquarters \nAllied Powers Europe in Mons, Belgium; and as a naval analyst with the \nspecial liaison detachment, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, \nBrussels, Belgium.\n  After completing his last sea tour, yeoman Chief Petty Officer Cook \nreported to his current assignment as congressional liaison in the Navy \nAppropriations Matters Office, where he helped the Department of the \nNavy achieve their financial and legislative goals. For 5 years, yeoman \nChief Petty Officer Cook has demonstrated exceptional leadership and \nforesight, engaging Members of the Appropriations Committee and its \nstaff to provide information essential to resourcing the Navy for its \nrole as the world's dominant sea power. In an increasingly difficult \nbudget environment, he provided essential support in shepherding four \nNavy budgets through the appropriations process, serving our Navy with \ninsight and dedication.\n  I join my colleagues today in saying thank you to yeoman CPO Mikel S. \nCook for his extraordinary dedication to duty and steadfast service to \nthis country throughout his distinguished career in the U.S. Navy.

A bill to provide for the adjustment of status of certain \nnationals of Liberia to that of lawful permanent residents and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am pleased to reintroduce the \nLiberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act along with Senators \nWhitehouse, Klobuchar, Warren, and Franken. \n  This bill, which I have introduced every Congress since 1999, seeks \nto provide a path to citizenship for qualifying Liberian refugees who \ncame here decades ago to escape Liberia's civil wars. Since this time, \nthey have been in our country legally through short term extensions of \nTemporary Protected Status and Deferred Enforced Departure. After years \nof uncertainty about whether they will be able to stay in their \ncommunities or whether their families will be split up, this bill give \neligible Liberians the chance to apply for legal permanent residency, \nand begin the process of finally becoming citizens.\n  Similar safeguards were included in the last Comprehensive \nImmigration Reform bill that the Senate passed, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to provide this critical and long overdue \nsupport for our Liberian community.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself, Mr. Daines, and Mr. Gardner):\n  S. 2163. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to direct the \nSecretary of Transportation to require that broadband conduits be \ninstalled as a part of certain highway construction projects, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, as a fifth generation Montanan, I have \nseen firsthand the struggles rural America faces when it comes to \nbroadband connectivity. I worked in the cloud computing industry for 13 \nyears, so I also know the opportunities created by technology and \nconnectivity.\n  Not only does access to broadband connect rural Americans and tribal \ncommunities to the rest of the world, but there are many farming \napplications that will enable farmers in Montana to be more efficient \nand equip them to feed the growing population. Despite the importance \nof connecting these communities, Montana remains ranked among the worst \nStates for broadband connectivity and there are too many instances \nwhere the Federal Government stands in the way of broadband \ninfrastructure deployment. This is especially important for States like \nMontana where 29 percent of the State is federally owned. Every Federal \nagency has their own set of requirements for siting infrastructure on \nFederal lands, and the process can take up to 10 years in some cases. \nThis burdensome, bureaucratic process is driving industry away from \nserving rural America and tribal lands.\n  That is why I am proud to introduce the bipartisan Streamlining and \nInvesting in Broadband Infrastructure act with my colleagues Senator \nKlobuchar and Senator Gardner. The bill implements a dig once policy \nthat incorporates broadband conduit installation into new highway \nprojects.
