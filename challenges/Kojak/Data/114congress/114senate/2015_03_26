Mr. President, for years, the Democrat-led Senate \nrefused to pass a balanced budget. It usually failed to produce any \nbudget at all. Maybe this made the special interests happy, but it was \ninfuriating for many in the middle class. These Americans called for \nchange.\n  Today, a Senate under new management is delivering that change. The \nnew Senate is prepared to pass a balanced budget with ideas that could \nboost jobs, raise annual wages by as much as $5,000 per family, and \ndrive economic growth for hard-working Americans. That is what the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office tells us, and it is no wonder.\n  This balanced budget would embrace the energy revolution and allow \nfor more environmentally responsible innovations. It would repeal \nunfair taxes such as those in ObamaCare and set the table for more \ncomprehensive replacement of the outdated Tax Code with one that is \nsimpler and more effective. And it would provide tools finally to \nrepeal and replace ObamaCare itself, leaving the law's higher costs and \nbroken promises where they belong--in the past--in favor of a fresh \nstart and the opportunity for real health reform.\n  So while this balanced budget might upset special interests, that is \nOK, because it is focused on the middle class instead. It is focused on \nhelping the most vulnerable too.\n  Here is what we know about important programs such as Medicare. We \ncan make commonsense improvements to save these programs today or we \ncan allow draconian cuts to fall on the most vulnerable in the years \nahead. These are essentially our only two options. We can't tax the \nproblem away. Denying the facts won't help either.\n  So we invite all of our friends to join us as positive reformers, not \ninsensitive deniers. Let's work together to improve Medicaid as this \nbalanced budget proposes. While our balanced budget cannot solve every \nchallenge, it will move us further down the path of positive reform. It \nwill make government more efficient, more effective, and more \naccountable to the middle class.\n  The budget also contains a good-faith compromise to begin the \nlegislative process for the Defense authorization bill we will consider \nlater this year, when additional OCO funds can be prudently reallocated \nagainst the actual procurement and modernization needs of our military, \nif only for the coming fiscal year. This is the best strategy, short of \nrevising the BCA, for keeping faith with our armed services, and it is \nthe best option we currently have for leaving the next President in a \nbetter position to face global challenges.\n  So I wish to thank Chairman Enzi for all of his good work in putting \nthis balanced budget together. It certainly wasn't easy. It is a good \nbalanced budget that everyone should want to support.\n  That is especially true when we compare it to the other alternatives \nhere. It is the only alternative, actually, since our friends still \ndon't seem to be in the habit of producing a budget of their own.\n  The alternative on offer was the budget we voted on Tuesday from \nPresident Obama. Someone called it the left's dream budget. But that \ndream ended up being so unserious and embarrassing that not more than a \nsingle Democrat could muster the courage to vote for it. In a way, it \nis hard to blame our friends. It would be pretty embarrassing and \ninsensitive to support a budget that contains trillions more in \noverspending, almost $2 trillion more in taxes, and hardly any serious \nideas to save the programs for the most vulnerable.\n  No wonder this budget went down in flames 98 to 1--98 to 1. That was \nthe vote on the President's budget. That 98, by the way, was against \nthe President's budget.\n  So only one budget remains. It is a balanced budget that will focus \non growth, common sense, and the middle class. It isn't perfect, but it \ndoes represent honest compromise and the promise of a better tomorrow.\n\n[[Page S1960]]\n\n  If Senators would prefer to amend it, they will have that opportunity \nthis evening. Members of both parties will be able to offer amendments. \nI know many of our friends across the aisle are eager to do that. \nRepublicans will have their chance too. There is a lot we expect to \nconsider.\n  For instance, do Senators want to be seen supporting a policy that \ncosts up to a million jobs or will they stand tall for American jobs \ninstead? Will Senators support more tired tax hikes or will they \nsupport the jobs those higher taxes threaten to destroy? And do \nSenators want to raise the cost of energy or do they want to see the \nAmerican people reap benefits of our energy revolution?\n  So tonight, the American people will have their voices heard again in \nthe Senate under new management. They will see a new Congress that is \nback to work again and on their behalf. After considering all of these \namendments, we will take a vote. When the budget passes, we will \nconference with the House. That is how this process has worked \nhistorically. It is what the American people have a right to expect \nnow, and that is what we hope to see again shortly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S1960-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation between Senator \nSanders and Senator Enzi in our arriving at the point we are now. The \nRepublicans have a totally different vision of what the country is and \nshould be than we have, but the debate between these two good Senators \nhas been civil. It has been very polite. It is the way things should \nhappen around here. So I appreciate that very much.\n  The Republican budget makes clear the priorities of the Republicans. \nRepublicans would get two-thirds of their cuts from low-income \nAmericans, but they would not plug one single loophole for corporations \nor the rich--and I mean the mega rich--not a penny. They would double \ndown on harmful sequestration, which is when automatic cuts occur \nacross the board. We know how disastrous this has been.\n  For the 1 year it was in effect--take, for example, the National \nInstitutes of Health--almost $2 billion they lost that 1 year.\n  On the floor is the senior Senator from the State of Illinois. I have \nheard him speak here on the floor about what a difficult time the \npeople at NIH are having because they don't have enough money to do \nbasic research. The sequestration that was put upon us last time caused \nthe NIH to stop their research on a universal flu vaccine. Hundreds of \nthousands of people die around the world every year, and tens of \nthousands of people die every year in the United States because of flu. \nThey were close to having a universal flu vaccine that would take care \nof this.\n  Sequestration is awful. It is part of the Republican budget. They are \ndoubling down on this harmful sequestration on health, education, and \neven national defense.\n  Talk about a gimmick. This is a doozy, what they are trying to do \nwith defense, to try to pretend they are going to put $38 billion more \nin the Defense budget. But it is pretend, because even looking at the \nRepublican budget, it is not possible to do. Once even the Republican \nhawks look at this, they will say: Well, maybe we are not going to get \nthat $38 billion.\n  So their budget has lots of gimmicks--lots of gimmicks. It has been \nwritten about all over the country in editorials from east to west and \nfrom north to south.\n  Fortunately for the country, the Republican budget will not become \nlaw.\n  Will the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S1960-4", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this has been an important week for the \nSenate as we work to set spending goals for our Nation. Before this \nyear, the Senate has only been able to pass two budgets in the past 6 \nyears. Now that Congress is under new management, we are on track to \npass a budget after only 3 months.\n  The reason we are working so hard is to restore the trust of the \nAmerican people, who want and deserve more effective and efficient \ngovernment. This week, as part of the Senate's regular order, we have \nbeen debating and offering amendments and have actually voted more than \na dozen times on how best to set spending limits and make government \nlive within its means, including votes to protect property rights of \nall Americans and to save Medicare.\n  The spending goals and limits we have set are why passing a budget is \nso\n\n[[Page S1962]]\n\nimportant to our Nation. They let congressional policymakers who \nactually allocate the dollars get to work by following our spending \nlimits. Without that, they are delayed.\n  We have had that situation for a number of years, in which the fiscal \nyear actually ends and we don't have the spending bills done. That is \nwhat happens with government shutdowns. That is what happens with \nextending its ability to operate without having a budget. That \nshouldn't happen.\n  So we want to get a budget passed by April 15 so that the spending \ncommittees can get busy looking at their areas of jurisdiction, their \nspecific areas of interest, to come up with the best policies possible \nthat have a total spending package that will keep government operating \nand meeting its objectives as the people expect.\n  But today is the day for which we all have been waiting. Today the \nSenate will begin voting on many amendments offered this week by way of \nwhat is affectionately known as a vote-arama. We will start voting \nearly this afternoon, and we will continue until we are exhausted, \nuntil we are done, until people think their amendments have been \ncovered sufficiently. That is the way we do it in the Senate.\n\n  The Senate debate on this balanced budget demonstrates that Congress \nis doing its part to deliver a healthy economy for each and every \nAmerican. The important first steps we have taken this week will help \ndeliver a government that is more accountable, which is absolutely \nessential for strong job growth and job creation. This budget will help \nevery American who wants to find a good-paying job and a fulfilling \ncareer.\n  I am incredibly proud of my colleagues who are working together to \ndeliver real solutions, real results, and real progress for hard-\nworking taxpayers.\n  I find this a little bit stressful. I am an accountant. I have found \na way to escape some of that tension. I have been reading the Tax Code, \nand it is time for us to reform the Tax Code. There are hundreds of \npages on minor decisions, on different ways of calculating it, and I am \nexcited that we are going to do that. One of the things both sides of \nthe aisle have talked about is speculation on tax reform. Tax reform \nneeds to be done in a bipartisan way. I know the chairman of the \nFinance Committee and the ranking member on the Finance Committee have \nalready been working on it. We have subgroups set up to solve different \nparts of the Tax Code, and I am confident we can do that. There are \ngeneral instructions in the budget bill that allow some latitude to the \nFinance Committee in a number of different ways, and I am hoping we can \nwind up with a simpler Tax Code, one that will not take care of my \nfrustrations in future years, but will ease the frustrations of the \nAmerican people as to taxes.\n  There has been a lot of speculation on where budget cuts are being \nmade. I know there is a lot of frustration on the other side. Our \nbudget sets limits for the different spending groups. It doesn't get \ninto the details. The people who know the details in those areas are on \nthe committees, and they can make better decisions than we as the \nBudget Committee can make. I do point out frequently that part of my \ndiscovery during this process was that there are 260 programs whose \nauthorizations have expired. That means the specific committees that \ncame up with the idea for these programs haven't looked at them for \nsome time, and that didn't stop us from going ahead and funding them \nanyway. They have expired, but in some cases we are spending four times \nas much as what was originally envisioned for that particular program. \nDoes it amount to much money? It amounts to $293 billion a year--$293 \nbillion a year. If the committees do their work, there is a lot of \nmoney available for the areas outside of defense.\n  Defense has its authorization done every year, so they are in a \ndifferent category from all of the rest of the Federal Government \nprograms. So if you are thinking there are a lot of hands tied on what \ncan be done, there is $293 billion out there that is being spent that \nhas expired and ought to be looked at. In businesses, they have to look \nat their expenses every single year and see where they can cut in order \nto continue the business. Around here one of those programs hasn't been \nlooked at since 1983.\n  So there is a lot of work for us to do. It is all included in the \nbudget. I hope we can finish the budget tonight and put everybody to \nwork on these extra tasks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I heard my friend from Wyoming say he is \nrelieving his stress over the budget by reading the Tax Code. In my \nreligion, when you go to confession, you are given a penance for your \nsins. I cannot think of a more awesome penance than reading the Tax \nCode. I certainly hope it gives my friend from Wyoming a good frame of \nmind as he attacks this vote-arama.\n  I am going to be brief because our ranking member on the budget has \narrived on the floor, but I do want to say this: Budgets make choices, \nand there are one or two choices--certainly more than one or two but \none or two that I would like to highlight that I think are worrisome.\n  The Republican budget eliminates health insurance for 27 million \nAmericans. That is 9 percent of people in America who would lose their \nhealth insurance protection because of the Republican budget. Part of \nit is the passionate refusal of the Republicans to accept the \nAffordable Care Act, which now in itself protects 15 to 16 million \nAmericans. We have said to them, if you don't like the Affordable Care \nAct, give us an alternative, and they have yet to do so--and, frankly, \nbecause it is fairly difficult, as it was passing this bill. But to \ntake health insurance away from 27 million Americans and say that is \ngoing to make a better life for working families? No, it will not. It \nwill make a bigger challenge for these families which will be extremely \ndifficult.\n  Secondly, I am worried and I think other Members from both sides of \nthe aisle share concerns about sequestration cuts when it comes to \nareas such as biomedical research. How in the world can we justify \ncutting research from the National Institutes of Health to find cures \nfor diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes--the list goes on. \nIf we believe we are making a better America by cutting back research \nand innovation, particularly biomedical research, it is extremely \nshortsighted. When I take a look at the 200 or so pending amendments on \nbudget resolution, it looks like there are 10 of them--including one I \nam going to offer--relative to medical research. Democrats and \nRepublicans are saying spare this area of Federal spending. I would \nlike to propose that all of us who share this goal on both sides of the \naisle join in an effort to make sure this is treated differently in our \nbudget. It shouldn't be subject to mindless and deep cuts in biomedical \nresearch, which will deny to a lot of suffering people the hope they \nneed and deny cures that will not only save lives but save dramatic \namounts of money.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, when we look at budgets, we look \nessentially at two things. First off, we look at what the budget \nactually does, because it is a set of priorities, and we look at what \nthe budget does not do.\n  Any sensible group of people, whether it is a family, whether it is \nlocal government, State government, whether it is a business--people \nsit around the table and say, OK, these are our needs, this is what we \nhave to address or this is no longer relevant or this is wasteful and \nwe have to get rid of it. That is what a budget process is about.\n  When you examine the Republican budget, it almost seems they turn \nthat equation upside down and they do everything we should not be doing \nand they don't do what we should be doing. The overall reality of \nAmerica that most people understand is the middle class of this country \nfor the last 40 years has been shrinking. Yes, we are in a lot better \nshape today than we were when President Bush left office, but real \nunemployment is 11 percent. We have the highest rate of childhood \npoverty in the industrialized world. Despite the modest gains to the \nAffordable Care Act, 35 million Americans still have no health \ninsurance. Millions of families--whether it is in Nevada or Vermont--\nare wondering how in God's name they are going to be able to send their \nkids to college when school is so expensive. What happens to those\n\n[[Page S1963]]\n\nyoung people when they leave school deeply in debt?\n  People are working in Vermont, in Nevada, in Wyoming for horrendously \nlow wages because we have a minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, and people \nare wondering why it is that they work 40 hours a week and still have \nto go to the emergency food shelf to put food on the table. Those are \nsome of the issues the American people are talking about and they are \nthinking about, and they wonder, How does it happen that while they are \nworking longer hours for low wages, the people on top and the large \nprofitable corporations are doing phenomenally well? How does it happen \nthat in the last 2 years, 14 of the wealthiest people in this country \nhave seen a $157 billion increase in their wealth? How does it happen \nthat one family, the Walton family, owns more wealth than the bottom 40 \npercent of the American people? How does it happen that 99 percent of \nall new income generated in America since the Wall Street crash goes to \nthe top 1 percent?\n  Those are the issues the American people are wondering about. Why, \nwith an increase in productivity, am I working longer hours for lower \nwages? Why, if I am a woman worker, do I make 78 cents on the dollar \ncompared to a male worker? Those are the questions.\n  Then you look at the Republican budget. The Republican budget does \nnothing to address the real problems except to make them worse. One of \nthe problems, to be very frank, and works to the Republicans' \nadvantage--and I have to say this, frankly--the Republican budget is so \noutrageous that when we explain it, people don't believe what we are \nsaying. Senator Durbin made the point--no debate here--if I am wrong, \nsomebody jump up and correct me. The Republican budget eliminates the \nAffordable Care Act, right? It does that, and 16 million Americans lose \ntheir health insurance--16 million people have no health insurance. But \nthat is not enough. The Republican budget cuts over $400 billion in \nMedicaid. That is another 11 million people losing their health \ninsurance--16 plus 11 is 27 million people losing health insurance.\n  Does anybody in America think that makes any sense at all? These are \nmen, women, children. You cut Medicaid and you throw people off. These \nare pregnant women who need to go to the doctor to make sure the baby \nthey are carrying is healthy or little babies who are born. That is \nwhat they do.\n  But meanwhile, here is something they do not do. When they get up \nthere and say this budget does not include any tax increases, they are \nright. I can see that. They are right. But what they are really saying \nis: We will not--we will never ask the billionaires in this country to \npay a nickel more in taxes. We will not ask the one out of four major \ncorporations that pay nothing in taxes to start paying their fair share \nof taxes. We will make it harder for kids to go to college, we will \nthrow people off of health insurance, but we will not ask the rich and \nthe powerful to pay more in taxes.\n  That is what this budget debate is about, and I hope the American \npeople pay attention to that.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 689\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up my amendment No. 689.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Portman] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 689.\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n          (Purpose: To improve the dynamic scoring provision)\n\n       On page 104, line 16, after ``shall provide'' insert ``, in \n     addition to the estimate of budgetary effects without \n     macroeconomic effects, an estimate of the budgetary effects \n     from changes in economic output, employment, capital stock, \n     interest rates, and other macroeconomic variables resulting \n     from the major legislation and''\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, we had an energetic discussion this \nmorning about the budget that is before us. The amendment I am going to \noffer will help us have a better process to get to pro-growth tax \nreform to actually get this economy growing.\n  My colleague, Senator Sanders, talked about the fact that real \nunemployment is far higher than the numbers that are officially \nreported. I agree with him on that. I agree with him that the economy \nis not out of the woods, and I agree with him that a lot of people are \nleft behind and will continue to be until we get this economy growing \nthe way you normally see an economy grow during a recovery. It is the \nweakest economic recovery, economists tell us, since the Great \nDepression; that is, measured in terms of economic growth, GDP, and in \nterms of job growth.\n  So what this budget does is it puts in place the process for us to \nactually get pro-growth on policies: yes, on health care; yes, on \ntaxes, on regulations, and so on to be able to move the economy \nforward. It was President John F. Kennedy who said that ``a rising tide \nlifts all boats.'' Now, some people get stuck on the shoals and we need \nto take care of them too. That is why this budget also has a strong \nsafety net necessary to get economic growth--not sufficient but \nnecessary. That is what this budget does.\n  By the way, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office--not the \nRepublicans, not I--the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office looks \nat this budget and says, you know what. By balancing the budget in 10 \nyears--balancing the budget--therefore, reducing the amount of deficits \nand the huge debt overhang--a record level of debt we have in our \ncountry right now--that will result in more economic growth and more \njobs. That is what the Congressional Budget Office said. So this notion \nthat somehow by actually dealing with the debt and deficit and by \nactually having a balanced budget is bad for the economy--it is just \nthe opposite. This is a first but incredibly important step to getting \nthis economy back on track and to bringing back these jobs.\n  By the way, this is about not just economic growth but about better \njobs, about rising wages, and it is about getting to a situation where \ninstead of having wages going down--which is what has been happening \nover the last 6 years--we can actually see wages go up. On average, \nwages have gone down about 8 percent. So for working families in Ohio \nand around this country, we have seen wages go down 8 percent. By the \nway, half of that reduction in wages came during the so-called \nrecovery. So something is not working. Part of what is not working is \nrunning these hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit every year and \nspending more than this place takes in every year and building up these \nlevels of debt that are unprecedented--over $18 trillion.\n  We did vote on the President's budget yesterday. It is the only \nalternative we have to be able to compare what this side of the aisle \nwants to do and what the other side of the aisle wants to do. In the \nbudget the President put out, there was an $8 trillion increase--\nincrease--in the debt over the next 10 years. That is adding to the \nover $7 trillion of debt that has been added over the last 6 years \nunder the Obama administration. That may be why not a lot of people \nvoted for the budget that the President presented. In fact, only one \nperson did--1 out of 100. The reason is, it adds so much more debt and \nso much more in annual deficits that it actually puts that wet blanket \nover the economy and doesn't enable us to see the economic growth we \nwant.\n  So one element of growth, as the chairman of the Budget Committee \ntalked about this morning, is tax reform. I think everybody \nacknowledges that our Tax Code is antiquated. It is out of date. It is \ninefficient. It does not let us compete around the world. So workers in \nOhio are competing with one hand tied behind their backs because our \nTax Code is so inefficient that it does not let them compete \neffectively around the world.\n  So let's reform the Tax Code. Everybody who looks at it--economists \nright, left, or center--agrees the Tax Code does not work. They have \ndifferent ideas on how to fix it, but they all say: if you could fix \nthis Tax Code, you would see more growth.\n  By the way, you would see not just more jobs but better jobs. If you \nlook\n\n[[Page S1964]]\n\nat the issue of business tax reform--there is actually a lot of \nsimilarity between what the administration is talking about and what \nMembers of Congress on my side of the aisle are talking about. The \neconomic analysis there is that the No. 1 impact of having the highest \nbusiness tax rate in all the developed world is on wages and benefits. \nThe No. 1 beneficiary will be workers because they are going to see \ntheir wages go up and they are going to see their benefits go up. These \nare the middle-class jobs we want to create in this country.\n  So let's have this tax reform. Let's make sure it is pro-growth.\n  Now back to this amendment and why it is so important to that. This \nis an amendment that says: Let's require the Joint Committee on \nTaxation--that is the group who handles scoring those tax reform \nproposals--to give us the right analysis so we can come up with pro-\njob, pro-growth tax reform that will actually enable us to bring back \nthese good middle-class jobs. That is what this amendment says. It \nrequires them to provide us what is called macroeconomic scoring.\n  Right now, unbelievably, when you provide a tax reform proposal on \nthe floor of the Senate, what you get back is just a static score that \nhas no relationship to what the impact will be on the economy. It \nassumes there will be zero impact on the economy. Now, nobody believes \nthat. Everyone knows tax changes will have some impact on the economy--\ngood, bad, indifferent--yet we do not have that information to be able \nto ensure that we are writing the right tax reform to get to the result \nwe all want. It seems absurd, I know, but that is the current \nsituation.\n  What this amendment says is, let's have a requirement that the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation provide to the Senate a dynamic score, a \nmacroeconomic score. By the way, they already do it. They already have \na model to do it. They just do not provide it to us. Would there be a \nso-called static score, too, that shows no economic changes? Yes, you \nwould have that too. I cannot imagine that any Member of this body, \nRepublican or Democrat, would not want to have that information, would \nnot want to know what the actual impact is on the economy.\n  Think about this: If McDonald's raises the price of its Big Mac to \n$10 or $12, what is going to happen? Under a static score, it would \nsay: McDonald's will get more revenue. We know what will happen. We \nwill not go to McDonald's and our kids will not go to McDonald's \nbecause it is too expensive. The revenue will go down.\n  We need to have that kind of commonsense analysis here on the floor \nof the Senate so we can, indeed, put forward tax reform that makes \nsense for the economy and makes sense to the American people and helps \nto do precisely what Senator Sanders talks about, which is to get that \nunemployment number down and provide better jobs, higher paying jobs. \nIf we do not do that, we are letting down the people we are elected to \nrepresent.\n  I hope this amendment No. 689 is supported by Democrats and \nRepublicans alike as a commonsense approach to this. Let's apply \nmacroeconomic analysis to anything that is a tax reform proposal over \n$15 billion. That is the right level. The House has similar analysis in \ntheir legislation, so this could actually end up being something on \nwhich the House and Senate can agree.\n  Let's ensure that we have the information we need to write the right \nkind of legislation to get this economy moving and to deal with both \nsides of the coin. One, spending restraint--and we all know that has to \nhappen--and two, growth, get this economy moving. If we do that, we \nwill see more gross revenues and be able to make this objective we have \nset out in this budget, which is to actually, for the American people, \nwho cannot understand why we cannot do it, balance this budget. They \nhave to balance their budgets. We have to in our families. We have to \nin our businesses. We have to in our States. We ought to do it here in \nthe Congress as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                  Amendments Nos. 415 and 416 En Bloc\n\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment to call up amendments Nos. 415 and 416 en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are called up en bloc.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 415\n\n (Purpose: To establish a spending-neutral reserve fund relating to a \n requirement that any new environmental agreement signed by the United \nStates with any foreign country or countries not result in serious harm \n                  to the economy of the United States)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___.

Mr. President, I wish to briefly address these two \namendments. The first amendment simply says that the United States \nshould not sign an international environmental agreement that would do \nserious harm to our own economy. That commonsense principle passed the \nSenate by a vote of 95 to 0 in 1997.\n  Last year, the administration announced the climate agreement with \nChina. That agreement requires significant short-term carbon emission \nreductions here in the United States, but China is allowed to continue \nincreasing its carbon emissions until 2030. That disparity could place \nthe United States at a significant economic disadvantage. In November, \nglobal talks began in Paris on a broader international agreement.\n  My amendment simply states what every Senator who voted in 1997 said: \nNo agreement should cause serious harm to the American economy.\n  My second amendment protects the reliability of our electricity grid. \nNorth American Electric Reliability Corporation released a report that \nfound that the targets set forward in the President's Clean Power Plan \nwill be difficult if not impossible to achieve without degrading the \nreliability of the grid.\n  We all want to have our lights turn on and our heat and air-\nconditioning work. This is in peril. My amendment simply makes sure \nfamilies and businesses have the reliable electricity they expect by \nblocking the EPA from finalizing, proposing, or issuing any regulation \nthat would reduce the reliability of the electricity grid.\n  I ask my colleagues to support these amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment that I have just called up \nthat is pending before the Senate deals with what I think is a critical \nissue for this country; that is, making sure we can continue to move \nforward with innovation to grow the economy.\n  There certainly are many debates that are going to be held as to how \nwe get the productivity in this country to increase, how we create more \nmiddle-class jobs and grow the economy from the top to the bottom. But \nI think there is broad consensus that what has really driven our \neconomy--really through the centuries but certainly most recently in \nthe United States--has been innovation. It is about innovation, \ncreating the next big thing, the big products that transform people's \nlives. In order to do that, companies that come up with these ideas \nneed to have patent protection so that the effort they put into that \nproduct, the money they put into that product, they are able to protect \nas they market that product and get a return on their investments. \nUnfortunately, however, the backlog of patent applications at the U.S. \nPatent and Trademark Office has become completely unacceptable.\n  The America Invents Act made a number of very important changes to \nour patent system that targeted the reducing of the backlog and driving \ninnovation. At the time that act was passed, there were more than \n700,000 patent applications at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. \nThose applications had an average review time of 3 years or longer \nbefore the applications were granted patent protection. Three years is \nsimply an unacceptable amount of time to wait as these inventors who \nare trying to get their patent protections--they have to wait several \nyears before they can bring those products to the market and have the \nprotections of patents.\n  What makes it even more unacceptable is that these folks who are \napplying for these patents pay a user fee. They pay a fee in order to \nhave this work done. Yet, with sequestration and other types of budget \nmaneuvering, the patent office actually cannot fully utilize the fees \nthat are generated by the people who are paying these fees. So, in a \nsense, this is an innovation tax. People who are innovating pay a tax \nwhile they are innovating, when what we should be doing is accelerating \ntheir ability to bring these products to market, create jobs, and \nadvance the economy.\n  The backlog now, after the passage of the act, still stands at \n600,000, with an average review time of 2.3 years. So we have made some \nprogress, but we still have a long way to go.\n  So in order to reduce the patent application backlog, the U.S. Patent \nand Trademark Office needs the ability to access all of the fees it \nreceives in order to hire additional examiners and administrative \npatent judges. That is what this amendment before us does--it gives the \npatent office the resources it needs in order to do its job \neffectively. The end result is a stronger American economy. I urge my \ncolleagues to adopt this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 521\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside and call up Peters amendment No. 521.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Peters] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 521.\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to \n  investing in science, technology, and basic research in the United \n                                States)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO INVESTING \n                   IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND BASIC RESEARCH IN \n                   THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to investment in science, technology, and basic \n     research in the United States, which may include educational \n     or research and development initiatives, public-private \n     partnerships, or other programs, by the amounts provided in \n     such legislation for those purposes, provided that such \n     legislation would not increase the deficit over either the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through 2020 or the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through 2025.\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, this amendment is similar to the previous \namendment in that it focuses on innovation. It focuses on what this \ncountry does best, which is create new products and advance the \nknowledge with scientific discoveries and new inventions.\n  This amendment, however, deals specifically with scientific discovery \nand technological breakthroughs that drive our economy. We have known \nthroughout human history that the drivers of that have been the big \nbreakthroughs, whether it is the cotton gin or the internal combustion \nengine or the railroads. These have been inventions that have \ntransformed the entire planet.\n  We need to continue to have those innovations, but in order to do \nthat, we need to invest in basic scientific research. Investments in \nbasic research have resulted in countless innovations that improve our \nday-to-day lives and support the Nation's overall productivity and \ncompetitiveness.\n  The Federal Government has long played a crucial role. This has \nalways been, in the past, a very bipartisan issue, that the Federal \nGovernment invest in this basic, cutting-edge research and development. \nHowever, we have seen a very I think disturbing trend over the last few \ndecades as R spending has fallen. The amount of money which the \nFederal Government puts into basic scientific research now is less than \n1 percent of GDP. This is simply unacceptable. We have to look at basic \nscientific research as the seed corn for our economy. We need to invest \nin seed corn so we can harvest the rewards of that investment.\n  This amendment would strengthen Congress's ongoing commitment to \nresponsibly increasing investments in science, technology, and basic \nresearch and help ensure U.S. science and technology leadership in an \nincreasingly competitive world.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this amendment to show our \ncommitment to investing in basic scientific research so we can continue \nto make the U.S. economy the strongest in the world.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 639\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside and call up Peters amendment No. 639.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Peters] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 639.\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S1966]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to \n             supporting trade and travel at ports of entry)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3__. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO SUPPORTING \n                   TRADE AND TRAVEL AT PORTS OF ENTRY.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to supporting trade and travel at ports of entry, \n     which may include construction at ports of entry or increased \n     staffing at ports of entry, by the amounts provided in such \n     legislation for those purposes, provided that such \n     legislation would not increase the deficit over the period of \n     the total of fiscal years 2016 through 2020 and the period of \n     the total of fiscal years 2016 through 2025.\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, this amendment deals with another critical \naspect of growing our economy. Certainly innovation and basic \nscientific research are the real drivers of long-term economic growth, \nbut another very important aspect of that is international trade. The \nUnited States has the best workers in the world. We have the best \nentrepreneurs. We have the best innovators. We need to be in a position \nthat we can continue to promote trade across the world.\n  So I rise to offer an amendment that will support trade and travel \nthrough our U.S. ports of entry. As we all know, trade and travel drive \neconomic development. In fact, they generate over $2 trillion in \neconomic impact and support nearly 15 million jobs nationwide. However, \nit is unfortunate to say that many our busiest ports of entry are in \nneed of modernization in order to safely and efficiently process \ntravelers and goods.\n  I speak about this with firsthand experience. In Michigan, our \nmanufacturers and agricultural producers rely on efficient trade with \nCanada, which is our Nation's largest export market, our top customer, \nas well as our closest ally. However, existing infrastructure at our \nports of entry often does not allow for the most efficient processing \nof trucks and cargo. We have two major crossings in Detroit--in \nWindsor, Canada, as well as Port Huron in Sarnia. Both of those trade \nareas need additional investment in their customs plazas to efficiently \nhandle the trade between our two countries.\n  Those investments are important investments in the future of this \ncountry and important in order to make sure we continue to expand trade \nand economic activity. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. First, Mr. President, I thank Senator Peters for the \namendments he just offered. We had a hearing in the Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee in regard to the patent issues. It is \nclearly a huge concern by the innovators, the small business, biotech, \nand high-tech firms. I thank the Senator very much for giving us an \nopportunity to act on that matter.\n  Secondly, let me compliment the Senator on the research issues. I \ntook to the floor yesterday and talked about the budgets of the \nNational Institutes of Health and how critical that is, not only for \ntheir direct mission, which is to find answers to diseases, but also to \nprovide the answers to building blocks for companies that do incredible \nwork.\n  I was at AstraZeneca in Frederick on Monday, where they do the \nbiologics manufacturing, and they depend very much on the NIH budget.\n  I thank the Senator for the amendments he offered. I know we will \nhave a chance to act on them a bit later.\n\n\n        Amendments Nos. 364, 367, 439, 440, 899, and 900 en bloc\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment to call up the following amendments en bloc: Cardin \namendments Nos. 364, 367, 439, 440, 899, and 900.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to talk a \nlittle bit about the amendments.\n  I see Senator Portman on the floor, and I want to talk about \namendment No. 899, which provides a deficit-neutral reserve fund for \nfinancial literacy.\n  The two of us have been working for over a decade to increase the \namount of savings for Americans, particularly retirement savings. We \nknow that at early ages people need to understand the importance of \nsaving.\n  I offer this amendment, and Senator Portman has been very helpful to \nme in developing this amendment. I hope we will be able to act on this \na little bit later.\n  Amendment No. 364 deals with oral health, which establishes a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund relating to improving oral health care for \npregnant women and children under Medicaid. Let me point out to my \ncolleagues something they may not be aware of; that is, the oral health \nof a pregnant woman very much impacts the baby. Therefore, it is \nimportant pregnant women have attention to their oral health care \nneeds. It is transmitted to their babies.\n  I urge my colleagues to help us in supporting this effort. We have \ntaken major steps to improve pediatric dental care. This is another \nstep we can take by dealing with pregnant women.\n  With regard to amendment No. 367, which sets up the deficit-neutral \nreserve fund to provide for voter reenfranchisement initiatives, once \nagain I think my colleagues would be surprised to learn there is an \nestimated 5.85 million citizens who cannot vote as a result of criminal \nconvictions and nearly 4.4 million of those have already been released \nfrom prison.\n  We have 4.4 million people living in our community whom we expect to \nbe productive citizens, and yet they have been disenfranchised from \nvoting.\n  Nationwide 1 in 13 African Americans of voting age have lost their \nright to vote, a rate four times the national average. I think that \nshould give us all concern.\n  Latino citizens are also impacted because they are disproportionately \noverrepresented in the criminal justice system.\n  States have vastly different approaches to people voting with \ncriminal convictions. This patchwork of State laws has caused confusion \namong the election officials and the public, sometimes resulting in the \ndisenfranchisement of even eligible voters. So this amendment would \nprovide much needed information into the hands of citizens returning \nfrom incarceration.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Paul for his work with regard to this \nissue. The two of us are trying to find a way we can bring forward \ntogether a workable way that can help many who have been released from \nour prisons to have the right to vote and participate in our community.\n  With regard to two amendments I am offering, amendments Nos. 439 and \n440, both are related to my work as the ranking Democrat on the Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship Committee.\n  One would set up a deficit reserve fund to deal with surety bonds. We \nhave increased the limit of the surety bond by the SBA for small \ncompanies, which is very important. This would help make that a more \npermanent increase.\n  The small companies, if they try to get a surety bond, have to pledge \njust about every one of their assets in order to get it. The SBA \nprogram helps with that credit so they can get affordable surety bonds \nwithout jeopardizing their ability to raise capital. This amendment \ncalls attention to that need where we can help small businesses in this \ncountry.\n  I also set up the deficit-neutral reserve fund for family funds \nwithin the small business investment company.\n  I thank Senator Risch. He has been working on this issue, and I have \nbeen working with him on this issue. I think we will hopefully be able \nto come together on legislation that will increase the opportunities \nunder the small business investment companies, which is, again, an \navenue for capital for small companies, the driving force for job \ninnovation in our community.\n  This amendment would allow us again to focus on that legislation, \nwhich we hope to move through the Small Business and Entrepreneurship \nCommittee.\n  Lastly, I have offered a deficit-neutral reserve fund, amendment No. \n900, concerning civic education.\n  I have taken the floor to point out that, yes, we need to stress \nareas of excellence in the sciences, et cetera, in education, but let's \nnot forget civic education. The bedrock of our country's values are \nbased upon our civic system, and it is important that young people have \na full understanding of civic education.\n  This amendment would give us an opportunity, in this Congress, to \nmove forward in promoting civic education for our school system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, first, I applaud my colleague from \nMaryland for these constructive amendments. I am happy to be a \ncosponsor of the financial literacy amendment, which enables all of our \nconstituents to be able to save and invest more, particularly with \nregard to retirement savings for retirees.\n  The savings rate is low. Baby boomers are retiring without having \nlifetime savings, and financial literacy is critical for them. It is \nalso critical for our young people to give them the opportunity to \nstart saving early with the power of compound interest and to be able \nto make wise decisions for their future--whether it is for retirement, \nwhether it is for health care or whether it is for other purposes.\n  I have enjoyed working with my colleague Senator Cardin on this issue \nover the years, and I am proud to cosponsor his amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 681\n\n  I wish to call up another amendment this morning because it is very \nimportant for all of us in this Chamber because all of us are affected \nby it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment to call up my amendment No. 681.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Portman] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 681.\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

Mr. President, this is a commonsense amendment that \ncalls for prioritizing the investments to tackle a very important issue \nfor our cities and towns across our country, especially those hardest \nhit by the housing crisis.\n  Main Streets, unfortunately, across our country have become littered \nwith abandoned and blighted properties.\n  In Ohio, there are about 80,000 of these abandoned home; hundreds of \nthousands, of course, across the country. I have had the opportunity to \nwalk the streets in some of our cities in Ohio with some of our \nfarsighted mayors who are tackling this issue. They are looking for a \nlittle bit of help. I have been in Warren, OH, Toledo, OH, and Lima, \nOH.\n  When you walk these streets and talk to the people in the \nneighborhoods, they let you know how they are feeling about this. They \ndon't like these blighted properties, in part, because it reduces the \nhome values for the whole neighborhood. In fact, there is some evidence \nout there that these blighted properties can cost neighbors up to 80 \npercent of their home value. So one of the best things you can do for \ntumbling home values in America right now in struggling neighborhoods \nis demolish these abandoned properties.\n  Second, and this is very important, they become magnets for crime, \nfor arson, and for other dangerous activities that put neighbors at \nrisk. It puts first responders at risk. There are stories around the \ncountry. Unfortunately, in my home State of Ohio, some first \nresponders, firefighters, have gone to a fire in an abandoned \nstructure, actually been injured, and in one case lost their life. This \nis something neighbors feel strongly about.\n  When I was in Toledo, with the mayor of Toledo, observing one of the \ndemolitions--it was a house that was about 10 feet away from a \nneighboring home. The mother was there with some of her young children, \nand she said: Thank goodness this is happening, because every night I \ngo to sleep I put my head on my pillow praying that the house next door \nis not going to be subject to the arson attacks that have happened in \nthe city of Toledo in these abandoned structures and praying that my \nchildren are not going to be injured by an arson next door to me.\n  It is critical that we provide this help. Land banks in these areas \nhave done a terrific job. Cleveland, in particular, I will hold up as \ndoing a great job. But in States like mine and in other manufacturing \nStates--Florida, Michigan, and other States around the country--these \nland banks are doing the best they can, but they need additional \nresources to demolish many of these properties in order to help \nstruggling neighborhoods recover.\n  This has been a bipartisan issue. We have been able to direct some \nfunding there, including from the hardest hit funds. I want to continue \nto make progress because it is so important, again, for our \nneighborhoods and for the safety of those people who live in these \nneighborhoods that are affected most directly by abandoned homes.\n  I hope we can get some votes from both sides of the aisle for this \namendment today and make it clear to those local officials across our \ncountry, and to those neighbors in these communities, that we are going \nto do what we can to help provide the resources to be able to deal with \nthese blighted and abandoned structures.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To create a point of order against legislation that would use \n         tax dollars to censor publicly-funded climate science)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST USING TAX DOLLARS TO CENSOR \n                   PUBLICLY-FUNDED CLIMATE SCIENCE.\n\n       It shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any \n     bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, amendment between \n     the Houses, or conference report that would censor or \n     otherwise limit the ability of any Federal employee or \n     Federal agency to use in official documents or presentations \n     terms common in scientific literature describing atmospheric, \n     climate, weather, or oceanic processes, including terms \n     relevant to changes in the global climate system or other \n     risks to human health, the environment, and the economy \n     related to air pollution.\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, what this amendment does is it supports \nthe First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution: freedom of speech, to \nprohibit censorship of Federal agencies and Federal employees from \nspeaking in scientific terms about the oceans, the weather, the \natmospheres, and the climate.\n  You would think this is so common sense and so understood under our \nfreedom of speech in our U.S. Constitution, but we have all read news \nreports at the State level, at the local level, and maybe even at the \nFederal level that, indeed, some folks are trying to muzzle scientists \nfrom speaking about the science involving the oceans, the atmosphere, \nclimate, and the weather.\n  I have the privilege of knowing something about the space program. \nWhen I hear people saying they don't want NASA to get involved in \nclimate, well, NASA builds the satellites, NASA launches the \nsatellites--but then NOAA, in the Department of Commerce, operates \nthese weather satellites--other satellites that are taking measurements \nof the Earth to understand what is happening to our atmosphere, what is \nhappening to our climate.\n  When I start talking about the atmosphere, I can't help but flash \nback 29\\1/2\\ half years ago, looking at our planet out the window of a \nspacecraft and looking at the rim of the Earth and seeing the thin \nlittle film that is the atmosphere that sustains all of our life.\n  There is a lot about it that we don't know. There is a lot about it \nthat we, in fact, can measure scientifically. Yet for some reason, \nthere is some commentary going on in America today that we want to \nmuzzle our scientists.\n  So this amendment is a simple, little, commonsense amendment that \nsays you can't muzzle a Federal agency or a Federal employee, telling \nthem they can't use their First Amendment right of freedom of speech to \nspeak in scientific terms about the oceans, the weather, the \natmosphere, and the climate.\n  Imagine if we were going to muzzle researchers at the National \nInstitutes of Health and censor them, saying they couldn't use medical \nterms such as asthma or cancer. What if that was off limits? There is \nnot even a question that we would consider that.\n  Last week, when we got into the matter of climate, a study suggested \nthe massive Antarctic glacier is melting. The water from that melting \nglacier will impact global sea levels, potentially raising them by 10 \nfeet. This week, researchers tell us the melting of Greenland's ice \nsheet is slowing the cyclical ocean current that drives the warm gulf \nstream, which comes right along the southeastern coast of my State and \ngoes out through the middle\n\n[[Page S1969]]\n\nof the Atlantic and warms parts of Western Europe. To understand all of \nthat, it is critical we have this information, which has the potential \nto impact all of us, no matter where we live.\n  At times of seasonal high tide, the streets of Miami Beach are \nflooded. The mayor of Miami Beach campaigned paddling in a kayak on \nAlton Road, which is on the west side of the city of Miami Beach. He \ncampaigned in a kayak at the time of seasonal high flood talking about \nwhat the city needed to do because of what NASA's scientists tell us.\n  This is what NASA has testified to before the Committee on Commerce, \nScience and Transportation. This was not a forecast, they were not \nprojections, but measurements of the rise of the sea level in south \nFlorida over the course of the last 45 years--6 to 8 inches. Again, \nthis was not a forecast but measurements. Do we want to muzzle that \nNASA scientist who testified before our committee and who, by the way, \nin this case is also a NASA astronaut? Do we want to muzzle him?\n  Scientists simply must have the tools and the ability to tell us what \nthey observe without limitation on the terms they can speak. So let us \nmake clear that public science cannot be muzzled, that we won't support \ncensorship, and that the taxpayers deserve an honest return on their \ninvestment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there will be very little time later \ntoday when we start voting for there to be full explanations of any of \nthese amendments, which I think is very unfortunate. I do want to let \nmy colleagues know about some of these amendments, and I am proud to \nsay that, for the most part, the amendments I have filed and have now \ncalled up are bipartisan amendments that enjoy support on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  For example, my amendment No. 427 would create a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund to support sufficient investment in Alzheimer's disease \nresearch to achieve the goal set by the national plan to address \nAlzheimer's disease--of having the means to prevent and effectively \ntreat that disease by the year 2025.\n  This amendment is cosponsored by Senator Moran, Senator Warner, \nSenator McCaskill, Senator Toomey, and Senator Donnelly. It is modeled \nvery much on a bill that Senator Klobuchar and I have introduced to \nincrease funding for Alzheimer's research.\n  Just yesterday the Special Committee on Aging, which I lead along \nwith Senator McCaskill, held an extensive hearing on Alzheimer's \ndisease. We listened to preeminent researchers and individuals such as \nB. Smith, who unfortunately has been afflicted with early onset \nAlzheimer's. We listened to a caregiver and to a geriatric physician \nfrom Portland, ME. We had testimony\n\n[[Page S1970]]\n\nfrom the Mayo Clinic and testimony from the individual who heads the \nInstitutes on Aging at the National Institutes of Health. To a person \nthey pointed out that we are spending $226 billion a year caring for \npeople with Alzheimer's, yet we are investing less than $600 million in \nthis disease.\n  The experts tell us that if our investment were at the level of $2 \nbillion a year, we could explore the promising breakthroughs, the \ntherapeutic targets that are needed to develop a means of prevention or \nbetter treatments or, ultimately, even a cure for Alzheimer's. Think of \nthat. That $2 billion figure that is recommended by the expert advisory \ncouncil, headed by Dr. Ron Peterson from the Mayo Clinic, is less than \n1 percent of what we are spending caring for people with Alzheimer's.\n  This disease is going to bankrupt the Medicare and the Medicaid \nPrograms. We are currently spending $154 billion from those two \nprograms for care of patients with Alzheimer's.\n  That is one of the amendments I will be proposing.\n  I see the Senator from Illinois is on the floor, and he has been \nanother real leader in this area.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Maine yield for a question?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Yes, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. First, I want to thank her. I took a look at the 200 \npending amendments on this budget resolution, and I think at least 10 \nrelate to biomedical research from both sides of the aisle. This is \nclearly a bipartisan issue, and I thank my colleague for speaking out \non this Alzheimer's issue, because these victims and advocates for \nresearch came this week to visit.\n  It is stunning, just stunning, to think for a moment that we diagnose \na person with Alzheimer's in America once every 68 seconds. When staff \ntold me that, I couldn't believe it. I said, that has to be wrong, but \nit is right. It is an indication of the rapid development and growth of \nthis terrible disease.\n  So I thank my colleague for putting in perspective the fact we spend \nover $200 billion a year already on it, and that doesn't calculate all \nof the sacrifices of the caregivers in helping members of the family.\n  It would seem to me that amidst all this budget debate there should \nbe certain areas that are sacred, and I think biomedical research \nshould be one of them. I thank my colleague for speaking up on \nAlzheimer's and I hope we can continue this dialog on behalf of NIH and \nthe other agencies doing the research.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague and friend \nfrom Illinois for his comments. I happened to catch his speech \nyesterday. There was a sea of purple at our hearing--purple \nrepresenting the Alzheimer's cause. I hope one day purple will \nrepresent Alzheimer's survivors. Wouldn't that be wonderful.\n  This is a high priority for me. And I agree with the Senator from \nIllinois, I believe we should be increasing our investment in \nbiomedical research, particularly for Alzheimer's, but in many other \nareas as well. The irony is that, ultimately, it will reduce not only \nhuman suffering but the cost of health care.\n  The trajectory of Alzheimer's is such that if we do not develop \nbetter treatments, a means of prevention, or a cure, by the year 2050 \nthe estimate is we are going to be spending more than $1 trillion \ntaking care of people with Alzheimer's.\n  For all of us in the baby boomer generation, the estimates are that \nby age 85, nearly 1 out of 2 of us will be afflicted with Alzheimer's, \nif the current trajectory is unchanged. Frankly, we are going to be \nspending our golden years either with Alzheimer's or taking care of \nsomeone with Alzheimer's. So this is a crisis, and it deserves our \nattention.\n  I know Senator Moran also has a broader amendment on biomedical \nresearch, which I am proud to be a sponsor of, and this is an area \nwhere I hope we can come together in a bipartisan way, as my colleague \nhas suggested.\n  Mr. President, there are other amendments I would like to briefly \ndiscuss, seeing no one seeking the floor immediately, I don't believe. \nI will have my staff check on that.\n  I am also going to offer an amendment to create a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund to increase access to higher education for low-income \nAmericans through the Federal Pell grant program, including an \ninnovative idea that I am very interested in, and that the chairman of \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Senator Lamar \nAlexander, is very interested in, which would allow for year-round Pell \ngrants so that individuals could complete their education more quickly.\n  Before I was elected to the Senate, I worked at a college in Maine--\nHudson University in Bangor, ME--and I saw firsthand the difference \nthat Pell grants made in the lives of these students. Indeed, on my \nstaff today there are highly talented individuals who were able to go \nto college solely because of the existence of Pell grants. Their \nfamilies did not have experience with higher education and could not \nafford higher education. Pell grants made possible a bright future for \nthese two women on my staff.\n  This is the kind of opportunity that should unite us and that all of \nus should rally behind. Allowing year-round Pell grants would allow \nstudents to complete their education more quickly and join the \nworkforce more quickly, which would help them financially as well. So I \nhope this is something we can pursue and that will be adopted as well.\n  Another of my bipartisan amendments, No. 442, would establish a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund to change the definition of full-time \nemployee under ObamaCare so a worker could work for more than 30 hours \nper week before the employer mandate penalty would be triggered. This, \ntoo, is bipartisan. Senator Donnelly, Senator Murkowski, Senator \nManchin, and I have all been working on this.\n  I hear from workers who are telling me their hours have been cut to \n29 hours a week because of these penalties their employers simply \ncannot afford. It is not just in the for-profit hospitality industry, \nit is also in school systems, community colleges. So that is yet \nanother of my amendments that I hope will enjoy support later today.\n  Mr. President, I see a number of my colleagues on the floor, so I \nyield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold her request?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am happy to withhold the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before I briefly outline my amendments, I \nneed to say a few words about the budget before us.\n  The vision outlined in the budget before us is truly a disaster for \nthe middle class and our economy. This budget lays out priorities that \nwould undermine the gains that millions have made in getting affordable \nhealth insurance. It would undermine the ability of millions of \nstudents to get a college education. It puts tax cuts for the wealthy \nahead of giving even a modest wage boost to those who are working hard \nto get ahead. This budget would give big corporations the opportunity \nto write their own rules while reducing the opportunity for the \ndisabled veterans and children to live a decent life.\n  Democrats have tried to improve this budget. We tried to eliminate \nthe sequester in a fair way. Republicans said no. We tried to make sure \nour commitments to those on Social Security and Medicare remain \nironclad. The Republicans said no. We tried to close a few loopholes to \ninvest in our communities and create jobs. The Republicans said no. We \ntried to give students the opportunity to get an affordable college \neducation. The Republicans said no.\n  Given all these problems, I cannot support this budget. This budget \nfavors the wealthy and special interests on the backs of middle-class \nfamilies, seniors, and students in Hawaii and across the Nation, but I \nwant to offer two ideas that I hope can improve this budget just a \nlittle bit.\n  Amendment No. 877 would restore year-round Pell grants without \nincreasing the deficit. Many college students juggle work and family \nschedules. To balance these commitments they need to attend college \nyear-round. But Pell grants can only be used in two semesters, \ncurrently.\n  My amendment would allow students to access Pell grants year-round, \nas they could from 2008 to 2011. This has been a bipartisan idea in the \npast. In fact, Senator Collins just now offered her similar amendment, \namendment No. 810, that I also support. We should adopt this \ncommonsense, bipartisan policy.\n  I thank Senator Collins for her work in enabling students to complete \ntheir college education in a way that would allow them to do so without \ndisruptions and additional costs. I look forward to working with her as \nwe move forward on this bipartisan-supported idea.\n  The second amendment I am offering, amendment No. 878, is very simple \nas well. The budget resolution allows for energy legislation, provided \nit is paid for only with cuts. It also lays out what I think is a very \nlimited view of our Nation's energy priorities, particularly the heavy \nfocus on fossil fuel development. My amendment would provide a broader, \nmore forward-looking view of our Nation's energy priorities. My \namendment allows for energy legislation that reduces our dependence on \nforeign oil, increases energy efficiency and renewable energy \ndeployment and innovation, and addresses carbon pollution.\n  Hawaii relies on imported oil for energy. The U.S. military \nrecognizes that overreliance on fossil fuel is a national security \nrisk. We have to recognize our future can't be based on fossil fuels.\n  Hawaii and other States are leading the way in transitioning to a \nclean energy economy. My amendment would ensure that Congress's \npriorities are more in line with where Hawaii and our Nation are \nheading in the future. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting \nthese two amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I believe every worker, every business \ndeserves a fair shot to get ahead. A basic American principle is \ncreating opportunity. We all know our workers are the best in the \nworld, and when we have a fair fight we can work hard and we can win, \nbut part of that fair fight is making sure we can do something about \nthe broken Tax Code and the system we have. My amendment would address \nthat, the Bring Jobs Home amendment.\n  We all know there are companies that, unfortunately, are able to game \nthe system to avoid paying their taxes. They move on paper in order to \nbe able to register in another country while still having the benefits \nof our country or they move overseas and, through the Tax Code, we as \ncommunities and their workers pay the cost of the move.\n  It is important to recognize the revenue that is being given up helps \npay for our American way of life--our roads, airports, clean water, \nclean air, opportunities for education, innovation, medical research, \nscience--all of the things that create the wonderful quality of life we \nhave in our country that everyone contributes toward, those things that \nwe need to do together.\n  Unfortunately, the Tax Code is rewarding too many companies to be \nable to take advantage of not doing their fair share. That is what my \namendment addresses.\n  As I indicated, moving their business on paper around to different \ncountries to avoid contributing to our American way of life, our \nAmerican quality of life, they invert, costing Americans tens of \nbillions of dollars in revenue that could go to support our veterans, \nour national defense, rebuilding America's roads and bridges, and water \nand sewer systems.\n  I believe it is particularly offensive to Americans when people find \nout that, in fact, a company can decide to pick up and move, and the \ncost of the move--the cost of packing up and leaving our country--is a \ncost they can write off on their taxes, which means we all pay the \nprice; the workers who are packing people up, the communities that are \nlosing the jobs, our country, in terms of the lost revenue, and we pay \nfor it.\n  Over the last 10 years, 2.4 million jobs were shipped overseas, and \nAmerican taxpayers were asked to foot the bill. It makes no sense. \nSurely, we can come together on a bipartisan basis and agree to stop \nthat--to stop that right off. That is what this amendment does.\n  Over 20 million more jobs are at risk of being shipped overseas \ntoday. In fact, in Michigan we have lost more than 700,000 jobs to \noffshoring. Now, I understand we are in a global economy. I understand \nthere are a lot of decisions being made around the globe as to where \ncompanies will locate, but our Tax Code should not have loopholes in it \nthat incentivize companies to actually continue to either get the \nbenefits of America while pretending to be someplace else or moving and \nhaving us help pay for it.\n  This is a very serious part of tax reform. As we debate a budget \nresolution that has over $400 billion in cuts to Medicare for seniors \nin it, that has over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid--80 percent of the \ndollars in Medicaid going for low-income seniors and people in nursing \nhomes--when we look at the fact that we have been trying to pass a bill \nto create millions of good-paying American jobs by rebuilding America, \nby rebuilding our roads, by rebuilding our infrastructure, we can't get \nsupport to do that. People say we can't afford to pay for it.\n  This is the opportunity to create the revenue to pay for it, to \ncreate the revenue to lower the cost of student loans so more people \nhave a fair shot to go to college, have an opportunity for the American \ndream, so they are not coming out of college being riddled with all \nkinds of debt, mounds of debt. It means they can't buy a house, they \ncan't buy a car, they can't get started in life with a family because \nthey are buried in debt. When we raise these issues on the floor, we \nhear we cannot afford, as a country, to fix those things that affect \nevery family--people struggling to get into the middle class and stay \nin the middle class.\n  I think this budget ought to be about the middle class. I think we \nought to be saying this is a middle-class budget, and I think if we are \ngoing to do that, we have to come together on fair ways to be able to \nfund those things that benefit everyone, that grow the economy by \ncreating and expanding the middle class. We will not have an economy \nunless we expand the middle class. That means good-paying jobs here--\nhere. I am all about export. I just want to export our products, not \nour jobs, and we have a Tax Code that is encouraging the export of our \njobs.\n  So I hope we come together around the Bring Jobs Home amendment, \nagree there is one area of the Tax Code that everybody ought to support \nfixing; that is, where folks are using loopholes and games and \ngimmicks, frankly, to avoid contributing to the quality of life in our \ncountry.\n  We can create opportunities without adding one more dollar to the \ncosts of middle-class families or small businesses or those who stay in \nour country and decide they want to continue to be a part of our great \nAmerican economy. This is about closing for the tax cheaters who are \navoiding stepping up and being a part of solving America's problems.\n  My amendment No. 523 will bring jobs home and invest in the middle \nclass of our country. I hope this is an area we can come together on, \nand I urge support for my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to speak to these amendments \nfor a couple of moments.\n  The first amendment, No. 991, targets improper payments and fraud in \nour largest entitlement programs. It is remarkable--every elected \nofficial I have ever met at any level of government often rallies \nagainst waste and fraud in government, and that means it so unusual \nthat this budget we have before us leaves out critical funding to fight \nfraud and abuse in Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and disability \nprograms.\n  The amendment I am offering today would restore all program integrity \nfunding to the Republican budget to the levels allowed in the Budget \nControl Act. Program integrity activities have a proven track record of \nsaving money. When we invest in programs that track and eliminate \noverpayments and fraudulent claims, we end up reducing costs and \nlowering budget deficits.\n  For example, according to the Social Security actuaries, program \nintegrity efforts to conduct ``continuing disability reviews''--\nspecifically to weed out beneficiaries who have recovered and are no \nlonger defined as ``disabled''--saves taxpayers $10 for every $1 spent \non program integrity efforts.\n  I am introducing this amendment because this is a good use of \ntaxpayer dollars and a critical way to ensure that the money we invest \nin important programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security \ndisability goes directly to the beneficiaries who rely on\n\n[[Page S1974]]\n\nthem. Any elected official who has ever said that we ought to root out \nwaste and fraud in entitlement programs should obviously be supporting \nrestoring these critical funds.\n  The second amendment I wish to raise is a bipartisan measure, No. \n636, filed along with Senators Crapo and King, dealing with consumer \ndata security.\n  Recently, we have seen major data breaches that have affected \nhundreds of millions of American consumers, those who have shopped at \nTarget and Home Depot, have accounts at JPMorgan Chase, or have \nreceived health care from Anthem. In the aftermath of the Target \nbreach, working with Senator Kirk, we recommended that various industry \ngroups in the private sector cooperate on information sharing to ward \noff data thieves.\n  With continuous advances in technology, it is vitally important that \nwe continue to strengthen our efforts to protect consumers from cyber \ncrime by enacting smart, targeted protections. Our bipartisan amendment \nsimply recognizes that we need to provide reasonable notification to \nconsumers when their personal information is compromised and encourage \ngreater cooperation and enhanced data security programs in the private \nsector to safeguard that data. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbipartisan amendment.\n  Finally, I would like to introduce a third amendment, No. 638, along \nwith my colleague Senator Ayotte, that mirrors language included in the \nchairman's mark of our last budget resolution. This amendment \nencourages Congress to act on the recommendations from GAO to improve \nFederal Government efficiency by reducing fragmentation, overlap, and \nduplication. The Senate has a bipartisan history of working on these \nissues, and I think it is important that our budget resolution this \nyear include our continuing commitment to this work.\n  In 2010, Congress passed the bipartisan Government Performance and \nResults Modernization Act, or GPRA, which required Federal agencies to \nreport how their money was being spent, as well as top priorities and \npossible avenues of consolidation within the agency. Last year, we \npassed the DATA Act, which works in concert with GPRA to further track \nhow agencies are spending money.\n  It is important that the savings from these actions go toward \nreducing our deficit. That is why the Warner-Ayotte amendment is \nactually a deficit-reduction reserve fund.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment.\n  I yield to my good friend, the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for \nyielding to me.\n  First of all, I would like to talk for a moment about the budget. I \nam pleased that the Senate is debating a budget. We are required by law \nto pass one by April 15. It has been a while since we have been able to \naccomplish that. I am hopeful that the budget will be reconciled with \nthe House-passed budget, giving us the opportunity to develop 12 \nappropriations bills within this budgetary outline.\n  It is unfortunate that by the nature of a budget, it is a partisan \nendeavor. The expectation is that no Democrat will vote for the budget \nthat ultimately will pass the Senate today. I hope that doesn't \ncontinue to be true in another issue that I am encouraging and am \nencouraged to know will be considered by the Senate, and that is the \nsustainable growth rate fix, the so-called SGR fix.\n  Back in 1997, a budget act was passed that created a formula by which \nphysicians are reimbursed under Medicare. That formula has been very \ndamaging to the practice of medicine--the ability to sustain a practice \nof medicine--particularly in areas of the country in which the \npopulation is elderly and patients are generally on Medicare and most \nof the physicians' income is then derived from reimbursement from the \nMedicare system.\n  The SGR has created a series of problems. At least annually, there \nhas been a problem we have had to fix. Over a decade, we have spent \nmillions of dollars--in fact, $150 billion in short-term so-called doc \nfixes.\n  What I hope happens after consideration of the budget today, tonight, \nin the morning, is that there will be unanimous consent and agreement \nthat we take a vote on finally permanently fixing the problems created \nby this SGR, the formula.\n  In my State of Kansas, there are 127 community hospitals across our \nState that care for patients every day, every hour. Most of those \nhospitals have a significant volume of Medicare patients. The \nphysicians who admit patients to those hospitals and see patients on an \nongoing basis in those communities see a significant portion of their \npatients, and their bills are paid by Medicare.\n  In the last several years, the reduction in payment for a physician, \nthat Medicare reimbursement, has been in the neighborhood of 20 percent \nto 30 percent. The reality, I think all of us know--in fact, it is \nevidenced by the fact that every year we do a patch, we fix this \nissue--what we know is that in the absence of fixing that formula \neither on a periodic basis or today potentially permanently, physicians \nwill no longer be able to see Medicare patients. In many of the \ncommunities I represent, the physicians are employed by the hospital. \nSo this becomes not just a physician issue, not just a hospital issue--\nthe reality is, it is a patient issue. Will you have a doctor in your \ncommunity who is willing to see, who is able to see a patient who is of \nthe age at which Medicare is providing Medicare health care benefits?\n  The opportunity we have today is important. We can do so many things \nby permanently fixing the SGR. The outcome is that communities across \nour country and communities across my State of Kansas have a much \nbrighter hope that their hospital doors remain open and physicians \ncontinue to practice medicine in their communities.\n  Our health care providers face tremendous challenges today related to \nthe Affordable Care Act, related to the ever-increasing amount of \nregulatory burden placed upon hospitals and doctors, upon the costs \nassociated with moving toward computerized medical records. Our health \ncare providers in many instances are hanging on by a thread, and \nwhether or not a community has a doctor, has a hospital determines \nwhether that community has a future.\n  I know that in my own hometown of Plainville, the ability of my \nparents--who lived into their nineties--to remain in their hometown was \ndetermined by whether there was an active, quality medical community, \nquality physicians who cared about their patients and hospitals, who \nwere there to admit their patients when that care was needed. Only \nbecause that existed in our hometown were my parents, into their \nnineties, able to continue to live in a community they called home.\n  The SGR fix is a significant component to make certain that no people \nhave to move, no senior citizens have to move someplace closer to a \ndoctor or a hospital because their hospital no longer is in existence \nor their physician no longer cares for folks who have Medicare.\n  The SGR, which I did not support when it was created, has caused a \nvolatile and unsustainable system for both patients and health care \nproviders. The uncertainty of knowing when and if Congress is going to \nfix by a patch creates problems in and of itself, in addition to the \nultimate reimbursement rate that physician receives.\n  The time to act is now. We are as close to a permanent SGR fix as we \nhave been in my time in Congress. It would be a very sad occurrence if \nwe let this opportunity slip by, and one more time, in a few months, we \nwill be back trying to figure out how to patch the SGR once again. We \nwill spend more money. We will create greater uncertainty. We will \nhasten the day in which citizens of our country--Medicare recipients--\nare no longer able to see a physician of their choice or be admitted to \nthe hospital in their community.\n  I am of the view that we ought not move on to other business. We \nought not recess for this April period of time until we make sure that \ntonight or in the morning the SGR fix is permanently put in place.\n\n\n                    Amendments Nos. 467, 468 En Bloc\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment to call up the following amendments en bloc on behalf of \nSenator Blunt: amendments Nos. 467 and 468.\n\n[[Page S1975]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, a lot of things have happened. We are on \nthe path, I hope, to being able to pass a budget that balances in 10 \nyears. It has some problems, but I think it would be a major change \nfrom the course we\n\n[[Page S1976]]\n\nhave been on, and so I will support it. I hope to be able to support \nit, although things could happen, I guess, between now and our final \nvote.\n  One of the things I wish to share with my colleagues is simply that \nthe proposal to fix the doctors' payments--the so-called doc fix, the \nSGR--which has been around for a long time is one of my highest \npriorities. It is, indeed, unreasonable and unjustified to require \ndoctors to be uncertain every year as to whether they are going to get \na 21-percent or so reduction in their Medicare payments. They can \nhardly do the work at that fee level. So we do need to fix it.\n  However, on the same day that we are now declaring that we want to \npass a budget that puts us on a financial path to balance in 10 years \nby a meager $3 billion--a balanced budget plan, a responsible plan; an \nidea and goal to achieve--we are also talking about passing an unpaid-\nfor plan, and in my view it is not responsible, to spend and borrow \nanother $141 billion, after the proposed offsets, to pay for the doc \nfix. This is what brings this Congress into disrepute. The same day we \nassert we want to have a balanced budget, and we lay out a plan that \nwill get us there in 10 years, we are now considering passing an \nunpaid-for increase in spending that will add $141 billion to the debt. \nColleagues, we just can't do that.\n  To my physician friends, whom I talked to a lot about this and who \nare worried about it, let's all work together to lay out a plan that \nwill pay for this expense. We can do that. Maya MacGuineas is at the \nCommittee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a well-respected, \nbipartisan group. They have basically been shocked by this proposal. \nThey submitted papers that said over 20 years it will add $500 billion \nto the debt. While, some have said that over 20 years, it will pay for \nitself. According to Maya MacGuineas' analysis, it won't, and we don't \nhave official data now. So why would we allow this legislation to pass \nthrough so fast?\n  I urge my colleagues, let's do a short-term fix again, but then let's \ndo a permanent fix, one that is responsible, one that is grownup, one \nthat is paid for, and not just one that adds more debt to the credit \ncard of America at a time when we cannot do that anymore.\n  I am so disappointed that we may not be able to let this legislation \nclear today because I don't believe it is going to be beneficial to us. \nWe can come back and take action to maintain the appropriate payment \nlevels. Let's do it the right way so we can be proud of it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is the right way \nto solve our biggest problem, which is responsible spending in \nWashington.\n  The Biennial Budgeting and Appropriations Act assumes the following: \nWhat we have been doing has been broken for years. Every President \nsince Ronald Reagan has endorsed the biennial budget. Twenty of the \nfifty States in the United States of America have a biennial budget. It \nis time we did budgeting and oversight and allowed time for both.\n  What this bill basically says is that in odd-numbered years we will \ndo our appropriating and in even-numbered years we will do oversight of \nappropriations.\n  Wouldn't it be great to change the paradigm in America to where \nduring election years and even years, instead of saying how much bacon \nwe are going to bring home, to instead say how much savings we are \ngoing the find in the appropriations process. We can find new money to \nfund new programs without raising taxes or raising revenues of the \nFederal Government.\n  It is a responsible way to run our country, it is a way we ought to \nrun\n\n[[Page S1979]]\n\nour country, and it is a responsible way for America to return to \nfiscal accountability.\n  With an $18.1 trillion deficit and with spending going haywire and us \nnot being able to do budgeting or appropriating at all, it is time we \ncall time out, fix our problem, and move forward.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, who as \nGovernor of New Hampshire for 6 years did biennial budgeting and has \ngreat experience in that effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nGeorgia, Senator Isakson, in supporting the biennial budgeting \namendment. This is legislation we have been working on--this will be \nthe third session of Congress now--and it is a response to what I think \nwe would all agree is a broken budget process here in Washington.\n  Since 1980, we have only had two budget processes that have been \nfinished on time, according to established process. In that timeframe, \nsince 1980 when, as Senator Isakson pointed out, every President has \nendorsed biennial budgeting, Congress has resorted to more than 150 \nshort-term funding bills or continuing resolutions. That is no way to \ngovern. While we have made progress in recent years to reduce our \ndeficits, we need reform of our budget process.\n  Senator Isakson pointed out very eloquently how this proposal would \nwork. In New Hampshire, where I served three terms as Governor, I had a \nlegislature of members of the other party and yet we were able to pass \nbiennial budgets 3 years, on time, that were balanced. It worked in New \nHampshire. It works in 19 other States. It can work here.\n  This is an opportunity for us to begin to reform our budget process. \nIt won't fix everything, but it will go a long way in addressing our \nopportunity to provide oversight in the second year of the budget \nprocess.\n  I hope our colleagues will join us, and that we will again, as we did \nin 2013, have a majority to support biennial budgeting in this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from New \nHampshire for her remarks and thank her for her commitment.\n  The definition of insanity is to do the same thing over and over \nagain and expect a different result. It is time we get a different \nresult in Washington, which is balanced budgets, fiscal accountability, \nand balanced spending, and a biennial budget will do that.\n  In our remaining time, with the permission of the Senator from New \nHampshire, I wish to address one other amendment we have called up to \nbe pending, which is amendment No. 839, which has already been \nreported.\n  Amendment No. 839 is very simply an amendment that recognizes the \nfact that 52 Americans were taken captive in 1979 in Iran at our \nEmbassy. Forty-four of them are still alive. They remain the only \nAmerican hostages ever taken who were never compensated for their time. \nWe have revenue accumulating because of the Iranian sanctions. \nEverybody on the Foreign Relations Committee is supportive, and I think \nthe State Department is too, of seeing to it we take a portion of those \nsanctions and compensate the American hostages of the Iranian \nGovernment from 1979 to 1980.\n  As the Presiding Officer will remember, it was the day Ronald Reagan \nwas sworn in that Jimmy Carter finally made arrangements to get those \nhostages out of Tehran. They suffered torture, physical abuse, and \nterror for 444 days. They deserve to be compensated. We deserve to take \nthe money the Iranians have been paid for sanctions and see to it these \nAmericans are compensated for what they suffered in 1979 and 1980.\n  I appreciate the time from the Chair and I yield back the remainder \nof our time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO \n                   ESTABLISHING A BIENNIAL BUDGET RESOLUTION \n                   PROCESS.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to establishing a biennial budget resolution \n     process, by the amounts provided in such legislation for \n     those purposes, provided that such legislation would not \n     increase the deficit over either the period of the total of \n     fiscal years 2016 through 2020 or the period of the total of \n     fiscal years 2016 through 2025.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to support this \namendment. The amendment I am offering along with the Senator from \nMaryland, the vice chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, Ms. \nMikulski, proposes the creation of a biennial budget resolution \nprocess.\n  Having a two-year budget could enable the annual appropriations \nprocess to run more smoothly, and it might also benefit other \ncommittees. The appropriations process often bogs down due to the \nfailure of the budget resolution process. If there is no budget \nresolution in place, there is no framework to facilitate consideration \nof appropriations bills.\n  Establishing a biennial budget process does merit serious \nconsideration, but biennial appropriations are another matter.\n  Proponents of biennial appropriations argue that having an ``off \nyear'' in which there are no appropriations bills will mean more \noversight during the off year. Well, this ignores the close \nrelationship between oversight and the appropriations process itself. \nWithin each year's appropriations process, in the hearings before the \ncommittee, informal meetings, committee\n\n[[Page S1982]]\n\nreports, and the bills themselves, Congress provides guidance--\nadmonitions sometimes--and funding adjustments based on program \nperformance and changing priorities. The appropriations process is one \nof the best tools Congress has to reform, improve, eliminate, and \nmodernize programs under its jurisdiction.\n  Having an off year would not translate into more oversight. It might \nwell have the opposite effect, as Congress would not possess any hammer \nor useful tool of the year's appropriations bill to modify agency \nactions. So you're yielding more power to the executive branch to spend \nmoney, borrow money, and try new programs without having proper \noversight of the appropriations and the authorizations process.\n  Writing and debating annual appropriations is an essential part of \nthe Congressional oversight responsibility that was contemplated by the \nFramers of the Constitution. It does not detract from the power of, or \nminimize or infringe on, authorizing committees' ability to perform \nadditional oversight. There is no limitation under this process of a \nlegislative committee's prerogatives. It provides the money, though, as \nthe Constitution contemplates, through an appropriation of funds \napproved by the people's representatives--not the Executive's, not the \npeople who run the Departments, and not the President himself.\n  We changed things with the King of England during the colonial era. \nThe people recognized they wanted the people in charge. ``Here, sir, \nthe people govern'' became a watchword of the Revolution and the \nestablishment of the United States of America.\n  So under this suggestion, which we are criticizing at this moment, \nCongress would be compelled to do one of two things: either adjust \nappropriations in the off year through supplemental appropriations, or \ngive agencies themselves greater flexibility to move money around among \ndifferent programs and activities that are part of the government \nspending process.\n  The first defeats the purpose of the biennial appropriations \nproposal. The second is a further expansion of Executive power. You're \nbuilding up the Executive with more tools to do its will without \nrespect to what the people's representatives in the Congress might \nprefer. The second is the further expansion of Executive power, \ngenerally, that we should be wary of granting. The Executive has an \nenormous amount of power, but under our system, we should seek an \nequally powerful role for the people's representatives, and for the \ndirect election of Members of the U.S. Senate whose responsibility \nincludes the power to help ensure that the States have the funds they \nneed to carry out their responsibilities.\n  Congress can improve its performance in budgeting, but it does not \nhave to abandon the annual review of theFederal appropriations process. \nIt doesn't have to be part of the answer to the question.\n  So I hope Senators will carefully review what is at stake and what is \nbeing suggested and consider that before you vote. I hope the Senate \nwill support my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, while waiting for the Senator from New \nJersey to arrive in his seat, I want to associate myself with the \nremarks of the Senator from Mississippi, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Mr. Cochran.\n  I want to be sure we understand that this idea of biennial budgeting \nis really a bad idea--well intentioned but a bad idea.\n  The Isakson amendment goes beyond a 2-year budget resolution and \ncalls for establishing 2-year appropriations of bills. The power of the \npurse is one of Congress's most powerful holds. We shouldn't give it \nup. What would happen, if we go with the Isakson and Shaheen amendment \nand not follow Cochran-Mikulski, we need to know we would be putting \ntoo much power in the hands of the executive branch, unelected \nbureaucrats, and OMB. So proponents of biennial appropriating will not \napprove congressional oversight--just the opposite.\n  Without annual appropriations bills, agencies will have little \nincentive to be candid in their testimony and responsive to \ncongressional will and congressional directives. We sacrifice our most \nimportant tool.\n  The other consideration is the practicality. Under biennial \nappropriations, the timeline between the initial forecast and the \nactual budget could be 30 months; then, we can't also respond to \nemergencies. Threats change every day--ISIS, security, the crisis that \njust happened to our allies in Germany. We have to be able to respond.\n  Congress should not tie its own hands and limit its ability. Support \nCochran-Mikulski, defeat Isakson-Shaheen.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I hope to have the opportunity to speak \nabout amendments Nos. 720 and 722 later, but I would like to speak now \nabout No. 721, which is a freight rail amendment.\n  I am very happy to see the Presiding Officer, Senator Rubio, whom I \nhave worked with on other legislation. Having bipartisan work on \nimportant critical issues is essential. I am happy to join with Senator \nFischer on this important amendment.\n  It focuses on the urgency to improve the movement of freight and \nstrengthen our competitiveness by investing in a comprehensive \nmultimodal national network that includes not just our major highways \nbut our rails, seaports, local roads, and intermodal facilities.\n  I am happy to see Senator Sanders, who has the courage to stand and \nspeak about the infrastructure deficit in our country and calls for \nbold, fiscally sound investment. I want to make sure, as we move \nforward, that freight planning and investment as seen by this amendment \nis prioritized. Along with Senator Fischer, I support broadening our \napproach to freight policy that would promote greater national \nproductivity. Why is this important? Hundreds of millions of tons of \nfreight are annually shipped through our ports, rails, and highway \nnetworks.\n  The Great Corridor runs from my State of New Jersey to New York, to \nPhiladelphia, moving over $55 billion in goods each year, and is one of \nthe most significant chokepoints in the U.S. transportation network \nthat moves $17 trillion of goods between metropolitan areas each year.\n  The incredible freight network drives our economy, boosts economic \ncompetitiveness, and creates jobs in America, thousands and thousands \nof jobs. With a slight adjustment of our priorities and a strong \nnational commitment to investing in our infrastructure, we can \ndramatically reduce congestion, improve the health of our American \ncommunities and make sure goods get where they need to go faster, \ncheaper, all while strengthening our economy and creating jobs.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \namendment and look forward to continuing to work on critical \ntransportation and infrastructure priorities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time for debate has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and ask for consideration of amendment No. 1024.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I object. The vote is set aside for 12 noon. \nWe could have 50 more people coming down and offering additional \namendments. They will have an opportunity to offer those amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 881\n\n  There is 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote on the Sanders amendment \nNo. 881.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this is a very simple, straightforward \namendment. It calls for a substantial increase in the minimum wage. The \nsimple truth is that in America, people working full time should not be \nliving in poverty. Since 1968, the real value of the Federal minimum \nwage has fallen by close to 30 percent. People all over this country \nand in State after State on their own have voted to raise the minimum \nwage.\n  By the way, in State after State where the minimum wage has gone up, \nmore jobs have been created. Let us stand today with the tens of \nmillions of workers who are struggling to put food on the table, to \ntake care of their families. Let us raise the minimum wage\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' \nThis is not the proper place for this. It can be handled as regular \nlegislation at any time. This budget resolution is focused on balancing \nthe budget in 10 years. That is important in and of itself, because \nbalancing the budget renews job growth and expands opportunity for \nhard-working families.\n  CBO analyzed our budget for its economic growth impact. That report \nmakes it clear that the economy grows as the government slows its \nspending rate. With that growth comes new jobs. Building on CBO's \nanalysis, it is clear that over 1 million new jobs could be created if \nour budget took full effect. That will create competition for \nemployees. That will increase wages.\n  The minimum wage was designed to be a training wage that teaches \npeople how to show up for work on time and how to learn a job before \ntransitioning to new jobs, and those that do get advanced really \nquickly.\n  I would ask there be a ``no'' vote on this amendment. It does not \nbelong in this budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Portman).

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 523\n\n  There are now 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote on Stabenow \namendment No. 523.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I would hope we could all come together \nand agree that we want to bring jobs back to America. This is about \nsaying if you are a business in America and you want to pretend to move \noffshore on paper but have the benefits of clean air and clean water \nand roads and all of the benefits of our American way of life, you \nought to be contributing to that way of life. So this closes tax \nloopholes being used by companies right now to avoid paying their fair \nshare.\n  Small businesses are here paying their fair share; individuals are, \nworkers are. Yet we have a code where you can pack up and move overseas \nand American taxpayers have to foot the bill for the move. The workers \nlosing their jobs have to foot the bill for the move. It makes no \nsense.\n  We want to bring jobs back to America. This simply closes egregious \nloopholes to make sure everybody is a part of America and that \neverybody is contributing to our quality of life and our way of life in \nAmerica. I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this \namendment. Some of Senator Stabenow's tax reform ideas might have \nmerit, but they should be dealt with in the context of comprehensive \ntax reform rather than as a stand-alone proposal. Otherwise, we would \nhave a whole bunch of these stand-alone proposals that would become \npart of the budget, instead of empowering committees of jurisdiction to \nhandle them as regular legislation, which they still would have to do.\n  The U.S. Tax Code is overly complicated. It is inefficient, and it is \narchaic. The current structure hurts economic growth, frustrates \nworking Americans, and pushes American businesses overseas. Any \ndiscussion of international or corporate tax reform should take place \nin the context of comprehensive tax reform to simplify the whole \nsystem.\n  The budget resolution assumes the tax-writing committees will adopt a \ntax reform proposal that reduces marginal rates but broadens the tax \nbase to create a fair, efficient, competitive, pro-growth tax regime, \nand that the revenue is neutral. We look forward to working on that in \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  I oppose the amendment, and I ask for a ``no'' vote. I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote \non Wyden amendment No. 1012.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, earlier in this week I was encouraged when \nRepublicans voted with Democrats to approve an amendment I introduced \nwith Senator Sanders that would protect Medicaid beneficiaries from \nbenefit cuts under the budget. But when we actually look at the \nRepublican budget on Medicaid, it is impossible to square that budget, \nwhich has $1.2 trillion in cuts, with the vote that was held earlier \nthis week to protect Medicaid. And we can't get those savings without \ncutting reimbursements for nursing homes and long-term care services. \nMedicaid pays 40 percent of all nursing home care.\n  Colleagues, let us be consistent with our Medicaid vote that was cast \nearlier this week, and support my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' The \nbudget before us suggests we modernize the Medicaid program based on \nthe successful and bipartisan model of the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram.\n  The Senate budget strengthens and improves Medicaid and protects the \nmost vulnerable among us who rely on the program. The budget does not \ncut Medicaid. It slows its rate of growth. The Senate Finance Committee \nwill of course determine the details of any Medicaid reform should \nlegislation on that matter come before this body. And it would require \nlegislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this budget makes massive cuts in \nMedicaid and will throw women, men, and children off of that vitally \nimportant program.\n  I strongly support the Wyden amendment. Let's protect Medicaid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining before the vote.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote \non the Rubio amendment No. 423.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, this is a pretty straightforward amendment. \nIt funds defense fully based on the Gates budget, which was the last \ndefense budget that was put together based solely on the assessment of \nthreats we face and the requisite military needs to deal with those \nthreats. The national security of our country is the predominant \nobligation of the Federal branch of government. It is the one thing \nthat only the Federal Government can do, and it is the first thing it \nis tasked with doing. If it cannot protect us from foreign threats and \nprotect our national security, all the other issues we are \ncontemplating become elementary. This is a critical component, given \nthe fact that around the world today there is an increase in threats \nfrom radical jihadists and nonstate actors to rogue states such as Iran \nand North Korea, to massive military buildup on behalf of the Chinese \nand the Asia-Pacific region, to the challenges faced by NATO and our \nallies in Europe as Vladimir Putin tries to redraw the post-Soviet \norder in Europe.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this. It does, once again, \nput us at the Gates' budget number which was the last number we arrived \nat, that was presented to us, and that fully funds the needs of our \nmilitary based truly on the threats of the modern era.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. This is truly a remarkable amendment because it runs \ndirectly in opposition to everything the Republicans have been talking \nabout. They say we have to cut Medicare and Medicaid and education \nbecause of the terrible deficit. Do you know why we have a deficit and \nlarge debt? Because we went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan and we \nforgot to pay for it.\n  Now Senator Rubio says, hey, let's continue spending more money on \nwar but just put it on the credit card. We don't have to pay for it. \nEnough is enough. If you want to go to war, start paying for that war. \nLet the American people know what the cost of war is.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment \nviolates section 312(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974 and the waiver provisions of applicable budget resolutions, I move \nto waive all applicable sections of that act and applicable budget \nresolutions for purposes of my amendment, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is now 2 minutes of debate prior to a \nvote on the Paul amendment No. 940, as modified.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, national defense is the No. 1 priority of \nthe Federal Government. My amendment increases defense spending, but \npays for it with spending cuts. It is irresponsible and dangerous to \ncontinue to put America further into debt, even for something we need. \nWe need national defense, but we should pay for it.\n  America does not project power from bankruptcy court. We need a \nstrong national defense, but we should be honest with the American \npeople and pay for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the Republican budget throws 27 million \npeople off of health care. It denies nutrition programs for hungry kids \nand pregnant women. It cuts $90 billion from the Pell program, making \nit harder for young people to get a college education, and it raises \nthe price of prescription drugs for the elderly. For Senator Paul, that \nis apparently not enough. He wants, over a 2-year period, $189 billion \nin cuts to discretionary programs, which will be devastating to the \nworking families of this country.\n  Stop the war against working families. Vote no on the Paul amendment.\n  I make a point of order that the pending amendment violates section \n312(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974 and the waiver provisions of applicable budget resolutions, I move \nto waive all applicable sections of that act and applicable budget \nresolutions for purposes of my amendment, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today would \nsimply expand access to paid sick days and give our families some much \nneeded economic stability.\n  Working families should not have to sacrifice a day's pay or \nsacrifice their job altogether just to take care of themselves or a \nsick child, but today in this country, 43 million of our Nation's \nworkers do not have access to paid sick days. This amendment would \nallow workers to earn up to 7 paid sick days over the course of a year.\n  It will not only help our families, it will be good for business. \nPaid sick days boost productivity, and in cities and States that \nalready have paid sick leave laws, many employers state that this \npolicy has not affected their revenue.\n  Allowing workers to earn paid sick days would take us a step closer \nto having an economy that works for all of our families, and I urge its \nsupport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this \namendment. Under the current law, the Family Medical Leave Act provides \n12 work weeks of job-protected unpaid leave for employees following the \nbirth of a child, to care for a seriously ill family member, or for \ntheir own serious health issues.\n  Voluntary paid leave programs work precisely because they are \nvoluntary, thereby offering flexibility to both employees and \nemployers. The one-size-fits-all approach does not permit the \nflexibility needed to help all kinds of businesses and all kinds of \nworkers. Employers, not the Federal Government, are best situated to \nknow the benefits compensation that should be provided.\n  This, again, is a bill that should go through committee. It might be \nvery successful if it goes through the committee process, but \nregardless it ought to, and so I ask for a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is 2 minutes of debate \nprior to a vote on the Moran amendment No. 356.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, the Moran amendment is an attempt to \naddress the issue--in fact it is addressing the issue--of the 40-mile \nrequirement contained in the choice act that Congress passed in August. \nSenators may recall that in August we were successful in coming \ntogether and passing legislation to give veterans greater options if \nthey live more than 40 miles from a VA facility or if they cannot get \nthe services within 30 days, the VA should provide those services, if \nthey choose, at home.\n  This amendment makes clear that the VA should provide those services \nin the circumstance where there is a VA facility within 40 miles, but \nit does not provide--if it does not provide the service the veteran \nneeds, it does not count against the 40 miles. This is a commonsense, \nvery bipartisan amendment. I ask that it be adopted.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Moran raising this \nissue. Last year we wrote the Veterans Access, Choice, and \nAccountability Act. We included language to allow veterans living at \nleast 40 miles from a VA facility to access care in the community.\n  Like Senator Moran, I represent a rural State. I am the first to \nunderstand the unique needs of rural veterans. I have spoken with \nSenator Moran and understand his intention is to ensure that veterans \nliving at least 40 miles from a facility that provides the care they \nneed can seek care in the community through the Choice Program on a \ncase-by-case basis.\n  If that is his intention, I think it is a good amendment. I think we \nshould all support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote \non Baldwin amendment No. 432.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, my amendment would create a free \ncommunity college program, making a bold investment in our Nation's \nstudents, its workforce, and the future of our economy.\n  It pays for this investment in a balanced way, and my amendment would \nactually reduce the deficit by enacting the Buffett rule, asking \nmillionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share of taxes while \ngiving our students a fair shot at the opportunities a higher education \nbrings.\n  Inspired by programs in Tennessee and Chicago, this spring President \nObama proposed a program that would allow students to attend community \ncollege for 2 years at no cost. This was a bold step.\n  Passing my amendment will show that Congress is ready to act to give \nevery student a fair shot at an affordable education. Voting for this \namendment means you believe a college education should be a path to the \nmiddle class and not a path into debt.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote yes on the Baldwin-Schumer-\nSanders-Stabenow amendment to support free community college and invest \nin our students and our workforce.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, for the 1 minute in opposition, I urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment. It spends more than $50 \nbillion and pays for it by raising taxes.\n  This amendment is again telling the Finance Committee exactly how to \ndo its work. But worse yet, the President's budget proposal for \ncommunity college tuition free for all is not free for the States.\n  The Federal Government would pay 75 percent, but the States have to \npay 25 percent. That is a 25-percent unfunded mandate. There is no \nprovision for the States to be covered under this thing.\n  So we are telling them they are going to provide free college, \nalthough a lot of them already do. For the poor, the Pell grant is \n$5,775, and the average college tuition is $3,347. But it is not clear \nexactly what strings the administration would attach to States and \ncommunity colleges in exchange for a 75-percent match.\n  Some of Senator Baldwin's tax reform ideas may have merit, but they \nshould be dealt with in the context of comprehensive tax reform rather \nthan as a stand-alone proposal.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy).

Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Hirono. Our amendment would create a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund to expand access to higher education for some of our \nneediest students through the Pell grant program.\n  The amendment would allow for year-round Pell grants so students who \nwant to accelerate their degrees by taking additional courses, \nincluding during the summer, can receive an additional Pell grant when \nthey need it\n\n[[Page S1988]]\n\nand complete their education more quickly without having to wait for \nthe next academic year to begin.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I want to thank the Senator from Maine. We should be \nworking to make college more affordable, reducing the crushing burden \nof student debt, and giving Americans a chance to further their \neducation and training skills.\n  The underlying budget makes drastic cuts to Pell grants and would \nincrease the average student's debt by thousands of dollars. The \namendment of the Senator from Maine would help make college more \naffordable and accessible by reinstating the year-round Pell grant, \nwhich is a much needed investment to improve students' success.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I urge our colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I think we have an agreement to take this on \na voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 810) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 828\n\n(Purpose: To provide additional resources to save student financial aid \n  and keep college affordable for more than 8,000,000 low- and middle-\n  income students by restoring the $89,000,000,000 in cuts to Federal \n                 Pell Grants in the Republican budget)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote \non the Franken amendment No. 828.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, we just voice-voted an amendment to let \nstudents use summer Pell grants, but the fact is this budget cuts Pell \ngrants. In Minnesota alone, more than 160,000 students were able to go \nto college thanks in part to Pell grants, and the same holds for \nmillions around the country.\n  When my wife Franni and I were in college, a full Pell grant paid for \nabout 80 percent of a public college education. Today it pays for less \nthan 35 percent. Yet this budget would cut this program and make it \nharder for students to pay for college. My colleagues want to cut it \nfurther. We should not be doing that.\n  That is why I offer this amendment to restore funding for Pell \ngrants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I urge my colleagues to vote yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to call up his \namendment?\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I would say yes.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and call \nup my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Franken], for himself, Mr. \n     Brown, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Reed, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 828.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of March 25, 2015, under \n``Text of Amendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  First, this amendment would increase deficits relative to the budget \nresolution. It increases spending in Function 500, with no offset.\n  Second, the budget resolution doesn't cut Pell grants, the primary \nprogram helping these millions of people.\n  The budget does encourage restoring the Pell Grant Program to its \noriginal status as a discretionary program, subject to annual review by \ncolleagues. The tuition purchasing power of Pell grants is at an all-\ntime low even though Pell grant spending has tripled in the past \ndecade. Since 2008, there has been an effort to maintain and increase \nthe maximum Pell grant, but college tuition increases faster than that.\n  This is a program that needs to be reviewed by the applicable \ncommittee to see what needs to be done.

Mr. President, more than 5 years after being signed into \nlaw, the Affordable Care Act is improving the health and well-being of \nmillions of Americans. Many of the Affordable Care Act's greatest \nsuccesses are getting lost in the noise of political attack ads. The \nAffordable Care Act has expanded health care coverage to millions of \nAmericans. These people no longer have to go to bed at night worried \nabout the possibility of bankruptcy if they get sick.\n  Americans who had coverage already are benefiting from new \nprotections.\n\n[[Page S1989]]\n\nWomen now pay the same premiums as men. Preexisting conditions can no \nlonger be used as an excuse to deny coverage, and health plans no \nlonger put lifetime caps on benefits. This amendment would require \ninsurers to disclose all of the benefits afforded to consumers through \nthe Affordable Care Act.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we don't have any problem with this being \ntaken by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO \n                   TRANSPARENCY IN HEALTH PREMIUM BILLING.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to increased disclosure of any Patient Protection \n     and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148) tax in health \n     insurance monthly premium statements, by the amounts provided \n     in such legislation for those purposes, provided that such \n     legislation would not increase the deficit over either the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through 2020 or the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through 2025.\n\n  Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, my amendment is a very simple amendment. It \nsimply seeks to make sure insurance companies increase the transparency \non the actual cost of the health insurance tax on monthly premiums.\n  The bottom line is this: When a single mom goes to the grocery store \nand she gets her receipt, at the bottom of the receipt it reflects the \ntaxes she has paid. When a father of three buys clothes, at the end of \nhis receipt it reflects the taxes that are being paid.\n  By the year 2018, this invisible tax not seen by the average \ninsurance purchaser will have raised about $14.3 billion in costs \nbecause of this health insurance tax. My amendment makes it easier to \nunderstand and appreciate the actual cost of the health insurance tax.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Affordable Care Act is a critical \nstep forward in our efforts to build on our progress to put patients \nfirst and allows every family to get affordable, quality health care. \nBut the work didn't end when the law passed--far from it. Families \nacross the country are expecting us to keep working to build on that \nprogress and continue to make health care more affordable, accessible, \nand of higher quality. That is what we are focused on, on this side, \nand the amendment that just passed did that, but we should not be \nplaying political games in joining to move our health care system \nbackward. It is bad enough that the underlying budget repeals the \nhealth care law and cuts patients and families off without proposing an \nalternative law, but this amendment makes it worse. It means patients \nand families get skewed, incomplete information about their health care \ncosts. I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate prior to \na vote on Durbin amendment No. 817.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we have a Tax Code in America which \ncreates incentives and rewards to companies all across the United \nStates.\n  I am proposing what I call the patriot employers' tax credit. It is a \ntax credit for those American companies that hire Americans and keep \ntheir jobs in the United States, for companies that pay at least half \nof their employees $15 an hour--and we picked that number because at \nthat wage, one doesn't qualify for the basic safety net programs--\ncompanies that provide good health insurance for their employees, good \npension programs for their employees, and companies that give a \npreference to veterans and to those in the Reserve and National Guard \nwho are serving overseas. I think those companies deserve our \nencouragement, a reward of a tax credit for patriotic employers.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in standing up for the companies \nthat stand up for America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, here we go again. I will be asking the \nSenate to vote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  Again, Senator Durbin has some good tax reform ideas. They probably \nhave merit, but we should deal with these ideas through comprehensive \ntax reform rather than a stand-alone proposal that tells the Finance \nCommittee how to do its work.\n  So far, we have resisted every one of these amendments. I assume we \nwill resist the rest of them today. But we can't tell the Finance \nCommittee how to handle comprehensive tax reform if we expect to \nsimplify the whole system.\n  So I ask for a ``no'' vote, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, is there any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is now 2 minutes of debate prior to a \nvote on Vitter amendment No. 515.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this amendment, No. 515, the Vitter \namendment, is very simple and straightforward but important. It says \nthat the U.S. Department of Education should not be able to bribe or \ncoerce States into any particular set of standards or curriculum or \ntesting, whether it is common core or anything else. That decision \nshould be up to the States. That decision should be up to local \neducation communities, not the Federal Government. The Federal \nGovernment, through our Department of Education, should not bribe or \ncoerce States in any direction. That is what the amendment is all \nabout.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I think we all believe that in our \ncountry all students should have access to a quality public education \nregardless of where they live or how they learn or how much money they \nmake. Education is one of the smartest investments we can make.\n  Chairman Alexander and I are working together on a bipartisan process \nto fix the broken No Child Left Behind law. I believe we are going to \nmake\n\n[[Page S1991]]\n\nprogress in the coming weeks. I appreciate his working with me.\n  The fact is that this amendment is not needed. The common core was \nnot mandated by the Federal Government. Race to the Top did not mandate \nadoption of common core. ESEA waivers have not mandated the common \ncore. Federal law already prohibits the Federal Government from \nrequiring States to adopt certain standards or curriculum.\n  By the way, this is a ``spending neutral'' reserve fund that I think \nwe all should be aware of for the first time in this Republican budget.\n  For all of those reasons, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that small businesses are provided relief as part \n   of tax reform by permanently increasing the maximum amount of the \n section 179 small business expensing allowance to $1,000,000 and the \n    investment limitation to $2,500,000 and indexing them both for \n                               inflation)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO SMALL \n                   BUSINESS TAX RELIEF.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to small business tax relief, which may include a \n     permanent increase of the section 179 small business \n     expensing allowance to $1,000,000 or an increase in the \n     investment limitation to $2,500,000, by the amounts provided \n     in such legislation for those purposes, provided that such \n     legislation would not increase the deficit over either the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through 2020 or the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through 2025.\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, this is a simple amendment. It increases \nthe amount of money that small businesses can expense in a given year. \nThat makes it easier for them to purchase new equipment and grow the \neconomy.\n  It is especially important to places such as the State of Colorado, \nwhere small businesses make up 97 percent of the employers in our \nState. Specifically, the amendment increases the section 179 expensing \nallowance to $1 million. Right now, it is at $25,000.\n  If we ever manage to pass another extenders bill, it will increase to \n$500,000. As we all know, many small businesses are pass-through \nentities. So they pay the individual tax rate even though they may use \nbusiness tax credits and deductions. So in tax reform they may lose \nsome of their credits but may not see a corresponding drop in their tax \nrates.\n  As we begin the process of reforming our Tax Code, we need to ensure \nthat these types of small businesses can continue to grow, invest, and \ninnovate. This amendment takes an important step in achieving this \ngoal.\n  I am told that there is an agreement--there may be an agreement--to \nhave a voice vote on this amendment. That would certainly be fine with \nme.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I don't think there is any objection on our side to a voice \nvote. I ask for a voice vote.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Hearing no further debate, the question is on agreeing to Bennet \namendment No. 947.\n  The amendment (No. 947) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 838\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote \non Murkowski amendment No. 838.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 838.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is already pending.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, Senator Sullivan and I have come \ntogether to move forward on this amendment. It provides a spending-\nneutral reserve fund for the sale, transfer or exchange of Federal \nlands to State and local governments.\n  I want to make sure that folks understand. This is not selling any \nland by itself. Only subsequent legislation can do that. It would \nrequire us to come back, just as we do now, with exchanges, \nconveyances, and sales, to move the legislation through.\n  What we have done is we have made sure that all lands that are \nincluded within national parks, national preserves, and national \nmonuments are excluded so there can be no effort to purchase or \nexchange there.\n  Our amendment will allow us to craft balanced, bipartisan legislation \nto empower States, improve conservation systems, and promote economic \ngrowth.\n\n[[Page S1992]]\n\n  That is exactly what we did last year, when we moved through the NDAA \nwith support from 80 Senators for that package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, Americans have always had a deep \nconnection to the outdoors. In New Mexico, families go back year after \nyear to fish in the Santa Barbara River, to the Santa Fe National \nForest to hunt, and to the Gila National Forest.\n  Our public lands are part of our American heritage. We cherish \npassing that tradition on to our children and to our grandchildren. Yet \nthis amendment would make it easier to turn our public lands over to \nState land commissioners and eventually to sell them outright.\n  Make no mistake. This amendment will mean more locked gates and more \n``no trespassing'' signs in places that families have used for \ngeneration.\n  Colleagues, this land is your land. I urge Senators to vote no on \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Murkowski \namendment.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiry.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Has the 10-minute limit expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is advised that it has.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Thank you.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, please, a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There shall be no further inquiries during a \nrollcall vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And what rule is that that governs that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised that we are in a \nrollcall vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, you allowed another parliamentary inquiry. Why \nwouldn't you allow my parliamentary inquiry? All I want to know is how \nmany minutes we have gone over the vote. I hear it is 11 minutes, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The parliamentary inquiries are at the \nsufferance of the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The sufferance of the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sufferance of the Senate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, the Senate is definitely suffering. But, in any \nevent, we are 11 minutes over.

There is 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote \non Whitehouse amendment No. 867.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, this amendment would establish a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund that would make it more difficult for \ncorporations and billionaires to secretly influence our elections \nthrough secret contributions and also to prevent such entities from \nevading campaign finance law, including by making false statements to \nFederal authorities and agencies.\n  I can tell my colleagues, if you are not sick of the secret money \nfloating into our elections, your constituents are. So listen to your \nconstituents. Give this a vote, and let's get started on fixing this \ngrave American disgrace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' \nRespectfully, I think we have some skepticism about this proposal, and \nI want to remind my colleagues this issue was decided by the Supreme \nCourt over 5 years ago. The Citizens United case has nothing to do with \ncorporate-union contributions to campaigns. Those prohibitions remain \nin place, and the Supreme Court decision reversed what for-profit and \nnot-for-profit corporations can say in elections. The Bipartisan \nCampaign Reform Act bans election-related expenditures and \ncommunications by American corporations. Proposals like this amendment \nare not designed to ensure transparency and civility of elections. They \nare, as Justice Thomas's concurring opinion in Citizens United \ncorrectly described, ``specifically calculated to curtail campaign-\nrelated activities and prevent the lawful, peaceful exercise of First \nAmendment rights.''\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 seconds.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The Supreme Court specifically left the disclosure of \nthese sources of these secret contributions to Congress. So the Supreme \nCourt actually has given us this job. I urge that we take it up.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, how much time does our side have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask for a ``no'' vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to Whitehouse amendment No. 867.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

There is 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote \non amendment No. 649, as modified.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, everyone in here knows what the United \nNations Arms Trade Treaty does. It doesn't infringe upon our Second \nAmendment rights. We all know that. It also limits our ability to help \nour allies like Israel in building their weapons system.\n  President Obama has signed the treaty but has not submitted it for \nratification; for one reason, he knows the votes are not there. Two \nyears ago, at 5 a.m. in the morning, 53 Senators, from both parties, \nvoted for my amendment very similar to this. My amendment would prevent \nfunds from going to the treaty Secretariat or any other organization \nthat is working to implement this treaty.\n  I ask for your support and retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, the United States is not a party to the \nArms Trade Treaty. It has not even been submitted to the Senate for \nconsideration. Regardless of your position on the treaty itself, \nprohibiting funding for any international organization anywhere while \nother countries are implementing a treaty is simply absurd. By the way, \nthe treaty for which we are not a party to ultimately makes the rest of \nthe world live up to the arms export standards of the United States, \nwhich is good to prevent proliferation for destabilizing arms that \ncould be used against American soldiers and to help level the playing \nfield for U.S. defense manufacturers. So the amendment actually harms \nU.S. national security by placing U.S. soldiers at greater risk from \narmed soldier transfers to our enemies, illegitimately and illegally, \nwithout proper oversight by other countries.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 seconds.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, the coming amendment is the Kirk-Brown \namendment which is the key Iran vote of this session of Congress.\n  If my colleagues are upset about the intel-sharing arrangement with \nthe State of Israel, if my colleagues feel we should rebalance our \npolicy with regard to the United States potentially voting against \nIsrael in the U.N., this is the time to rebalance our policy with \nregard to our allies in the State of Israel.\n  I urge the body to support this Brown-Kirk bipartisan amendment which \nhas been worked out with the other side. I just talked to the senior \nSenator from California, Mrs. Boxer, who assured me she supports this \namendment. So does the senior Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez, \nwith whom I have built such a long, bipartisan partnership on the Iran \nissue.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will just take 20 seconds and yield the \nrest.\n  I hope we all vote for this because it doesn't do anything to cause \ndisarray in negotiations. What it says is if there is a deal and there \nis a breakout and it is certified that there is a breakout with Iran, \nwe would have a very quick way to restore sanctions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator from Illinois as well as the Senator \nfrom New Jersey and the Senator from California.\n  We are united in our goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear \nweapon; we all know that here. I commend the President for trying to \nresolve the nuclear dispute diplomatically.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Kirk-Brown-Boxer-Menendez \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to call up amendment No. 966, as \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Coons], for himself and Mr. \n     Sanders, proposes an amendment numbered 966, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to \n     offsetting the costs of operations against the Islamic State)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO OFFSETTING \n                   THE COSTS OF OPERATIONS AGAINST THE ISLAMIC \n                   STATE.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to providing revenue to offset the costs of the war \n     against the Islamic State, by the amounts provided in such \n     legislation for those purposes, provided that such \n     legislation would not increase the deficit over either the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through 2020 or the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through 2025.\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, we need to make sure we pay for our war \nagainst ISIS. ISIS is a national security threat. We are just now \ncoming to the end of two long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that have \ncost trillions of dollars, and we didn't pay for them. It is \nunacceptable. Our country has a long history of paying for our wars, \nand we need to return to that tradition. As a democracy, we should go \nto war as a nation and not put the burden on just the troops and their \nfamilies.\n  I am pleased to have the cosponsorship of Senator Sanders, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support our amendment to raise the revenue necessary \nto pay for our war.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I certainly appreciate the statement of my good friend, and we have \ntalked a good deal about this. I believe we ought to pay for everything \nwe do around here. There are all kinds of ways for paying for things, \nincluding reducing spending on things we shouldn't be spending money \non. So I would like to work with him in the future. I agree with him \n100 percent that the amount of money that goes out the door should be \nequal to the amount of money that comes in the door, but I oppose this \namendment just because of the way it was crafted. I wish he had said it \nneeded to be paid for, and I would agree with that, but the way it is \ncrafted leads me to want to oppose this, and I hope on our side we will \ndo so.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I would simply say that I appreciate the \nsentiment expressed by the Senator from Tennessee. I agree that all \nwars need to be paid for. I think we need to recognize that revenue is \nrequired to do so.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Sanders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 20 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask my colleagues to vote ``no.'' The Coons amendment is \nshort and simple, but it claims it will offset the cost of the war \nagainst ISIS with the President's budget. We didn't pass the \nPresident's budget. This $8.8 billion is divided between the Department \nof Defense, which executes Operation Inherent Resolve, and the State \nDepartment, which provides----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask for a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, what this amendment says is that if \nSenators vote for another war, this time they will have to raise taxes \nto pay for it. No more wars on the credit card. Vote yes.\n  Mr. COONS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I need to let you know that you \ndon't have to wait all 10 minutes to turn in your vote. If you vote in \n5 minutes, we can finish in 5 minutes.\n  Otherwise, a 5-minute vote takes us 10 minutes, just like a 10-minute \nvote\n\n[[Page S1995]]\n\ntakes us 20 minutes, and a 15-minute vote takes us 30 minutes.\n  We are going to have to cut down the time, or I am sure people are \ngoing to give up before they get to some of their amendments.\n  I do need to announce that there is dinner in the Mansfield Room. It \nis courtesy of Senator McConnell, and it is for both parties.\n  You also need to know that Senator Reid has agreed to provide dinner \ntomorrow night in the Mansfield Room. So unless we can speed this up, \nwhat we are looking for is a volunteer for breakfast and for lunch \ntomorrow.\n  Looking at the list of amendments, I am pretty serious about all of \nthat. We need to speed it up.\n  To do that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nvote on the following amendments in the order listed, with no second-\ndegree amendments in order prior to the votes, with an exception of a \nside-by-side to the Nelson amendment No. 944 and the McCain amendment \nNo. 360, and that the listed amendments be voted on second.\n  The first one is Isakson, No. 839; then Stabenow, 1072; Portman, 689; \nCasey, 632; Thune, 607; Bennet, 1014; McConnell, 836; Merkley, 842; \nGardner, 443; Murray, 951; Graham, 763; Blumenthal, 825; Flake, 665; \nSanders, 475; Hatch, 1029; Schatz, 1063; Kirk, 1038; Nelson, 944; \nMcCain, 360; Wyden, 968; Lee, 750, as modified; Reed, 919; Cotton, 659; \nMenendez, 993; Cotton, 664; Brown, 994.\n  The amendment (No. 750), as modified is as follows:\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 750\n\n       On page 64, line 11, insert ``, which may include funding \n     the payments in lieu of taxes program at levels roughly \n     equivalent to lost tax revenues due to the presence of \n     Federal land'' after ``Taxes (PILT)''.\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

There is 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote \non Isakson amendment No. 839\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, amendment No. 839 recognizes that on \nNovember 4, 1979, 52 brave Americans were taken hostage in Tehran, \nIran. They were beaten, they were held in captivity, they were \ntortured.\n  Finally, the Algerian accords were negotiated, and they were released \nin January of 1981. But in the Algerian accords, they were prohibited \nfrom ever being compensated by litigation against the nation of Iran.\n\n[[Page S1999]]\n\n  Now, with the sanction money flowing into the U.S. Treasury and into \nthe State Department, the money is there to compensate these brave \nindividuals, of which there are 44 still remaining alive.\n  This amendment acknowledges that Congress has the responsibility that \nthe Supreme Court dedicated to make sure these people get compensated \nfor the bravery they exhibited for the United States of America in \ncaptivity.\n  I urge that this amendment be adopted.\n  I recognize the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Isakson's \nefforts here, which passed in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nlast year, working with the State Department, and moved unanimously to \napprove this bill.\n  This is to give 52 Americans, who were held hostage in Iran and \ndenied the opportunity to seek redress for their terrible ordeal, that \nopportunity. The only way we are going to give them that opportunity \nfor the 444 days that their families were held hostage in Iran, is to \nhave this type of action.\n  I look forward to working with them, not just today but beyond, to \nget it passed so we can get these American families their justice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia for \nhis leadership on this issue. He and I have cosponsored a bill that \nachieved this goal.\n  This amendment is vitally important to advance public awareness and \nmake our colleagues more aware of the importance of this very \nsignificant issue. I thank him for his leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Isakson \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 839) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1072\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate prior to a \nvote on the Stabenow amendment, No. 1072.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to ask support for the Stabenow-\nCantwell amendment.\n  This addresses the cuts to the budget in Medicare. Medicare is a \nuniversal health care program, as we know. It is a great American \nsuccess story. Everybody believes that.\n  It protects Americans from having their life savings wiped out by a \nsingle illness. It guarantees important medical care and quality of \nlife for literally tens of millions of people across our country.\n  I was very disappointed yesterday that our Republican colleagues \nvoted against providing a point of order that would allow us to object \nto efforts to privatize Medicare or cut benefits or raise out-of-pocket \ncosts for prescription drugs or preventive services. But as a result of \nthat, we now have in front of us a budget that calls for $435 billion \nin cuts to Medicare.\n  We all know there are ways to work together to create savings through \nefficiencies and quality measures and other things, but we should not \nbe telling a generation of seniors, and those coming beyond them--who \nworked hard their whole lives and paid into the programs--that they \nwill not have the health care they need and deserve.\n  So I ask colleagues to join with us in rejecting the $435 billion in \nMedicare cuts that are in this budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  In the committee, Senator Stabenow heard several different versions \nof this amendment. None of them passed muster with the Parliamentarian.\n  I credit the Senator's instincts to approach the question of Medicare \nseriously. I am sure she knows we all take Medicare seriously. Why does \nthe budget resolution have the numbers that it has? Because the \nRepublicans and the President agree that we have to act on policies \nwhich extend the life of the Medicare trust fund.\n  The budget does this by adopting the President's goal of extending \nthe life of Medicare's hospital insurance, HI trust fund, by at least 5 \nyears.\n  While Republicans and the President share the goals of a financially \nstronger Medicare Program, the Republican budget empowers the Senate \nFinance Committee, the committee of jurisdiction, to determine how best \nto extend the life of the trust fund and solve the program's grave \nfinancial challenges. Many people have concerns about what the \nadministration has proposed with this new Medicare policy. I do, too, \nand expect that the Finance Committee, working on a bipartisan basis \nand in cooperation with the House, can craft a solid, successful \nlegislation to save Medicare from insolvency.\n  I ask for a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Stabenow \namendment.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote \non Portman amendment No. 689.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is a commonsense reform \nthat allows the Joint Committee on Taxation to provide an accurate \nscore to those of us in the Senate.\n  Right now we get a static score only, and everybody knows it is not \nwise to just have a static score, because it doesn't take into account \nthe effect of tax changes on the economy.\n  I think everyone in the Chamber would agree there is some impact on \nthe economy. We have to know what it is. This is informational. We will \nstill get the static score, but also get a macroeconomic score.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation already does the analysis. So they \nhave the information, they are just not allowed to share it with you. I \nwould think everybody in this Chamber should support this.\n  In the underlying bill, there is already also a macroeconomic \nanalysis on the spending side, which is something new. So spending and \ntaxes will both be analyzed. We will have the macroeconomic score.\n  The last time we talked about this a couple years ago on the floor, \nwe got a majority vote--some Democrats, all the Republicans. I hope we \nwill get a bipartisan vote today. I think it only makes sense for us to \nhave the best information possible to be able to do the best tax reform \npossible, for instance, to be sure it does focus on economic growth, \njobs, and rising wages.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, dynamic scoring is nothing more than an \naccounting gimmick that makes tax cuts appear at least partly pay for \nthemselves. It is an attempt to make it seem like the failed policies \nof trickledown economics work, but we know better.\n  According to the CBO, the Bush tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 are \nresponsible\n\n[[Page S2000]]\n\nfor more than 13 percent of the increase in our national debt from 2001 \nto 2011.\n  Tax cuts did not grow the economy; they just grew our debt. The fuzzy \nmath of dynamic scoring may get to a different answer, but the reality \nis that tax cuts for large profitable corporations and the wealthiest \nAmericans do not pay for themselves. They just make the rich richer.\n  Once again, Republicans are opting for accounting gimmicks to cover \nup their real intentions. Dynamic scoring will rig the scoring process \nin favor of legislation that benefits those who are already doing very \nwell.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

There is now 2 minutes of debate \nprior to a vote on Amendment No. 632.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I am honored to be working on this \namendment with Senator Shaheen and Senator Murray. This amendment will \ncreate a deficit-neutral reserve fund to support efforts to prevent \nemployment discrimination against pregnant workers.\n  In the United States today, for so many years, we have had a standard \nset forth in the Americans with Disabilities Act, reasonable \naccommodations for those with disabilities. The same should apply to \npregnant workers.\n  We had a Supreme Court case decision just yesterday. Peggy Young was \nvictorious, but the result is that there is no predictable standard for \npregnant workers in the workplace. We need a standard so employees know \nwhat their rights are and so employers can follow the law.\n\n  I yield for my colleague Senator Shaheen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, this is about ensuring that women are \nnot discriminated against because they want to have children. This is \nmaking sure that women don't have to choose between their jobs and \ntheir families. It is about ensuring that all women can be reassured \nthat if they are pregnant, their employer has to provide reasonable \naccommodations.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to declare that Republicans are \ncommitted to fair and equal treatment of pregnant women as well. \nCongress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978 and passed the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act in 1993. Congress may need to enact this \nspecific legislation through committee in order to address this issue. \nThis amendment does confirm the ability of the committee of \njurisdiction to draft legislation. We would be happy to accept this on \na voice vote.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I request a rollcall vote and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  Mr. ENZI. A rollcall vote has been requested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Casey amendment No. 632.\n  Mr. ENZI.

There is now 2 minutes of debate prior to a \nvote on Thune amendment No. 607.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise in support of my amendment No. 607, \nto create a deficit-neutral reserve fund to repeal the Federal estate \ntax, better known as the death tax.\n  My amendment will put the Senate on record in support of eliminating \nthis destructive and ill-conceived tax on American families in their \ntime of grief. It has often been said but it is worth repeating: A \ndeath in the family should not be a taxable event.\n  I agree wholeheartedly with a piece in the newspaper earlier this \nweek by Harry Alford, president of the National Black Chamber of \nCommerce, who writes that the death tax ``disproportionately hampers \nminority and women-owned businesses across the country'' and ``creates \nan unfair situation for minority businesses which have finally started \nto accumulate wealth within the last 60 years.''\n  The death tax also hits farmers particularly hard.\n  According to USDA statistics on cropland values, a significant \npercentage of farms in my State of South Dakota and States such as \nNorth Dakota, Montana, Illinois, Indiana, Colorado, Minnesota, Florida, \nand Missouri remain subject to this double tax even at the higher \nestate tax exception limit.\n  Incremental relief from this unfair tax is not enough. The time has \ncome for full repeal. I urge support for my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this amendment is not about family farms \nor small business. This amendment benefits exclusively the wealthiest \nthree-tenths of 1 percent of the families in this country--the very, \nvery wealthiest people--and 99.7 percent of the families in America \nwill not benefit by 1 nickel. By the way, for those concerned about the \ndeficit, this will cost us $250 billion over a 10-year period.\n  Ironically, the Republican budget raises taxes for lower income \nfamilies\n\n[[Page S2001]]\n\nwho are on the earned-income tax credit program and the children's tax \ncredit program. So what we are doing now is giving tax breaks to \nbillionaires in the same bill that we are raising taxes for low-income \nworking families, and adding significantly to the deficit.\n  I think this should be a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is now 2 minutes of debate on the Bennet \namendment No. 1014.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, this amendment is very straightforward. \nThe purpose reads ``. . . responding to the economic and national \nsecurity threats posed by human-induced climate change, as highlighted \nby the Secretary of Defense, the Director of National Intelligence, the \nAdministrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and \nthe Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration.''\n  The amendment establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund to promote \nnational security, economic growth, and public health by addressing \nclimate change through the increased use of clean energy, the \ndeployment of energy efficiency, and the reduction of carbon pollution.\n  That is it. That is all it is--simply a statement of all the facts \nand the suggestions of three common strategies to address the issue.\n  Climate change is a serious threat to the world, to our country, and \nto Colorado. Ask anyone whose farm or ranch depends on water from the \nColorado River or one of its tributaries.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators time has expired.\n  Mr. BENNET. I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, just Wednesday of this week, the new \nannual Gallup poll came out. It said very clearly that among the six \nenvironmental concerns the Gallup poll included in its survey, global \nwarming polled at the very bottom, right after the loss of the tropical \nrainforests, I might add. Gallup also found that a majority believe \nthat the seriousness of global warming is overstated.\n  The Obama administration and others on this side like to claim 97 \npercent of the world's scientists believe in manmade global warming. \nMonday's Wall Street Journal op-ed debunked the 97 percent and the \nsurvey represents the views of only 79 respondents out of 3,149. \nLastly, the agencies they are talking about that claim that 2014 was \nthe warmest year on record, such as NASA--NASA now has reduced that to \n38 percent. They have retreated from that position. So the people have \ncaught on to this hysteria, and I ask colleagues to oppose the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 1014.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me just say to my colleagues that this is an \namendment which ought to pass 100 to 0. Let me tell you why. The \nAdministrator of EPA just testified within the last couple of weeks \nthat she does not have the authority under the Clean Power Plan to cut \noff State roads and bridges funds.\n  So today, with my friends from Kentucky and Oklahoma, I have offered \nan amendment that is really quite simple. It says that Washington \nbureaucrats should not be allowed to punish innocent Americans by \nthreatening the roads and bridges they use just because a citizen's \nState may take a wait-and-see approach--a wait-and-see approach--as \ncourts rule on massive EPA regulations. These are regulations which \nwould threaten the middle class without having a meaningful impact on \nthe global climate.\n  The legal issues here will resolve themselves eventually. But \nwhatever our party or ideology, we should be able to agree that the \nFederal Government should not be punishing hard-working families just \nto score political points as States await legal clarification.\n  Let me say it again. The Administrator of the EPA does not believe \nshe has the authority to do this. We need to make it clear that the \nSenate opposes any step in that direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to amendment No. 836, \nwhich seeks to undercut the President's Clean Power Plan to address \nclimate change and reduce dangerous carbon pollution.\n  The year 2014 was the single most dangerous year ever recorded in \nterms of temperatures, the warmest in history. NOAA and NASA continue \nto chronicle this ever-worsening warming planet. Not only will the \nPresident's power plan reduce greenhouse gasses, but it will also \nreduce the amount of pollution that leads to dangerous smog-related \ndiseases that are contracted by Americans all across our planet.\n\n[[Page S2002]]\n\n  Instead of debating this amendment, we should be debating the way to \nreduce the impacts of dangerous greenhouse gases on our planet.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan).

The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this \namendment. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is, and always has \nbeen, an agency with excessive independence. The agency actually steals \nfunding from the Federal Reserve before it goes to the Federal \nGovernment, which takes away from our general fund. There is no control \nover any part of that agency.\n  Once it had a Director a year ago, we said there needed to be an \ninspector general taking a look at this problem. But the inspector \ngeneral said he has no access to the records, even though he works \nthere.\n  So this is an agency that is out of control.

There is 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote \non the Gardner amendment No. 443.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, this amendment does a very simple thing. \nIt protects State water rights. It creates a deficit-neutral reserve \nfund to make sure we are protecting privately held water rights from \nintrusion by the U.S. Forest Service or the ski area water rule, and it \nmakes sure we are keeping private water rights held safe from \ngroundwater rules by the U.S. Forest Service.\n  This is an effort to make sure we are protecting private water \nrights, preventing bypass flows, and making sure we are doing \neverything we can to make sure that State water law is the imminent \nfeature of our water in this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the Gardner amendment would radically \nchange the way water is handled on public lands. There are real \nconcerns about how Federal land management agencies deal with water, \nparticularly in the drought-afflicted West. But this amendment is so \nbroad that it is trying to address these problems in a way that will \nhave numerous unintended consequences. It would make even worse some of \nthe water shortages in the areas of the West, particularly in the Lower \nColorado Basin. It would also create havoc in our national parks in \nboth the East and the West.\n  The amendment would call into question the status of water contracts \nactually signed by the Bureau of Reclamation throughout the West. \nUncertainty is the last thing we need. It would have damaging \nimplications for settlements such as the Yakima Basin where people have \ncome to agreement.\n  I agree we need to continue to work on the drought issues in the \nWest. But saying that Federal management agencies don't have their \nobligations, such as helping in the national forests with \nfirefighters----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, once again, this is about water rights. \nThis is about making sure we protect State-held water rights.\n  It is a very clear contrast. If you believe water rights should be \nmanaged by the Federal Government, then vote against the amendment. But \nif you believe private water rights are under State law, managed by \nState law, decided by State law, then vote for this amendment.\n  Let's protect our private water rights. Let's keep our law clear--\nthat this matter belongs in the hands of the States and not in the \nhands of the Federal Government.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is 2 minutes of debate prior to the vote \non the Murray amendment No. 951.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as a former preschool teacher, I have \nseen firsthand the kind of transformation that early learning can \ninspire in a child. I believe we should be investing more in our \nchildren, not less. So today I am offering an amendment to expand \naccess to early childhood education so more kids can start kindergarten \nready to learn. This amendment would expand high-quality early learning \nopportunities for low- and moderate-income 3- and 4-year-olds and build \non the investments that Governors and legislators across the country, \nregardless of party affiliation, are already making to improve early \nlearning opportunities through public-private partnerships. It is fully \npaid for by closing wasteful tax loopholes. I hope our colleagues can \nsupport this critical amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this \namendment. All of us know there is a great value to pre-school, and the \nFederal Government already spends as much as $20 billion per year on \nearly childhood programs, including Head Start. This amendment would \ncall for $66 billion over 10 years, so it is just $6.6 billion per \nyear. But we already spend $20 billion, which is almost as much as we \nspend on kindergarten through 12th grade. How many programs do we need? \nWe have 45 at the moment.\n  One year ago, when we reauthorized the child development block grant, \nI offered an amendment to reduce the number of programs to five and put \nthem all under one agency. That would save enough money to do this. \nElementary and secondary education will be marked up, I think, when we \nget back. That committee process would be the appropriate place to \nconsider this proposal, not in the budget. I would ask for a ``no'' \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote \non Graham amendment No. 763.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am going to withdraw this amendment, but \nbefore I do, I will take a couple of minutes to explain what it would \ndo and what awaits us.\n  Most Members of the body don't understand, I think, that there are \n160 programs which are exempt from sequestration. Our pay is exempt \nfrom sequestration, as is Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, food stamps, most \nall of Medicare, all of Medicaid, and the Veterans' Administration. The \nmilitary, the intel community, and NIH have had devastating cuts, but \nwe don't include our own pay. At the end of the day, how can we justify \nmaking sure we take care of the veterans, but we are putting those who \nare serving our country in the fight today at risk?\n  So I will withdraw this amendment for now because I think we are \nabout to get some reason regarding sequestration, but if we don't, I \nwill have an amendment for each of the 160 programs, starting with our \npay. We need to feel the pain we are inflicting on other people.\n  I will withdraw this amendment for now, hoping we can fix \nsequestration, but if not, we need to take a look at the entire \ngovernment and let others feel the pain, not just those who wear the \nuniform and are doing the work this country needs to have done.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 763 Withdrawn\n\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 825\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote \non the Blumenthal amendment No. 825.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, this amendment helps to keep faith \nwith our veterans and to make sure we leave no veteran behind by \nreflecting and responding to their voices and the message they have \ngiven us about the need for more and better health care relating to \npost-traumatic stress, treatment for military sexual trauma, and an \nimprovement in the delivery of health care for them around the country.\n  It also improves the job training and rehabilitation programs for our \nveterans and makes sure, among other provisions, there is greater \naccountability and more funds and support for the inspector general of \nthe VA so we can avoid the kinds of gaps and egregious shortcomings we \nhave seen in this past year and also improve the Choice Program this \nCongress passed.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this bipartisan amendment.\n  I thank Senator Moran and Senator Baldwin for their support and \ncosponsorship and urge that we keep faith with our Nation's heroes and \nleave no veteran behind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we are willing to take this on a voice vote.\n  We yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Blumenthal amendment No. 825.\n  The amendment (No. 825) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 665\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote \non the Flake amendment No. 665.\n\n[[Page S2004]]\n\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, in 2009, the President signed Executive \nOrder 13502, which states that it is the policy of the Federal \nGovernment to encourage executive agencies to consider requiring the \nuse of PLAs, or project labor agreements, in connection with large-\nscale construction projects.\n  This Executive order did not mandate the use of PLAs. However, some \nFederal agencies have interpreted that order to require it, and so all \nthis amendment does is take it back to what the law intended--that the \nFederal Government is neutral with regard to the awarding of contracts, \nallowing the free market to work its will, and deliver to taxpayers the \nbest possible product at the best possible price.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Flake amendment--and Senator Flake is \nmy friend--strikes the project labor agreement option.\n  What is a project labor agreement? It is only awarded to a company \nafter they win the competitive bid. So they have to come in with a low \ncompetitive bill.\n  What does a project labor agreement contain? How much it is going to \ncost, what wages will be paid, and how disputes will be settled. The \nnet result is that projects cost less and they are done on time.\n  Why would we want to eliminate the possibility of saving taxpayers \nmoney with project labor agreements? I hope my colleagues will vote no \nso we can put the money we are going to save from the Flake amendment \ninto some important investments in America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I could have the attention of all \nSenators. At the rate we are going, we could be here until 5 a.m. in \nthe morning, so I think it is a good time to seek some cooperation.\n  We have a number of amendments lined up here where sponsors will take \na voice vote in the tranche we are working on now. If there are any \nSenators who are not in the current tranche and would like to be \nconsidered, I recommend that those Senators come over here and talk to \nthe budget staff and see if we can't take some of them and do it by a \nvoice vote and see if we can move through this process so we can get \nout of here at a reasonable hour.\n  I ask my friend the Democratic leader to give us a view of the status \non the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from South Carolina set a good \nexample by withdrawing his amendment. That is really what the standard \nshould be. Senator Blumenthal was second best when he said he would \ntake a voice vote. The only disagreement I would have with my friend \nthe Republican leader is that if we go through all of these amendments \nthat are pending, it will take 33 more hours. That is the math. That is \nthe truth. We need to move on.\n\n  Remember, this budget resolution is a statement of policy. It is not \nthe law. We can say ``I gotcha'' on this one, ``we gotcha'' on that \none, but that is--we have done that now for 8 hours or whatever it is.\n  I really do agree with the Republican leader. The staff has worked so \nhard. They haven't worked just today and yesterday and this week; they \nhave been working for weeks to get us to the position where we are \ntonight. I know the Republican leader bought dinner tonight, and I \nappreciate that very much. But if we can get finished here by 11:30, I \nwill buy dinner when we get back, and it will be better than that.\n  So we have had an ample vote-arama. For all the new Members, they see \nwhat it is like. The time has come for Senators to show some restraint.\n  No one's election is going to be determined--I say that to the world. \nNo one's election is going to be determined by what is taking place \nhere tonight--no election. I defy anyone to show me in any of these \nvote-aramas where a vote has made any difference. And we are witnesses \nto that, and I can testify to that. One time, to show my colleagues how \nmeaningless these votes are, we voted against prisoners being able to \nhave Viagra in prison. We actually voted on that. No one lost an \nelection. By the way, it was defeated.\n  So let's--we can go through all of the Viagra amendments and do all \nof these things to embarrass each other, but that isn't what we should \nbe doing. The time has come to forgo pressing amendments to votes \naltogether.\n  It has been very dignified. Earlier today, I said how proud I am of \nthe two managers of this legislation. They have totally different \npolitical outlooks, but they have been gentlemen to each other and \ngentlemen to each of us.\n  So I hope we can move forward as quickly as possible. The agreement \nfor the dinner was not a Las Vegas bet; it is something I will do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will just add, we will finish \ntonight, and it might help us move quicker, in addition to having voice \nvotes on a lot of amendments, if we sit at our own desks and see if we \ncan just get through this as rapidly as possible without denying anyone \ntheir rights.\n  So I recommend we go ahead, whatever the next amendment is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, no one believes in tax policy that has the \neffect of shipping jobs overseas.\n  My amendment, which is cosponsored by Senator Wyden--a true \nbipartisan amendment--goes right to the heart of what amendment No. 523 \nof my friend from Michigan and amendment No. 817 of my friend from \nIllinois claimed to be doing.\n  Tax policy leaders of all ideological stripes agree on a key point. \nThe U.S. corporate tax rate is the highest among our trading partners \nand is making American firms less competitive, thereby hurting American \nworkers.\n  My amendment would put in place a deficit-neutral reserve fund to \nbring the corporate rate down and to prevent the bleeding of U.S. jobs. \nVote for it to preserve and grow U.S. jobs.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment, as I \nunderstand it, is to prevent American jobs from being moved overseas. I \nthink if we are serious about this, we may want to change our \ndisastrous trade policies, which have led to the shutdown of thousands \nof factories in this country and millions of decent-paying jobs. In my \nview, at a time when we have an $18 trillion national debt, the last \nthing we need to do is to cut corporate taxes on profitable \ncorporations that in many cases pay little or nothing in Federal taxes.\n  We have major corporation after major corporation making billions of \ndollars. They pay zero in Federal income taxes. I don't quite know how \nyou can lower their taxes below zero. We need real tax reform in this \ncountry that ends corporate loopholes that is costing us well over $100 \nbillion a year.\n  So I would urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I think the Senator, through the Chair, \nwould yield to me for a moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon be given 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I support this \namendment.\n  President Obama favors lowering this tax rate, and I believe the \nreason he does is because he thinks this will provide another \nopportunity to reduce offshoring. I support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Since this is bipartisan, I would hope we would take this \nby voice vote. And it is the chairman and ranking member of the \ncommittees who have to do the work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 1029.\n  The amendment (No. 1029) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, yesterday, I corrected the record on the \nmatter of tax expenditures. That statement focused on individual income \ntax expenditures. According to 2014 Congressional Budget Office data, \nthe individual income tax accounts for 47.1 percent of federal revenue. \nBy contrast, the corporate income tax accounts for 11.9 percent of \nfederal revenue. Today I am going to discuss corporate tax \nexpenditures.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress's nonpartisan official tax \nscorekeeper, provides scoring and analysis of corporate tax \nexpenditures. What are corporate tax expenditures? In a general sense, \nthey are departures from a regular income tax. A regular income tax \nrecords income and provides deductions for expenses related to \nproducing income to arrive at net income. Tax benefits in the form of \nexclusions, deductions, and credits not connected to the generation of \nbusiness income are generally treated as corporate tax expenditures. As \nthe tax-writing committee hearings have shown, our business tax system \nis overloaded with subsidies and other complex special provisions. \nThose deviations from basic measures of net income can result in \neconomic inefficiencies, slow growth, and an economy that produces \nfewer jobs than it otherwise would. From a revenue-neutral standpoint, \nthe flip side of that narrower, less-efficient tax base is a higher \nthan optimal tax rate. It is a matter of broad-based consensus of \nsenior tax policymakers from the left to the right that there is a \n``two-fer'' in broadening the tax base and lowering the rate. This \napplies to both corporate businesses and noncorporate businesses.\n  To the extent Congress delays translating the bipartisan goal of a \nbroader business base and lower rates into concrete policy, the dangers \nof further inversion transactions and foreign takeovers looms on the \neconomic horizon. My friends on the left side of the political spectrum \nshould be the most concerned. Why? The reason is the local economies \nmost vulnerable to inversions and foreign takeovers of U.S.-based \nbusinesses are in business sectors that dominate in the high cost-of-\nliving, high-tax so-called ``Blue States.'' I am referring to the high-\ntech, pharmaceutical, and other cutting-edge intellectual property \nproducing business sectors. Those business sectors tend to be based in \nhigh-cost, high-tax blue States. My friends on the other side should be \nvery sensitive to threats to their local economies.\n  For that reason, I continue to be stunned to see many of most liberal \nfriends on the other side take positions on this budget resolution that \nare at odds with the goal of tax reform. Cherry-picking corporate tax \nexpenditures to use for new spending, if it were to become viable \npolicy, would starve the resources for tax reform. If my friends on the \nother side were to prevail on this strategy, you could forget about the \nbipartisan goal of broadening the business tax base and lowering tax \nrates. Their policy positions, if enacted, would leave tax policymakers \nwith no resources to engage in reform. In fact, a broader U.S. tax base \nwith rates that are already too high would make U.S.-based businesses \nless competitive. The tax baggage of being a U.S.-based business would \ngrow, further tipping the balance toward foreign control by inversions \nand takeovers.\n  The debate on corporate tax expenditures isn't about the merits of \nthose policies. That debate on the merits of corporate tax expenditures \ncould, should, and will be joined in legislating tax reform. That is a \nbipartisan goal for a bipartisan policy result that is necessary to \nbuild a stronger American economy.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1063\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote on the Schatz amendment No. 1063.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1063, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I ask unanimous consent that my amendment No. 1063 be \nmodified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO ENSURING \n                   EQUAL TREATMENT OF MARRIED COUPLES UNDER THE \n                   SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM AND BY THE DEPARTMENT \n                   OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution \n     for one or more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, \n     amendments between the Houses, motions, or conference reports \n     relating to ensuring equal treatment of married couples, \n     which may include ensuring that all legally married spouses \n     have access to Social Security benefits after the death of \n     their spouse and to benefits under laws administered by the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs, by the amounts provided in \n     such legislation for those purposes, provided that such \n     legislation would not increase the deficit over either the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through 2020 or the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2016 through 2025.\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. All legally married, same-sex couples deserve equal \ntreatment under the law, regardless of\n\n[[Page S2006]]\n\nwhere they live. But right now, eligibility for spousal benefits \nprovided under the Social Security Act and by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs is determined by a place-of-residence standard. That \nmeans that legally married same-sex couples who move to a State that \ndoesn't recognize same-sex marriage could be denied Social Security and \nveterans survivor benefits.\n  Plain and simple, this is wrong, and this doesn't reflect our \nAmerican values. This amendment will fix this and provide equal \nprotection under the law and the Social Security and veterans benefits \nthat gay Americans have earned. I would be happy to entertain a voice \nvote in support of this amendment if the majority is amenable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it has come to my attention that is not \ngoing to be possible on this amendment.\n  Again, this is a statement that has to be handled by the committee of \njurisdiction and has no real effect. So I would ask that everybody vote \n``no'' on this one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Schatz \namendment No. 1063, as modified.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is 2 minutes of debate prior \nto a vote on Kirk amendment No. 1038.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Illinois, we \nare offering an alternative to the Sanders amendment that failed \nearlier today. The Sanders amendment called for a substantial increase \nin the minimum wage, an action that the Congressional Budget Office has \ntold us could kill up to 1 million jobs.\n  The Kirk amendment takes a different approach. It reaffirms the \nability of the individual States to raise the minimum wage above the \nFederal level, but only if they choose to do so at their own volition.\n  It also calls for policies that will result in higher wages for all \nAmericans, progrowth tax relief and the elimination of burdensome \nmandates such as ObamaCare.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Kirk amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Frankly, I don't quite understand this amendment. This \nis what it says: This amendment would ``establish a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund'' to reaffirm that States can raise minimum wage while \nproviding tax relief and eliminating excessive government mandates.\n  States do not need permission from the Federal Government to raise \nthe minimum wage. In fact, 29 States have already raised the minimum \nwage. And in the last election, when that question was on the ballot in \nfour States, all four of those States voted to raise the minimum wage.\n  People all over this country want us to raise the Federal minimum \nwage, which is now a starvation wage of $7.25 an hour.\n  So this amendment, quite frankly, does not make a whole lot of sense \nto me. I would hope it will be defeated.\n  States are looking to the Federal Government to raise the minimum \nwage. We don't have to tell them what to do. They are doing just fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this amendment is a reaffirmation of the \n10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n  I ask for the support of our colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The amendment is pending.\n  There is 2 minutes of debate on the amendment.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, this is an amendment to call a point of \norder on any legislation that would attempt to muzzle Federal employees \nin using any scientific language that calls a change--scientific \nlanguage that would apply to oceans, to weather, to the climate, and to \natmospheres.\n  This is an attempt to make clear that we do not agree with muzzling \nor censoring Federal agencies or Federal employees when it comes to \nemploying their scientific knowledge.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this amendment is not germane to the budget \nresolution. It creates a point of order concerning subject matter that \nis not within the jurisdiction of the Committee on the Budget, \nprohibiting Federal employees or agencies from exercising their freedom \nof speech by prohibiting using terms from atmospheric scientific \nliterature.\n  While I know many of my colleagues have strong opinions on this \ntopic, it is not appropriate for inclusion in a budget resolution. In \nfact, this amendment is corrosive. It damages the privilege of the \nbudget. Therefore, when debate time expires I will raise a point of \norder that this amendment is not germane to the budget resolution and I \nencourage my colleagues to sustain it.\n\n[[Page S2007]]\n\n  I guess that probably concludes the debate.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has 7 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, this is an issue of freedom of speech, \nFirst Amendment rights. This is in fact--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, amendment No. 944 is not germane to the \nbudget resolution now before the Senate.

Mr. President, this amendment is simple. It says that \nchildren who show up at our border will not be allowed to stay. They \nwill be returned to the country they came from. Right now they are \nbeing transported up by the lowest form of life that ever existed on \nthe Earth. Young women are being raped, people are being killed, people \nare being molested, and the drug cartels are the ones that are bringing \nthem up. This has got to stop. They can go to the consulate and the \nembassies in their countries--I am talking about the three Central \nAmerican countries, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. But to have \nthe drug cartels and parents paying thousands of dollars to have them \ntransported up, many of the young women being raped on the way, is \nunacceptable.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 360, as Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I have a modification at the desk and ask unanimous \nconsent that my amendment be modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3__.

The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I did raise an objection to the change, \nalthough I appreciate the fact that the Senator made that change.\n  I rise to oppose amendment No. 360 which would roll back critical \nantitrafficking and humanitarian protections for children from Central \nAmerica. Last summer I led a congressional delegation to the Rio Grande \nValley border to view the humanitarian crisis of unaccompanied children \nfrom Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Clearly, concrete cells at \nBorder Patrol stations are no place for children, which is where they \nlikely would be under the expedited deportation proceedings allowed \nunder this amendment. These young children are fleeing danger and \nviolence in their own home countries. It is also no answer to require \nthese children to seek asylum in their home countries while being \nexposed to the very violence they are trying to escape in the first \nplace.\n  This is the portion of the amendment the Senator has eliminated. It \nstill doesn't leave out the part about expedited deportation. So let's \nkeep the current law in place that--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. HIRONO.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 968, and I urge \nSenators to support this amendment because it will cut taxes on the \nmiddle class and give millions of Americans a new ladder of economic \nopportunity. This amendment rewards hard work, makes college more \naffordable, and helps parents who have a tough time making ends meet. \nLet's create a new path upward for the middle class and those who want \nto be middle class. Support this amendment.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n[[Page S2008]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, once again I have to ask my colleagues to \nvote ``no.'' This is a tax reform idea that has some merit, but it has \nto be dealt with in the context of comprehensive tax reform rather than \na stand-alone proposal. I know that he and his Finance Committee \nchairman, Senator Hatch, are working on changing the Tax Code to \neliminate some of the overcomplicated, inefficient, and archaic \nlanguage, so we should address it in the committee of jurisdiction, not \nin the budget.\n  Even though the amendment is deficit neutral, it is, again, telling a \ncommittee what to do and how to do it, and it is even by the person who \nhas the capability to do that.

Mr. President, the Federal Government owns almost two-thirds \nof the land in Utah and almost half of the land in the 11 coterminous \nStates in the Western United States. But unlike other property owners, \nthe Federal Government does not pay property tax. As a result, areas \nwith high concentrations of Federal land, such as most of Utah and most \nof the Western United States, face budget shortfalls that affect the \nability of those States to fund critical education, transportation \ninfrastructure, and emergency services.\n  To help compensate local governments for this loss of property tax \nrevenue, the Federal Government created the PILT Program--PILT stands \nfor Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program--to provide some funding for these \nrevenue shortfalls.\n  Historically, PILT payments tend to represent just a tiny fraction, \njust pennies on the dollar for what these jurisdictions could otherwise \ncollect in property tax revenue.\n  Now to correct the damage caused by this unfair system----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEE. I ask my colleagues to vote for this amendment which would \nallow us to bring PILT into conformity with what these jurisdictions \nwould otherwise receive from taxation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment. While there are many of us who support full funding for \nPILT, this amendment is impractical. In fact, the Congressional \nResearch Service reports indicate that attempts to set up tax \nequivalency for PILT would be wrought with errors and gamesmanship. \nThat is because counties routinely tax different land uses at different \nrates.\n  Second, my colleagues should note that this may increase PILT \npayments more than 350 percent of today's authorized level, and that \nwould raise the cost of this program from $4 to $5 billion, to $15 to \n$20 billion.\n  Because the amendment creates a spending-neutral reserve fund, only \ncuts to other mandatory spending programs could be used to fund the 350 \npercent rise in payments.\n  So, Mr. President, I cannot support this amendment. It is \nunsustainable and unworkable, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is now 2 minutes of debate prior to a \nvote on the Reed amendment No. 919.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this amendment is based on legislation \nSenator Blumenthal and I introduced last Congress to close a major \nloophole in the current corporate tax law by putting an end to \nunlimited tax write-offs for performance-based executive pay. In 1993, \nCongress limited the deductibility of executive pay to $1 million, with \nan exception for performance-based compensation. But over the last two \ndecades, corporations have made the exception the rule, and we have \nseen more pay designated as performance based even in some cases where \nthe company is not doing very well for the shareholders.\n  It has been estimated that between 2007 and 2010, $121.5 billion in \nexecutive pay was deductible, and roughly 55 percent of that was for \nperformance-based compensation. Businesses and shareholders should \nestablish the pay of their officers and employees, but the taxpayers \nshould not be subsidizing excessive pay at corporations. I urge a \n``yes'' vote. It will save more than $50 billion over 10 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, again I ask my colleagues to vote ``no.'' \nTax reform must be handled by the tax committee. Putting it in the \nbudget does not help move the process forward. There are a number of \nquestions the committee needs to address: What does it mean, corporate \ncompensation in excess of $1 million? Does that include or exclude \nhealth care? Does this include baseball players and actors and \nactresses as well? What are we talking about with limiting \ncompensation? Can you limit compensation for people by a Federal law? \nIf they have earned more than that, what about people who are operating \nunder contract?\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment. It will be \nhandled in the tax committee when we consider tax reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs. \nFeinstein) and the Senator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I simply \nwant to account for the full economic impact of such designations, and \nI urge my colleagues to cast a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there are two ways to repeal landmark \nenvironmental law. One is through the front door, and the amendment \nwould say we abandon the Endangered Species Act. It is gone.

There is now 2 minutes of debate prior to a \nvote on the Reed amendment No. 919.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this amendment is based on legislation \nSenator Blumenthal and I introduced last Congress to close a major \nloophole in the current corporate tax law by putting an end to \nunlimited tax write-offs for performance-based executive pay. In 1993, \nCongress limited the deductibility of executive pay to $1 million, with \nan exception for performance-based compensation. But over the last two \ndecades, corporations have made the exception the rule, and we have \nseen more pay designated as performance based even in some cases where \nthe company is not doing very well for the shareholders.\n  It has been estimated that between 2007 and 2010, $121.5 billion in \nexecutive pay was deductible, and roughly 55 percent of that was for \nperformance-based compensation. Businesses and shareholders should \nestablish the pay of their officers and employees, but the taxpayers \nshould not be subsidizing excessive pay at corporations. I urge a \n``yes'' vote. It will save more than $50 billion over 10 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, again I ask my colleagues to vote ``no.'' \nTax reform must be handled by the tax committee. Putting it in the \nbudget does not help move the process forward. There are a number of \nquestions the committee needs to address: What does it mean, corporate \ncompensation in excess of $1 million? Does that include or exclude \nhealth care? Does this include baseball players and actors and \nactresses as well? What are we talking about with limiting \ncompensation? Can you limit compensation for people by a Federal law? \nIf they have earned more than that, what about people who are operating \nunder contract?\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment. It will be \nhandled in the tax committee when we consider tax reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment establishes a reserve fund \nto ensure the Fish and Wildlife Service considers the cumulative \neconomic impact of a critical habitat designation\n\n[[Page S2010]]\n\nand not just the incremental impact when listing a previously \ndesignated critical habitat.\n  A critical habitat designation provides additional protections for \nendangered species, but States like Arkansas have seen critical habitat \ndesignations that do not take into account the full economic impact on \nfarmers, ranchers, and landowners.\n  Previously, the full economic impact of a designation was considered, \nbut that has been modified recently so only the marginal impact between \nthe endangered species listing and the critical habitat designation is \nconsidered.\n  Any reforms should not change the listing process, and I would not \nsuggest we should change the listing process in this measure. I simply \nwant to account for the full economic impact of such designations, and \nI urge my colleagues to cast a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there are two ways to repeal landmark \nenvironmental law. One is through the front door, and the amendment \nwould say we abandon the Endangered Species Act. It is gone. And one \nway is through the back door. This is through the back door.\n  If radical amendments like this one were in place, we would not have \nsaved the great American Bald Eagle, the symbol of our Nation.\n  If you believe that God's creations should be preserved, vote no on \nthe Cotton amendment.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator is right.\n  There is 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote on Brown amendment No. \n994.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe disposition of the Brown amendment, which we were just discussing, \nNo. 994, the next amendments in order be the following and that the \nSenate vote on the amendments in the order listed with no second-degree \namendments in order prior to the votes: Vitter No. 811, Warren No. \n1094, Lee No. 855, Cardin No. 367, Rubio No. 552, and Kaine No. 1047, \nas modified.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided between the managers or their designees prior to each vote and \nthat all votes after the first in this series be 10 minutes in length.\n  Let me just say parenthetically that if everyone will stay in their \nseat--the clerk tells me it takes 7 minutes to call the roll. So if \neveryone will stay in their seat, we will go straight through. They \ntell me it takes 7 minutes to do it. This should take us about an hour \nif we get started.\n  Further, I ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of \nthe listed amendments and any cleared amendments agreed to by both \nmanagers and both leaders, the remaining pending amendments be \nwithdrawn and the Senate proceed to vote on adoption of the resolution, \nas amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask to call up amendment No. 994.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, 18 years ago, the 6 biggest U.S. banks had \nassets equal to 18 percent of the GDP. Today, those six banks' combined \nassets are about 63 percent of GDP, with an average of more than 5,000 \nlegal entities operating in 57 different countries.\n  Dodd-Frank requires large banks to produce an annual living will \nexplaining the bank's plan for its own rapid and orderly resolution \nthrough the bankruptcy process in the event of material financial \ndistress or failure. The Brown-Vitter amendment says that if banks \ncannot credibly explain how they can fail safely, then they are \nconsidered too big to fail and they need to have more capital or be \nrestructured until they can go bankrupt without a government bailout.\n  As Chairman Shelby told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, if a \nbank is too big to fail, it is probably too big to exist.\n  I ask support for the Brown-Vitter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, there is no objection on our side. We would \nhope for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Brown \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 994) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 811\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote \non Vitter amendment No. 811.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, during the ObamaCare debate on the Senate \nfloor, the Senate passed an amendment to the Obama bill saying that all \nMembers of Congress need to go to our exchange for health care, just as \nother Americans have gone to the exchange--no special deal, no special \nexemptions, and no special subsidy.\n  After that was passed into law, a lot of folks didn't like it, and a \nspecial rule was applied by the Obama administration to change some of \nthat situation. This amendment would say: No, we are going to live by \nthat statute. We are going to go to the exchange for our health care--\nno special subsidy, no special deal--and it would also apply to the \nPresident, the Vice President, and their political appointees.\n  This amendment would not change anything at all with regard to \ncongressional staff.\n  I urge support for my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, colleagues, this is very important. Today, \nevery single Senator is treated like every single person in the country \nwho works for a large employer. Those large employers all make a \ncontribution to their employees' health care. We don't get any \nsubsidies. We don't qualify for subsidies. We are treated like everyone \nelse in this country who has an employer contribution to their health \ncare.\n  Now, colleagues, you do not have to take that employer contribution. \nIf you don't want it, give it back. You don't need this amendment to \ngive it back. If you feel as strongly as Senator Vitter does that you \nand your family don't want or need this employer contribution, then \ngive it back to the Treasury, as I assume Senator Vitter does.\n  Again, we don't need this amendment. If you don't want your employer \ncontribution, you vote yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time for debate has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And if you believe we should be treated like everyone \nelse in the country, vote no. That is how I am voting.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote \non the Warren amendment No. 1094, as modified.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, more than ever, our seniors depend on \nsafety and reliability of Social Security. For 15 million seniors, \nSocial Security is the only thing that stands between them and poverty.\n  For too long in Washington, Social Security has been under assault. \nRepublicans have long argued that we have to gut the program to save \nit. Well, they are wrong. We shouldn't be talking about gutting Social \nSecurity. We should be talking about strengthening Social Security. We \nshould be talking about protecting Social Security. We should be \ntalking about expanding Social Security.\n  This amendment supports those goals. We acknowledge the need to make \ncertain the program is solvent--something that people can depend on. We \nreject the false choice that too many Republicans have put forward to \nscare our seniors into believing they must absorb drastic cuts in the \nbenefits they depend on. And we believe when two-thirds of the \nseniors----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. WARREN. Two minutes? Oh, 1 minute. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, at the present time, Social Security has an \nunfunded liability of $25 trillion over the infinite horizon. There is \na problem. It is not to scare seniors, it is to preserve and make the \nprogram sustainable.\n  When President Clinton was in office, he and Rick Santorum held a \nday's seminar on Social Security reform. We broke into Republican-\nDemocratic House and Senate groups the next day. We came up with a \nblueprint for saving Social Security and to fix it. We recognized it \ntook many different options, just not one option. One option will not \nsolve the problem, and no one party can address the issue alone.\n  We are prohibited by statute from making changes to Social Security \nin a budget resolution, and that is probably a good thing. So I urge a \n``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Warren \namendment, as modified.\n  Ms. WARREN.

There is 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote \non Lee amendment No. 855.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, this amendment, amendment No. 855, would \ncreate a budget point of order--a point of order that would make it \nclear it is not in order to consider a debt ceiling increase using \nreconciliation instructions under this budget.\n  While the language in this budget does not itself expressly authorize \nthe use of reconciliation for this purpose, it does nothing to prohibit \nsuch language from being added in conference. So the point of order at \nissue would impact only legislation that attempts to use reconciliation \ninstructions to pass a debt limit increase, and it would require an \naffirmative vote of two-thirds of the Members duly sworn and chosen.\n\n[[Page S2013]]\n\n  This is something the American people deserve to have debated and \ndiscussed independently. It is also something that ought to require an \nenhanced threshold.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support amendment No. 855.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, deciding whether to increase the debt \nlimit is like putting purchases on your credit card and then deciding \nwhether to pay the bill. Increasing the debt limit is not a license to \ntake on more debt, it simply makes it possible to pay the bills we have \nalready incurred.\n  Recent history shows that leaving this to the last minute, and even \ncoming close to hitting the debt limit, is extremely dangerous for our \ncountry and, in fact, the entire world. Even the remote possibility of \ndefault by the U.S. Government is enough to throw markets into turmoil \nand has resulted in credit rating agencies downgrading our credit \nworthiness.\n\n  Unfortunately, in recent years some of my Republican colleagues have \nused raising the debt limit as a way to extract policy concessions that \ninvariably include draconian cuts to programs that are important to \nworking families and the middle class. This amendment continues that \ntrend by making it even harder to raise the debt limit and thus \neasier----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. SANDERS.--to cause an international panic.\n  I urge colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there is an estimated 5.85 million \ncitizens who can't vote as a result of criminal convictions and nearly \n4.4 million of those have already been released from prison. One out of \nevery 13 African Americans of voting age have lost their right to vote.\n  This amendment creates a deficit-neutral reserve fund in order to \nconsider voter reenfranchisement initiatives. It is not descriptive as \nto the type.\n  Senator Paul has introduced legislation on this subject. I have \nintroduced legislation on this subject. I would hope this would be \naccepted by voice vote. It spells out in the amendment that we would \nlike the U.S. attorney to inform during plea agreements the impact on \ndefendants on their rights to vote, and that we would like to have data \nconcerning the impact on minority populations.\n  I hope we could move forward with this, and I would be willing to \naccept this on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am going to have to recommend a ``no'' \nvote because of States' rights concerns. There are 48 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia that prohibit voting while incarcerated for a \nfelony offense. I was fascinated to find that only two States--Maine \nand Vermont--permit persons in prison to vote.\n  An estimated 5.85 million Americans--one in 40 adults--has currently \nor permanently lost their voting rights as a result of a felony \nconviction. But each State has its own process for restoring the voting \nrights to ex-offenders now. States are best suited to make the judgment \ncall, as they are closest to their citizens.\n  So I ask for a States' rights vote of ``no.''\n  Mr. CARDIN.

DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO REVISE \n                   OR REPEAL SEQUESTRATION.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other appropriate levels and limits in this \n     resolution for one or more bills, joint resolutions, \n     amendments, amendments between the Houses, motions, or \n     conference reports that amend section 251(c) of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 or the \n     enforcement procedures under section 251A of that Act to \n     revise or repeal the discretionary spending limits and \n     enforcement procedures established under those sections, \n     relating to providing relief from sequestration and the \n     reduction in discretionary spending limits for fiscal years \n     2016 and 2017, split evenly between both the revised security \n     category and the revised nonsecurity category, and offsetting \n     such relief through targeted changes in mandatory or \n     discretionary spending programs (not pertaining to Social \n     Security) and tax expenditures by the amounts provided in \n     such legislation for those purposes, provided that such \n     legislation would not increase the deficit over the period of \n     the total of fiscal years 2016 through 2025. For purposes of \n     determining deficit-neutrality under this section, the \n     Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may \n     include the estimated effects of any amendment or amendments \n     to the discretionary spending limits.\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. ADJUSTMENTS FOR SEQUESTRATION REPLACEMENT.\n\n       (a) Mechanism for Implementing Increase in Discretionary \n     Limits.--If a measure becomes law that amends the \n     discretionary spending limits established under section \n     251(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control \n     Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 901(c)), the adjustments to \n     discretionary spending limits under section 251(b) of that \n     Act (2 U.S.C. 901(b)), or the enforcement procedures \n     established under section 251A of that Act (2 U.S.C. 901a), \n     the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     shall adjust the allocation called for in section 302(a) of \n     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 633(a)) to the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, and may adjust all \n     other budgetary aggregates, allocations, levels, and limits \n     contained in this resolution, as necessary, consistent with \n     such measure, up to the amounts specified and reserved in \n     subparagraph (b).\n       (b) Amounts Specified and Reserved.--The amounts specified \n     (and to be reserved from the allocation called for in section \n     302(a) allocation of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 \n     U.S.C. 633(a)) to the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     Senate until such time as the conditions specified in \n     subsection (a) are met are--\n       (1) for fiscal year 2016--\n       (A) for the revised security category, $37,000,000,000 in \n     budget authority (and the outlays flowing therefrom); and\n       (B) for the revised nonsecurity category, $37,000,000,000 \n     in budget authority (and the outlays flowing therefrom); and\n       (2) for fiscal year 2017--\n       (A) for the revised security category, $37,000,000,000 in \n     budget authority (and the outlays flowing therefrom); and\n       (B) for the revised nonsecurity category, $37,000,000,000 \n     in budget authority (and the outlays flowing therefrom).\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, the key budget issue that we are grappling \nwith is what will we do about sequester in the budget caps. All of us \nsince March of 2013 have heard in our various committees about the \neffect these caps are having on our national defense, our law \nenforcement, medical research, education, and every other priority. \nThis amendment does two simple things. It creates a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund to allow us to look for a sequester replacement that can \nanalyze mandatory programs other than Social Security, discretionary \nprograms, and tax entitlements--tax expenditures. Second, it creates a \nmechanism if such a bill is enacted to adjust the budget caps. If we \nare serious about lifting sequester, we should vote for this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, one of the things the Republicans on the \nBudget Committee have suggested was that as soon as we finish the \nbudget, which we hope to finish by April 15, that we could begin to \nlook at the Budget Control Act itself. The budget resolution already \nprovides for sequester replacement. There is a reserve fund in place \nfor the sequester to use if the circumstances permit. Additionally this \namendment would increase taxes, not to reduce the deficit but to \nincrease spending. At a time when our national debt exceeds $18 \ntrillion when our debt is bigger than our economy, we need to talk \nabout cutting spending and taxes, not increasing them.\n  On the last recorded vote for the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution, \nI urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Kaine \namendment No. 1047, as modified.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Very briefly. I thank all Members of the Senate for \ntheir cooperation. I know it has been a trying day, and we appreciate \neverybody's cooperation in getting this important measure to the finish \nline. It will be a good day for the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the pending \namendments are withdrawn and the question occurs on adoption of S. Con. \nRes. 11, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n\n\n                            SGR Legislation\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I, too, wish to express my appreciation to \neveryone who worked today. The thing I enjoyed most of all was the \nrecess subject to the call of the Chair.\n  One thing we all acknowledge that we need to do is to prevent \nautomatic cuts to doctors under Medicare because it is not only \nimportant to the doctors, it is also important to the patients--the so-\ncalled sustainable growth rate, or SGR--and we need to reauthorize the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program.\n  There is a lot of stuff in the bill that passed the House. They got \n392 votes on that. That is a rare vote over there. I am pleased they \ndid that. We are willing, over here, to proceed with this matter \ntonight.\n  As I indicated to the leader earlier on today, we had hoped we could \nget this done, but I understand it is late, whatever day it is. It is a \nbill that is 362 pages long. We are willing to move forward. I am \ndisappointed we may not be able to get it done tonight. I sure wish we \ncould. If we can't, I hope the majority leader will move to this matter \nas soon as we get back here after the recess. It is a very important \npiece of legislation that we all acknowledge we need to do.\n  I understand we want to help the physicians. I acknowledge that, but \nremember, those Medicare physicians take care of people who are badly \nin need of health care. It is not only for the doctors that we need to \ndo this, we need to do it for their patients.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, just to reassure my colleagues, CMS \nindicates that they can handle this for up to 2 weeks. It was \nencouraging that this passed the House with such a large bipartisan \nmajority, and I want to reassure everyone who is interested in this \nlegislation that we will move to it very quickly when we get back. As I \nindicated, once again, they can handle a 2-week gap here. We will turn \nto this legislation very quickly when we get back. I think there is \nevery reason to believe it will pass the Senate by a very large \nmajority.\n  Mr. REID. Finally, it is my understanding that when we come back, we \ncould have a very limited number of amendments to try to dispose of \nthis.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am sorry. I didn't hear the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I said when we come back after 2 weeks, I \nhope the majority leader will consider a very limited number of \namendments with time agreements on them.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Democratic leader and I will discuss the way \nforward. But I wanted to reassure everyone that this 2-week delay will \nnot impact this, and I believe we will be able to figure out a way to \ngo forward very quickly on something that is so overwhelmingly popular \non a bipartisan basis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on adoption of S. Con. Res. \n11, as amended.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Teddy Roosevelt once noted that one of his \nlife's great prizes was to work hard at work worth doing. Well, I \nbelieve the work we have done this week to boost our Nation's economy, \nsupport our national defense, and expand opportunity for hard-working \nfamilies is work truly worth doing.\n  The budget we have been debating in the Senate this week will boost \nthe Nation's economic growth by more than $500 billion over the next 10 \nyears, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It \nalso will balance the budget in 10 years, with no tax hikes, protect \nthe Nation's most vulnerable citizens, strengthen America's national \ndefense, and improve economic growth and opportunity for hard-working \nfamilies.\n  This budget's economic growth dividend means that more jobs will be \ncreated across the country in all 50 States. In fact, the Senate Budget \nCommittee estimates that nationwide there will be more than 1.3 million \nadditional jobs in 2025. And this is only the spending reductions \nincluded in this budget. If the Senate takes the additional step and \nadds the recommended tax and regulatory reforms\n\n[[Page S2023]]\n\nto these spending reductions, the economic and job benefits will be \neven bigger.\n  This balanced budget is an important first step to help Washington \nlive within its means, just as hard-working families have to do every \nday. A balanced budget means real accountability in Washington and \nensures that programs actually accomplish what they set out to deliver.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues for their consideration, cooperation, \nand patience to bring us to this point. I wish to particularly thank \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for allowing the Senate and \nSenators to actually do our job, both in committee and on the floor of \nthe Senate. Under Majority Leader McConnell, we have received support \nand backing from the Senate Republican leadership, and it has been a \ngreat leadership team. It is because of this leadership that we have \ncome to this result--the first Senate Republican resolution since 2006.\n  This commitment to an open, honest, and transparent legislative \nprocess is crucial to helping Congress restore the trust of the \nAmerican people.\n  I also owe thanks to the outstanding Republican members of the Senate \nBudget Committee, who worked long and fought so hard and tenaciously to \noutline a plan that can balance the budget over the next 10 fiscal \nyears. Thanks also are due to the many Members on this side who came \nand spoke on the budget's behalf, offered amendments to make it \nbetter--well, almost always to make it better--and worked with us and \neach other to move through the resolution's debate and voting process \ntogether.\n  I have enjoyed my partnership with Senator Sanders since we both took \non our new roles just a few months ago at the beginning of the 114th \nCongress. We have known each other a long time, served on some of the \nsame Senate committees, and to have him across the aisle managing this \nbill with me has been an enjoyable part of acting on my first budget \nresolution. I also appreciate his staff who worked with him so \ndiligently.\n  I also wish to focus for a moment on some of the staff who helped \nlead us here. I thank the Republican staff of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, including the director, Eric Ueland; my deputy staff \ndirector Dan Kowalski; parliamentarian Tori Gorman; chief economist \nBill Beach; director of budget review Matt Giroux; senior budget \nanalysts Peter Warren and Steve Robinson; budget analysts Greg \nD'Angelo, Chris Cook, John Selden, and Andrew Herther; junior budget \nanalyst Kaitlin Vogt; chief counsel Greg Dean and assistant counsel \nClint Brown; editor Elizabeth Keys; Susan Eckerly; communications \ndirector Joe Brenckle; executive assistant Kim Proctor, and staff \nassistant Katie Wachob. Without all their work, which began last year, \nwe would not be here this evening standing on the verge of passing the \nSenate's fiscal year 2016 budget resolution.\n  I have to mention that they didn't even change offices when we got \nthe majority so that they could be working on this budget, knowing that \nsince it is always our first opportunity in the majority, we had a lot \nof work to do.\n  In addition, thanks are owed to the chief clerk of the committee, \nAdam Kamp, and his dedicated staff, who worked tirelessly supporting us \nin our efforts.\n  As well, thanks to my personal staff, including my legislative \ndirector Tara Shaw, and the personal office legislative team of Travis \nJordan, Becky Cole, Clint Lohse, Renee Bender, Bart Massey, Kristin \nChapman, and Elizabeth Schwartz. I particularly have to mention my \nchief of staff, Flip McConnaughey.\n  We have been supported by the great work of our floor and cloakroom \nstaff, led by Laura Dove and Robert Duncan; the Senate Parliamentarian \nElizabeth MacDonough and her team, along with our bill and amendment \nclerks who keep us on the straight and narrow. Key staff from Senator \nMcConnell's office have been very helpful, including his chief of staff \nSharon Soderstrom, his policy director Hazel Marshall, and his budget \nand appropriations policy adviser John Burks.\n  Also, I wish to thank Russ Sullivan, Monica Popp, and Johnny Slemrod \nfrom Senator Cornyn's Whip Office.\n  After 5 days of consideration and 50 hours of debate on our budget \nresolution, truly everything that can be said has probably been said by \neverybody who can say it. But I don't think anyone said this yet: I \nwant to thank the people who voted for the final passage of S. Con. \nRes. 11, the fiscal year 2016 Senate budget resolution. We now move on \nto conferencing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee is not on the floor, so let me take this opportunity on \nbehalf of the Democratic members of the Budget Committee to express my \nappreciation to our chairman. We obviously disagree on the substance of \nthis budget, as the votes reflect. Indeed, we think it is an awful \nbudget. But I think I speak for all of us when I say how impressed we \nhave been by the calm and civil and courteous and patient manner in \nwhich the chairman has led us through a very substantively difficult \nissue. I wish to join him on behalf of the Democrats on the Budget \nCommittee in thanking all of the relevant staff--the parliamentary \nstaff, the committee staff, the floor staff--who have supported us \nthrough this process.\n  Our chairman is a very courteous gentleman.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to join Americans of Thai descent \nacross this country and millions of people in Thailand--the United \nStates' oldest ally in Asia--in celebrating on April 2 the 60th \nbirthday anniversary of Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri \nSirindhorn. Fondly called by Thais as ``Princess Angel'', she is known \nfor her life-long dedication to the cause of humanitarianism, education \nand human development, especially for the disadvantaged and \nmarginalized, in Thailand and beyond. I am sure my colleagues in this \nChamber will join me in paying tribute to her remarkable contributions.\n  Following closely in her parents' footsteps, Her Royal Highness has \ntraveled with their Majesties throughout Thailand listening to their \nsubjects' problems and responding with royal development projects. When \nnot engaged in her official duties, she was pursuing her studies, \nattaining a Ph.D. in Development Education and a master's degree in \nHistory.\n  Since 1980, she has launched her own development projects. At first, \nHer Royal Highness focused on assisting disadvantaged and malnourished \nchildren. Aside from providing immediate aid, she also promoted \nintegrated farming as a means to increase overall resilience and \nsustainable sources of nutrition. Public health has been a lifelong \nconcern. The Princess is the President of the Thai Red Cross Society \nand Chairperson of the Prince Mahidol Foundation, which bestows \nglobally recognized awards for achievements in public health and \nmedicine.\n  She soon expanded her charity projects to encompass education, \nworking to increase access for children so as to improve their \nopportunities in life. Her approach and philosophy in this endeavor are \ndeeply rooted in human rights and self-sufficiency. Specifically, Her \nRoyal Highness has said:\n  ``Those at the margins of society have rights to a good standard of \nliving. Access to education is a fundamental human right. Education \nprovides opportunities to learn and live sufficiently. Knowledge can be \nvalued resources to help others or the community.''\n  In fact, Her Royal Highness has supported more than 100 projects \naimed at improving lives, raising the status of women, helping the \ndisabled, and protecting the environment and wildlife. Many of these \nhave won the support\n\n[[Page S2024]]\n\nand funding of agencies such as UNESCO, FAO, WHO and Johns Hopkins \nUniversity.\n  The scholarships she grants to students are helping to nurture and \ncreate new generations of talented Thais dedicated to public service. \nAs someone who is tech savvy and up-to-date on information technology, \nthe Princess promotes Thailand's traditional culture and arts among the \nyounger generation.\n  Through her selfless dedication and hard work for the benefit of \nhumanity, she has earned love and respect from the Thai people and \nthose beyond Thailand, including the United States. Therefore, I wish \nto join them in celebrating this auspicious occasion of Her Royal \nHighness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn's 60th birthday anniversary \nand wishing her happiness, good health and longevity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2024-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING DR. MARGARET HAMBURG\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is with both sadness and appreciation \nthat I recognize Dr. Margaret Hamburg as she leaves her post as \nCommissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. Dr. Hamburg has been \na wonderful colleague and partner during her tenure at FDA. She has a \ncollaborative and effective leadership style that has truly improved \nthe health, safety, and quality of life here in our country. Over the \nnearly 6 years she has spent as Commissioner, Dr. Hamburg has worked \ntirelessly to ensure that Americans remain healthy and safe for years \nto come.\n  Dr. Hamburg has presided over significant milestones, strengthening \nthe agency's commitment to science and advancing biomedical innovation. \nThe personalized medicine initiative prioritized under her leadership \nhas led to more targeted, effective treatments for cancer patients, in \naddition to diagnostic tests that are faster and more accurate--crucial \nfactors in tailoring optimal treatment for each particular patient. Dr. \nHamburg also worked with me and several of my colleagues in launching \nexpedited review of ``breakthrough therapies'' to accelerate help for \npatients with serious or life-threatening illnesses. Thanks to her \nefforts, the United States is more competitive and better positioned to \naccommodate the astounding pace of medical innovation as we move \nforward in the 21st century.\n  In the area of food safety, Dr. Hamburg's leadership helped to build \na more modern food protection system that will prevent foodborne \nillness and improve the safety of the food Americans consume for years \nto come. She has also worked with Congress in creating important steps \nto ensure product safety, implementing new standards that will protect \nthe American people from the dangers of counterfeit, stolen, \ncontaminated, or otherwise harmful drugs.\n  These are just a few highlights from Dr. Hamburg's tenure. Dr. \nHamburg has rendered our country a tremendous service, and I know that \nshe will continue to have success in all of her future endeavors. I \nwish her the best of luck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2024-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2024-S2025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Staff Sergeant Dirk T. Shelton\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a brave young \nKentuckian who served our country in uniform and whose life has been \ntragically cut short. SSgt Dirk T. Shelton, of Corbin, KY, died in \nWashington, DC, from wounds received July 13, 2014 on a training \nmission. The U.S. airman was 29 years old.\n  Staff Sergeant Shelton enlisted in the Air Force in 2005, after \ngraduating from Corbin High School in 2004. He served multiple overseas \ntours, including four to Afghanistan and one each to Somalia and \nKuwait. He was a member of Joint Special Operations Command and was \nstationed at Fort Bragg, NC.\n  Staff Sergeant Shelton was the recipient of many medals, awards, and \ndecorations, including the Bronze Star, the Joint Service Achievement \nMedal, and the Air Force Achievement Medal. He was honored to be a \nBronze Star recipient at such a young age. He had recently completed \ntraining in HALO parachute jumps. HALO stands for high altitude, low \nopening.\n  Staff Sergeant Shelton had wanted to fly as a young child. He loved \nto make people laugh and his coworkers remember that Dirk made work \nfun. He leaves behind his wife, Maria. Together they would have \ncelebrated their fifth wedding anniversary on July 20, 2014.\n  He also leaves behind his parents, Tom and Jenny Shelton; his sister \nand her husband, Morgan and David Taylor; his niece, Reagan; his aunts \nand uncles, Mike and Vicki Moore, John and Penny Hammons, and Joe and \nMissy Shelton; his cousins, Jon Moore, Amy Hammack, Johnny Hammons, \nJulie Hendrickson, Whitney Pratt, Emily, Jamie and Joey Shelton, and \nJake, Brett and Allie Pennington; his parents-in-law, Israel and Nimfa \nOcasio; and his sisters-in-law, Melanie, Marissa, and Mia Ocasio.\n  The local Times-Tribune newspaper published an article detailing SSgt \nDirk T. Shelton's funeral service. I ask unanimous consent that said \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Times-Tribune, July 25, 2014]\n\n       Hundreds Attend Military Funeral Service for Dirk Shelton\n\n                            (By Jeff Noble)\n\n       Whenever America needed him, Staff Sergeant Dirk Thomas \n     Shelton always answered the call.\n       Those calls took him to corners of the world where very few \n     people--even his own family at times--had any idea where he \n     was.\n       After serving honorably to fight for and preserve our \n     nation's freedom and way of life, Dirk returned to Corbin to \n     rest forever.\n       Hundreds of people paid homage to Dirk during a stirring \n     and poignant funeral service Thursday evening at Grace on the \n     Hill United Methodist Church. The full military funeral began \n     around 6:10 p.m., and followed the visitation that went on \n     from 2-6 p.m.\n       A Corbin native, Dirk was a Radio Frequency Transmission \n     Journeyman assigned to the Joint Communications Unit in Fort \n     Bragg, North Carolina. He was also a member of the Joint \n     Special Operations Command, a sub-unified command of the U.S. \n     Special Operations Command.\n       Sgt. Dirk Shelton passed away in Washington, D.C. last \n     Monday, July 14. He was on a training mission in Fairfax, \n     Virginia, and suffered a traumatic brain injury last Sunday, \n     July 13. At the time of his death, he was 29 years old.\n       The military plane carrying his body left Washington, D.C., \n     Wednesday evening and landed at Lexington's Blue Grass \n     Airport later that night. A hearse brought the body south to \n     Corbin where it was taken to Hart Funeral Home, who handled \n     the arrangements.\n       Around 12:35 p.m. Thursday, the hearse left the funeral \n     home as part of a small procession that took Dirk's body to \n     the church for the visitation.\n       A long, steady line of people paying their respects to Dirk \n     lined outside and inside the chapel for much of the \n     afternoon. Inside, an open casket with an American flag \n     draped to the casket's side stood in the middle, just below \n     the stage.\n       Above the casket, on either side were pictures and mementos \n     of Dirk.\n       Looking down from the balcony to the right, a black and \n     white picture of him with his sister, Morgan Shelton Taylor, \n     stood out as a memory of earlier times. To the left was a \n     large picture of Dirk free falling from an airplane during \n     maneuvers--a favorite print of the Shelton family.\n       Overhead, above the choir loft, two large video screens on \n     the left and right displayed pictures and tape of Dirk, his \n     wife Maria, his parents Tom and Jenny, and moments capturing \n     the life of a man who lived it like there was no tomorrow.\n       Two poems and an essay written by Dirk were read at the \n     funeral. And, as people came inside for the service, there \n     was this comment, written on a small program card.\n       ``All my life I have been pushed towards different goals. \n     Not all of these goals were goals I had necessarily set for \n     myself, but they were goals all the same. The reason for this \n     `push' is because people who are for me want me to succeed in \n     life. I would like nothing better than to be a successful \n     person and that brings about my fear. My fear is that I might \n     not be successful in life. . . . The way I see it, the only \n     real way that I could get rid of my fear completely is to \n     actually become successful at something in my life, which \n     leads me to believe that my fear may be around for a long \n     time. If I could change my fear, I wouldn't. It's what gets \n     me by. If it were gone, there would be a void in my life and \n     I would inevitably turn out to be what I fear--\n     unsuccessful.''\n       Dirk Shelton wrote those words in an essay.\n       His friend Johnny B. Hammons read them at the service.\n       ``He was a hero to me, he was a hero to his family, and he \n     was a hero to his community,'' Hammons said.\n       According to his friends and comrades in the military, he \n     went beyond and above success at all times.\n       Lieutenant Colonel Jim Clifford, the commander of Dirk's \n     unit in Fort Bragg, North\n\n[[Page S2025]]\n\n     Carolina, said of him, ``What many of you don't know is that \n     Dirk was a patriot in the truest sense of the word.''\n       He noted Dirk's six deployments--four to Afghanistan, and \n     one each to Somalia and Kuwait--and the numerous awards, such \n     as the Bronze Star.\n       Lt. Colonel Clifford told the audience, ``It takes just \n     plain guts. We wonder where you find such young men. Corbin, \n     Kentucky is that place.''\n       Along with giving thanks to Dirk's parents, the officer \n     singled out Dirk's widow, Maria Shelton--who also serves in \n     the military and is stationed at Fort Bragg.\n       ``Maria, thanks for standing by Dirk during those long \n     trips'' (that he made to serve his country during combat \n     tours and numerous overseas missions).\n       The military was there in a show of strength and support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2025-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RECOGNIZING THE THOMAS MORE COLLEGE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a team of \nnational champions that comes from the great State of Kentucky. On \nMarch 21, 2015, the Thomas More College women's basketball team, the \nSaints, won the first ever team championship in their school's history.\n  The Saints notched an 83-to-63 win over George Fox University in the \nwomen's Division III championship game and capped an undefeated season \nwith a record of 33 to 0. They are only the sixth team in the history \nof Division III women's basketball to go an entire season undefeated. \nAlong the way to their perfect season, they defeated four top 10-ranked \nteams.\n  The final game was hosted by Calvin College in Grand Rapids, MI, and \nplayed in the Van Noord Arena. Thomas More jumped out to an early lead \nand never trailed in the game. Thomas More's leading scorer in the \nchampionship game, Sydney Moss, was also named the NCAA Division III \nnational player of the year by both D3hoops.com and the Women's DIII \nNews. It is the second consecutive year she has earned the award. \nDuring the NCAA postseason, Moss broke the NCAA all-division men's and \nwomen's scoring record with an incredible 197 points in the Saints' six \nNCAA tournament games.\n  Saints head coach Jeff Hans, who guided his team to their first \nundefeated season and their first national championship, was also named \nthe Division III national coach of the year by both D3hoops.com and the \nWomen's DIII News.\n  I want to recognize every member of this championship team that is \nbringing the Women's Division III trophy back to Kentucky. Team members \ninclude Kirsten Paul, Kiley Bartels, Abby Owings, Stephanie Krusling, \nOlivia Huber, Nikki Kiernan, Mikkah Hignite, Sarah Roaden, Kelly \nMcDonald, Sydni Wainscott, Alexa Santamaria, Kaylee Bush, Sydney Moss, \nSam Cady, and Hannah Devine.

The school's \ndirector of athletics is Terry Connor and its president is David \nArmstrong.\n  The Kentucky Enquirer recently published an article about the Saints' \nvictory. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Kentucky Enquirer, March 21, 2015]\n\n        Thomas More Women Win Division III National Championship\n\n                            (By Adam Turer)\n\n       Grand Rapids.--The Division III women's college basketball \n     season began with Mount St. Joseph's Lauren Hill scoring the \n     season's first points in front of a sold crowd at the Cintas \n     Center. It ended with head coach Jeff Hans and the Thomas \n     More Saints hoisting the national championship trophy. With \n     an 83-63 win over George Fox on Saturday night, the Saints \n     earned the first team championship in Thomas More history.\n       In a battle of 32-0 teams-the first Division III women's \n     championship between two undefeated squads-the Saints \n     controlled from the opening tip. One night after starting 0-7 \n     from the field, Thomas More hit its first three shots to open \n     up an early lead. They never trailed.\n       George Fox, the 2009 national champion and 2012 runner-up, \n     made it this far behind its relentless full court press. The \n     Saints had faced very little full court pressure this season, \n     for good reason. With Abby Owings, Sydney Moss, and Sydni \n     Wainscott all able to handle point guard duties, the Saints \n     are nearly impossible to trap. Hans went to a four-guard \n     lineup at times with Olivia Huber coming off the bench. The \n     Saints still had to overcome several uncharacteristic \n     turnovers, but balanced those miscues with a bounty of fast \n     break points.\n       Moss was, as always, the focal point of the opposing \n     defense. It took the nation's leading scorer over 11 minutes \n     to make her first field goal. The two-time national player of \n     the year found other ways to help her team win. She led \n     Thomas More with 19 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists. The \n     biggest beneficiaries of her defense-breaking ball handling \n     were post players Alexa Santamaria and Nikki Kiernan. \n     Santamaria finished with 14 points on 6-6 shooting, while \n     Kiernan added 16 points on 7-11 shooting. Most of their \n     attempts were wide open looks from within two feet thanks to \n     Moss drawing away helpside defenders and dropping no-look \n     dimes.\n       The victory was a culmination for the program which began \n     its ascension as a national contender under current Xavier \n     head coach Brian Neal. The success continued under Hans, but \n     the Saints developed a pattern of underwhelming in the \n     postseason. The addition of key transfers and the infusion of \n     several of northern Kentucky's top high school players \n     elevated this year's team to unforeseen heights. Moss did not \n     transfer home from Florida expecting to win a national \n     championship. She drew inspiration from the program's family \n     atmosphere, and the ability to play in front of her family \n     nearly every night. This win brought renewed appreciation for \n     her loved ones.\n       ``You look up and see your mom and think of all the \n     practices she drove you to, all the shoes she bought you, and \n     all the sacrifices she made,'' Moss said after Friday's \n     semifinal win.\n       Dozens of Saints students, many athletes in other sports, \n     made the trek to Grand Rapids not once, but twice this \n     weekend. They bussed up for Friday's semifinal, back to \n     Crestview Hills, then back up on Saturday. Thomas More fans \n     accounted for roughly 70 percent of the crowd and 90 percent \n     of the crowd noise at Saturday's title game. The team bus \n     will return to Crestview Hills with some new hardware to add \n     to the Connor Convocation Center trophy case.\n       ``The support I cannot say enough about. The pride that \n     they have in their school and excitement to see our programs \n     go to another level,'' said athletic director Terry Connor. \n     ``[There is] a great sense of pride and this is proof that it \n     can be done.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2025-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2025-S2026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RECOGNIZING THE OWENSBORO HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The \nOwensboro Red Devils won a decisive 74-58 game over rival Bowling Green \nthis March 22.\n  It is the fourth State championship for Owensboro High School, and \nthe first since 1980 for the Red Devils. Owensboro came into the \ntournament having shot 55 percent from the field during the first three \nrounds of the tournament. During the championship game, they never \ntrailed.\n  Owensboro is only the seventh school in State history to win the \nchampionship four times. And Owensboro's head coach, Rod Drake, was a \nsenior on the Owensboro 1980 championship team. A crowd of over 11,000 \nsaw Owensboro clinch the win inside of Lexington's legendary Rupp \nArena.\n  I want to recognize every member of this championship team that is \nbringing the KHSAA trophy back to Owensboro.

You do everything \n     together, and when you work as hard as we do, we knew what \n     our goal was. And we're just glad we accomplished it before \n     we left.''\n       Miller, a 6-7, 290-pounder, played through what he called a \n     groin/hamstring injury and finished with 11 points, 10 \n     rebounds and five assists.\n       ``I was about 30 percent, honestly,'' Miller said. ``But I \n     wasn't going to let that stop me from playing my last game \n     with my brothers, so I'm just glad we got it done.''\n       Jacoby Harris, a 5-10 sophomore, added 14 points and five \n     assists as the 3rd Region team won its seventh game in a row.\n       The Red Devils (31-4) beat Bowling Green twice during the \n     regular season--79-71 on Jan. 3 and 69-66 on Feb. 10. But \n     that didn't make them overconfident.\n       ``To be honest, we had a little doubt,'' Holman said. \n     ``Because to beat a team three times in a row is pretty hard. \n     So we just took it as we never played them before. . . . Took \n     it back to square one, and that's how we got here now.''\n       This marked the first finals between Western Kentucky \n     schools since 4th Region Edmonson County beat 2nd Region \n     Christian County in 1976.\n       Fourth Region champion Bowling Green (31-6), in its first \n     State finals and 15th tourney, was led by Terry Taylor with \n     16 points and nine rebounds. Tucker Sine had nine points and \n     seven boards, and Kyran Jones netted eight points and eight \n     caroms.\n       ``Coming into this tournament, we were playing as well as \n     anybody,'' Purples Coach D.G.

We \n     ran into a team that shot a little better, they fought around \n     the rim a little harder, they hit their free throws (20 of \n     23), and it was just a tough game for us. But we got beat by \n     a bunch of good players and a great coaching staff over in \n     Owensboro.''\n       Owensboro jumped to a 4-0 lead to start.\n       Ahead 4-3, the Red Devils went on a 9-0 run, only to see \n     the Purples come back with a 9-0 rally to leave the score 13-\n     12.\n       Owensboro led 16-12 through one quarter and 27-23 at \n     halftime.\n       The Devils opened the third quarter with a 7-1 run to push \n     the lead to 34-24.\n       Then, a 9-0 blitz widened the gap to 43-26.\n       Holman started the action by converting a three-point play \n     for a 37-26 lead.\n       Darion Marrow, who finished with six points, hit a short \n     jumper.\n       Sanford scored on a fast break, and Marrow flipped in a \n     shot from the lane.\n       The lead was 49-33 through three quarters.\n       The closest Bowling Green came from there was 61-49 with \n     3:06 left, when Taylor scored on a put-back.\n       Both teams came into the finals having shot 55 percent from \n     the field during the first three rounds of the tourney.\n       Owensboro nearly matched that Sunday, going 25 of 48 (52.1 \n     percent), but Bowling Green came in 23 of 64 (35.9 percent).\n       ``Defensively, it's all about heart,'' Sanford said. ``And \n     our team has a lot of heart.''\n       ``The basket got a little small for us tonight,'' Sherrill \n     said. ``We picked a bad game to have one of our lower \n     performances in the shooting from the field. But to come in \n     here and play in a state championship time for the first time \n     in Bowling Green history . . . I'm still so proud of them. \n     We're taking home a big old silver ball tonight.

Mr. President, I believe my U.S. Senate colleagues are \nwell aware of how seriously we take our basketball in my home State of \nKentucky. I rise to congratulate the statewide champions in girls' \nbasketball in Kentucky, the Covington Holy Cross Indians, who won the \nKentucky High School Athletic Association, KHSAA, State Basketball \nChampionship this March 15.\n  It was a dramatic ending to a spectacular season for the Indians, who \nfinish with a 33-to-3 record. The score in the final game against the \nAllen County-Scottsville Patriots was tied at 32 with just under 20 \nseconds to play when senior forward Abby Hassert, who had not scored \nall game, drove the lane from the top of the key to score a layup and \nwin the game. It was the Indians' first appearance in the State \ntournament in 39 years, and the game was enjoyed by over 5,000 fans at \nE.A. Diddle Arena in Bowling Green, KY.\n  I want to recognize every member of this championship team that is \nbringing the KHSAA trophy to Covington. Team members include Justice \nArce, Zyah Beal, Olivia Crigler, Kate Dreas, Morgan Gabbard, Abby \nHassert, Ally Mayhaus, Cessie Mayhaus, Dajah McClendon, Candace McNama, \nTara Niehaus, Hannah Niemeyer, Alexis Riep, Aleah Tucker, Courtney \nTurner, and Deja Turner.

Diddle Arena crowd of 5,335 roared.\n       After multiple timeouts, Allen County-Scottsville had a \n     last shot to tie. But Morgan Rich's long three-point try from \n     near her team bench hit off the backboard and rim.\n       ``We got exactly what we wanted,'' Patriots Coach Brad \n     Bonds said. ``We got Morgan in the right spot for the shot. \n     We threw it up to Savannah (Gregory), who threw it to Morgan. \n     It was perfect. It was executed great. We got the shot we \n     wanted.''\n       Holy Cross (33-3), out of the 9th Region, ended the season \n     on a 22-game winning streak.\n       The Indians, with a school enrollment of 406, also won the \n     All ``A'' title back on Feb. 1.

She and \n     Holly Robinson grabbed seven rebounds each.\n       Holy Cross Coach Kes Murphy, whose sister Donna was \n     Kentucky's first Miss Basketball in 1976, credited the \n     championship to a killer schedule that had his team well \n     prepared for Sunday.\n       The game was tied 18-18 at halftime, with ACS holding a 12-\n     3 advantage in rebounds. Robinson has six of those.\n       But Holy Cross had a 9-0 edge in points off turnovers.\n       The Indians led 27-24 through three quarters.\n       In a game that saw seven ties and six lead changes, the \n     Patriots took their final lead, 32-31, when Rich hit two of \n     three free throws with 2:29 left.\n       A Mayhaus free throw at 1:09 tied the score.\n       With the Patriots patiently looking for a game-winning \n     shot, Holy Cross point guard Dajah McClendon picked Rich's \n     pocket with 32 seconds left.\n       ``I just knew I had to get up and get one for my team,'' \n     McClendon said. ``We needed that.''\n       Holy Cross took a timeout at 19.6, which led to Hassert's \n     game-winning play.\n       ``She'd better make it,'' Murphy said he thought at the \n     time of the drive. ``And you know what, she's not an \n     offensive player. For what we need. But we know she can play, \n     we know she can make passes and for her to finish and give us \n     this, it means everything.''\n\n[[Page S2027]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2027-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   RECOGNIZING AID FOR AIDS OF NEVADA AND THEIR 25TH ANNUAL AIDS WALK\n\n  Mr. REID.

They have hired a team of \nenthusiastic and dedicated staff whose effective teaching is evidenced \nby the high test scores of the students. In the last school year, Jo \nMackey Magnet School had a higher percentage of students meet or exceed \nNevada's standards in reading, mathematics, and science when compared \nto the county and State percentages. They also exceeded State and \ncounty rates in attendance and reported zero incidents of bullying or \nsuspensions. Additionally, the Jo Mackey Academy of Leadership and \nGlobal Communication was recently recognized by the Magnet Schools of \nAmerica Merit Awards Program as a Magnet School of Excellence.\n  Since its founding, Jo Mackey Magnet School has prepared Clark \nCounty's children to embark in a world of diversity. Students of many \ndifferent ethnic and racial origins work together on projects both \ninside and outside of the classroom.

Mr. President, we have a number of challenging foreign \npolicy issues at the moment--from Russian aggression in Ukraine to ISIL \nand the Syrian civil war to stemming climate change.\n  Yet amid these larger demands, it is important to remember there are \nmany smaller struggles going on all over the world that are also \nimportant--struggles for basic political freedoms which can still \nresult in jailings or worse.\n  Today I would like to mention a number of such brave individuals who \nare being detained for exercising or advocating for such democratic \nvalues.\n  First, I am deeply troubled by the recent crackdown on human rights \nactivists in Azerbaijan--part of a disturbing pattern in that country \nthat has significantly deteriorated during the last year.\n  The New York Times summed it up nicely in its recent editorial by \ndescribing Azeri President Aliyev as a modern-day ``Jekyll and Hyde'' \nwho is able to convince the world that he plays nice with the West \nwhile creating one of the worst human rights records at the same time.\n  Aliyev wants the world to believe that Azerbaijan is a model country \nthat promotes moderate Islam, has strong relations with the West, and \nis an ideal host for the upcoming European games, yet it currently \nholds more political prisoners than Russia and Belarus combined--not a \ngreat distinction to be sure.\n  At the end of 2014, Aliyev's henchmen brazenly raided Radio Free \nEurope/Radio Liberty offices in Baku, just weeks after the government \narrested one of the country's best known investigative reporters, \nKhadija Ismayilova. After more than 2 months of detention, she was \ncharged with embezzlement, illegal entrepreneurship, tax evasion and \nabuse of power--similar charges to those of other human rights \nactivists.\n  Last August, Senators Cardin, Murphy, and I sent a letter to \nPresident Aliyev expressing our concern over the imprisonment of Anar \nMammadli and Bashir Suleymanli, the chair and the executive director of \nthe Election Monitoring and Democracy Studies Center, an organization \nthat promotes free and fair elections in Azerbaijan.\n  Recently, Bashir was finally released but his colleague Anar remains \nbehind bars.\n  Just prior, police arrested Leyla Yunus, the director of the \nInstitute for Peace and Democracy. The very next week, the police \nfollowed up by arresting her husband, Arif Yunus; fellow activist, \nRasul Jafarov, a human rights defender and chairman of the Human Rights \nClub; and Intigam Aliyev, the country's most prominent human rights \nlawyer and the 2012 winner of the prestigious Homo Homini Award for his \nwork defending the rule of law in Azerbaijan.\n\n[[Page S2028]]\n\n  Last month, the Washington Post ran a powerful letter on its opinion \npage written recently by Khadija where she states that the reason she \nis in prison is because of the regime's corruption and vows to continue \nto expose that corruption. Less than a week later the Azeri government \nsuddenly called for a closed-door trial and found her guilty of \ncriminal libel.\n  To quote her piece in the Post:\n\n       The fight between good and evil goes on, and the most \n     important thing is that this fight should not end. If we can \n     continue to reject the thinking that is imposed on us and \n     believe that human dignity is not for sale, then we are the \n     winners, and they, our jailers both inside and outside \n     prison, are the losers.\n\n  Sadly, this is just a snapshot of the many brave Azeris or \norganizations facing trumped-up charges or imprisonment for simply \nexercising basic political freedoms.\n  To them, I say, the world is aware of your plight and courage. And to \nPresident Aliyev, I urge you to release your own people whose only \noffense has been to ask for a peaceful democratic Azerbaijan. You \ncannot be a part of the Western community of democracies while \nviolating its core democratic principles.\n  Second, Mr. President, is Saudi Arabia--a country that is an \nimportant ally to the United States on many issues and yet could not be \nmore different when it comes to basic freedoms.\n  I have spoken about human rights concerns in Saudi Arabia on the \nfloor before--the troubling lack of freedoms for women and the use of \nobsolete blasphemy and apostasy laws to stifle freedom of religion and \nexpression.\n  In 2012, the Saudi Government imprisoned a young blogger named Hamza \nKashgari for tweets considered blasphemous.\n  Fortunately, after nearly 2 years, I was pleased to hear of his \nrelease.\n  Writer and activist Raif Badawi, however, has not been so fortunate.\n  Also imprisoned in 2012, Raif Badawi was sentenced to 10 years in \nprison and 1,000 lashes for apparently launching a Web site that \nsuggested a peaceful discussion about religion.\n  He received his first set of 50 lashes in public on January 9, and \nspent his 31st birthday in jail, severely wounded.\n  His wife, Ensaf Haidar, who fled to Canada with their three children \nafter she began receiving anonymous death threats because of her \nhusband's case, fears her husband may not be able to physically \nwithstand another round of lashings.\n  I was relieved to hear that after international outrage about this \ntreatment as well as serious concern about his health, Raif's next \nrounds of floggings have been repeatedly postponed. His case was \nreferred to the Supreme Court in Riyadh only to be returned back to the \nCourt of Appeals in Jeddah, where reports indicate he may be retried \nand even worse, could face the death penalty.\n  Raif's lawyer, Waleed Abu al-Khair, a prominent human rights activist \nin his own right and head of the Monitor of Human Rights in Saudi \nArabia, was himself arrested and sentenced to 15 years in prison \nfollowed by a ban on travel for 15 years.\n  Also concerning is that his case was taken up by the Specialized \nCriminal Court in Jeddah, which was created in 2008 to deal with \nterrorist suspects but has also taken to trying human rights activists \non dubious charges.\n  I sent a letter to Saudi Arabia in January along with several \ncolleagues--Senators Leahy, Shaheen, Rubio, Feinstein, Wyden, Kirk, and \nBoxer--urging the release of both Raif and Waleed.\n  My staff has also met with Samar Badawi--she is Waleed's wife and \nRaif's sister, and she is an activist in her own right--it is a whole \nfamily of activists. For years she has been a strong advocate for \nwomen's rights in Saudi Arabia and has served her own time in jail for \nit.\n  In fact, in 2012, she was one of the recipients of the International \nWomen of Courage Award from the State Department.\n  Samar and others have raised the profile of countless women who have \nstood up for their rights in a country where zealous interpretations of \nreligion and traditional customs guide Saudi laws, like the one \nrequiring all women to have a male guardian.\n  The guardianship law automatically restricts Saudi women from \ndriving, as many of you know, but also from making their own choices \nregarding marriage and divorce, employment, travel, banking, and \ncountless other basic life decisions.\n  Raif, Waleed, and Samar are only a few of the many independent \nactivists and peaceful dissidents in Saudi Arabia who have faced \npersecution.\n  Now, like many of you, I was saddened to hear of the passing of King \nAbdullah bin Abdul Aziz on January 23. Many have described him as a man \nof vision, peace, and reform.\n  As his brother, Salman, takes the seat as the new King of Saudi \nArabia, I hope he will take every opportunity to free Raif, Waleed, and \nothers jailed on account of their beliefs, to allow greater room for \npolitical debate and freedoms, and renounce any further prosecutions \nunder charges of apostasy or blasphemy.\n  Last, Mr. President, I would like to turn the attention toward \nEthiopia, a country I last visited in 2010, when I had the opportunity \nto meet with then-Prime Minister Meles.\n  Meles' government made many advances and Ethiopia was and remains an \nally and leader a difficult region. It has also received millions over \nthe years in development assistance from the United States.\n  And yet, Ethiopia continues to be a country with a troubling human \nrights record, particularly regarding freedom of the press.\n  Many had hoped that new Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam would \nbring a change to his late predecessor's human rights policies.\n  Unfortunately, last July the Ethiopian Government charged six \nbloggers and three journalists--known collectively as the Zone 9 \nBloggers--under a broadly used terrorism law, despite any credible \nevidence be offered.\n  Sadly, these bloggers seem to have been arrested to narrow the \nalready small space for free media expression in Ethiopia.\n  Some of you may have heard of Eskinder Nega, a prominent independent \njournalist who was critical of the Ethiopian Government and was \ndetained on eight different occasions before being convicted in 2012 on \nterrorism charges and sentenced to 18 years in prison.\n  Others may know of Reeyot Alemu, a schoolteacher and columnist with \none of Ethiopia's last remaining independent papers was also convicted \nin 2012 on counts of terrorism and sentenced to 5 years in prison. \nReeyot has breast cancer and is in desperate need of urgent and proper \nmedical care beyond what prison can provide.\n  Both Eskinder and Reeyot have won prestigious international awards \nfor their work while serving prison terms. Both represent the plight of \ntheir countless colleagues in the industry who have suffered threats, \nintimidation, politically motivated prosecutions, and even physical \nabuse.\n  I sent a letter with Senators Boxer and Menendez to the Ethiopian \nGovernment about the Zone 9 Bloggers last summer and I know Secretary \nKerry has also raised their cases. I am troubled to hear that a fair \nand transparent trial for them only continues to be delayed.\n  In fact, their case was adjourned 20 times before the group finally \nhad the opportunity to plead not guilty in court last month, only to be \nadjourned again for March 30, just shortly before the Ethiopian general \nelections in May.\n  Prime Minister Hailemariam, you have an opportunity to turn the page \non your country's human rights record by reversing a troubling pattern \nof press harassment.\n  These are just a few of the many political prisoners around the globe \nthat struggle, often at great risk, for a better future for their \nfellow countrymen and women and for their children. I want them and \ntheir families--and the governments unjustly holding them--to know that \nthey are not forgotten.\n  I will continue to draw attention to their plight and work for their \nrelease, along with my colleagues here in Congress and their countless \nadvocates around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2028-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2028-S2029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LYNCH NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one great responsibility that distinguishes \nthe U.S. Senate is our constitutional role\n\n[[Page S2029]]\n\nof advice and consent. We have a solemn duty to consider nominees for \npositions of great importance to the Nation, some of which are lifetime \nappointments. Every day that the nomination of Loretta Lynch to be the \nnext Attorney General awaits a floor vote is another day the Senate \nfails to function as it should.\n  The Attorney General is our Nation's top law enforcement official. \nThe position is critical to protecting our national security and our \nmost cherished civil rights. It is a position of honor and one that \ndeserves respect. And even though Senators have not always agreed with \nthe President's choice, there used to be a mutual respect for the \nposition and the process of filling it. That proud history is being \ndebased here in the Senate today. The Republican majority has turned \nthis vital position--and the highly respected nominee--into a \nbargaining chip to be leveraged for political gain. This is not how to \ntreat a position of such importance to law enforcement and our national \nsecurity.\n  When I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I did not support the \nnomination of Michael Mukasey, the choice of President George W. Bush. \nBut I did not obstruct the process or deny the Senate a vote. To the \ncontrary, we treated the position and the nominee with the historic \nrespect they both deserve. Judge Mukasey received a floor vote just 2 \ndays after he was reported from committee and he was confirmed just 53 \ndays after his nomination was announced. That process stands in sharp \ncontrast to that of Ms. Lynch. It has now been 28 days since she was \nreported out of committee and 137 days since her nomination was first \nannounced.\n  The treatment of this excellent nominee is beneath the dignity of \nthis body. In January, Ms. Lynch testified before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee for nearly 8 hours and she responded to nearly 900 written \nquestions. Not a single witness invited by Republicans opposed her \nnomination. When Republicans stalled consideration of Ms. Lynch's \nnomination in committee, Democrats noted the unnecessary delay and \nraised concerns about filling this vital position. Senator Cornyn \ndismissed this as ``faux outrage.'' But in November 2007, Senator \nCornyn complained that a 7-week process on the Mukasey nomination \nthreatened our national security. He issued a press release stating:\n\n       It is imperative that the president has his national \n     security team at full strength and the unnecessary delay of \n     Judge Mukasey's nomination has prevented that. He deserves an \n     immediate up-or-down vote by the full Senate.\n\n  Loretta Lynch's nomination has now been pending more than 19 weeks. \nWhere is the outrage now? Where is the concern for the President's \nnational security team to be at full strength?\n  Similarly, in early October 2007--just 3 weeks after Mr. Mukasey's \nnomination was announced, the Republican leader criticized me for not \nyet having set a hearing date, saying that Democrats should ``not hold \nJudge Mukasey hostage while they play partisan games.'' That was after \n3 weeks. We are now on week 19 for Ms. Lynch--that is more than six \ntimes as long and Senator McConnell has openly linked her confirmation \nto partisan politics by linking her vote to demands on legislation.\n  Senate Republicans' handling of the nomination process for the \nNation's top law enforcement officer has been disgraceful. And all of \nthis after Senate Democrats agreed not to process her nomination during \nthe lameduck because the current majority leader reassured us that she \nwould be treated fairly. Unfortunately, that has not been the case. No \none can deny that Ms. Lynch is eminently qualified for the job. No one \ncan deny that her nomination is a historic one. No one can deny that \nher record safeguarding our Nation from terrorists and criminals is \nbeyond reproach. And no one can deny--based on the objective numbers--\nthat she is being treated worse than her predecessors. Ms. Lynch has \nbeen treated unfairly compared to previous Attorneys General nominees \nby whatever metric one chooses.\n  Republicans are holding back a top Federal prosecutor who has an \nunparalleled record keeping Americans safe from terrorists. During her \ntenure as U.S. attorney, the Eastern District of New York has \nprosecuted significant terrorism cases. This includes the successful \nprosecution of six individuals for their roles in a 2009 Al Qaeda plot \nto attack the New York subway system; the convictions of four \nterrorists plotting to attack John F. Kennedy Airport; and the \nconviction of a terrorist who attempted to detonate an explosive device \nat the New York Federal Reserve.\n  Rudy Giuliani, the former Republican Mayor of New York and a proud \nlaw-and-order conservative, urged the Senate last week to end the delay \nand to confirm Ms. Lynch. He said:\n\n       This woman is entitled to confirmation: not as a woman, not \n     as a man, but as a highly qualified candidate . . . Loretta \n     Lynch is more than qualified. She's overqualified to be \n     attorney general.\n\n  My friend Louis Freeh, former Director of the FBI and Federal judge, \nhas written that ``[i]n my twenty-five years of public service--23 in \nthe Department of Justice--I cannot think of a more qualified nominee \nto be America's chief law enforcement officer.'' He has further stated \nthat ``Ms. Lynch is an atypically non-political appointment for that \noffice, a career professional without any political party ties or \nactivity.''\n  If we do not confirm Ms. Lynch before the upcoming recess, her \nnomination will be pending before the full Senate for 46 days by the \ntime we return on April 13. That is nearly twice as long as all of the \npast seven Attorneys General combined: Richard Thornburgh, 1 day; \nWilliam Barr, 5 days; Janet Reno, 1 day; John Ashcroft, 2 days, Alberto \nGonzales, 8 days; Michael Mukasey, 2 days; and Eric Holder, 5 days. \nThis delay is an embarrassment for the U.S. Senate.\n  I am concerned that the Senate will have to file a cloture motion and \nvote to overcome a filibuster of Ms. Lynch's nomination. This would be \nunprecedented and unwarranted. No Attorney General nomination in our \nhistory has ever been met with a filibuster. We have never needed a \ncloture vote for an Attorney General nomination. It appears that Senate \nRepublicans want to make history for all the wrong reasons. It is time \nto stop playing politics and lead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2029-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2029-S2030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         JUDICIAL CONFIRMATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are now three months into the new \nCongress with Republicans in the majority. The Republican reign thus \nfar has been defined by an attempt to shut down the Department of \nHomeland Security; a refusal to even allow a floor vote on an eminently \nqualified nominee for Attorney General; and the decision to inject a \npartisan abortion fight in what is otherwise an uncontroversial bill to \nbuild on our efforts to combat human trafficking. On top of all of \nthis, the Senate Republican Leadership has been unwilling to bring up \nfor a vote any of the judicial nominees pending on the Executive \nCalendar. Not one.\n  The refusal by the Senate Republican leadership to schedule votes on \nany Federal judges is completely contrary to historical precedent. This \nis also in stark contrast to the way Democrats treated President Bush's \njudicial nominees. During the Bush administration we were able to \nreduce overall judicial vacancies from 110 down to 28. In the 17 months \nI chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee during President Bush's first \n2 years in office, the Senate confirmed 100 Federal circuit and \ndistrict court judges. I also served as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee during the last 2 years of the Bush administration and \ncontinued to hold regular hearings on judges and we confirmed 68 \ndistrict and circuit court judges in those last 2 years.\n  The Senate must continue to fulfill its constitutional obligation of \nadvice and consent. The fact that we are in the last 2 years of this \npresidency does not mean our work is done. In the last 2 years of the \nClinton administration, 73 judges were confirmed, and in the last 2 \nyears of the Reagan administration, 83 judges were confirmed. I have \nheard Senate Republicans state that 11 of the judges confirmed in the \nlame duck last year should count towards confirmations this year. That \nis a bizarre claim. Prior Congresses have always confirmed consensus \nnominees prior to long recesses. And Senate Democrats were only forced \nto do so because Republican obstruction had\n\n[[Page S2030]]\n\nleft judicial vacancies close to or exceeding 90 through the first 6 \nyears of this President's tenure.\n  In comparison to the current treatment of judicial nominees, by the \nend of March 2007, the new Senate Democratic majority had scheduled \nvotes on and confirmed 15 of President Bush's district and circuit \ncourt nominees. The refusal to schedule a vote on a single judicial \nnominee this year comes despite the fact that four of these nominees \nhave languished on the Senate floor for a month and were recommended to \nPresident Obama by their two Republican home State Senators. Three of \nthese pending nominees will fill district court vacancies in Texas, two \nof which have been designated by the non-partisan Administrative Office \nof the U.S. Courts as ``judicial emergency'' vacancies. I would urge \nthe current Assistant Republican Leader, who represents Texas, to work \nto schedule votes to fill those vacancies. I would also urge the junior \nSenator from Texas, who has now announced his intent to run for \nPresident, to urge his Leadership to schedule a vote to fill those \nvacancies.\n  We started this Congress with 44 judicial vacancies, including 12 \nvacancies deemed judicial emergencies. Today, there are 55 vacancies, \nincluding 23 judicial emergency vacancies. Let us not go back to the \nfirst 6 years of this presidency when vacancies consistently hovered \naround 90. The Democratic majority worked hard to reduce those \nvacancies so that our justice system could function effectively. The \nRepublican majority needs to put partisanship aside and schedule votes \non these consensus judicial nominees.\n  Filling the current vacancies is necessary but not sufficient. Last \nweek the Judicial Conference of the United States, led by Chief Justice \nJohn Roberts, identified the need for adding 5 permanent judgeships to \nthe courts of appeals, and 68 permanent judgeships to the district \ncourts, as well as converting 9 temporary district court judgeships to \npermanent status. This Senate should be working to provide the Federal \nJudiciary with the resources it needs, including the addition of more \njudgeships.\n  I urge the Republican leadership of this body to schedule votes on \nthe current pending nominations before we break for the 2-week recess. \nLet us show respect to the independent Federal judiciary of this \ncountry and let's get these nominees to work for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2030-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2030-S2031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DIPLOMACY, DEVELOPMENT, AND NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Appropriations Subcommittee on the \nDepartment of State and Foreign Operations has a long history of \nbipartisanship. Over the years, I have served as either chairman or \nranking member, and I am pleased that cooperation between Republicans \nand Democrats is as strong today as it has ever been.\n  I want to commend Senator Graham, the chairman of the subcommittee, \nwho has been a passionate defender of the budget for international \naffairs as a key component of our national security strategy. He \nunderstands that the use of military power is often an insufficient--\nindeed inappropriate--way to solve problems or protect our security. \nThere are times when the use of military force is necessary, but \ndiplomacy and development can be a cost-effective investment to avoid \nthe far more costly and dangerous deployment of U.S. troops.\n  Earlier today, the subcommittee heard testimony from five outstanding \nprivate sector witnesses on this very subject--Bill Gates, co-founder \nof the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Ben Affleck, co-founder of \nthe Eastern Congo Initiative; ADM James Stavridis, former Supreme \nAllied Commander, Europe, former Commander of U.S. Southern Command, \nand current dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts \nUniversity; Scott Ford, founder of Westrock Coffee Company and the \nRwanda Trading Company; and John Megrue, chairman of Apax Partners \nU.S., chairman of Born Free, chairman of the Business Leadership \nCouncil for a Generation Born HIV Free, and a director of Millennium \nPromise and of Grameen America.\n  Each of these witnesses made a compelling case for increased funding \nfor the international affairs budget. They gave inspiring examples of \nhow partnerships between the U.S. Agency for International Development \nand civil society organizations in poor countries have brought dramatic \nimprovements to the lives of local people, and more open and stable \nsocieties.\n  In a world that is perhaps more dangerous and unpredictable as any \ntime since World War II, we have a chance to help promote economic \ngrowth and political stability, and in doing so build sustainable \nforeign partners. It is therefore ironic that today we were presented \nwith an amendment, offered by the junior Senator from Kentucky, to \nslash the international affairs budget by nearly 50 percent for the \npurpose of bolstering defense spending, even though the Pentagon is \namong the strongest supporters of diplomacy and development. \nFortunately that amendment was resoundingly defeated by a vote of 96 to \n4.\n  At just 1 percent of total Federal spending, this account cannot and \nshould not serve as a bill payer for other priorities. Nor will \nreducing foreign assistance benefit our military. In fact, the opposite \nis true, and I commend Senator Graham for calling today's hearing in \norder to explain why.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an October 21, 2014 op-ed by retired \nGen. Anthony Zinni and retired ADM James Stavridis, entitled Fighting \nExtremism Requires Foreign Aid, Too be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            [Oct. 21, 2014]\n\n              Fighting Extremism Requires Foreign Aid, Too\n\n            (By Gen. Anthony Zinni and Adm. James Stavridis)\n\n       The American people are justifiably alarmed at the rise of \n     ISIS and their unspeakable atrocities that are further \n     destabilizing parts of the Middle East. The threats to our \n     allies in the region like Israel and Jordan are real, as is \n     the potential for terrors attacks here on American soil.\n       But the hard truth is that these terror threats staring us \n     square in the eye cannot be resolved by military power \n     alone--nor can it end the cycle of other security-related \n     challenges occurring in Ukraine, the South China Sea and in \n     parts of Central America, just to name a few.\n       The important lessons we learned in our military careers is \n     that countering the threats to our nation require \n     comprehensive responses that utilize all our elements of \n     national power--military and non-military. An indispensable \n     part of the non-military toolkit is foreign aid--one of the \n     least appreciated and yet vital means for advancing America's \n     interests around the world.\n       Today's battles require melding our military power with \n     civilian efforts to provide humanitarian assistance and \n     support the creation of well-functioning governance systems \n     and civil society, build infrastructure, coalesce diverse \n     nations around common goals, and promote economic \n     development. In short, everything that is necessary to \n     improve the long-term prospects of a nation and keep \n     extremists from exploiting misery and desperation.\n       These lessons were made clear after World War II. Through \n     the Marshall Plan and the creation of Bretton Woods \n     institutions, the United States helped to rebuild the \n     economies of our former enemies on the battlefield, Germany \n     and Japan, who are now strong and valuable contributors to \n     the global economy and security. The same holds true for \n     South Korea. None of this came cheap or easy, but we've \n     reaped the rewards through decades of peace and stability in \n     these regions. More recently, American-led initiatives in \n     Colombia and the Balkans have made significant progress in \n     bringing stability and economic growth after years of \n     conflict.\n       The recent status of forces agreement between the United \n     States and Afghanistan is a good first step toward creating \n     stability and prosperity in Afghanistan, which is in our \n     vital national interest. Our efforts will be led by the State \n     Department in diplomacy and USAID and other civilian agencies \n     in helping to strengthen governance, rebuild the economy and \n     educational systems, and move farmers away from growing \n     poppies. These are roles our diplomatic services and \n     development agencies, with the support of our military, are \n     best equipped to play.\n       For all these reasons, our nation, at long last, needs to \n     reject misguided narratives that question the value of \n     foreign aid. The opinion polls consistently showing the \n     American people favor cutting and even eliminating foreign \n     aid are deeply troubling--and are often based on wildly \n     inflated estimates of what we spend in the first place: one \n     percent of the federal budget.\n       Make no mistake, the money spent on these programs can save \n     countless dollars and lives by averting more costly military \n     involvement and humanitarian crises. That's why we see these \n     programs as the difference between preventative care and \n     trauma care. As former Defense Secretary Robert Gates \n     memorably said, ``Development is a lot cheaper than sending \n     soldiers.''\n       The world has changed dramatically since the Cold War when \n     we began our military\n\n[[Page S2031]]\n\n     service, and so have the threats confronting our nation. \n     That's why we must employ all the means of American influence \n     and power, including strong and effective foreign aid.

Mr. President, as negotiations continue in Havana between \nthe Colombian Government and the FARC rebels, I want to speak briefly \nabout some recent information that is reason to be both encouraged and \ncautious about the future.\n  Over the course of the 50-year armed conflict, antipersonnel \nlandmines and other unexploded ordnance have maimed and killed \nthousands of Colombians, mostly innocent civilians living in rural \nareas. To its great credit, the Colombian Government signed the \ninternational treaty banning antipersonnel mines years ago, but the \nFARC continued to use them.\n  Then, a little over 2 weeks ago, on March 7, the Colombian Government \nand the FARC reached an agreement for the removal and destruction of \nthese indiscriminate weapons. The two sides have agreed to request the \norganization Norwegian People's Aid to lead and coordinate the \nimplementation of this effort, which will prioritize areas where the \npopulation faces the greatest risk. The agreement provides for surveys, \nverification, and other mechanisms to ensure its effective \nimplementation. This is long overdue, and I commend both sides for \ntaking this step. It will not only save lives; it will help to build \nconfidence for the implementation of a comprehensive peace agreement if \none is reached.\n  While officials of both Colombia and the United States like to \nportray Plan Colombia, the 5-year initiative that has stretched on for \n15 years and cost more than $9 billion in U.S. aid as an unparalleled \nsuccess, the reality is mixed.\n  On the one hand, there have been significant achievements. Many \nColombians are safer today than a decade ago, the army and police are \nmore professional, and the economy has improved significantly. The \nnegotiations to achieve a comprehensive peace agreement between the \ngovernment and the FARC, for which President Santos deserves our strong \nsupport, are making progress, although difficult issues, particularly \nrelating to justice and accountability, remain.\n  A separate but related issue that needs to be addressed is the \nMinistry of Defense's proposed military justice reforms. I am among \nthose, including the Department of State, who have expressed concern \nthat these legislative and constitutional proposals could be \ninterpreted to permit the transfer of certain human rights crimes, \nincluding false positives, to the military courts which lack the \ncredibility or capacity to impartially investigate and adjudicate them. \nThe Colombian Government needs to resolve this matter as soon as \npossible in a manner that eliminates any ambiguity about the authority \nof the civilian courts over such cases.\n  Despite Plan Colombia's achievements, much of the past decade and a \nhalf was plagued by massacres, kidnappings, land seizures, and other \ncrimes by paramilitaries, the Colombian army, and the FARC and ELN \nrebels, for which a very small fraction of the individuals responsible \nhave been brought to justice. Corruption was rampant during the \nadministration of President Uribe, and life today for millions of \nColombians remains one of poverty, violence, and displacement. Human \nrights defenders, social activists, and trade unionists continue to be \nthreatened and assaulted or killed with alarming frequency.\n  According to a recent report of the International Red Cross, \nviolations of international humanitarian law in Colombia increased by \n41 percent in 2014. There were 814 alleged breaches of international \nhumanitarian law, an increase of 258 from 2013.\n  During the past year, Human Rights Watch released reports documenting \nnumerous new cases of disappearances, killings, sexual violence, and \nother atrocities by the FARC and successor groups to paramilitaries in \nthe mostly Afro-Colombian areas of Tumaco and Buenaventura. In these \ntwo municipalities on the Pacific coast, more than 28,000 residents \nwere reportedly forced to abandon their homes due to violence in 2014 \nalone, according to government data.\n  These findings illustrate that despite progress in the peace talks \nthey have yet to bring tangible improvements in the lives of many \nColombians who continue to suffer horrific abuses with impunity. The \nlandmine agreement has the potential to help change that. And, of \ncourse, a peace agreement that results in the disarmament of the FARC \nand their renunciation of drug trafficking would be a historic \nachievement of immense benefit to the Colombian people. But while it \nwould signify an end to the armed conflict it would only be the \nstarting point for rebuilding the country, especially rural communities \nthat suffered the worst of the violence and displacement. That is a \nprocess which will take years.\n  It is widely understood that any peace agreement between two warring \nparties, neither of which can win on the battlefield, requires \ncompromise. At the same time, lasting peace will require access to \njustice, particularly for victims of the worst crimes. Impunity is at \nthe root of the Colombian conflict: few criminal investigations result \nin convictions, and human rights or other political crimes of violence \nand corruption are rarely prosecuted.\n  If a peace agreement is reached I believe the United States should \nstrongly support it--with an emphasis on strengthening Colombia's weak \njudicial institutions, including holding accountable those responsible \nfor war crimes. No democracy can survive without transparent, \ncompetent, independent judicial institutions that protect the rule of \nlaw and deliver justice when basic rights are violated. If Colombia has \nthe trained investigators, prosecutors, judges and most importantly, \nthe political will to end impunity, the country will finally be able to \nleave the worst of its past behind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2031-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               WILDFIRES\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to briefly mention the topic \nof wildfires. This year, Arizona and the West face an active wildfire \nseason. Already 20 percent of Arizona's pine forests have been consumed \nby wildfires over the past decade. The fire situation is made worse by \nthe ongoing drought and the unhealthy state of our overgrown forests. \nThat is why I want to commend the chairman for reporting a budget \nresolution that calls on Congress to address funding shortfalls in the \nForest Service's suppression budget but also promotes wildfire \nprevention using industry-led forest thinning and forest stewardship \ncontracts.\n  Senator Flake, Senator Barrasso, myself, and many others have made \nthe case for years that the best way to control ballooning wildfire \ncosts is to thin our forests so that fires become less severe and less \ncostly to fight. The budget resolution's existing provision on \nwildfires is largely based on a bill that we recently reintroduced in \nCongress, the FLAME Act Amendments of 2015, which the Budget chairman \nsupported. I am pleased that our goals are reflected in this resolution \nunder section 319.\n  I also want to commend my colleague, Senator Wyden, who offered an \namendment, S.A. 434, that focuses purely on suppression funding, which \nI agree should be paired with the wildfire language in the budget \nresolution. Senator Wyden and I have talked about merging some elements \nof our two proposal in order to cover both suppression and prevention. \nOur mutual goals were advanced today when Senator Wyden modified his \namendment to state that Congress may incorporate additional criteria in \nany proposal that enables limited wildfire adjustments for the Disaster \nRelief Fund.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2031-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2031-S2033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SUNSHINE WEEK AND GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last week marked the 10th anniversary of\n\n[[Page S2032]]\n\nSunshine Week, an initiative that has become a nationwide effort to \npromote openness and transparency in government. As Justice Brandeis \nwrote in 1913, ``sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.'' \nThat is what Sunshine Week is all about--shining a bright light to \nprovide accountability and ensuring the public's right to know what its \ngovernment is doing.\n  James Madison wrote in the Federalist No. 51, that ``if men were \nangels, no government would be necessary.'' This passage has been \nquoted and used time and again for different purposes--sometimes \ncorrectly, other times incorrectly. Nevertheless, it is important to \nkeep in mind its context. Of course men aren't angels. Rather, we are \nall ambitious, and ``ambition must be made to counteract ambition.'' \nThus, Madison described the Framers' challenge of forming a government \nadministered by man as how to ``enable the government to control the \ngoverned; and . . . oblige it to control itself.''\n  Madison went on to explain the need for the government structure we \nall know and live under now with proper checks and balances. Because of \nthis structure, which is the best in the world, we celebrate Sunshine \nWeek and continue to ensure the public can hold its government \naccountable.\n  There is perhaps no better tool that Americans have to help ensure \nthat open government and transparency prevail than the Freedom of \nInformation Act. Enacted almost five decades ago, FOIA gives the public \nthe right to government information, opening wide the curtains on the \npublic's business and helping to ensure that government officials \nremain accountable.\n  Unfortunately, as Madison explained so long ago, when ambition seeks \nto counteract ambition there are challenges to allowing sunlight to \ndisinfect the ``culture of obfuscation'' that permeates certain corners \nof the Federal Government. When this happens, FOIA's effectiveness is \nundermined, and the public becomes even more skeptical of government. \nThis sort of government behavior and secrecy knows no partisan \nboundaries. Both Democrat and Republican administrations have failed to \nprovide the level of transparency that Federal laws require and which \nthe American public so rightly deserves. But efforts to change the \ngovernment's attitude toward openness and transparency should know no \nsuch partisan boundaries either.\n  Currently, there is bipartisan work underway in both the Senate and \nHouse to strengthen the Freedom of Information Act. These reforms are \naimed at improving citizens' ability to access government information. \nThe Senate Judiciary Committee has passed the FOIA Improvement Act of \n2015, a bill I have cosponsored, and I am hopeful it will pass the \nSenate very soon. The FOIA Improvement Act would codify a ``presumption \nof openness'' standard, which will help to ensure that agencies \nproactively disclose more information to the public. The bill also \nmakes it easier for the public to request documents from the \ngovernment, while bringing about meaningful improvements to the FOIA \nprocess.\n  Improvements in technology--and even improvements to our laws--will \nonly go so far, however. Those who are entrusted with conducting the \npeople's business and who serve as stewards of hard-earned taxpayer \ndollars, should operate under an instinct of openness rather than \nreflexive secrecy.\n  Anyone who has watched the news recently could tell you that this \nyear's Sunshine Week couldn't have fallen at a more appropriate--yet \nvery concerning--time for our Nation. Even within the past few weeks, \nAmericans have learned of more actions and inactions at the Federal \nlevel that helped keep the shutters closed on the public's access to \ngovernment business.\n  It is impossible to discuss the current state of government \ntransparency without acknowledging former Secretary of State Hillary \nClinton's use of a personal email account located on a private server \nin her home to conduct official State Department business.\n  Last week, an article in Politico by Dan Metcalfe--who served more \nthan 25 years as the Director of the Department of Justice's Office of \nInformation and Privacy--called Secretary Clinton's argument that she \ncomplied with Federal recordkeeping laws ``laughable.'' Mr. Metcalfe \nsays that ``in this case, which is truly unprecedented, no matter what \nSecretary Clinton would have one believe, she managed successfully to \ninsulate her official emails, categorically, from the FOIA, both during \nher tenure at State and long after her departure from it--perhaps \nforever.'' At minimum, he says, ``it was a blatant circumvention of the \nFOIA by someone who unquestionably knows better.''\n  In an attempt to appease the increasing demand for answers, Secretary \nClinton said she used a personal email account to conduct official \ngovernment business simply for reasons of ``convenience.'' While that \nmay be so, I fear it is indicative of a broader fundamental disconnect \nbetween the letter and spirit of our Nation's transparency laws and the \nactions and attitudes of its officials.\n  Let's be clear. Transparency shouldn't be a question of convenience. \nAnd the public's right to know shouldn't be curtailed simply because \nthe release of certain information might be rather inconvenient for an \nagency, its leadership or an administration.\n  Conducting government business on private email undermines public \ntrust and is detrimental to good government. That is why I have \nreiterated a request I made to the State Department in 2013 for records \nand communications relating to the agency's questionable use of the \n``special government employee'' designation for a top aide to Secretary \nClinton. This designation may have facilitated even more government \nbusiness being conducted over private email, and we need to know \nexactly how these practices may be undermining FOIA.\n  I have also worked to shine light on the current Labor Secretary's \nuse of private email to conduct official business while serving at the \nJustice Department, and on allegations of the improper use of \nunofficial email addresses at the Treasury Department. In our \nincreasingly digital world, we must remain vigilant in ensuring that \ngovernment officials are conducting business through the appropriate \nchannels.\n  President Obama gave me high hopes at the start of his administration \nfor a ``new era of open Government''--one where transparency is the \nrule, as opposed to the exception. On his first day in office, the \nPresident issued a memorandum to his administration, proclaiming that \n``the Freedom of Information Act should be administered with a clear \npresumption: In the face of doubt, openness prevails.'' He has even \nproclaimed that his is ``the most transparent administration in \nhistory.''\n  Yet, time and again, we see examples of this administration operating \nunder a ``do as I say, not as I do'' approach to transparency. Last \nweek, administration officials proclaimed in USA TODAY that \n``increasingly, government agencies are operating with a `default to \nopen' approach.'' They added that ``the administration also continues \nto make important strides in improving the Freedom of Information Act \nprocess.''\n  The very next day was National Freedom of Information Day. How did \nthe Obama administration celebrate its commitment to transparency? It \nannounced its intention to remove a Federal regulation from the books \nthat for 30 years has subjected the White House Office of \nAdministration to FOIA requests. And just for good measure, the \nadministration said that this official change in policy will not be \nsubject to public comment.\n  But this is by no means the first time the administration has shirked \nits commitment to transparency. From negotiating new regulations behind \nclosed doors, to arguing an illogically narrow interpretation of FOIA \nbefore the DC Circuit--an interpretation the court said would have left \nFOIA requesters in limbo for months or even years--the Obama \nadministration seems determined to say one thing while doing another. \nClearly, there is room for improvement.\n  But thankfully, when the government refuses to let the sunlight in, \ncourageous citizens have stepped up to throw open the shutters. Each \nyear, Sunshine Week provides an excellent opportunity to highlight the \nbravery and contribution of whistleblowers--private citizens and \ngovernment employees who come forward to expose wrongdoing.\n\n[[Page S2033]]\n\n  Whistleblowers are a critical component of ensuring that our \ngovernment remains accountable to the people that it serves. For years, \nI have worked with fellow lawmakers to ensure that whistleblowers have \nthe kind of protections they need to be able to shine a light on waste, \nfraud, and abuse--without fear of retribution. Part of this effort has \nbeen through rigorous congressional oversight of agency compliance with \nlaws like the Whistleblower Protection Act.\n  This also involves rooting out areas for improvement. Earlier this \nmonth, the Senate Judiciary Committee held an oversight hearing to \nexamine the urgent need for increased whistleblower protections at the \nFBI, where--unlike every other Federal agency--employees are not \nprotected from retaliation for uncovering and reporting wrongdoings to \ntheir direct supervisors.\n  People who are courageous enough to open wide the curtains on waste, \nfraud, and abuse should not have to fear for their livelihood; they \nshould be honored for exposing the truth. To help advance this effort, \nI--along with a bipartisan group of Senators--recently launched the \nWhistleblower Protection Caucus. The caucus will serve as a resource \nfor the latest information on whistleblower developments and will \nfoster bipartisan discussion on the treatment of whistleblowers.\n  Agency inspectors general, likewise, play a crucial role in bringing \ninformation about government actions--or inactions--out into the public \nlight. It is important that their jobs not be undermined by the very \nagencies within which they operate. I am continually frustrated by the \nstories I hear of an agency stonewalling an inspector general's attempt \nto uncover the truth. In August 2014, 47 inspectors general from across \nthe Federal government wrote to Congress about agency refusals to \nprovide access to documents and information critical to their \ninvestigative efforts.\n  I am particularly troubled by recent reports from the Justice \nDepartment's Office of the Inspector General that the FBI is failing to \nprovide it with timely access to records. Not only is the FBI dragging \nits feet in turning over key documents, it is erecting barriers to \naccess that are in direct contradiction with Federal law.\n  If agencies are willing to go to such lengths to prevent disclosure, \nwe have all the more reason to recognize and support the efforts of \nthose who--often at great risk--seek to peel back the curtains.\n  Sunshine Week continues to be a reflection of the tireless efforts of \nwhistleblowers, government watchdogs, investigative journalists, and \naverage Americans from across the country who are steadfast in their \npursuit of a more transparent and accountable government. They are \ndoing their part. We need to do ours. Let's build upon this 10th \nanniversary of Sunshine Week to engage in the discussions and work \ntogether toward the solutions that will truly usher in a new era of \nopenness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2033-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR.

Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing March as National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month. This \nmonth provides us with an opportunity to reflect on the significant \nstrides we have made in confronting colorectal cancer and to renew our \ncommitment to beating this devastating disease. In 2000, President \nClinton first dedicated National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month in \norder to raise awareness of colorectal cancer and to remind us of the \nimportant steps we can take to prevent, detect, and ultimately defeat \nthis disease.\n  Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the \nUnited States. This year, approximately 50,000 Americans will die from \ncolorectal cancer, which means each one of us in this Chamber will lose \nan average of 1,000 constituents in 2015 alone. The likelihood of \ndeveloping colorectal cancer is now greater than 1 in 20, and 133,000 \nAmericans are expected to be newly diagnosed this year. The American \nCancer Society estimates that 2,360 new cases of colorectal cancer will \nbe diagnosed in Maryland and, sadly, 860 Marylanders are expected to \ndie from the disease this year.\n  Colorectal cancer affects men and women equally when we reach the age \nof 50 and beyond. Unfortunately, as I look around this room I know that \nsome of you have known someone who has been impacted by this disease.\n  Despite these grim statistics, however, the single most encouraging \nfact about this deadly disease is that colorectal cancer is among the \nmost preventable of all cancers. Unlike other cancer screenings where \nthe goal is to detect cancer at an early stage, colorectal cancer \nscreenings can actually prevent cancer from occurring in the first \nplace. Colorectal cancer arises from pre-cancerous growths, or polyps, \nthat grow in the colon. If found early through appropriate screening \nand detection, these polyps can be removed, halting their progression \ninto colorectal cancer. The way to beat this disease is with regular \nscreening through a variety of methods, including colonoscopy. These \nare life-saving tests. In fact, a recent study in the New England \nJournal of Medicine concluded that of the nearly 50,000 people expected \nto die of colorectal cancer this year, screening could save more than \nhalf of them.\n  At the same time, colorectal cancer screening is becoming a public \nhealth success story in the United States. While it remains the second \nleading cause of cancer deaths among men and women combined, both the \nincidence and death rate have been declining in recent years--something \nno other country can claim. The percentage of the population that is up \nto date with recommended colorectal cancer screening increased to 65 \npercent in 2010 and, among those aged 50 and older, incidence rates \nhave dropped 30 percent over the last decade. This positive trend in \nlower incidence rates demonstrates the importance of screening and the \npower of preventive medicine.\n  In Maryland, we can boast one of the highest screening rates among \neligible populations in the country at 70 percent. However, that still \nmeans that three out of every ten people at risk are not getting \nscreened. This highlights the need for policies to help achieve the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention's national goal of having 80 \npercent of eligible Americans screened by 2018. Furthermore, screening \nrates remain unacceptably low across the country, especially in the \nMedicare age population, who have the greatest risk for developing \ncolorectal cancer.\n  I am proud to rise in support of National Colorectal Cancer Awareness \nMonth. The need for increased awareness about this disease and the \nimportance of screening is a public health issue truly worthy of our \nattention in Congress. I ask my colleagues to join me in working to \nraise awareness that colorectal cancer is preventable, detectable, \ntreatable and curable.\n\n[[Page S2034]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2034-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     RECORD EXPUNGEMENT DESIGNED TO ENHANCE EMPLOYMENT (REDEEM) ACT\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, earlier this month, Senator Rand Paul and \nI introduced the Record Expungement Designed to Enhance Employment--or \nREDEEM--Act, a bill that takes important new steps to ensure that youth \nand adults caught up in the criminal justice system have an opportunity \nat a second chance to turn their lives around rather than returning to \na life of crime. I thank Senator Paul for joining with me to craft this \nlegislation.\n  This important bipartisan legislation would establish much needed, \nsensible, pragmatic reforms that keep kids out of an adult system in \nthe first place, protect their privacy so a youthful mistake does not \nhaunt young people throughout their lives, and make it less likely that \nlow-level nonviolent offenders reoffend.\n  As the former mayor of Newark, I believe strongly in holding people \naccountable for breaking our laws, but I also believe it is important \nthat we do everything possible to ensure that when people leave prison \nand return to their communities, they have every chance at becoming \nproductive members of our society. No one deserves more of an \nopportunity to leave their past behind than our children. Far too \noften, kids are easily manipulated into making a youthful mistake that \nshould not follow them for the rest of their lives. That is why I \nadvocate that we fix our Nation's broken criminal justice system, a \nsystem that has taken an unimaginable and I believe unsustainable toll \non families and communities.\n  The United States is home to between 4 and 5 percent of the entire \nglobe's population, but we have 25 percent of the world's prison \npopulation. This phenomenon is unacceptable, that the land of the free \nwould have 25 percent of the globe's imprisoned people. What is \nstartling about that is the majority of those people are nonviolent \noffenders. In fact, the majority are nonviolent drug offenders.\n  This phenomenon has largely emerged since around 1980, a period \nduring which the Federal prison population has grown nearly tenfold. \nSince 1980 we have seen a 10-time increase in our prison population. \nThe sad reality is that nearly three-quarters of Federal prisoners are \nnonviolent and have no history of violence whatsoever.\n  What is worse and what is anguishing is that once they are convicted \nof a crime, American citizens then face daunting obstacles to \nsuccessfully rejoin society, to being able to raise their family, put \nfood on the table, provide for themselves. As a result of that, our \nState and Federal prison exits have now become revolving doors, with \ntwo of every three ex-offenders getting rearrested within 5 years. Two-\nthirds of those nonviolent folks leaving our prisons come back within 5 \nyears.\n  When ex-offenders return to prison again and again, they are not just \npaying a price; we all pay the price. We are contributing so much of \nour resources to rearresting the same people over and over, to \nreincarcerating the same people over and over. A recent Pew report \nconcluded that if just 10 States cut their recidivism just 10 percent, \ntaxpayers would save $470 million--money this Nation could use to \neither return to taxpayers or invest in our crumbling infrastructure.\n  To further public safety, reduce recidivism, and protect the future \nof our children, I am proud to reintroduce the REDEEM Act. This bill \nwould incentivize States to raise the age of original jurisdiction for \ncriminal courts to 18 years old. Trying juveniles who have committed \nlow-level, nonviolent crimes as adults is counterproductive. They do \nnot emerge from prison reformed and ready to reintegrate into a high \nschool. The criminal record they have will not help them as they try to \nget a job. We need a system that treats juveniles toughly and fairly, \nwith an eye toward a productive adulthood.\n  This change in law is important for protecting our children's \nfutures. For kids in the dozen States that treat 17- and even 16-year-\nolds as adults, no longer would getting into a schoolyard scuffle \nresult in an adult record that could follow an individual for the rest \nof their life, restrict access to a college degree, limit employment \nprospects, and increase the likelihood of engaging in further criminal \nactivity.\n  The bill would enhance Federal juvenile record confidentiality and \nprovide for automatic expungement of records for kids who commit \nnonviolent crimes before they turn 15 and automatic sealing of records \nfor those who commit nonviolent crimes after they turn 15.\n  The bill would ban the very cruel and counterproductive practice of \njuvenile solitary confinement that can have immediate and long-term \ndetrimental effects on youth detainee mental and physical health. In \nfact, the majority of suicides by juveniles in prisons occur when young \npeople are placed in solitary confinement. Other nations even consider \nit torture.\n  The bill would, for adults, offer the first broad-based Federal path \nto the sealing of criminal records. A person who commits a nonviolent \ncrime will be able to petition a court and make his or her case.\n  The bill would enhance the accuracy of criminal justice records. \nEmployers requesting a background check from the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation will be provided with only relevant and accurate \ninformation thanks to a provision that will protect job applicants by \nimproving the quality of the Bureau's background check. Think about \nthis: 17 million background checks were done by the FBI in 2013, many \nof them for private providers, and upward of half of them were \ninaccurate or incomplete, often causing people to lose a job, miss an \neconomic opportunity, and be trapped with few economic options other \nthan to reoffend in order to feed a child.\n  Finally, the bill would lift a ban on receiving Supplemental \nNutritional Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits. The intent of this \nprogram is to keep low-income families from going hungry. Yet those \nconvicted of drug use or possession lose the right to obtain such \nbenefits. Once an individual has paid his or her debt to society, a \npath to the reinstatement of those benefits should be available. As \nPresident George W. Bush said in his 2004 State of the Union Address, \n``America is the land of the second chance, and when the gates of the \nprison open, the path ahead should lead to a better life.'' This bill \nwould do just that.\n  Taken together, these measures will help keep kids who get in trouble \nout of a lifetime of crime and help adults who commit nonviolent crimes \nbecome more self-reliant and less likely to reoffend. This bill is \nsupported by 27 organizations, including: the ACLU, the National \nEmployment Law Center, the Sentencing Project, the Center for Children \nLaw and Policy, the Legal Action Center, the Coalition for Juvenile \nJustice, the General Board of Church and Society, National Juvenile \nJustice Network, and the National Catholic Social Justice Lobby.\n  The time to act is now. We cannot afford to let our criminal justice \nsystem continue to grow at the rate that it is. We cannot afford to sap \nbillions of taxpayer dollars from a broken system that is locking \npeople up and then doing nothing to empower them to succeed. We cannot \nafford to waste human potential and human productivity.\n  We have seen how other individual States--like Georgia, Texas, and \nNorth Carolina--are taking significant steps to address this issue and \nare lowering both recidivism and the size of their prison population, \nwhile at the same time lowering actual crime in their States. It is \ntime that the Federal Government act to do the same.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to support the REDEEM Act so we can make \nour communities safer and stronger and empowers our citizens to live \nproductive and strong lives of contribution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2034-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2034-S2035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WORLD WAR II VETERANS VISIT\n\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the distinguished \nveterans of Honor Flight Northern Colorado who recently made their 13th \ntrip to Washington, DC to visit the memorials that stand in our \nNation's Capital. This group includes veterans from multiple wars and \ndifferent generations, linked together by their service to our Nation.\n  Founded in 2005, the Honor Flight Program was originally formed to \nhonor veterans of World War II but has since expanded to include those \nwho have served in all other American engagements. This program \nprovides an\n\n[[Page S2035]]\n\nopportunity for veterans to fly to Washington, DC free of cost, so they \ncan visit the national memorials dedicated to their service. Of the 123 \nveterans who visited Washington, DC 22 served in World War II, 69 in \nKorea, and 32 in Vietnam.\n  Military service is an exceptional duty to country. When the United \nStates has been threatened, our veterans have stepped up and answered \nour country's call without reservation or fear.\n  Though these memorials honor our veterans' service, no statue or \nmonument can truly express the level of gratitude we feel for those who \ncourageously risked their lives to preserve our inherent rights to \nlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Today we honor those who \nfought to secure the blessings endowed by our Creator for future \ngenerations.\n  Please join me in honoring Leonard Bennett, Verne Berry, Donald \nDebus, Frank DeSeure, Earl Harper, Joe Hoberman, Boyd Johnson, Charles \nJohnson, Phyllis Iverson-Farver, Glenn Lawrence, William Loper, Thomas \nMascarenas, Jack Miller, James Mitchell, Glenn Morrell, Robert Palmer, \nMargaret Rowlett, Waldemar Schielke, Eric Schoenhaar, Lyle Stearley, \nPerry Sullinger, James Wayne, Henry Amen, Donald Babcock.

Mr. President, I congratulate the hard-working members \nof the Greater Bloomington chamber of Commerce as they celebrate 100 \nyears of creating jobs, building Indiana's economy, and improving the \nlives of Hoosiers across our State.\n  The Greater Bloomington Chamber of Commerce was founded in 1915 by a \ngroup of local business leaders dedicated to improving their community. \nFor the past century, the chamber has proudly served Bloomington and \nMonroe County businesses, as well as the community as a whole, with \nintegrity, leadership, and collaboration.\n  Since its founding, the Bloomington Chamber of Commerce has provided \nleadership through member engagement, business advocacy, and civic \npartnerships designed to strengthen the Bloomington business \nenvironment. They have been a voice of business in greater Bloomington, \nadvancing collaboration, regional partnerships, and fostering young \nprofessional development in order to prepare students for work.\n  The Bloomington Chamber of Commerce has many noteworthy \naccomplishments over their 100 years of existence. Some of these \ninclude leading support for local and statewide transportation \nimprovement projects; supporting the development of public water \nresources such as Lakes Lemon, Griffey, and Monroe; leading school bond \nreferendums, programs, and opportunities through the Franklin \nInitiative; and supporting efforts to revitalize downtown Bloomington. \nFor these efforts and so many more, the Bloomington Chamber of Commerce \nhas been named Chamber of the Year in both Indiana and on the national \nlevel by the American Chamber of Commerce Executives.\n  Businesses and everyday residents have benefited from the efforts of \nthe Greater Bloomington Chamber of Commerce, and its members to create \nan exceptional quality of life for families in and around Monroe \nCounty. As a leading advocate for business in the Bloomington area \ntoday, the chamber's mission remains true to its foundation while at \nthe same time adapting to accommodate the ever-changing landscape of \ntoday's business world. Their core vision of keeping Greater \nBloomington a vibrant community in which to live, learn, invest, and \nwork has paid off for area residents and will continue to do so for \nyears to come.\n  On behalf of the citizens of Indiana, I sincerely congratulate all \nmembers of the Greater Bloomington Chamber of Commerce on their 100th \nanniversary, and I wish them continued success and growth in the years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2035-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2035-S2036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ZEKE GRADER\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

He was raised in \nFort Bragg, a small coastal town in Mendocino County, and spent his \nfree time down on the docks helping his family's fish business. Zeke \nlater attended Sonoma State University and graduated with a degree in \npolitical science before going to law school at the University of San \nFrancisco.\n  In 1976, Zeke began working as the executive director of the Pacific \nCoast Federation of Fishermen's Associations, PCFFA, a trade \norganization supporting commercial fishing and fishermen rights. \nThroughout his 40-year career with PCFFA, Zeke worked tirelessly to \nsupport fishermen and their families, serving with unmatched \ndistinction and skill. Zeke always understood the importance of ocean \nconservation, supporting groundbreaking legislation such as the \nMagnuson-Stevens Act and the California Coastal Act and advocating for \nsustainable fisheries that protected against overfishing and restored \nfish habitats.\n  Zeke's passion for the ocean led him to other leadership positions, \nincluding\n\n[[Page S2036]]\n\nroles as the founding executive director of the Institute for Fisheries \nResources, a member of the U.S. Department of Commerce's Marine \nFisheries Advisory Committee, and a member of the Marine Fish \nConservation Network.\n  A resolute and determined defender of the sea and those whose \nlivelihoods depend on it, Zeke Grader is truly a force of nature.

Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in saluting Rebecca Alexander, a native Californian who has overcome \ntremendous obstacles and inspired countless others to face their own \nchallenges with courage and strength.\n  On April 14th, the Foundation Fighting Blindness will honor Rebecca \nAlexander with its Hope and Spirit Award at the Thirteenth Annual For \nthe Love of Sight Visionary Awards Dinner here in Washington.\n  Rebecca was born in Oakland with Usher syndrome type III, a rare \ngenetic disorder that causes progressive blindness and deafness. She \nbegan losing her sight as a teenager, and suffered a fall at age 18 \nthat broke nearly every bone in her body. Today, Rebecca is almost \ncompletely blind and deaf.\n  Despite these daunting setbacks, Rebecca has persevered. Now 36 years \nold, Rebecca is a psychotherapist with two master's degrees from \nColumbia University and a successful private practice in New York City. \nShe is also the author of a moving memoir, ``Not Fade Away.''\n  In addition to her professional achievements, Rebecca regularly \nteaches spin classes and competes in the Civilian Military Combine, \nCMC, for extreme athletes.

Mr. President, our Nation was founded on an idea--an \nidea that every person has the right to freely speak, live, worship, \nwork, and build flourishing lives for themselves and their families. \nAnd today I want to recognize a man who embraces those liberties and \nwhose witness is exceptional. For a century, Mr. Mitzner has been a \nwarrior for freedom.\n  David Mitzner was born to Jewish parents in Poland, and during World \nWar II he lost his family to the Holocaust. He survived 8 long years in \na Soviet gulag. A Russian officer told the men at the labor camp, \n``Here you're going to live, here you're going to die.'' David refused \nto accept that as his fate and fought to live. In 1949 he defied his \ncaptors and escaped the iron grip of communism to come to the United \nStates.\n  He arrived in New York with just $17 in his pocket. He didn't know \nEnglish and didn't have any relatives to rely upon. He got his first \njob working for a hosiery manufacturer and today he is one of world's \nmost successful private real estate investors whose projects span from \nTexas to Poland.\n  He works with the same vigor, energy, and gratitude as he did when he \nstepped onto American soil 66 years ago. And at 100 years old, Mr. \nMitzner still goes into the office to make sure his company continues \nto operate with uncompromising integrity and excellence. He has \npioneered development in cities across the world, and particularly in \nWarsaw, his childhood home, which was nearly destroyed by communism. \nHis fellow investors said it couldn't be done but he proved them wrong.\n  As he often says, there are miracles all around us. David's life is a \nmiracle and it is one that continues to overflow into all those who are \nblessed to know him.\n  In closing, I want to recount a brief anecdote from the Passover \nSeder, which I had the privilege of celebration with David and the \nextended Mitzner family last year. It was very close to his 99th \nbirthday, and I remember him saying, ``99 is nothing. When I turn 100, \nthat will be something.'' David, you are now 100, and it is indeed \nsomething. Happy birthday, friend, and thank you for the legacy you \nhave built, not merely on bricks and mortar, but on upon your fortitude \nand your faith.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2036-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING JUSTICE BEST\n\n Mr. HELLER.

Ms. Best is a junior at Spanish \nSprings High School in Sparks, NV, and was one of 5,000 students in 45 \nStates to compete. This was the largest amount of participants to ever \nenter the contest since it began 11 years ago. The competition allowed \nfor middle school and high school participants and required the \nstudents to make a 5- to 7-minute documentary responding to this \nstatement: ``The Three Branches and You: tell a story that demonstrates \nhow a policy, law, or action by either the executive, legislative, or \njudicial branch has affected you or your community.'' Students were \nchosen based upon how well their videos demonstrated research and \nplanning and upon their ability to include a diverse range of expert \ninterviews on the topic. Last, judges paid close attention to the \nstudents' ability to demonstrate critical thought on their topics.\n  Ms. Best chose an important topic pertinent to Nevada on both a State \nand Federal level: the greater sage grouse endangered species listing. \nThroughout the documentary, she presented the two sides of the issue by \ninterviewing professionals and locals with knowledge on the topic and \nconcluded that listing the greater sage grouse as an endangered species \nwould be detrimental to the Nevada economy. Ms. Best was one of 16 \nsecond prize winners, earning a total of $1,000. She is a shining \nexample of how hard work and dedication result in success and stands as \na role model for future Spanish Springs Cougars.\n  I am excited to see a local student bringing recognition to both \nNevada and to Spanish Springs High School for her advancement in a \nnational competition.

On October 16, \n2013, an armed robbery took place at a Bank of America in Reno, \nresulting in the death a patron. Mr. Rodriguez was off duty and unarmed \nwhen he witnessed the occurrence at the bank, but he called 911 and \nfollowed the suspect after he had fled the scene. Mr. Rodriguez then \napprehended and disarmed the suspect at a nearby bus station to be sure \nthe situation would not escalate or result in the suspect getting away. \nResponding officers arrived shortly after to take the suspect into \ncustody. It gives me great pleasure to recognize Mr. Rodriguez for his \nunwavering commitment to protecting his community in both this instance \nand throughout his tenure as an officer.\n  Mr. Rodriguez began his career as a Reno police officer in 1998 and \nhas remained committed to his job and his community ever since. His \ndedication to keeping those around him safe is commendable, and his \ncommitment to service above self is a shining example of heroism. The \nReno community is safer because of Mr. Rodriguez.\n  The Congressional Badge of Bravery is awarded to law enforcement \nofficers who have sustained a physical injury or were at great risk of \nphysical injury while protecting their community. Mr. Rodriguez's \nactions more than warrant this prestigious award and represent only the \ngreatest of Nevada's values, including a sense of community and an \nobligation to help others. His actions prove that he consistently makes \nthe safety and security of others a top priority and is always ready to \nrespond at a moment's notice. He is a role model to future generations \nof Reno police officers and officers across the country.\n  During his tenure, Mr. Rodriguez has demonstrated immeasurable \nbravery, commitment to excellence, and dedication to the highest \nstandards of the police force. I am both humbled and honored by his \nservice and am proud to call him a fellow Nevadan. Today, I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in congratulating Mr. Rodriguez for all of his \naccomplishments and wish him well in all of his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2037-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I wish to honor the 50th \nanniversary of the Appalachian Regional Commission, a vital partnership \nthat has created abundant opportunities for families and communities in \nmy State of West Virginia and across the Appalachian region for five \ndecades. Since its establishment in 1965, the Appalachian Regional \nCommission, known as ARC, has spurred job creation, economic growth and \ninfrastructure improvements, which have helped build a stronger \nAppalachia. I am proud of all that ARC has done to help improve the \nregion, and I am committed to continue working with the agency to \nfurther enhance our communities.\n  Over the past 50 years, the rural communities of Appalachia have \nfaced unique challenges. After the American industrial revolution, \nwhich was driven largely by Appalachian coal and other regional \nresources, these communities experienced a rapid economic downturn. \nSince then, ARC has partnered with local and State leaders to make \ncritical investments that have helped rebuild and revitalize the \nregion.\n  Located in the heart of Appalachia, which is home to more than 25 \nmillion Americans, my home State of West Virginia has benefitted \nconsiderably from the contributions of ARC. Through its initiatives, \nARC has played a critical role in helping lift West Virginians out of \neconomic turmoil and homelessness. Prior to ARC's establishment, 34.6 \npercent of West Virginians were living in poverty. Today, that number \nhas been cut in half to 17.6 percent. This is telling of ARC's \ncommitment to the strength of our citizens in rural and economically \ndistressed areas.\n  Also, by investing in our highways, railroads, bridges, as well as \nwater and sewer systems, ARC funding in West Virginia has helped lay \nthe foundation for economic growth in the region. Of West Virginia's \n409.6 total eligible miles, 360.4 are open to traffic thanks to help \nfrom ARC. Additionally, ARC has made 2,133 strategic nonhighway grants \nin West Virginia, totaling $387.6 million. These initiatives are vital \nto improving the quality of life for our residents and growing tourism \nand business in the State.\n  The agency's investments have undoubtedly been a source of economic \nvitality and an engine for job growth. All of the Mountain State's 55 \ncounties added employment at a 4.2-percent faster pace and per capita \nincome at a 5.5-percent faster pace than similar counties that did not \nreceive ARC investments. Per capita income has increased from 71.6 \npercent of the national average in 1969 to 79.4 percent today.\n  Nonetheless, there is still work to be done to bring Appalachia to \nparity with the rest of the Nation. We must continue to invest in the \nregion's educational programs, because the long-term economic success \nof this region truly rests in the hands of a well-informed, educated \nand skilled workforce. We must also focus on working together to fight \nrampant drug use and abuse, a national epidemic that proliferates in \nthe pockets of Appalachia. And of equal importance, we need to continue \nto invest in industrial infrastructure, broadband expansion, business \ndevelopment, health care, and workforce training.\n  While Governor, I had the honor of serving as the cochair for the \nState's representative of ARC and now, as a U.S. Senator from \nAppalachia, I continue to be a strong supporter of the program. ARC has \nproven over the past 50 years that a partnership between the Federal, \nState, and local government can work together to help improve the \neconomic success in regions across West Virginia and Appalachia. It is \ntruly an honor to recognize them today for their work to improve and \ndevelop this special American region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2037-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING STEVE PIERCE, II\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that Cindy \nand I would like to express our sincere condolences to our friend, \nArizona State Senator Steve Pierce, his wife, Joan, and their entire \nfamily on the loss of their son, Stephen Morris Pierce II. Sadly, Steve \nleaves behind his wife Amilyn and their unborn child.\n  I wish there were a way to make sense of such a sudden and tragic \nloss. It is impossible for Steve's family and friends to understand how \nsomeone with such a bright future could be taken from them so quickly.\n  Raised on one of the last great cattle ranches in Arizona, Steve's \nimagination thrived. He was an all-American boy who enjoyed fishing, \nfootball, and baseball. His love of the ocean took Steve to San Diego \nState University, where he studied computer information and decision \nsystems. Always adventurous and playful, Steve found a way to turn play \ninto work when he started working in the online-gaming industry. He was \nable to fulfill his dream of starting his own online-gaming company.\n  Steve touched the lives of many and will never be forgotten. His \ngenerosity of spirit will always be treasured. We can take comfort in \nthe fact that those who loved him will keep his memory alive when they \nremember his easy laugh and acts of kindness.\n  Cindy and I express our deepest sympathies for the tragic loss of \nsuch a fine son, husband, brother, and friend. Through this difficult \ntime, the Pierce family will remain in our thoughts and \nprayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2037-4", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2037-S2038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DETROIT PUBLIC LIBRARY SESQUICENTENNIAL\n\n Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, today I recognize the Detroit \nPublic Library's Sesquicentennial. For 150 years, the\n\n[[Page S2038]]\n\nDetroit Public Library has been a cornerstone in the cultural and \nintellectual life of Detroiters. Throughout that time it has remained \ncommitted to its mission of enhancing the quality of life of the city's \nresidents, and has worked to safeguard the history of Detroit and \nMichigan.\n  When the Detroit Public Library opened on March 25, 1865 its \ncollection consisted of 5,000 books housed in a single room of \nMichigan's first State Capital. The Detroit Free Press celebrated the \nlibrary's inauguration by reporting that all Detroiters were anxious to \nsupport the new institution. The free access to information on the \nfields of science and literature was embraced as a public good worthy \nof praise. As enthusiasm for the library grew, so did its collection. \nOn March 27, 1873 Michigan Governor John Judson Bagley signed into law \na measure calling for the construction of a new library in Detroit.\n  On January 22, 1877, the new home of the Detroit Public Library was \ndedicated and its first librarian, Professor Henry Chaney, was \nappointed. The building, the first to solely house the library, was \ndesigned in the Second Empire style by the Detroit architectural firm \nof Brush & Smith. Much of the detail work was completed by a young \nGeorge D. Mason, who later went on to design the Detroit Masonic Temple \nand the Grand Hotel on Michigan's Mackinaw Island. In addition to its \ngrand exterior, the library included a large reading room that featured \nornate iron columns rising to a central skylight. The new building cost \n$124,000 or approximately $2.5 million when adjusted for inflation, and \nhoused a collection that had grown to 33,604 items.\n  Demand for the services of the Detroit Public Library continued to \ngrow along with the city's population. In 1900, the Detroit Public \nLibrary opened three additional branches. In 1904 it opened two more. \nThe library continued to expand over the next two decades, with each \nadditional branch designed and constructed to highlight beauty as well \nas utility. The library also established 80 smaller stations located in \nschools, fire houses and factories throughout Detroit. Still, as the \ncity boomed with the success of the automotive industry, the Detroit \nPublic Library found itself in need of even more space.\n  In March 1910, the City of Detroit accepted financial assistance from \nAndrew Carnegie to encourage the construction of a new, larger public \nlibrary. In light of Detroit's growth, officials determined the new \nlibrary should be located north of downtown. The city purchased land \nalong Woodward Avenue for nearly $500,000--more than $11.1 million \ntoday--and hired Cass Gilbert to design the new building. Mr. Gilbert, \nan architect from New York, had designed the library in St. Louis and \nthe Woolworth Building in New York City. He would also go on to design \nthe James Scott Memorial Fountain on Detroit's Belle Isle, as well as \nthe U.S. Supreme Court building in Washington, DC.\n  The Detroit Public Library's main branch opened at its current \nlocation in March, 1921. With a final cost of $3 million--nearly $38.45 \nmillion today--the Italian Renaissance inspired structure of white \nmarble was immediately deemed the most beautiful building in Detroit. \nWhen it opened, the main library's collection included more than \n500,000 items. The library continued to grow. On June 23, 1963, the \nCass Avenue wings of the main branch opened, doubling the size of the \nlibrary to accommodate a collection that had reached almost 2 million \nitems and served nearly 2 million residents.\n  Today, the Detroit Public Library includes 23 locations and a \ncollection of over 4.1 million items. It remains committed to \nincreasing the quality of life in Detroit and addressing the changing \nneeds of its residents. The library provides programs for adults, \nchildren, and teens designed to increase literacy and technical skill, \nencourage lifelong learning, promote multiculturalism, and ensure the \nequitable access to information. This year it is proud to celebrate the \n50th anniversary of its Junior Great Books Program and the 75th \nanniversary of its Bookmobile. It has also continued to serve the \nentire State of Michigan through its outstanding special collections, \nwhich include the 100-year-old Clarence M. Burton Historical \nCollection, the E. Azalia Hackley Collection of African Americans in \nthe Performing Arts, the Rare Book Collection, and the Ernie Harwell \nSports Collection.\n  As the Detroit Public Library moves into the future, I am confident \nit will continue to contribute to the intellectual capital, diversity, \ncreativity and community spirit of a great city. I am pleased to \nrecognize the Detroit Public Library's Sesquicentennial and wish it \nanother 150 years of service to the City of Detroit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2038-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2038-S2039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM E. RUSHING JR.\n\n Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, today I recognize William E. \nRushing Jr. for his volunteer leadership to the American Concrete \nInstitute, ACI, headquartered in Farmington Hills, MI, an organization \nwhose work is fundamental to our Nation's critical infrastructure and \neconomic competitiveness. I am honored to acknowledge Mr. Rushing for \nhis career-long commitment to advancing knowledge of concrete in the \nUnited States and abroad.\n  ACI has been a pioneer in all concrete-related fields: research and \ndevelopment, structural design, architectural design, construction, and \nproduct manufacture. With 100 professional chapters, 86 student \nchapters, and nearly 18,000 members spanning over 100 countries, the \nACI provides knowledge and information for the best use of concrete. \nThrough a host of activities including continuing education, \ncertification, seminars, publications, and conventions, ACI plays an \nactive and vital role in the concrete industry. Central to ACI's work \nis the development of codes and standards, which serve as a reference \nfor building codes that impact many concrete projects in the United \nStates. Further, in some 21 countries worldwide, the ACI 3I8 Structural \nConcrete Building Code provisions serve as a base for part or all of \nthese nations' building codes.\n  Mr. Rushing received his bachelor of science degree in civil \nengineering from Louisiana State University, LSU, Baton Rouge, in 1981. \nHe is a licensed professional engineer in Louisiana, Mississippi, \nAlabama, Arkansas, and Arizona. Mr. Rushing is also a member of the \nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers and the Structural Engineers \nInstitute. He has been honored with election to the LSU Civil and \nEnvironmental Engineering Hall of Distinction.\n  Currently, William E. Rushing Jr. is a vice president with Waldemar \nS. Nelson & Co., Inc., New Orleans. He has been an active member of ACI \nfor more than 30 years and was named a fellow of ACI in 1998. He \npreviously served on the ACI board of direction, has chaired the ACI \nstrategic plan drafting task group, and has skillfully managed \ninstitute finances for several terms as chair of the Financial Advisory \nCommittee. As chair of the ACI Convention Committee, he has worked \ntirelessly to improve the experience for local chapters at its \nconventions. He has worked on several ACI technical committees that \ncover the full range of the institute's areas of knowledge and \nexpertise. Through his work on ACI educational committees, he has been \na strong promoter of ACI student activities programs. He also serves on \nthe board of the ACI Foundation.\n  Mr. Rushing will complete his term as president of ACI on April 16, \n2015, at The ACI Concrete Convention and Exposition in Kansas City, MO. \nHis year-long presidency has been marked by implementing and advancing \nthe goals of engagement, outreach, structure, and leadership in the ACI \nStrategic Plan. The ACI University Program was launched as a new method \nto deliver online learning modules to bring education information to \nall concrete professionals. A major development during his presidency \nwas the rollout of the reorganized ACI 318-14 Structural Concrete \nBuilding Code, the culmination of a massive technical undertaking which \ntook nearly 7 years to complete. In his outreach capacity, Mr. Rushing \nengaged concrete industry professionals and their broader network of \nstakeholders on the benefits of the reorganized code.\n  Over his decades of work in the concrete industry, Mr. Rushing has \nbeen honored with many awards for his outstanding leadership and \nservice. In 2011, he was recognized with the ACI Henry L. Kennedy Award \nfor his work\n\n[[Page S2039]]\n\non many of the institute's committees. He also received the Chapter \nActivities Award from ACI in 2003. As a member, of the board of \ndirection for the Louisiana chapter--ACI, he received its Chapter \nActivity Award in 2004 and its Chapter Distinguished Member Award in \n2010. His service has also been recognized in his selection as vice \nchair of the ACI Fall 1996 Convention and co-chair of the ACI Fall 2009 \nConvention.\n  Mr. President, I am honored to ask my colleagues to join me today to \nrecognize Mr. William E. Rushing Jr.'s leadership and service to the \nAmerican Concrete Institute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2039-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING RAFAEL GARCIA\n\n Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I would like to speak to you about \nthe loss of a remarkable young man who made a tremendous impact on my \ncommunity.\n  This week, the city of Miami lost a firefighter, a devoted husband, \nan expectant father, and a selfless public servant named Rafael Garcia \nwhen he died very suddenly from a brain tumor that was detected just \ndays ago.\n  Rafael, known as Ralf, was only 28 years old. He is remembered by the \nmany who loved him as brilliant, driven, and selfless, and the all-too-\nbrief record of his life confirms all three traits. He graduated \nsalutatorian from Christopher Columbus High School in 2005. He chose to \nattend Florida International University to stay close to his family and \nthe community he loved and went on to graduate summa cum laude as the \nonly student in his class to have a perfect GPA.\n  With Ralf's natural gifts, he could have chosen virtually any career \npath--including jobs that would have paid lucrative salaries and kept \nhim far from danger--but instead he chose to apply his considerable \ntalents to serving his neighbors as a firefighter and EMT. So after \ngraduation, he worked as a math teacher while attending Coral Springs \nFire Academy, from which he graduated first in his class. He was then \nso eager to get started that he camped outside for 3 days so he could \nbe first to submit his application for an opening. After winning that \nposition, he attended Miami Fire Academy, where he once again graduated \nfirst in his class and won the award of Outstanding Recruit.\n  As a firefighter, Ralf was more than just a hero who rushed into \ninfernos while others fled; he also served our community in smaller \nmoments, protecting the little pieces of this country that make America \nhome. It is firefighters like Ralf who place a rescued teddy bear in \nthe arms of a scared child. It is firefighters like Ralf who extinguish \na blaze before it destroys the business a man worked his whole life to \nbuild. It is firefighters like Ralf who save a young mother from the \ntwisted steel of a car wreck. And it is firefighters like Ralf who help \nto provide my children--and all children--with the knowledge that they \nare safe and that should anything happen, there are men and women ready \nto blare sirens, stop traffic, and break down walls to get to them if \nthat is what they have to do.\n  Ralf is remembered as a ``firefighter's firefighter.'' Many children \ngrow up dreaming of becoming firefighters, and many who achieve this \ndream aspire to be a firefighter like Ralf.\n  His supervisor, Lieutenant Christopher Cope, told the Miami Herald he \nwas ``one of those subordinates that you wish you could clone to staff \nyour entire department.''\n  When his tumor was discovered earlier this month, Ralf was in the \nprocess of studying for his lieutenant's exam. Remarkably, with all of \nhis responsibilities as a firefighter and soon-to-be father, Ralf also \nfound time to touch lives in other ways.\n  He spent any time he could spare tutoring high schoolers in Miami \nstruggling with math and serving as a substitute teacher. His father \ntells of multiple parents who have reached out this week to express \ntheir gratitude for how Ralf helped their children achieve better test \nscores.\n  But even with all of his service in life, perhaps the greatest \ndemonstration we have of Rafael Garcia's character is the dignity, \nlove, and selflessness he demonstrated in his final days. A surprise \nprognosis that would have left many of us bitter and defeated instead \nbrought out what was best in him.\n  Before he passed, his wife Maeghan wrote on Facebook of his final \ndays when he resolved to donate his organs to others. She wrote, ``I \ntruly believe that the only reason he is still holding on is because he \nknows he will continue to help others even after his passing. In true \nRalf fashion, I can just imagine him not wanting to `be selfish' by \nletting go too soon. That was his nature,'' she wrote, ``always \nthinking of others first.''\n  Miami has lost an irreplaceable member of our community this week in \nRafael Garcia, but I know his legacy will live on for many years in the \nlives of those he touched. Today, Jeanette and I hold in our prayers \nhis wife Maeghan, his-soon-to-be-born son, who is due in May, and his \nparents, Juan and Patricia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2039-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING MARUCCI SPORTS\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, entrepreneurs and small business \nowners have a unique skill of seeing what their community is missing \nand fulfilling that need. As such, these ideas are often conceived \nthrough personal experiences and the backyard projects we take on for \nour children, family, and friends. This week's Small Business of the \nWeek, Marucci Sports of Baton Rouge, LA, was similarly inspired.\n  Back in 2002, Jack Marucci and his son Gino began studying the wooden \nbats of their favorite baseball players so that Gino could pick one to \nplay with in his Little League games. When Jack couldn't find the \nperfect bat for his son, he decided to craft one in his garage down in \nsoutheast Louisiana. Gino's homemade bat quickly became popular around \nthe neighborhood, and Jack picked up orders to produce personalized \nones for his son's friends. Shortly thereafter, a Major League first \nbaseman put in an order, as well. As the former Louisiana State \nUniversity athletic training director, Jack knew a thing or two about \nproper sports equipment, and Marucci Sports has since grown to be one \nof Louisiana's top cutting-edge companies for quality baseball and \nsoftball products. Today, Marucci Sports continues to provide wood bats \nto youths learning the game for the first time, as well as to over one-\nthird of the Major League Baseball's players.\n  Due to Jack's legacy of meticulous attention to detail and quality, \nMarucci Sports is on the forefront of innovating athletic equipment. \nMost recently, the company announced the creation of a new smart fabric \nwith the capability to help diagnose head injuries for athletes. In \nrecent years, the long-lasting effects of head injuries, including \nconcussions, have come into the limelight as a serious issue for \nathletes. In response to those concerns, Marucci Sports developed new \nBodiTrak's Head Health Network helmets, which are lined with a \npressure-mapping fabric designed to track each contact the helmet \nreceives as it happens. If there is particularly strong contact to the \nhead, the helmet will notify the coach or trainer who can then make \nsure the player is alright. This technology has the potential to \nprevent generations of folks from developing damaging head injuries and \nprotect future generations of athletes.\n  It is innovative ideas such as these from Marucci Sports and other \nsmall businesses that make our country great. Congratulations again to \nMarucci Sports for being selected as Small Business of the Week. Thank \nyou for your commitment to safety, creating quality products, and one \nof Louisiana's favorite past times.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2039-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2039-4", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2039-S2040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S2040]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2040-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                    Enrolled Joint Resolution Signed\n\n  The President pro tempore (Mr. Hatch) reported that he had signed the \nfollowing enrolled joint resolution, which was previously signed by the \nSpeaker of the House:\n       S.J.

A bill to require rulemaking by the Administrator of the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency to address considerations in \nevaluating the need for public and individual disaster assistance, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today a bill to \ntry to bring some transparency and fairness into FEMA's disaster \ndeclaration process. It is the Fairness in Federal Disaster \nDeclarations Act.\n  The inspiration for the bill was a tragic one. On February 29, 2012, \nleap day, a category F-4 tornado tore through southeastern Illinois, \ncausing damage in 11 Illinois counties and causing major damage in the \nsmall towns of Harrisburg and Ridgway. Eight people in Harrisburg, \nalone, died in the event and 15 people were killed in total. Winds \nreached 175-miles per hour. It is not too much of a stretch to say \nthese two small towns were almost wiped off the map.\n  Requests for Federal assistance after a disaster are made by the \nGovernor of each State. The state emergency management agency typically \ndoes a preliminary damage assessment and then the Governor decides \nwhether State resources are adequate to absorb the costs of clean up \nand recovery. In the case of the Harrisburg and Ridgway tornado, the \nGovernor's request for federal emergency designation for Individual \nAssistance was denied, as was the State's appeal of that decision. With \nthat denial, individuals whose homes or properties were damaged were \nprecluded from direct federal help.\n  I asked FEMA why it denied the Governor's request--which was \nsupported by my colleague Senator Kirk and me, along with the entire \nIllinois delegation--and we were told it was because the disaster did \nnot meet or exceed the State's per capita. In other words, because \nIllinois is a highly populous state, it is presumed it can absorb the \ncosts of cleanup and recovery from disasters up to a certain level. \nFEMA said the deadly tornado event did not exceed the state's presumed \ncapacity.\n  Currently, FEMA multiplies the number of people in a state by $1.35 \nto determine a threshold of the amount of damage a state would have to \nhave incurred to be considered for Assistance. In Illinois, that figure \nis about $18 million. Well, Harrisburg, Ridgway, and the surrounding \ncommunities had about $5.5 million in Public Assistance damages. $5.5 \nmillion is a lot of loss, particularly in a rural area--but not enough \nto qualify for Federal assistance under FEMA' s rules.\n  From 2002 to 2015, Illinois was denied federal disaster assistance \nseven times. Texas was denied thirteen times--for damage caused by \neverything from\n\n[[Page S2048]]\n\nwildfires to tropical storms. Florida was denied Federal disaster \nassistance eight times during that 13-year period, and California, New \nJersey, and New York were each denied four times. FEMA's formula does \nnot work for large, populous states, particularly those with a \nconcentrated urban area, like Illinois.\n  Although the ultimate decision whether to award Federal assistance is \nmade by the President, by statute, under the Stafford Act, FEMA is \nrequired to consider six factors when determining whether assistance is \nwarranted. After the Harrisburg and Ridgway tornado, we pushed FEMA a \nlittle harder and asked what else, in addition to the per capita, was \nconsidered in the denial. After all, 15-people died in the event and \nthe damage was startling. We were told that specifics of FEMA's \nanalysis is not public and wouldn't be disclosed.\n  Illinois ran into the same issue in November 2013 when, once again, \ntornadoes swept through the State. This time six people were killed and \nwhole neighborhoods were nearly destroyed. The Cities of Washington, \nGifford, and New Minden, Illinois, experienced the worst tornado damage \nI have ever seen. Public infrastructure was decimated, but because \nIllinois did not meet one of FEMA's criteria, we were denied Federal \nPublic Assistance. These events inspired my colleague, Senator Kirk, \nand me to introduce a bill to try to build in a bit more transparency \nand fairness into FEMA's process.\n  The Fairness in Federal Disaster Declaration seeks to improve the \ndisaster analysis by assigning a value to each of the factors FEMA must \nconsider when determining whether Federal disaster assistance will be \nmade available. When it comes to Individual Assistance--funding to help \npeople repair and rebuild their homes--the breakdown would be as \nfollows:\n  Concentration damages--the density of damage in an individual \ncommunity--would be considered 20 percent, Trauma--the loss of life and \ninjuries and the disruption of normal community functions--would be 20 \npercent of the analysis, Special Populations--including the age income \nof the residents, the amount of home ownership, etc.--would comprise 20 \npercent, Voluntary agency assistance--a consideration of what the \nvolunteer and charitable groups are providing--would make up 5 percent, \nthe amount of Insurance coverage--20 percent, and the average amount of \nindividual assistance by State, which includes the per capita \nanalysis--would make up 5 percent of the analysis.\n  The bill also would add a seventh consideration to FEMA's metrics--\nthe economics of the area, which will receive 10 percent consideration. \nThis includes factors such as the local assessable tax base, the median \nincome as it compares to that of the state, and the poverty rate as it \ncompares to that of the state.\n  For Federal Public Assistance, the breakdown would be similar, with a \ngreater emphasis placed on the Localized Impacts of the disaster, which \nwould warrant 40 percent of the analysis.\n  It is reasonable that FEMA should take into consideration the size of \nthe state requesting assistance, but as the regulations stand, large \nstates are being penalized. Assigning values to the factors will help \nensure that the damage to the specific community weighs more than the \nstate's population. Illinois is a relatively large State, \ngeographically, and has a concentrated urban area. The State--\nparticularly downstate--is being punished for this fact.\n  If the Cities of Washington and Gifford, and Harrisburg and Ridgway, \ndo not qualify under FEMA's current criteria for federal assistance, \nsomething is wrong. This legislation is necessary because the way FEMA \nevaluates whether to declare an area a Federal disaster is not working. \nIt is done behind closed doors and it works against states with large \npopulations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 870\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the recognition of certain Native \ncommunities and the settlement of certain claims under the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to allow \nfive Southeast Alaska communities to finally be allowed to form urban \ncorporations under the terms of 1971's Alaska Native Claims Settlement \nAct, the Unrecognized Southeast Alaska Native Communities Recognition \nand Compensation Act. I am joined in sponsoring this bill by my Alaska \ncolleague, Senator Dan Sullivan.\n  At the very beginning of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of \n1971 there are a series of findings and declarations of congressional \npolicy that explain the underpinnings of this landmark legislation. The \nfirst clause reads: ``There is an immediate need for a fair and just \nsettlement of all claims by Natives and Native groups of Alaska, based \non aboriginal land claims.'' The second clause states: ``The settlement \nshould be accomplished rapidly, with certainty, in conformity with the \nreal economic and social needs of Natives.''\n  Unfortunately 44 years have passed since the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act became law and still the Native peoples of five \ncommunities in Southeast Alaska: Ketchikan, Wrangell, Petersburg, \nTenakee and Haines--the five ``landless communities''--are still \nwaiting for their fair and just settlement.\n  The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act originally awarded $966 \nmillion and 44 million acres of land to Alaska Natives and provided for \nthe establishment of Native Corporations to receive and manage such \nfunds and lands. The beneficiaries of the settlement were issued stock \nin one of 13 regional Alaska Native corporations--12 based in Alaska. \nMost beneficiaries also had the option to enroll and receive stock in a \nvillage or urban corporation or group.\n  For reasons that still defy explanation, the native peoples of the \n``landless communities,'' were not permitted by the Act to form village \nor urban corporations. These communities were excluded from this \nbenefit even though they did not differ significantly from other \ncommunities in Southeast Alaska that were permitted to form village or \nurban corporations under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. For \nexample, the Ketchikan area had more Native residents in 1970, than \nJuneau, which was permitted to form the Goldbelt urban corporation, or \nSitka that formed the Shee Atika urban corporation. This finding was \nconfirmed in a February 1994 report submitted to the Secretary of the \nInterior at the 1993 direction of Congress. That study was conducted by \nthe Institute of Social and Economic Research at the University of \nAlaska.\n  The native people of Southeast Alaska have recognized the injustice \nof this oversight for more than four decades. An independent study \nissued two decades ago confirms that the grievance of the landless \ncommunities is legitimate. Legislation has been introduced in the past \nsessions of Congress to remedy this injustice. Hearings have been held \nand reports written. Yet legislation to right the wrong has inevitably \nstalled out.\n  I am convinced that this cause is just, it is right, and it is about \ntime that the Native peoples of the five landless communities receive \nwhat has been denied to them for so long.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would enable the Native \npeoples of the five ``landless communities'' to organize five ``urban \ncorporations,'' one for each unrecognized community. These newly formed \ncorporations would be offered and could accept the surface estate to \n23,040 acres of land--one township as granted all other village \ncorporations in Southeast. Sealaska Corporation, the regional Alaska \nNative Corporation for Southeast Alaska, would receive title to the \nsubsurface estate to the designated lands. This version of the \nlegislation has been modified to guarantee that the lands to be \nconveyed may include subsistence sites, aquaculture sites, \nhydroelectric sites, tidelands, eco-tourism sites and surplus federal \nproperties to help satisfy any compensation requirement.\n  It is long past time that we return to the Native peoples of \nSoutheast Alaska a small slice of the aboriginal lands that were once \ntheirs alone.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Sullivan):\n  S. 873. A bill to designate the wilderness within the Lake Clark \nNational Park and Preserve in the State of Alaska as the Jay S. Hammond \nWilderness Area; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nrename a wilderness area in my home state of Alaska in honor of \nAlaska's fourth Governor, Jay S. Hammond. I am pleased that I am joined \nin sponsoring this bill by my Alaska colleague, Senator Dan Sullivan.\n  Jay Hammond is truly one of the unique figures in Alaska history. In \na state with many unique statesmen, Hammond is truly worthy of honor. A \nNew Yorker who first studied petroleum engineering at Penn State, he \nbecame a Marine fighter pilot who fought in World War II in the \nPacific/China with the famed Black Sheep Squadron. After the war he \nfound life on the East Coast too confining and flew an old plane to \nAlaska in 1946, never looking back. Initially a pilot to ``Bush'', \nremote rural parts of Alaska, he worked as a trapper, wildlife guide \nand laborer before heading back to college to gain a degree in \nbiological sciences in 1949 from the University of Alaska.\n  He then went to work as a wildlife biologist and hunter for the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service. By 1950 after conducting some of the first \nswan studies in northern Alaska, Jay Hammond was transferred to \nSouthwest Alaska where he conducted predator/prey studies on Alaska \nPeninsula caribou, flew fisheries enforcement flights out of Dillingham \nAlaska, and fell in love with Lake Clark and its surrounding \nwilderness, a 45-mile lake on the west side of Aleutian Range that he \nwould call home, besides a setnet salmon site at Naknek, for nearly 55 \nyears.\n  Mr. Hammond, upon Alaska entering the Union in 1959 ran and won \nelection to the Alaska State House of Representatives as an \nindependent, serving\n\n[[Page S2050]]\n\nthree terms before redeclaring himself as a Republican and serving two \nterms in the state Senate. He then served as mayor of the Bristol Bay \nBorough from 1972 to 1974, after serving as the borough's manager in \nthe 1960s and 1970s.\n  Mr. Hammond then was drafted to run for Governor of Alaska in 1974, \ndefeating the state's second Governor and former Secretary of the \nInterior Walter J. Hickel in the Republican Primary before defeating \nthe state's first Governor William A Egan in the general election. It \nwas an election dominated by Hammond's opposition to oil leasing in \nSouthcentral's Kachemak Bay, concern over the State of Alaska's salmon \nfisheries and fear over the state over spending soon after the \ndiscovery of oil on Alaska's North Slope.\n  Governor Hammond during his two terms oversaw construction of the \nTrans-Alaska oil Pipeline System, TAPS, championed creation of the \nAlaska Permanent Fund savings account, and was the author of the Alaska \nPermanent Fund Dividend program, which provides Alaskans a yearly \ndividend check from the interest earnings of the savings from a quarter \nof the State's petroleum revenues. He also won approval of a \nconstitutional budget reserve that was intended to reduce State \nspending, and championed agricultural development in Interior Alaska. \nHe also oversaw the state's purchase of the Alaska Railroad from the \nfederal government.\n  Hammond on environmental issues opposed construction of a proposed \nRamparts hydroelectric dam on the Yukon River, supported the \ncongressional creation of a 200-miles fisheries zone off the State's \ncoast that improved state fishery stocks, oversaw creation of a state \nlimited entry fisheries regime, oversaw the creation of the Nation's \nlargest State park, the Wood Tikchik State Park in Southwest Alaska, \nwhich contains 1.6 million acres of wilderness, and worked with \nCongress and observed congressional passage of the Alaska National \nInterest Lands Conservation Act in 1980 that replaced the designation \nof 120 million acres of Alaska into protected status under the federal \nAntiquities Act, while placing 104 million acres of new lands into \nnational parks, preserves, refuges, monuments, wilderness and wild and \nscenic river classifications. The law added 5.5 million acres of \nwilderness in 14 units in national forests, added more than 40 million \nacres in 10 new units to national parks, including the 3.86 million-\nacre Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, bringing to 54 million \nacres the total size of Federal park holdings in Alaska; added a number \nof new wildlife refuges in Alaska, bringing to 19 the number of refuges \ncovering 76.8 million acres in the State; and created 13 wild and \nscenic rivers running 3,131 miles. The act created 57.9 million acres \nof formal wilderness in the State, Alaska containing about 60 percent \nof the nation's total formal wilderness.\n  Mr. Hammond was also a talented and prolific writer and poet, \npresenting to the University of Alaska Library Archives an impressive \ncollection of speeches, testimony, notebooks and papers. He also wrote \nseveral books on life in Alaska, led by his first book, ``Tales of \nAlaska's Bush Rat Governor.'' He died on Aug. 2, 2005, at age 83 in his \nsleep at his homestead near Port Alsworth, Alaska, having survived five \nplane crashes and innumerable close calls during his first flight to \nAlaska and in fighting a fire at his home at Lake Clark, and over the \nfollowing 59 years in the State. He was survived by his wife, Bella and \ndaughters Heidi and Dana.\n  Jay Hammond was well-respected for reaching across the aisle to forge \nbipartisan alliances and enjoyed many close friendships with colleagues \nin both political parties and with his staff, who were deeply loyal to \nhim. The designation of the 2.6 million acres of already created \nwilderness in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, where his \nhomestead lies, will honor Jay Hammond and will be a fitting tribute to \nhis honorable life and legacy, a man that the Anchorage Municipal \nAssembly on August 7, 2005, called, ``the finest example of a true \npublic servant. There are few men who have influence through their \nquiet articulation of what is right and fair in the way of Jay \nHammond.''\n  I hope for quick passage of this bill prior to the anniversary of \neither his birthday or the date of the tenth anniversary of this death. \nHe was creative, funny, thoughtful, respectful, wise and courageous and \ntruly deserves this honor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 882. A bill to amend part A of title II of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we rely on our public schools to prepare the \nnext generation for success as citizens, workers, and innovators. We \nhave asked educators to raise the bar and educate all students to \ninternationally competitive college and career-ready standards. To \nachieve these goals, we need to establish a comprehensive system of \neducator preparation and support that ensures that new educators are \nprofession-ready and that provides for their growth and development \nover the course of their careers.\n  Today, I am pleased to join Senator Casey in introducing the Better \nEducation Support and Training, BEST Act to reform induction, \nprofessional development, and systems for professional growth and \nimprovement for teachers, librarians, and principals currently on the \njob, updating the Effective Teaching and Leading Act that I introduced \nlast Congress. The BEST Act will strengthen Title II, Part A, of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act to ensure that formula grant \nfunds support the goal of all students having equitable access to \nprofession-ready and effective educators. The BEST Act will ensure that \nall educators on the instructional team--teachers, principals, \ncounselors, librarians, and other specialized instructional support \npersonnel--collaborate and are prepared and supported in helping \nstudents achieve and grow. It will offer induction and mentoring \nprograms for new educators; personalized, job-embedded professional \ndevelopment, and career pathways and leadership roles for teachers and \nother educators.\n  In the coming weeks, I will be reintroducing legislation to address \nthe front end of the educator pipeline--the Educator Preparation Reform \nAct. This legislation builds on the success of the Teacher Quality \nPartnership Program, which I helped author in the 1998 reauthorization \nof the Higher Education Act.\n  Together, these two bills will modernize Federal policy for education \npreparation and development to create a continuum of support for \nprofessional educators throughout their careers. They provide a \nblueprint for reauthorizing Title II of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act and Title II of the Higher Education Act. Over the years, \nI have been fortunate to work with many stakeholders on these bills, \nincluding the Coalition for Teaching Quality, representing over 100 \nnational, State, and local organizations.\n  I look forward to working to incorporate these bills into the \nupcoming reauthorizations of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nand the Higher Education Act, and I urge our colleagues to join in this \neffort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2050-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2050-S2052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 116--PROVIDING FOR FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS IN BURMA\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Menendez, and Mr. Rubio) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S.

Article 354, which \n     limits certain freedoms that contradict laws ``enacted for \n     Union security, prevalence of law and order, community peace \n     and tranquility or public order and morality''; and Article \n     436, which subjects Constitutional amendments to a 75 percent \n     vote threshold in parliament (thereby confirming the \n     Tatmadaw's veto power);\n       Whereas the NLD Central Executive Committee released a \n     statement on January 13, 2015, expressing concern with the \n     stall of democratic transition and reforms in Burma, and \n     identifying the following conditions as prerequisites for \n     free and fair general elections: constitutional amendments \n     ``in line with the desire of the people'';

If Myanmar is serious about \n     transitioning to democracy, it must be serious about allowing \n     persons affected by its actions to express their frustrations \n     without being punished.'';\n       Whereas the Government of Burma responded to the various \n     concerns raised by the Special Rapporteur with accusations of \n     interference in Burma's internal affairs, and pointedly \n     failed to criticize slanderous comments made by a Buddhist \n     nationalist monk who called the Special Rapporteur a \n     ``bitch'' and ``whore'';\n       Whereas the United States Permanent Representative to the \n     United Nations Samantha Power stated in Louisville, Kentucky \n     on January 12, 2015, ``Burma is still a long way from being a \n     rights-respecting democracy.

Yet virtually no one has been held accountable, and the \n     humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate.'';\n       Whereas the Government of Burma, under the direction and \n     leadership of President Thein Sein, submitted draft \n     legislation to parliament that seeks to stigmatize and \n     discriminate against religious minorities in Burma through \n     coercive population control, marriage restrictions, and anti-\n     conversion methods that violate established international \n     human rights norms and instruments to which Burma is a party;\n       Whereas Ambassador Power reaffirmed, ``Our tools include \n     incentivizing continued progress, shining a bright light on \n     the government's shortcoming, and imposing targeted sanctions \n     on individuals who stand in the way of change.'';\n       Whereas President Barack Obama stated during his visit to \n     Burma on November 14, 2014, that the United States expects \n     elections in Burma ``to take place on time. We do not want to \n     see delays, because it's time for the voice of the people of \n     Burma to be heard in a fair, free, and transparent manner . . \n     . the constitution amendment process needs to reflect \n     inclusion rather than exclusion, that there are certain \n     provisions in the Burmese constitution that objectively don't \n     make much sense.''; and\n       Whereas internationally recognized standards of free and \n     fair elections include: the right of adult citizens to \n     register and vote in elections, without discrimination; equal \n     opportunity for individuals to stand as candidates, form \n     political parties, and conduct campaign and civic education \n     activities free from interference and intimidation;

and\n       (C) express solidarity with the United Nations special \n     mechanisms that are investigating and protesting against \n     violations of human rights in Burma, and to express concern \n     regarding the Government of Burma's refusal to work \n     cooperatively with such mechanisms;\n       (3) calls upon the United States Government, in partnership \n     with other international donors, to ensure that the \n     Government of Burma and the Union Election Commission \n     function in an independent, fair, and impartial manner \n     throughout the preparation and conduct of elections in Burma, \n     and that the Tatmadaw publicly affirms in advance that it \n     will honor the results of such elections;\n       (4) expects the President to delay further steps toward \n     normalization of relations with Burma, including immediately \n     suspending all military-to-military engagement with the \n     Tatmadaw, should the Government of Burma, including the \n     Tatmadaw and any of its affiliates, undermine the prospects \n     for free and fair elections in Burma;\n       (5) expects the President to take additional actions to \n     sanction specific individuals within the Government of Burma \n     whom the President determines undermine free and fair \n     elections in Burma, including through the denial of visas and \n     freezing of assets of such individuals, as appropriate;\n       (6) calls upon the President and the Secretary of State to \n     take action to ensure that ethnic groups in Burma are not \n     coerced, in any way or by any means, into ceasefire \n     agreements with the Government of Burma;\n       (7) calls upon the Secretary of State to work with like-\n     minded regional and international governments to ensure that \n     the general elections in Burma meet international standards \n     of free and fair elections, including by ensuring that \n     international and domestic monitors have full and unimpeded \n     access to all aspects of the electoral process; and\n       (8) calls upon the Secretary of State to publicly and \n     forcefully condemn human rights abuses committed by the \n     Tatmadaw and to demand credible and independent \n     investigations and prosecutions of any and all allegations of \n     such abuse, including with respect to--\n       (A) the January 19, 2015, rape and murder by the Tatmadaw \n     of two Kachin volunteer schoolteachers in Northern Shan \n     State;\n       (B) the December 22, 2014, murder of Daw Khin Win, a \n     nonviolent protestor at the Letpadaung mine site;\n       (C) the November 19, 2014, killing of 23 cadets in Laiza, \n     Kachin State, by the Tatmadaw's shelling;\n       (D) the October 4, 2014, murder of Ko Par Gyi in Mon State, \n     a freelance journalist and\n\n[[Page S2052]]\n\n     former body guard of opposition political leader Aung San Suu \n     Kyi;

Whereas at the age of 10, Cesar Estrada Chavez joined the \n     thousands of migrant farm workers laboring in fields and \n     vineyards throughout the Southwest after a bank foreclosure \n     resulted in the loss of the family farm;\n\n[[Page S2054]]\n\n       Whereas Cesar Estrada Chavez, after attending more than 30 \n     elementary and middle schools and achieving an eighth grade \n     education, left school to work full time as a farm worker to \n     help support his family;\n       Whereas at the age of 17, Cesar Estrada Chavez entered the \n     United States Navy and served

in the vineyards of central California;\n       Whereas Cesar Estrada Chavez and Helen Fabela had 8 \n     children;\n       Whereas as early as 1949, Cesar Estrada Chavez was \n     committed to organizing farm workers to campaign for safe and \n     fair working conditions, reasonable wages, livable housing, \n     and outlawing child labor;\n       Whereas in 1952, Cesar Estrada Chavez

Res. 128\n\n       Whereas colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of \n     cancer death among men and women combined in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas in 2015, more than 130,000 individuals in the \n     United States will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer and \n     approximately 50,000 more will die from it;\n       Whereas colorectal cancer is 1 of the most preventable \n     forms of cancer because screening tests can find polyps that \n     can be removed before becoming cancerous;\n       Whereas screening tests can detect colorectal cancer early, \n     which is when treatment works best;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     estimates that if every individual aged 50 or older had \n     regular screening tests, as many as 60 percent of deaths from \n     colorectal cancer could be prevented;\n       Whereas the 5-year survival rate for patients with \n     localized colorectal cancer is 90 percent, but only 39 \n     percent of all diagnoses occur at that stage;\n       Whereas colorectal cancer screenings can effectively reduce \n     the incidence of colorectal cancer and mortality, but 1 in 3 \n     adults between the ages of 50 and 75 are not up to date with \n     recommended colorectal cancer screening;\n       Whereas public awareness and education campaigns on \n     colorectal cancer prevention, screening, and symptoms are \n     held during the month of March each year; and\n       Whereas educational efforts can help provide to the public \n     information on methods of prevention and screening, as well \n     as symptoms for early detection: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the designation of March 2015, as ``National \n     Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month'' and the goals and ideals \n     of that Month; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the month with appropriate awareness and educational \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/26/senate-section/article/S2055-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 129--DESIGNATING MAY 4, 2015, AS NATIONAL FOOD \n      PROTEIN-INDUCED ENTEROCOLITIS SYNDROME (FPIES) AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. BOOKER (for himself and Mr. Toomey) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 130\n\n       Whereas the Vietnam War was fought in the Republic of South \n     Vietnam from 1961 to 1975, and involved North Vietnamese \n     regular forces and Viet Cong guerrilla forces in armed \n     conflict with United States Armed Forces, allies of the \n     United States, and the armed forces of the Republic of \n     Vietnam;\n       Whereas the United States Armed Forces became involved in \n     Vietnam because the United States Government wanted to \n     provide direct military support to the Government of South \n     Vietnam to defend itself against the growing Communist threat \n     from North Vietnam;\n       Whereas members of the United States Armed Forces began \n     serving in an advisory role to the Government of the Republic \n     of South Vietnam in 1950;\n       Whereas as a result of the Gulf of Tonkin incidents on \n     August 2 and 4, 1964, Congress overwhelmingly passed the Gulf \n     of Tonkin Resolution (Public Law 88-408), on August 7, 1964, \n     which provided the authority to the President of the United \n     States to prosecute the war against North Vietnam;\n       Whereas in 1965, United States Armed Forces ground combat \n     units arrived in Vietnam;\n       Whereas by September 1965, there were over 129,000 United \n     States troops in Vietnam, and by 1969, a peak of \n     approximately 543,000 troops was reached;\n       Whereas on January 27, 1973, the Agreement Ending the War \n     and Restoring Peace in Vietnam (commonly known as the ``Paris \n     Peace Accords'') was signed, which required\n\n[[Page S2056]]\n\n     the release of all United States prisoners-of-war held in \n     North Vietnam and the withdrawal of all United States Armed \n     Forces from South Vietnam;\n       Whereas on March 29, 1973, the United States Armed Forces \n     completed the withdrawal of combat units and combat support \n     units from South Vietnam;\n       Whereas on April 30, 1975, North Vietnamese regular forces \n     captured Saigon, the capitol of South Vietnam, effectively \n     placing South Vietnam under Communist control;\n       Whereas more than 58,000 members of the United States Armed \n     Forces lost their lives in Vietnam and more than 300,000 \n     members of the Armed Forces were wounded;\n       Whereas in 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was \n     dedicated in the District of Columbia to commemorate those \n     members of the United States Armed Forces who died or were \n     declared missing-in-action in Vietnam;\n       Whereas the Vietnam War was an extremely divisive issue \n     among the people of the United States and a conflict that \n     caused a generation of veterans to wait too long for the \n     United States public to acknowledge and honor the efforts and \n     services of such veterans;\n       Whereas members of the United States Armed Forces who \n     served bravely and faithfully for the United States during \n     the Vietnam War were often wrongly criticized for the policy \n     decisions made by 4 presidential administrations in the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas designating March 29, 2015, as ``Vietnam Veterans \n     Day'' would be an appropriate way to honor those members of \n     the United States Armed Forces who served in South Vietnam \n     and throughout Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 29, 2015, as ``Vietnam Veterans Day'';\n       (2) honors and recognizes the contributions of veterans who \n     served in the United States Armed Forces in Vietnam during \n     war and during peace;\n       (3) encourages States and local governments to designate \n     March 29, 2015, as ``Vietnam Veterans Day'';
