Mr. President, the bipartisan FAA Reauthorization Act \nis the product of a collaborative committee process in the Senate that \nis back to work. It was guided and informed by a series of substantive \ncommittee hearings. It contains ideas from committee members on both \nsides of the aisle, and because both Republicans and Democrats were \ngiven a stake in the outcome, it passed the Commerce Committee on a \nvoice vote.\n  Senator Thune is the chair of that committee and Senator Ayotte is \nthe chair of the committee's aviation panel. We recognize key players \nlike these for their many months of hard work, hearings, and \ncollaboration. We recognize the ranking members, Senators Nelson and \nCantwell, and committee members from both sides for their contributions \nas well.\n  The bipartisan FAA Reauthorization Act will support American jobs and \nhelp American manufacturing. It will improve safety in the skies and \nsecurity in our airports. It contains commonsense reforms for \npassengers too. In fact, a consumer columnist for the Washington Post \ndubbed it ``one of the most passenger-friendly FAA reauthorization \nbills in a generation.'' For instance, to the extent an airline charges \nfees for things such as baggage or cancellations or changes, this bill \nwill help ensure they provide it in a clear, standard format that \npeople can actually understand. It will allow passengers to get refunds \nfor services they purchased but didn't receive, like when they have \nbeen charged a bag fee and the bag doesn't make it. It will give \npassengers more peace of mind when they travel, directing the FAA to \nupdate the contents of the onboard emergency medical kits, and it will \nmaintain rural access in States like Kentucky.\n  The bipartisan FAA Reauthorization Act achieves all of this without \nimposing the kind of overregulation that takes away choices from \nconsumers and threatens service. It does everything I mentioned without \nraising taxes or fees on travelers. It is a balanced bill, but that \ndoesn't mean some colleagues won't have ideas or amendments they would \nlike to have considered. For instance, in the wake of incidents like we \nsaw in Brussels, I know some have expressed interest in security-\nrelated amendments. But in order to even have an opportunity to work \nthrough additional ideas or amendments, we must first get on the bill. \nAfter talking to the Democratic leader, I am optimistic we will do that \nin a few hours.\n  If colleagues are serious about having the opportunity for amendments \nof any kind, here is what it means today: Let's continue doing our job. \nWe will\n\n[[Page S1680]]\n\nvote today to get on the bill, and we will move ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/06/senate-section/article/S1680-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REGULATION ON RETIREMENT SAVINGS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today the administration will unveil a \nset of regulations many believe will make it harder for lower to \nmiddle-class families to save for retirement. The regulation has been a \nlong time coming, and there will be changes made from what was \ninitially proposed. However, the fundamentals are likely to remain the \nsame.\n  If that is the case, here is what we can safely say. Some have \nestimated that investment fees could more than double under this \nregulation. Here is what that could mean: access to critical retirement \nadvice for those who can afford it and restricted access to affordable \nadvice, and fewer retirement savings as a result, for too many lower \nand middle-class Americans.\n  It sounds a lot like ObamaCare. Here is why. Like ObamaCare, it \nthreatens to upend an entire industry, threatens to increase costs and \ndecrease access, and it threatens to hurt the very people it is aimed \nat helping. This regulation could have the effect of discouraging \ninvestment advisers from taking on clients with smaller accounts. What \nthat means is that smaller savers, everyday Americans trying to plan \nfor their future, could have less access to sound investment advice. \nOne report projects the rule could cost middle-class families $80 \nbillion in lost savings over the next decade.\n  I have already heard from Kentuckians who fear the negative \nrepercussions this rule could have. For example, one financial adviser \nin my State shared with me his concerns about how the rule, as \nproposed, could impact his clients. There is the single mom with a \ndaughter in college who fears she could see significant investment fee \nincreases under the rule--increases she simply cannot afford. There is \nalso the small business which could have a harder time accessing \ninvestment advice, potentially leading it to stop offering retirement \nplans to employees all together, and retirees living off their \nlifesavings could see reductions in their fixed income because of \npotential increases in investment costs.\n  From its initial proposal at a campaign-style event to its rollout \ntoday, this regulation seems to have always been more about politics \nthan good policy. According to a report released by the Senate Homeland \nand Governmental Affairs Committee chairman, the administration seems \nto have ``disregarded . . . concerns and declined to implement \nrecommendations'' from career, nonpartisan staff and government \nofficials. Chairman Johnson's report goes on to say that the \nadministration ``frequently prioritized the expeditious completion of \nthe rulemaking process at the expense of thoughtful deliberation.''\n  America's middle class deserves responsible solutions, not far-\nreaching regulations that could jeopardize the retirement security of \nthe very people it purports to help.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/06/senate-section/article/S1680-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We are going to proceed to this legislation. We should know in a \nfew hours how much of the postcloture time will have to be used. I hope \nnot very much. I hope we can get right to offering amendments.\n  As the Republican leader said, Senators Nelson and Thune will manage \nthis bill and the committee did a good job. There are airport security \nmeasures in the bill. I think we need to do more, but what they did is \ncertainly a step in the right direction, so there will be amendments \ndealing with airport security coming from our side. There could be some \nother amendments, but we will see. I do hope we can yield back whatever \ntime is left on the motion to proceed to the bill. I hope we can do \nthat no later than this afternoon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/06/senate-section/article/S1680-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RULE ON INVESTMENTS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, yesterday the assistant Republican leader \nmade an interesting statement as he spoke to reporters just off the \nSenate floor. This is what he said and I quote: ``Even though this is \nan election year, it is no excuse for not getting the people's work \ndone.'' We all agree. On this side of the aisle, we all agree.\n  Even though this is an election year, it is no excuse for not getting \nthe people's work done. I didn't write that for the Republican whip, \nbut I couldn't have done any better had I tried to write it. That is \nwhy Senate Republicans should put aside election year politics and do \ntheir job regarding President Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court, \nJudge Garland, hopefully to be Justice Garland soon. And what is that \njob? As the Republican leader said a decade ago, and I quote:\n\n       Our job is to react to the nomination in a respectful and \n     dignified way, and at the end of the process to give that \n     person an up-or-down vote as all nominees who have majority \n     support have gotten through the history of the country. It's \n     not our job to determine who ought to be picked.\n\n  So says the senior Senator from Kentucky. By the Republican leader's \nown admission, our job is to carry out a respectful nomination process. \nThat means hearings, and at the end of the process we must give the \nnominee an up-or-down vote. That is our job, and we should do it.\n  Will the Chair announce what the Senate is going to be doing for the \nremainder of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/06/senate-section/article/S1680-6", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, for weeks now we have seen Democratic \nSenators come to the floor and attack the chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. The tone of these attacks against Senator Grassley \nhave been vicious and they have been very personal. I believe Democrats \nhave embarrassed themselves, and they have done a disservice to their \nconstituents and to the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Grassley is an outstanding public servant. He has been \nrelentless in representing the interests and the views of the people of \nhis home State of Iowa. He has not missed a vote in 27 years. He holds \ntownhall meetings in every one of Iowa's 99 counties every\n\n[[Page S1681]]\n\nsingle year. That is how seriously Chuck Grassley takes his \nresponsibility to serve and to represent the people of his home State. \nEvery other Member of this body should be trying to copy his example, \nnot coming to the floor to criticize him or take cheap shots, as the \nDemocrats have been doing in an attempt for political gain.\n  What Senator Grassley wants should be the same thing all of us want \nwhen it comes to momentous decisions--decisions like who will have a \nlifetime appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States. He \nwants to give the people a voice. That is what Senator Grassley wants \nfor the people of Iowa, and that is what I want for the people of \nWyoming.\n  Senator Enzi and I had a telephone townhall meeting last month, \ntalking to people around the State of Wyoming. The great majority of \nthe folks in Wyoming agree with Senator Grassley, agree with Senator \nEnzi, and agree with me about the next Supreme Court Justice and giving \nthe people a voice. This isn't just something that Republicans are \nmaking up because we don't like this nominee, although there is plenty \nnot to like; it is what past chairmen of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nhave done, Democrats as well as Republicans.\n  In 1992 Senator Joe Biden--now Vice President Joe Biden, but then \nSenator Joe Biden--came to the Senate floor to explain his rule, called \nthe Biden rule, and it had to do with Supreme Court nominations. On \nthis Senate floor, Joe Biden said that once the Presidential election \nis underway, ``action on a Supreme Court nomination must be put off \nuntil after the election campaign is over.'' That is what Vice \nPresident Joe Biden said when he was a Senator. Those are Joe Biden's \nwords--former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is the \nsame position Senator Chuck Grassley currently holds. Senator Biden at \nthe time said the temporary vacancy on the Court was ``quite minor''--\n``quite minor,'' he said--``compared to the cost that a nominee, the \npresident, the Senate, and our nation would have to pay for what would \nassuredly be a bitter fight.''\n  Senator Biden was one of the Democrats who voted to filibuster Samuel \nAlito's nomination to the Supreme Court. So was Senator Pat Leahy, who \nonce also chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator Obama and \nSenator Harry Reid--that is right, Barack Obama, currently President of \nthe United States, then-Senator Obama, and Senator Harry Reid, once \nmajority leader, now minority leader--voted for that filibuster.\n  Back in 2005, when Senator Reid was the Democratic leader, he said: \n``Nowhere in [the Constitution] does it say the Senate has a duty to \ngive presidential nominees a vote.'' Senator Reid even went so far as \nto unilaterally change the rules of the Senate on nominations a few \nyears ago. He was in the majority then; now he is in the minority.\n  That is what Democrats have done and what they have said about things \nlike nominations to the Supreme Court and other important jobs for the \ncountry.\n  We have elections in this country for a reason--it is so we can hear \ndirectly from the people what they think and how they want us to act on \ntheir behalf.\n  In 2014, the American people rejected the path the Democrats in \nWashington were taking. They put Republicans in charge of the House and \nthe Senate because they wanted us to act as a check and a balance on \nwhat President Obama was doing. Democrats want to ignore the will of \nthe people on this Supreme Court nomination.\n  The President wants to say it is his decision and his alone. Well, it \nis not just his decision. Now that the election season is upon us, it \nshould be the people's decision. Republicans understand that, Senator \nGrassley clearly understands that, and Democrats actually used to \nunderstand it. We need to give the people a voice.\n\n\n                          Energy Industry Jobs\n\n  Mr. President, I would also like to speak briefly about something \ngoing on in my home State of Wyoming. Late last week, two of our \nState's largest coal mines announced they would let go 15 percent of \ntheir workers--465 families now living with the terrible pain of loss \nof a job. Wyoming has seen thousands of hard-working men and women lose \ntheir jobs in the energy industry over the past few years, people \nworking in oil, gas, and coal.\n  Democrats in Washington should never forget that the regulations they \nand this administration impose have real impact on real people. When \nMembers of the Congress focus obsessively--and it is a misguided \nobsession--on ideas like climate change, they do grave damage to the \nhard-working families all across this country who are trying to provide \nenergy for America and provide for their families.\n  When Democratic Presidential candidates say they want to keep our \nresources in the ground, they send shock waves through communities that \ndepend on energy jobs. When the Obama administration promotes green \nenergy at any cost, it does great harm to Americans who are working to \nproduce red, white, and blue energy. Seven years of overregulation has \ntaken its toll on coal country. The Obama administration has taken away \nthese people's jobs, and now it is trying to take away their dignity \nbecause a person's job is related to their identity and dignity in so \nmany ways.\n  My goal is to make American energy as clean as we can, as fast as we \ncan, without raising costs and causing pain to American families. That \nmeans investing in new ways to develop Wyoming's incredible energy \nresources and finding new markets for those resources. Energy is known \nas the master resource. It is the master resource for a reason, and \nAmerica provides and produces the energy we need for a strong economy \nas well as a healthy environment. There are bipartisan ideas and bills \nhere in the Senate to help us do both. We should never give up on that \ngoal.\n  American energy production has powered our economic recovery and has \nbeen the workhorse for the American economy for the last 7 years \nthrough the economic recovery. It is time for us here in the Senate, \nhere in the country, certainly here in Washington, to return that favor \nand to help get these Americans back to work.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to tell a story \nabout how a distinguished naval career was ruined by abuse of suspected \nwhistleblowers. The end result is a mixed bag of good and bad.\n  In doing oversight of the Defense Department whistleblower cases, I \nhave learned a difficult lesson. As hard as we may try, whistleblower \ncases rarely have good outcomes. Now, true, a wrong may be made right, \na measure of justice may have been meted out, but the victims--the \nwhistleblowers--have been left out in the cold. They may never get the \nremedy they seek and deserve.\n  At the center of this case is an honored naval officer, RADM Brian L. \nLosey. He can only blame himself for what happened. No matter how you \ncut it, though, the destruction of a distinguished military career--\nespecially one devoted to hazardous duty in Special Operations--is very \nunfortunate and very sad as well. Yet that is accountability's harsh \nreality. This admiral allegedly broke the law and must now pay the \nprice.\n  In the end, under pressure from several quarters, Secretary of the \nNavy Ray Mabus was forced to deny Admiral Losey his second star. This \npromotion was hanging fire for 5 long years, mostly because of ongoing \ninvestigations. Admiral Losey had allegedly retaliated against several \nwhistleblowers.\n  If the Secretary of the Navy and the Navy's top brass had their way, \nAdmiral Losey would be wearing that second star today, but late last \nyear it got tossed into a boiling cauldron. Mounting opposition was \ncoming from four different directions.\n  First, on November 13 of last year, after learning about the \ncontroversy, a bipartisan group of Senators weighed in with a request \nfor all the reports on the Losey matter. The requests came from \nSenators Wyden, Kirk, Boxer, Johnson, Markey, McCaskill, and Baldwin, \nalong with this Senator from Iowa. We happen to be members of the \nWhistleblower Protection Caucus. Other Senators also made similar \nrequests for those reports.\n  The second operation. On December 2, 2015, we received four of the \nfive Department of Defense Office of Inspector General reports on that \ninvestigation. One is still being reviewed, and I will tell you about \nthat particular report in a minute.\n  In reviewing these documents, we quickly realized that Admiral Losey \nappeared to be a serial retaliator of whistleblowers. The evidence was \noverwhelming. He allegedly broke the law.\n  It all began in July 2011 at the Norfolk naval base Travel Office. \nThere was a minor dispute over who should pay for his daughter's \nairline ticket to Germany. As a Coast Guard Academy cadet, that \ndaughter was not entitled to travel as a dependent at taxpayers' \nexpense. Although Admiral Losey, his wife, and staff allegedly \n``pestered'' the Travel Office to pay for the ticket, Admiral Losey \neventually purchased it with his own money. Nonetheless, this incident \ntriggered a hotline complaint on July 13, 2011. Admiral Losey was \ninformed of the complaint 2 months later, and then from that point it \nwas all downhill.\n  After learning of the anonymous hotline tip, Admiral Losey was \nreportedly ``livid.'' He saw it as an act of disloyalty and ``a \nconspiracy to undermine his command.'' He reportedly developed a list \nof suspects and began a punitive hunt for more. Reports indicate he was \ndetermined to find out who blew the whistle, and when he did, he \nallegedly said he ``would cut the head off this snake and end this.''\n  So in his drive to root out moles, he created a toxic environment in \nhis command. His seemingly reckless behavior and blatant disregard for \nthe law and well-being of his subordinates led to his downfall. The end \nresult of the admiral's misguided search for moles was a series of \nreprisals against suspected--just suspected--whistleblowers.\n  His choice of suspects was gravely mistaken. No one, in fact, had \nblown the whistle. Yet each was allegedly subjected to adverse \npersonnel action at his direction and with his concurrence. His targets \nwere mostly senior members of his command staff at Stuttgart, Germany. \nThe person who actually blew the whistle worked at the Travel Office in \nNorfolk, VA. Clearly, this was a case of misdirected retaliation, which \nmakes his alleged abuses even more egregious.\n  As soon as Senators finished reviewing these reports and started \nasking pointed questions, the Navy knew the watchdogs were on the case. \nThe Navy brass went to general quarters. According to reports in the \nWashington Post, the top brass turned up the pressure. They arbitrarily \ndismissed the inspector general's findings and put the promotion on a \nfast track.\n  Now for the third part of this story. My good friend from Oregon, \nSenator Ron Wyden, on December 18 of last year, upset the apple cart. \nHe placed a hold on the pending nomination for a new Under Secretary of \nthe Navy, Dr. Davidson. His hold was not directed at Dr. Davidson; \ninstead, it was directed at Admiral Losey's pending promotion. He had \ngrave concerns about revelations in the inspector general's reports. \nHis hold restored much needed leverage lost when the Senate confirmed \nthe admiral's promotion in December 2011. He wanted the Secretary of \nthe Navy to reconsider the promotion. So I commend my friend from \nOregon for taking this action because it was an immediate game-changer.\n  Fourth, on January 14, 2016, there came a bolt out of the blue. The \nSenate Committee on Armed Services fired a shot across the bow that \nstopped the Navy dead in the water. The committee's letter to the \nSecretary of the Navy began with this damaging assessment. After \nreviewing the investigative reports, we--meaning the committee--\n``maintain deep reservations'' about Admiral Losey's ability to \nsuccessfully perform as a two-star admiral. This was the death knell, \nbut the committee's condemnation didn't end there. If it had known in \n2011 what it knew in January of this year, the committee said it would \nnever have confirmed Admiral Losey's nomination in the first place. The \ninspector general's damaging investigative reports had turned its \nearlier assessment upside down. The committee then very much slammed \nthe door shut.\n  The committee urged the Secretary of the Navy to use his authority to \ndeny the promotion. There was no gentle nudge. This letter effectively \nended Admiral Losey's career. The Secretary of the Navy had run out of \noptions. The Secretary had to do what he had to do. The committee of \njurisdiction had laid down the law. The admiral should not be promoted. \nEnd of story. Admiral Losey will now step down as leader of the Naval \nSpecial War Command and retire.\n  The committee's groundbreaking letter was signed by Chairman McCain \nand Ranking Member Reed, and what is important about this letter is \nthat it is a very sharp departure from actions taken by past Armed \nServices Committees in questioning a lot of these things that go on in \nthe Defense Department. During the course of my oversight work, I have \nhad several beefs with this committee over issues exactly like this. \nAll were about the need to hold senior officers accountable for alleged\n\n[[Page S1683]]\n\nmisconduct based on evidence in inspector general reports. The response \nback then was very different from what I see of the work of the \ncommittee today.\n  I see this letter as a breakthrough. I see it as a masterpiece. I am \nproud of the Committee on Armed Services. This about-face came under \nnew leadership, and I hope it signals the dawning of a bright new day. \nSo it shouldn't surprise anyone that I would thank Chairman McCain and \nthank Ranking Member Reed from the bottom of my heart for this \noutstanding leadership. Their actions send a message to whistleblowers: \nReprisals will not be tolerated. That is a real morale booster for all \nwhistleblowers suffering under the weight of reprisals.\n  From what I know about whistleblowers, most of them are very \npatriotic people. They just want the government to follow the law and \nspend the money appropriately. They just want the government to do what \nthe government is supposed to do. When they see it isn't being done, \nand they work up the chain of command but do not see any changes, then \nthey come to Members of the Senate and the Congress. So I thank them \nagain for having the courage to do the right thing. Holding such a \ndistinguished naval officer accountable was no easy task. To the \ncontrary, it was as difficult as they get.\n  Mr. President, now that the question of the admiral's promotion has \nbeen laid to rest, I would like to turn to that unfinished business I \nearlier referred to. The true scope of the admiral's retaliation \nactions is still being examined because there is a fifth report out \nthere. The focus of the fifth and final report of the Losey \ninvestigation is more like a phantom than a real report.\n\n  Over 1,150 days have passed since this investigation began, and it is \nstill not finished. It should be a piece of cake. The cast of \ncharacters, the facts, the evidence, and the findings should be \nessentially the same as in other Losey reports published long ago.\n  So I ask: What is really going on here? I have received several \nanonymous tips. What I hear is very disturbing. This report is \nallegedly being doctored, causing bitter internal dispute over across \nthe river. On one side are the investigators just doing their job. They \nappear--as we would expect--to be guided by the evidence. On the other \nside is top management at the Defense Department. They appear very \neager to line up with the Navy's decision to arbitrarily dismiss \nevidence.\n  From the get-go, the findings in the draft report substantiated \nreprisal allegations against Admiral Losey--consistent with the other \nreports. Top management initially concurred with those findings. So \nthen, what is wrong? Why not issue the report?\n  However, in response to alleged pressure from the Secretary of the \nNavy's office, they caved and agreed to take Losey out of the report. \nHow could they get such a bad case of weak knees? The evidence staring \nthem in the face seems irrefutable--rock solid. Plus, it was just \nreaffirmed by an unlikely source--the U.S. Air Force.\n  Because two Air Force officers were allegedly involved, the Air Force \nhad to conduct its own review. The Air Force also found the evidence \nvery compelling. As a result, the Air Force officer--who was Admiral \nLosey's command attorney--reportedly faces potential legal trouble. He \nallegedly facilitated the admiral's retaliatory actions against the \nwhistleblowers. The other officer will retire.\n  Despite the red flags and the need for caution, caution has been \ntossed to the wind. On March 31, 2015, Deputy Inspector General \nMarguerite Garrison gave the Navy a green light to proceed. She \nnotified Admiral Losey by letter that he ``was no longer a subject of \nthe investigation.'' How could she do such a thing with all the \nevidence that is already out there in the other four reports and what \nwe think we know in this report that is not public?\n  At that point in time, Admiral Losey's alleged retaliation was the \ncenterpiece of the report. True, it was a draft report in the midst of \nreview. True, there were questions about Admiral Losey's role. Yet, \nafter the passage of 1 year, the dispute remains unresolved. The report \nis still in draft and, obviously, mired in controversy.\n  I think this all shows that there is something rotten at the \nPentagon. To send such a letter, which was inconsistent with the \nevidence in an unfinished report, seems inappropriate. The Garrison \nletter set the stage for what has followed, and I will tell you what \nfollowed.\n  To conform to the Garrison letter, the findings in the draft report \nhad to be allegedly changed from ``substantiated'' to ``not \nsubstantiated.'' The investigators, thank God, dug in their heels and \nstood their ground. The evidence was apparently on their side.\n  In early December of last year, as the Losey promotion issue reached \na critical juncture, top management allegedly ``directed'' the \ninvestigators to change the report's findings from ``substantiated'' to \n``not substantiated.'' The investigators were also allegedly directed \nto change facts and evidence to fit the desired findings. In other \nwords, key pieces of evidence had to be allegedly ``removed'' to ensure \nthat the evidence presented in the report was aligned with the \nspecified conclusions.\n  These are very serious allegations. Deliberately falsifying \ninformation in an official report constitutes a potential violation of \nlaw. If the directed rewrite of this report really happened, and if it \nis allowed to stand, it could undermine the integrity of the whole \ninvestigative process.\n  The new acting Defense Department inspector general, Mr. Glenn Fine, \nwhom I know from a similar position in the Justice Department to be a \npretty good inspector general, needs to grab the bull by the horns in \nthis case, and he has the authority to do it.\n  He needs to call the top officials involved on the carpet. This would \ninclude Mrs. Garrison, her deputy, Director Nilgun Tolek, and Deputy \nDirector Michael Shanker. The IG needs to ask them to explain and \njustify their actions. Next, he needs to ask the investigators to \npresent their side of the story. Then, he needs to weigh independently \nand objectively the evidence and figure out what needs to be done to \nget this solved and get this report out. I think Mr. Fine has the \ncapability to be independent and objective, and I ask him to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am here to defend Chief Justice John \nRoberts. I am here because he has been attacked, without cause, by the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Yesterday afternoon the senior Senator from Iowa hit a new low in \ntrying to justify his unprecedented obstruction of President Obama's \nSupreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick Garland. The chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee accused Chief Justice John Roberts of being ``part \nof the problem'' when it comes to the politicization of the Supreme \nCourt. That is without any foundation.\n  I don't agree with the Chief Justice on every opinion he has \nrendered, nor, frankly, do I agree with any of the other seven on \nopinions they have rendered. We have had some disagreements on a number \nof opinions they have authored and participated in. Again, I don't \nagree with the Chief Justice on many of the opinions he has written, \nbut his observations about the Supreme Court confirmation process have \nobviously struck a nerve in the Republican caucus.\n  Here is what happened. Days before the unfortunate death of Justice \nScalia, before anyone could have anticipated the Supreme Court vacancy, \nChief Justice Roberts made the commonsense assertion in a speech he \ngave that partisan politics hurt our Nation's highest Court. This is \nwhat he said:\n\n       When you have a sharply political, divisive hearing \n     process, it increases the danger that whoever comes out of it \n     will be viewed in these terms. . . . It's natural for some \n     member of the public to think you must be identified in a \n     particular way as a result of that process. And that's just \n     not how--we don't work as Democrats or Republicans. I think \n     it's a very unfortunate perception the public might get from \n     the confirmation process.\n\n  I was a Member of the Senate when we had the hearings regarding \nJustice\n\n[[Page S1684]]\n\nRoberts. He came from the same court on which Merrick Garland served. \nThey served together, and they are friends. In the past, Justice \nRoberts has said many glowing things about Merrick Garland. But \nyesterday afternoon on this floor, the senior Senator from Iowa had the \naudacity to accuse Roberts of being part of the problem, even going so \nfar as to tell the Chief Justice--listen to this one--``Physician, heal \nthyself.''\n  I say to the senior Senator from Iowa, Justice Roberts isn't the one \nwho needs healing. What needs mending is the Judiciary Committee under \nhis chairmanship, which he has annexed as a political arm of the \nRepublican leader's office. Senator Grassley has sacrificed the \nhistorical independence of the Judiciary Committee to do the bidding of \nthe tea party and obviously the Koch brothers.\n  I have news for Senator Grassley: The American people don't think the \nprocess of nominating a Supreme Court Justice is political because the \nSupreme Court's rulings don't match expectations of the political right \nor the political left. I have confidence that these men and women who \nserve on the Court do the very best they can to rule on the law as they \nsee it. The American people don't think it is political because the \nsenior Senator from Iowa is refusing to give a fair hearing to a highly \nqualified nominee purely because he was nominated by a Democratic \nPresident. The American people think it is political when the Judiciary \nCommittee and the Republicans on his committee meet behind closed doors \nand make pacts to blockade our Nation's judiciary, from the Supreme \nCourt, to the circuit courts, to the district courts.\n  I know that my friend, with whom I have served for decades in this \nbody, is grasping for something, anything to get himself off the hook. \nPresident Harry Truman said, ``The buck stops here.'' Senator Grassley \nwants the buck to stop with anyone but himself. He has done more to \npoliticize the process than any chairman of the Judiciary Committee in \nthe history of this country.\n  If the senior Senator from Iowa really wants to understand why \nAmericans think the process of nominating Supreme Court Justices is so \npartisan, he should consider his own actions. He has only himself to \nblame for not doing his job.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, just a little earlier today, the Senate \nmoved to proceed to the FAA reauthorization bill. My hope is that we--\nthe distinguished Senator from Florida, who is the ranking member on \nthe Commerce Committee, and I--will move to have a substitute \nconsidered, and, hopefully, that will happen very soon.\n  At this time, I wish to speak about the subject that is before us, \nand that is the FAA reauthorization bill.\n  This week the Senate is taking up something that is a very important \npiece of legislation when it comes to aviation reforms that will \nsupport U.S. jobs, increase safety, improve drone operations, and make \ntravel easier for airline passengers. The bill before us today, the \nFederal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 2016, will help \nupdate aviation law to reflect the rapid advances in technology we have \nseen over the last few years.\n  For example, since the last reauthorization of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration in 2012, the use of drones has increased dramatically. \nThe FAA has sought to keep up by using the authority it already has to \nsafely advance this burgeoning industry, but there are limits to what \nthe FAA can do with only outdated authority to manage this rapidly \nadvancing technology. Passing this reform bill will help the FAA remove \nbarriers to innovation and address unacceptable safety risks when it \ncomes to unmanned aircraft.\n  Just last month the Los Angeles Times reported on an incident where a \nLufthansa A380 jumbo jet approaching the Los Angeles International \nAirport experienced a near miss with a drone that flew just 200 feet \nover the airliner. While fortunately in this case, the two did not \ncollide, the prospect of a jumbo jet carrying hundreds of passengers \nstriking a drone while flying over a heavily populated area is \nchilling.\n  Our colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, noted in a \nstatement on this incident that our FAA bill includes key reforms that \nwill keep drones out of the path of airliners. She added: ``We must \npass this bill and strengthen the law wherever we can.'' Well, I could \nnot agree more. To keep drones out of the paths of commercial \nairliners, the Senate bill would implement standards so that existing \nsafety technologies could be built into unmanned aircraft. This \nlegislation also takes steps to require drone users to learn basic \nrules of the sky so they understand the limits of where and when \nunmanned aircraft may operate. This is critical as we move into an era \nwhere drones share airspace with commercial aircraft, emergency medical \nflights, low-altitude agricultural planes, and general aviation pilots.\n  Our focus on safety in this legislation doesn't stop at promoting \nsafe use of unmanned systems. Our legislation addresses safety issues \nacross the aviation spectrum. Lithium batteries, the batteries that \npower laptops and mobile phones, have helped to grow our digital \neconomy, but the bulk transport of these items poses serious shipping \nchallenges. Our bill ensures swift implementation of new international \nsafety standards for the bulk transport of these batteries.\n  Although the sequence of events preceding the tragic Germanwings \nmurder-suicide almost certainly would not have happened in the United \nStates due to existing rules, our bill recognizes the importance of \nmental health and strengthens evaluations for commercial pilots.\n  Our legislation also improves a voluntary safety reporting program \nfor pilots and sets a deadline for creating a commercial pilot record \ndatabase to ensure air carriers have all available information about \npilots' training, testing, and employment histories when hiring.\n  In response to an independent recommendation completed after our \nexperience with the 2015 Ebola virus outbreak, our bill directs Federal \nagencies to establish aviation preparedness plans for any future \noutbreaks of communicable diseases.\n  Our legislation also directs the FAA to update guidance regarding \nflight deck automation, such as the use of autopilot, a key factor in \nrecent fatal accidents. This legislation also makes existing funds \navailable for a $400 million increase in the Airport Improvement \nProgram to strengthen infrastructure and safety measures at our \nairports.\n  While our top priority is safety, the Senate's aviation bill also \nmakes consumer friendly reforms to improve air travel for passengers. I \ncommute weekly from my home in South Dakota to Washington, DC. So I \nunderstand the many frustrations that passengers face, and my \ncolleagues and I are immensely proud of the pro-consumer provisions in \nthis bill. Our legislation has been hailed by a consumer columnist for \nthe Washington Post as ``one of the most passenger-friendly Federal \nAviation Administration reauthorization bills in a generation.''\n  Under our bill, airlines must return fees consumers have paid for \nbaggage if items are lost or delayed. We also require airlines to \nautomatically return fees for services purchased but not delivered so \nthat travelers don't have to go through the hassle of trying to reclaim \ntheir money from an airline. And for customers frustrated by lengthy \nlegal jargon that can make it difficult to understand fees, our bill \ncreates a new and easy-to-read uniform standard for disclosing baggage, \nticket change, seat selection, and other fees. Our proposal also helps \nfamilies with children find flights where they can sit together without \nadditional costs by requiring airlines to tell purchasers about \navailable seat locations at the time of booking.\n  As a resident of a rural State, the needs of the general aviation \ncommunity were a priority of mine when we wrote this bill. I am pleased \nwe were able to build a consensus for including reforms from the \nPilot's Bill of Rights 2 offered by many of my colleagues and led by \nSenators Inhofe and Manchin.\n\n[[Page S1685]]\n\nThese provisions include reforms to the third class medical certificate \nrequired for noncommercial pilots and new protections for pilots in \ntheir interactions with the FAA.\n  To reduce the risk of aircraft accidents for low-altitude fliers, \nsuch as agricultural applicators, our bill includes requirements for \nhighly visible physical markings on small towers posing hazards.\n  This bill would also strengthen the aviation industry by improving \nthe FAA's process for certifying aircraft designs and modifications and \nensuring that these certifications benefit manufacturers competing in \nglobal markets. This would help manufacturers move U.S. aerospace \nproducts to market faster without compromising safety standards.\n  While I expect and encourage robust debate on this bill, I hope the \ndebate will go forward with the same bipartisan and constructive spirit \nthat Senator Nelson and I witnessed during consideration of this bill \nin the Commerce Committee. At the committee markup, we voted to include \ndozens of amendments reflecting ideas from both sides of the aisle. On \nfinal passage, we approved this bill by a voice vote, without a single \ncommittee member recording an objection. Part of reaching this \nconsensus was an agreement Senator Nelson and I had reached not to \ninclude certain proposals that would divide our colleagues. We worked \nhard to find middle ground on a number of issues to enable us to move \nthis bill forward. Air traffic control reform and a passenger facility \ncharge increase were excluded from the package because, at present, \nthese proposals lack sufficient support and their inclusion could have \njeopardized the legislation. Senator Nelson and I also agreed to limit \nthe length of this bill to 18 months. This allows us to enact important \nreforms now while providing an opportunity to revisit other issues \nreasonably soon.\n  As we debate this bill, we should remember the urgent need for safety \nimprovements and good government reforms to improve our aviation \nindustry. There are numerous reforms in this bill that are simply too \nimportant to delay, and I look forward to a productive debate.\n  Finally, I took to the floor earlier this week to discuss the recent \nhorrific attacks perpetrated by ISIS and the implications for security \nand our aviation policy. In addition to this FAA bill, the Commerce \nCommittee has approved two bipartisan aviation security bills. The \nfirst is S. 2361, the Airport Security Enhancement and Oversight Act, \nwhich Senator Nelson and I introduced along with the bipartisan \nleadership of the Homeland Security Committee as cosponsors, and the \nsecond is H.R. 2843, which is the TSA PreCheck Expansion Act offered by \nRepresentative John Katko in the House.\n  Historically, the Senate has passed aviation security enhancements \nseparate from a reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration. \nWhile I still prefer this separate approach, I will pursue every option \nto enact these improvements and will vigorously oppose any efforts to \nwater down the security enhancements in these bills.\n  I know we all share the goal of keeping aviation secure, and I will \nlisten to the views of my colleagues on whether we pursue enactment of \nthese bipartisan aviation security proposals through this \nreauthorization or through separate legislation.\n  I thank my partner on the Commerce Committee, Ranking Member Bill \nNelson, as well as Senators Kelly Ayotte and Maria Cantwell, who lead \nour Aviation Subcommittee, for their work on the Federal Aviation \nAdministration Reauthorization Act.\n  I look forward to the ensuing debate on the bill, and I urge--at the \nend of that debate--my colleagues to move forward and pass this \nlegislation because it is important for America's economy and the \nsafety of our traveling public.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I think the chairman, Senator Thune, has \npointed out that what we have tried to exhibit is the way the Senate is \nsupposed to work. We are supposed to work in a bipartisan way to forge \nconsensus in order to be able to govern. The subject matter of the FAA \nreauthorization bill is one that we shouldn't dilly-dally around. \nIndeed, we take some of the very serious consequences we are facing \nwith our national aviation system head-on.\n  I also want the chairman to know how much I appreciate the spirit \nwith which we have worked, not only on this issue but on the many \nissues we have discussed in the Commerce Committee. I think the proof \nis in the pudding, and I think we will see an amendment process that \nwill run fairly smoothly as a result of the example and the spirit we \nhave tried to set with regard to this legislation.\n  This is a comprehensive bill. It has been months in the making, and \nin working together in the fashion that I indicated, the bill reflects \nour broad agreement on aviation. At the same time, we have refrained \nfrom the controversial proposals, such as the plan in the House bill \nthat has come out of the House committee and has not gone to the floor. \nThey had a plan to privatize air traffic control and that has stopped \nthe House FAA bill dead in its tracks.\n  We have a good bill in front of us here in the Senate, and in this \nrobust process we will consider many amendments and improvements as we \ncontinue the legislative process. There is no basis for the chatter \ncoming from some in the House that hearts and minds will change here in \nthe Senate on air traffic control privatization. Air traffic control \nprivatization is just not going to happen. I have made myself very \nclear on that issue. Such a privatization scheme would seriously impact \nthe overall success of our aviation system. It would dismantle the \nlongstanding partnership between the FAA and the Department of Defense \nand needlessly disrupt the progress the FAA is making in its \nmodernization efforts. Let me underscore that. The Defense Department \noperates in about 20 percent of our airspace. They cannot afford to \nhave a private company handling that airspace. Of course, this \nprivatization could also lead to increased costs for the traveling \npublic and users of the National Airspace System.\n\n  We think the measured approach we are taking in this bill is the \nbetter path, and we are not alone in this view. This bipartisan bill \nenjoys the support of a huge number of organizations. Now, nothing is \nperfect, and so it was my hope that we could find a way to help our \nbusiest airports by increasing the resources they need to improve and \nmaintain vital facilities. We couldn't reach that agreement. That is \none reason the term of this bill is somewhat limited through fiscal \nyear 2017, so we have an additional opportunity to revisit this and \nother issues in the not-too-distant future. It is a consensus bill, and \nit contains, as the chairman has just mentioned, many new consumer \nprotections for airline passengers, critical improvements in drone \nsafety, and reforms that boost U.S. aircraft manufacturing and exports, \nand it will do all of this without disrupting the safest and most \nefficient air transportation system in the world.\n  Let me highlight some of these consumer protections. How irritating \nis it to passengers that they don't know about this-and-that fee, this-\nand-that charge? At the end of the day, consumers feel nickeled and \ndimed. They deserve to know, and they need some relief. Well, this bill \nmakes progress on that. Last summer, this Senator released a report \nthat found that airlines failed to adequately disclose the extra fees \nand the add-on costs charged to the flying public. In many cases, \npassengers didn't know they could get a seat without having to request \na special seat with a fee. In many cases, passengers didn't know about \nthe fees they had to pay for airline baggage. That report had a number \nof comprehensive recommendations, and this legislation builds on that \nreport to protect the flying public--many things in the bill. For \nexample, it requires fee refunds for lost or delayed baggage. It \nrequires new standardized disclosure of fees for consumers. It requires \nincreased protections for disabled passengers.\n  As the chairman mentioned, drone safety is a very important area of \nthis bill. Remember Captain Sully Sullenberger, who became a national \nhero when, upon takeoff and ascending out of LaGuardia, he encountered \na flock of seagulls which were sucked into his jet engines? Now, that \nis flesh\n\n[[Page S1686]]\n\nand blood and feathers and webbed feet. You can imagine what would \nhappen if a plane, on ascent or on descent of a passenger airline, \nsucks in the plastic and metal of a drone. There are lives at risk, and \nthere might not be a Hudson River that Captain Sullenberger could belly \nit in, in the Hudson River, and save all the lives of his passengers.\n  Last year alone, the FAA recorded over 1,000 drone sightings near \nairports and aircraft. That is unacceptable, and we must do everything \nwe can to protect the flying public from these dangers posed by drones. \nSo this bill creates a pilot program to test various technologies to \nkeep drones away from airports, and it requires the FAA to work with \nNASA to test and develop a drone traffic management system. We have \nseen the technology already available that can suddenly capture a \ndrone, if it goes into a prohibited area, and land that drone or take \nover that drone and take it someplace else. The identification of \ndrones that go in and out of prohibited areas is also important. We are \ngoing to have to face this because, sooner or later, it will not be \nwhat happened at the Miami International Airport with a drone within \nhundreds of feet of an inbound American Airlines airliner into Miami \nInternational. So we want to avoid that catastrophic outcome. This \nlegislation also provides reforms in the FAA certification process that \nwill boost U.S. manufacturing and exports and most importantly create \nreally good jobs for hard-working Americans.\n  Those are just some of the key features in the bill when it comes to \nreauthorizing the FAA, and that is what brings us here today with the \nbill on the floor. We know we are in a new context of world terrorism, \nhaving just been reminded in Brussels. The dual attacks on a Brussels \nmetro station and the airport are a grim reminder that both aviation \nand surface transportation networks remain attractive targets for \nterrorists. It is now almost 15 years after September 11. The \nterrorists are still out there seeking these vulnerabilities. In \nNovember of last year, we saw the ability to penetrate airport \nperimeter security in Egypt enabled an employee to get an explosive \ndevice on a Russian passenger jet, and that killed 224 civilians. So we \nhave amendments to address these issues. We think these amendments are \nnoncontroversial, we think they are bipartisan, and they certainly are \ntimely.\n  As our debate unfolds over the next few days, aviation security will \nbe an important factor in the discussion. The chairman and I have \ntalked at length, and we have some of the ideas that we are going to \npresent for consideration on security. One such proposal, as the \nchairman has mentioned in his opening remarks, we already passed in the \ncommerce committee. It is right there, the Airport Security Enhancement \nand Oversight Act. That bipartisan legislation, sponsored by a number \nof us on the committee, would improve background checks for airport \nworkers and increase employee screenings--obviously, a reminder of the \nRussian jetliner--this is important--and a reminder of the gun-running \nscheme in the Atlanta airport: over 100 guns over a 3-month period put \non airliners, transporting them from the Atlanta Airport to New York. \nIt is an area that requires attention.\n  So I look forward to collaborating with our colleagues as we move \nthese important issues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue that \naffects a part of our Constitution. The Constitution begins with these \nthree words: ``We the people.'' You can talk in any townhall across \nAmerica and ask ``What are the first three words of the Constitution?'' \nand they will respond ``We the people.'' They know that the \nConstitution starts with those words written in a super-sized font, \nbecause that is really the heart of what our system of government is \nall about--not ``we the powerful commercial interests,'' not ``we the \ntitans of industry,'' not ``we the richest in America.'' No. ``We the \npeople,'' the citizens, ordinary citizens. Our Constitution, our system \nof government is set up to honor and respect and address the concerns \nof ordinary citizens. That is very different from so many other \ncountries where our early residents came from, from across the sea. So \nthose three words capture the spirit of what our new Nation was all \nabout, or, as President Lincoln later summarized, a government of the \npeople, by the people, and for the people.\n  I have come to the floor periodically to address various issues \nrelated to ``we the people,'' related certainly to honoring the spirit \nof the Constitution. In that regard, this week I am coming to the floor \nto address the responsibility of our Senate and its advice and consent \nrole under our Constitution.\n  The President's duty is to nominate a Supreme Court Justice when \nthere is a vacancy. That responsibility is clearly written into our \nConstitution. The Senate's duty is to consider whether that nominee \nmerits being appointed. In the early ages of our country, as we went \nfrom the Revolution of 1776 to the drafting of the Constitution, our \nFounders were of mixed minds as to how this appointment process should \nwork. Some said the appointments should all be done by what they \nreferred to as the assembly--that is, by all of us in Congress. So the \nexecutive branch would have a check on it, but the position would be \nfilled by Congress. Others said: No, no, no, no, that is too difficult. \nToo much horse trading is going to be going on. The responsibility \nneeds to be vested in the President. That is accountability.\n  But what happens if the President engages in appointments of dubious \nmerit, people of dubious character, of dubious qualifications? So they \ncame out with this compromise that the President nominates and our \nresponsibility here in the Senate is to determine whether the nominee \nis of fit character.\n  One can get a little flavor of this from the writings of Hamilton in \nthe Federalist Papers, Paper No. 76. He writes:\n\n       To what purpose then require the cooperation of the Senate? \n     I answer, that the necessity of their concurrence would have \n     a powerful, though, in general, a silent operation. It would \n     be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the \n     president, and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment \n     of unfit characters.\n\n  That is our responsibility--to vet the nominee and to vote upon \ndetermining whether the individual is of fit character, and that \ncertainly can be broadly interpreted to include personal \ncharacteristics and qualifications for a job that requires specific \nqualifications. That is our responsibility.\n  Every Senator here took an oath to the Constitution, pledged to honor \ntheir responsibilities here as they are laid out in the Constitution. \nThat is why I am so disturbed that at this moment we have Senators in \nthis body who have said: I am not going to do my responsibility under \nthe Constitution. I am going on a job strike. I don't want to work and \ndo my responsibility under advice and consent. I don't want to do the \nwork of vetting candidates and voting on candidates. I am just going to \nsit on my hands and sing ``la la la'' instead of doing the work the \nConstitution requires.\n  That is unacceptable. To my colleagues who are sitting on their hands \nand failing to do their constitutional responsibility, I simply say: Do \nyour job.\n  On March 16 President Obama nominated Merrick Garland to serve on the \nU.S. Supreme Court. Certainly the President has now fulfilled his \nresponsibility under the Constitution. He put forward a nominee to fill \nthis critical vacancy on the Supreme Court. I certainly look forward to \nmeeting with Merrick Garland, reviewing his credentials, and learning \nmore about his vision for the Supreme Court. That is part of the \nvetting process. That is something all of us should be doing. Then it \nwill be time for the Senate as a body to act. That means the Judiciary \nCommittee proceeds to collect information on Mr. Garland's background \nand on his decisions, and then they hold a hearing and members of\n\n[[Page S1687]]\n\nthe committee ask penetrating questions: Why did you say this in a \nparticular opinion? He has a whole record to be examined, and that is \nwhat we should be doing right now.\n  Not since the Civil War have we left a vacancy on the Supreme Court \nfor over a year, but the job strike my colleagues are engaged in today \nsays: We are going to leave this vacancy on the Court. We are going on \na job strike for an entire year and not do our responsibility under the \nConstitution because we just don't want to.\n  That is a dereliction of duty, and I encourage my colleagues to \nrethink their positions.\n  Since 1975 it has taken on average only 67 days to vet and vote on a \nSupreme Court nominee--just 67 days or a little over 2 months.\n  There are some folks here in the Chamber who say: Well, this is a \nunique circumstance because we are in the last year of a Presidency, \nand therefore we should just wait and leave the Court spot empty for a \nyear. Wait until the election next November and wait for the new \nPresident to come in in January and then get a new nominee and hold \nhearings then.\n  That argument fails on several accounts. First of all, there is \nnothing in the Constitution that says one will only do their job in a \nyear, if you will, that is in the first 3 years of the Presidency \ninstead of the fourth year. That is not written in the Constitution. \nFor any of my colleagues who make this argument, I would be happy to \nread the Constitution to them. Better yet, read it yourselves. Look at \nthe Constitution and our responsibilities under the Constitution. The \nPresident is required to nominate in all 4 years, and we here in the \nSenate are required to proceed to determine whether that nominee is of \nunfit character or of fit character, and that means vetting and that \nmeans voting. The President doesn't get a break in his fourth year and \nget told to do nothing, and we don't get a break in our sixth year. We \nare not told that in the sixth year we should wait to make decisions \nbecause we have to run for reelection and therefore we should wait \nuntil our citizens vote. No. We have a term that runs a full 6 years, \nand we have a responsibility for the entire 6 years. The President has \na term of 4 years, and he or she has the responsibility for the entire \n4 years. There is nothing in the advice and consent clause that says \nthat at a certain point in time, we are just not going to do our advice \nand consent responsibility.\n  It is conceivable that the Founders could have written into the \nConstitution that in the fourth year of a Presidency, the Senate will \nnot fill any positions, but they didn't write that into the \nConstitution, and it would not have made sense for them to have done so \nbecause the work of the Court is ongoing and the work of the executive \nbranch is ongoing.\n  Indeed, if we want any form of precedent, we can look to the recent \npast. Justice Kennedy, who sits on the Court today, was confirmed in \nthe last year of President Reagan's final term, and he was confirmed \nunder a Democratically controlled Senate. I have not heard a single \nMember come to this floor and say that if they had been here in that \nyear, they would have advised that we leave President Reagan's nominee \nhanging, unvetted, not voted on for an entire year, waiting for the \nnext President. No one here made that argument back then, and nobody is \nmaking it now. What we are seeing is a purely political effort to pack \nthe Court to politicize an institution that shouldn't be politicized.\n  From the moment of nomination through the end of this administration, \nwe still have 310 days. The average, after a nomination, to confirm a \nnomination, is 66 days. In other words, we have five times as many days \nas needed for the average to confirm. There is no argument that there \nis not enough time.\n  A job strike based purely on partisan politics designed to polarize \nand pack the Court is going to do a tremendous amount of damage to this \nimportant institution.\n  Our Founders laid out in the Constitution a vision of three coequal \nbranches, but, colleagues, if you take the advice and consent power to \nundermine the ability of the executive branch to operate or the ability \nof the Court to operate, you will damage in a serious way the quality \nof the three branches. You will be saying that one branch has the power \nto derail the ability of the other two to function. That is absolutely, \nclearly, completely, 100 percent not the vision that was laid out in \nthe Constitution and not the vision that was laid out for advice and \nconsent.\n  Let me remind you that advice and consent is the responsibility to \ndetermine if the nominee is of unfit character. How can we determine if \nsomeone is of unfit character if we won't meet with them? How can we \ndetermine if someone is of unfit character if we are not willing to \nreview their writings? How can we determine if they are of unfit \ncharacter if the Judiciary Committee doesn't hold a hearing to actually \nraise questions and ask the nominee to respond to them? How can we as a \nbody determine and make the decision that someone is of unfit character \nif we don't hold a vote?\n  Consider the precedent that is being established and the damage it \nwill do. Let's say for example that by refusing to do their job, my \nRepublican colleagues delay until the next administration comes in. It \nis a Republican administration, and they get a nominee who they feel \nhas far-right views that they like better than the nominee before us.\n  By the way, Merrick Garland's views are about as straight down the \ncenter as anyone can ask for. He has been praised voluminously by \nRepublicans in the past. Justice Roberts said that if one disagreed \nwith Justice Garland, one would really have to look carefully as to \nwhy. A key Member of this body who has been here a very long time said: \nIf someone like Justice Garland was nominated, well, that would be a \nvery reasonable nomination. So we have a very reasonable, down-the-\nmiddle nomination.\n  But what if this tactic of going on strike and failing to do your job \nworked, so that in the next administration you could secure a Supreme \nCourt Justice who is way to the right?\n  First, it has been a clear and complete effort to pack the Court. You \nhave destroyed the integrity of the Court as one that rises above \npartisan politics.\n  Then along comes another vacancy, and you have a different President \nand/or maybe the same President. Now the minority says: Well, we are \ngoing to go on strike, or maybe the majority is going to go on strike \nbecause they don't like this particular President or they don't like \nthis particular nominee. And they say: We are not going to vet, we are \nnot going to vote, we are going to wait. It is only 3 years until the \nnext President. Let's let the people decide or wait till the next \nPresident.\n  Perhaps if the Republican side succeeds in packing the Court and then \nthe question becomes another vacancy, Democrats say: Well, look, we \nhave to restore the balance of the Court, so we are going to absolutely \nrefuse to act on the next nominee of this Republican President.\n  This you can see. This precedent is not only a dereliction of duty; \nit is deeply damaging to the integrity of the Court. It is deeply \ndestructive of the integrity of the Court. This is a path we do not \nwant to go down as a body, exercising our advice and consent \nresponsibilities, politicizing our judicial system, polarizing our \njudicial system, destroying the integrity of our judicial system.\n  I appeal to my colleagues, rethink the oath of office that you took \nto do your job, decide to end this job strike, and do your job. Rethink \nhow important the responsibility that we have as a Senate is to \nmaintain the integrity of our institutions. For short-term gain, \ndestroying the Supreme Court, polarizing, diminishing the Supreme Court \nis not in the interest of our Nation.\n  I will go back to where I began, with our system of ``we the \npeople''--our ``we the people'' Constitution--designed to create laws \nof, by, and for the people. There are three coequal branches of \ngovernment; one creating laws, one executing those laws, and one \ndetermining whether or not those laws are within the balance of our \nConstitution.\n  This action of trying to pack the Court through a job strike is \nequivalent to shredding key parts of this beautiful document. It is \nwrong in terms of the short-term action, and it is certainly wrong in \nterms of our long-term responsibilities.\n\n[[Page S1688]]\n\n  Let's end this show. Let's end this highly politicized moment. Let's \nactually hold the hearing to vet the candidate. Let's meet with the \ncandidate so we can develop our individual understandings. Let's review \nthe candidate's writings, and let's gather on the floor to vote whether \nwe believe this candidate is a fit character or unfit character. That \nis our responsibility. Let's do our responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Nuclear Deal With Iran\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, last Saturday marked the 1-year \nanniversary of the Obama administration's deal with Iran, known as the \nJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action. This is the nuclear deal with Iran \nthat officially went into effect last October.\n  Briefly summarized, in exchange for billions of dollars in near-term \nand long-term sanctions relief, Iran made some very modest nuclear \nconcessions--and that is if you believe the inspection regime is not \nfundamentally flawed, which I do not believe. So instead of trust and \nverify, we can't even verify Iran is complying with the terms of the \nagreement. Indeed, I think we can pretty much be guaranteed that Iran \nwill do its dead-level best to cheat.\n  To make matters worse, the administration all but admitted the deal \nwasn't going to stop Iran from exporting terrorism--which is the No. 1 \nstate sponsor of terrorism in the world--or violating the human rights \nof its own citizens or advancing its ballistic missile program. We have \nseen a lot of evidence of that recently.\n  All of these major bipartisan concerns were highlighted by Congress \nbut totally ignored by the administration. President Obama himself \nwarned that ``this deal is not''--is not--``contingent on Iran changing \nits behavior. That is the President of the United States, the leader of \nthe free world, the Commander in Chief. The President of the United \nStates said: ``This deal is not contingent on Iran changing its \nbehavior.'' Unbelievable and outrageous.\n  My concerns with this agreement have done nothing but grow ever since \nthe deal was done, and Iran continues to prove it was not negotiating \nin good faith--to the contrary, that it was negotiating in bad faith \nand would take every advantage it could to advance its nuclear \nambitions and to continue its state sponsorship of global terrorism.\n  Iran is still working to undercut the United States and its \npriorities in the Middle East by fueling proxy wars in the region in \nplaces such as Iraq, Yemen, and Syria. The administration has even made \nclear that it knew the money that was released as a result of the \nsanctions relief--that it knew--that the tens of billions of dollars of \nintermediate sanctions relief going to Iran would be funneled to \nterrorist groups across the Middle East. So we have an unverifiable \ndeal, and we have money going to finance terrorism. What is not to love \nabout that? That is the administration's attitude.\n  In fact, earlier this week it was reported that the U.S. Navy--the \nU.S. Navy--for the third time in just 2 months intercepted an Iranian \nshipment of weapons in the Arabian Sea believed to be headed from Iran \nto rebel groups in Yemen.\n  One has to wonder how Iran paid for those weapons. Well, one logical \nexplanation would be perhaps with the sanctions relief authorized by \nthe President's misbegotten deal with Iran. That was a huge cash \ninfusion. It is only logical to believe that Iran used that money to \npay for the weapons they were then trying to ship to the rebels in \nYemen. And, of course, as we have seen recently, the deal certainly \ndidn't keep Iran's Revolutionary Guard from test-firing ballistic \nmissiles. The fact is, the Iranian nuclear deal is not worth the paper \nit is written on. I hope the next President will rip it to shreds day \none in office and give it the sort of respect that it has really \nearned.\n  Unfortunately, Iran serves as just one of the many examples of how \nthe administration's rudderless strategy is advancing America's \ninterests in the complex world we are living in. On President Obama's \nwatch, the United States has methodically ceded our irreplaceable \nleadership role throughout the world. This is most evident in the \nMiddle East--a caldron of violence and instability.\n  In Syria, we don't see the JV team that President Obama referred to \nin ISIS. We see an emboldened terrorist group that exports death and \ndestruction to our allies in cities such as Paris and Brussels, with \nthe intention to do the same thing right here in the United States, \nanywhere and everywhere they can, including places such as Garland, TX, \nwhere thankfully an alert security guard was able to thwart two ISIS-\ninspired terrorists from killing innocent civilians.\n  In Iraq, where Americans spent their treasure and spilled their blood \nto bring relative peace and stability just a few short years ago, we \nnow find complete chaos. President Obama's precipitous withdrawal of \nU.S. forces from Iraq helped turn the region back into a powder keg.\n  Much like the Obama administration's promised redline on chemical \nweapons in Syria, the border between Syria and Iraq has literally been \nerased. It doesn't exist anymore. As the Obama administration has stood \nby, today the black flag of ISIS flies high over places such as Mosul \nand Fallujah.\n  We all know that ISIS has carved out a safe haven in the heart of the \nMiddle East, while Syria has plunged deeper and deeper into civil war \nand chaos. Millions of people have become displaced as refugees, both \ninternally in Syria and in surrounding countries, causing further \ninstability in the region. And now, of course, we are seeing them not \nonly in refugee camps in Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon, but escaping to \nEurope and creating huge challenges for the governments in Europe. That \nis not even to mention the hundreds of thousands of Syrians who have \nlost their lives in this civil war while the world has stood back and \nby and large watched with negligible strategy or effort to try to \nchange the outcome.\n  What is the result? Well, beyond this hard reality, this sends a \nmessage to our allies and our adversaries. Our allies are questioning \nour commitment and our reliability. Our adversaries are interpreting \nour lack of strategy and action as weakness and opportunity. Israel, \nalong with several of our gulf partners, has found a White House that \nrepeatedly seems to care more about the interests of our common enemy \nthan Israel's security interests. In Europe, North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization countries--NATO countries--question our dedication and \ncommitment to transatlantic peace and prosperity as Russia prowls at \ntheir back door. Our adversaries have noticed. They have been \nemboldened by the lack of American leadership and strategy, and they \nhave taken full advantage.\n  This administration's abdication of leadership has allowed China to \ngrow more belligerent in the Asia-Pacific; North Korea to test what \nthey claim is a hydrogen bomb and to threaten our allies, such as South \nKorea and Japan; and Russia to quickly fill the leadership vacuum left \nby the United States in Europe and the Middle East.\n  If we had any doubt about it, once again we have learned a hard \nlesson, and that is, weakness is itself a provocation. Weakness is a \nprovocation. What this world needs, what America needs, is leadership \nand a strategic vision that doesn't just respond to every crisis on an \nad hoc basis.\n  Fortunately, the Founding Fathers gave the Congress some tools to be \nable to help when the Chief Executive of the country seems to be \nwithout any particular direction or without a particular strategy. The \nSenate can play an active role in holding the administration \naccountable and putting forth a strategy to help keep us safe.\n  For example, yesterday the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a \nhearing to discuss Iran's recent transgressions. I am glad the chairman \nof that committee, Senator Corker, and the ranking member, Senator \nCardin, are working together on a bipartisan basis on legislation to \nlevy more comprehensive sanctions on the Iranian regime to make up for \nwhat should have been done in the Iran nuclear deal but was essentially \nignored. The administration had consciously decided to ignore Iran's \nrole as a state sponsor of\n\n[[Page S1689]]\n\nterrorism and decided we are just going to try to deal with the Iranian \nnuclear aspirations and not the terrorism aspirations. In doing so, I \nthink they literally failed on both counts. They not only created a \ntesting regime that can't actually verify when Iran is cheating, but at \nthe same time they have unleashed tens of billions of dollars to help \nfinance terrorist activity.\n  The administration has made clear that it simply doesn't have much \ninterest in holding Iran accountable. They seem now absolutely nervous \nabout doing anything that Iran might use as an excuse to walk away from \nthe nuclear deal, which they could do on a moment's notice, meanwhile \nkeeping the benefits they have already gotten from this deal; namely, \nthe billions of dollars in sanctions relief.\n  I hope the Senate will move forward on this legislation soon. Our \nallies and our friends need to know that if the President will not \nstand by them and challenge our adversaries, Congress will.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Filling The Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise once again to address the Supreme \nCourt vacancy created by the untimely death of Justice Antonin Scalia. \nThe Constitution gives the nomination power to the President and gives \nthe advice and consent power to the Senate but does not tell either how \nto exercise their power. Our job of advice and consent begins with \ndeciding how best to exercise this power in each situation, and the \nSenate has done so in different ways at different times under different \ncircumstances. I don't think there is any question about that.\n  For two reasons, I am convinced that the best way to exercise our \npower of advice and consent regarding the Scalia vacancy is to defer \nthe confirmation process until the current Presidential season is over. \nThe first reason is that the circumstances we face today make this the \nwrong time for the confirmation process. This vacancy occurred in a \nPresidential election year with the campaigns and voting already \nunderway. Different parties control the nomination and confirmation \nphases of the judicial appointment process. The confirmation process, \nespecially for Supreme Court nominees, has been racked by discord in \nthe past, and this is one of the bitterest and dirtiest Presidential \ncampaigns we have seen in modern times. Combining a Supreme Court \nconfirmation fight and a nasty Presidential campaign would create the \nperfect storm that would do more harm than good for the Court, the \nSenate, and of course, our Nation.\n  The circumstances I mentioned are identical to those that led Vice \nPresident Biden in 1992 to recommend exactly what we are doing today. \nIn June of 1992, when he chaired the Judiciary Committee, he identified \nthese very circumstances and concluded: ``[O]nce the political season \nis under way, and it is, action on a Supreme Court nomination must be \nput off until after the election campaign is over.'' To be fair, \nsomething significant has changed since 1992. The confirmation process \nhas become even more partisan, contentious, and divisive.\n  In 2001 Democrats plotted a procedural revolution by launching new \ntactics to prevent Republican judicial nominees from being confirmed. \nOver the next several years, they led 20 filibusters of appeals court \nnominees and prevented several from ever getting appointed.\n  Then in 2013, Democrats used a parliamentary maneuver to abolish the \nvery filibusters they had used so aggressively. The minority leader \nknows this because he was in the middle of it all. If the condition of \nthe confirmation process was bad enough in 1992 for Chairman Biden to \nrecommend deferring it to a less politically charged time, Democrats' \nactions since then have only made this conclusion more compelling \ntoday.\n  The second reason for deferring the confirmation process for the \nScalia vacancy is that elections have consequences. In 2012 the \nelection obviously had consequences for the President and his power to \nnominate, but the 2014 election had its own consequences for the Senate \nand its power of advice and consent. The reason the American people \ngave Senate control to Republicans was to be a more effective check on \nhow the President is exceeding his constitutional authority.\n  The 2016 election also has consequences for the judiciary. The timing \nof the Scalia vacancy creates a unique opportunity for the American \npeople to voice their opinion about the direction of the courts.\n  On Monday the minority leader reminded us of an important axiom. Let \nme refer to the chart again. ``No matter how many times you say a \nfalsehood, it is still false.'' I agree.\n  The minority leader claims that the Senate has a constitutional duty, \na constitutional obligation to hold a prompt hearing and timely floor \nvote for the President's nominee to the Scalia vacancy. Yesterday The \nHill quoted him saying this: ``The obligation is for them to hold \nhearings and to have a vote. That's in the Constitution.'' By my count, \nthen, the minority leader has made this claim here on the Senate floor \nmore than 40 times. He said it as recently as this morning. No matter \nhow many times he says this falsehood, it is still false. The minority \nleader's claim is false because the Constitution says no such thing. \nThis is what the Constitution actually says about appointing judges: \nThe President ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent \nof the Senate, shall appoint.'' Nothing about hearings or votes, \nnothing about a timetable or schedule.\n  I say this to my Democratic colleagues: Do you really want to stand \nbehind a completely fictional, patently false claim like that? Do you \nreally want to base your position on what the Washington Post Fact \nChecker called a ``politically convenient fairytale''? I understand \nthat you want the Senate to conduct the confirmation process now for \nthe President's nominee. We can and should debate that. But will none \nof you be honest enough to at least say what everyone in this Chamber \nknows--that the Constitution does not require us to do things that way?\n  The minority leader not only contradicts the Constitution; he \ncontradicts himself. The minority leader was serving here in the Senate \nin 1992. Senator Reid took no issue with Chairman Biden's conclusion \nthat the circumstances at the time--the same circumstances that exist \ntoday--counseled deferring the confirmation process. Senator Reid did \nnot tell Chairman Biden that the Senate must do its job. Senator Reid \ndid not assert then what he repeats so often today--that the Senate has \na constitutional duty to give nominees prompt hearings and timely floor \nvotes.\n  On May 19, 2005, during the debate on the nomination of Priscilla \nOwen to the U.S. court of appeals, the minority leader said of the \nConstitution--and I will refer to this chart again--``Nowhere in that \ndocument does it say that the Senate has a duty to give Presidential \nappointees a vote.''\n  In that 2005 speech, the minority leader was particularly adamant \nabout this point. Claiming that the Senate has a duty to promptly \nconsider each nominee and give them an up-or-down vote, he said, would \n``rewrite the Constitution and reinvent reality.'' That is what the \nminority leader said then. The circumstances have changed, of course. \nToday the political shoe is on the minority leader's other foot, and he \nis the one claiming that nominees must have prompt consideration and \nup-or-down votes. By his own standard, the minority leader is rewriting \nthe Constitution and reinventing reality. Now that it serves his own \npolitical interests and that of his party, the minority leader has \nreversed course and claimed in a recent Washington Post opinion column \nthat the Senate has a constitutional duty to give nominees ``a fair and \ntimely hearing.''\n  Let me once again mention 1992, when Chairman Biden denied a hearing \nto more than 50 Republican judicial nominees. He allowed no hearing at \nall, whether fair or unfair, timely or otherwise. In September 1992 the \nNew York Times reported on page 1 that this was part of an obstruction \nstrategy to keep judicial vacancies open in the hopes\n\n[[Page S1690]]\n\nthat Bill Clinton would be elected. Senator Reid served here at that \ntime, but I can find no record of him demanding that every nominee get \na timely hearing. Instead, he wholeheartedly supported his party's \nstrategy of obstruction.\n\n  In his recent Washington Post column, the minority leader also wrote \nthat the Senate has a constitutional duty to give nominees a floor \nvote. Between 2003 and 2007, however, he voted 25 times to deny any \nfloor vote at all to Republican judicial nominees. As far as I can \ntell, we have the same Constitution today as we did in 1992, 2003, \n2005, and 2007. We have the same Constitution today with a Democrat in \nthe White House as we did in the past with a Republican President in \nthe White House. The minority leader cannot have it both ways. He \ncannot today insist that the Constitution requires the very hearings \nand floor votes he and his fellow Democrats blocked in the past. I \nsuppose they will say those were lesser court judges. Well, they were \nstill judicial nominees.\n  On Monday, the minority leader again attacked the Judiciary Committee \nand its distinguished chairman, Senator Grassley. You have to go a long \nway to find anybody who is nicer, more competent, and more dedicated \nthan Senator Grassley; yet he is being attacked again. I guess they \nthink that somehow makes a difference.\n  The minority leader held up a quote from an editorial in an Iowa \npaper about how the chairman is conducting the confirmation process. I \ndon't know when the minority leader started caring about what hometown \nnewspaper editorials said about the confirmation process, but this \nappears to be yet another epiphany.\n  On February 19, 2003, the Reno Gazette-Journal criticized Democrats \nfor their filibuster of Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals. A \nfew weeks later, the Las Vegas Review-Journal called the filibuster \ncampaign promoted by Senator Reid ``nothing more than ideological \nposturing and partisan blustering.''\n  As I mentioned earlier, the minority leader went on to vote 25 times \nfor filibusters of Republican judicial nominees.\n  Also on Monday, the minority leader claimed that the Judiciary \nCommittee is not doing its job and that the chairman is ``taking his \nmarching orders from the Republican leader.'' Later in the day, the \nSenate unanimously passed the Defend Trade Secrets Act. The minority \nleader dismissed this legislative accomplishment because it was \nreported out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously. He said: ``I don't \nsee today why the Judiciary Committee should be given a few pats on the \nback.'' Well, that is OK with me; we don't need pats on the back. The \nminority leader knows better though. He knows that the strong \nbipartisan outcome for this legislation was the result of nearly two \nyears of work behind the scenes, primarily at the staff level.\n  It is painfully obvious that the minority leader desperately wants to \nscore political points and to spin everything he can to his advantage, \nbut to disparage and belittle the arduous work of both Democrats and \nRepublicans, by both staff and Senators, is disgraceful and insulting. \nBefore he denigrated this significant bipartisan achievement, he should \nhave read the Obama administration's statement of policy on the bill. \nThe Defend Trade Secrets Act will, the administration says, promote \ninnovation and help minimize threats to American businesses, the \neconomy, and national security interests. The Obama administration \ncalls this an ``important piece of legislation'' that would ``provide \nimportant protection to the Nation's businesses and industries.''\n  This morning, the minority leader once again said that the Senate \nmust do its job regarding the Scalia vacancy, and he asked, ``What is \nthat job?'' The Senate's job is to determine how best to exercise its \nadvice and consent power under the particular circumstances we face \ntoday. We have made that determination. We have done our job. We are \nmaking the same determination that the minority leader apparently \nsupported in 1992. The Constitution no more dictates our decision than \nit did in 2009 when the minority leader correctly said that the Senate \nis not required to vote on nominations.\n  No matter how many times you say a falsehood, it is still false. No \nmatter how many times the minority leader falsely claims that the \nConstitution dictates how and when the Senate must conduct the \nconfirmation process, it is still false. No matter how many times he \nclaims that the Senate is not doing its job, it is still false. No \nmatter how many times the minority leader questions the integrity and \ncharacter of the Judiciary Committee chairman, those questions are \nstill false. No matter how many times the minority leader contradicts \nhimself and tries to avoid his own judicial confirmation record, his \nclaims today are still false.\n  The Senate today has the same power of advice and consent as when \nDemocrats were the majority. We have the same responsibility to \ndetermine the best way to exercise that power in each situation. In \n1992 Chairman Biden recommended deferring the confirmation process so \nthat ``partisan bickering and political posturing'' did not overwhelm \neverything else. The false claims and disreputable tactics being used \ntoday, including by the minority leader, only confirm Chairman Biden's \njudgment and its application today.\n  All of this is disappointing to me, to be honest with you. We have an \nhonest disagreement as to when this nomination should be brought up. We \nhave an honest disagreement as to how it should be brought up. We have \nan honest disagreement about the times we are in. We think this \nPresidential race is horrific on both sides. And I, for one, as former \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, am deeply concerned that we bring \nup this nominee in the middle of this awful mess called the \nPresidential election, with all of the politics and screaming and \nshouting and arguing from both sides. Considering a nominee now would \ndemean the Court. It would demean what we are trying to do around here. \nWaiting to consider a nominee only makes sense given that voting in \nthis election is already underway. For reasons I have explained \nbefore--and no doubt will do so again--the confirmation process for the \nScalia vacancy should be deferred until the election season is over.\n\n  I am also troubled by the minority leader's attacks on Chairman \nGrassley. I am concerned because I think that to have any leader attack \nsomebody as decent and as honorable as Chuck Grassley is below the \ndignity of this body. Whether someone has disagreements with Chuck or \nnot, they can explain those disagreements without being slanderous or \nlibelous.\n  There are very few people in this body who are as honest and as \ndecent as Chuck Grassley. I think all of my colleagues are honest and \ndecent, but very few of them would rise to the level Chuck Grassley \ndoes. He is an old farmer who believes in doing right and who, to the \nbest of his ability, always does right. I have been around Chairman \nGrassley for a long time, and I have the utmost respect for him. He is \nnot even an attorney. Yet he is running the Judiciary Committee very \nwell. He is a good man. He deserves to be treated like a good man and a \ngood leader and a good chairman.\n  We are going to have our differences in this body, but we should \ntreat each other with the utmost respect and not accuse people of being \nthings they are not. I can say one thing. I have served here for 40 \nyears and Chuck Grassley has been one of the best people I have served \nwith on either side.\n  I think my friends on the other side understand that I care a great \ndeal for them and that I like working with them. Sometimes we have to \nmodify things so they are pleased, but that is part of this process. \nSometimes we very vehemently disagree. That is one of the great things \nabout the Senate--we can disagree without being disagreeable. We can \nfind fault in the issues, but I think it is time to quit finding \nunnecessary fault in each other.\n  This is the greatest deliberative body in the world. I feel good to \nhave been able to serve as long as I have here, and I respect my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  Even so, we have a disagreement on when this body should consider a \nnominee, and that disagreement is a sincere one. The fact is, it would \nbe terrible to bring up the nominee in the middle of this particular \nPresidential election.\n  Let me just conclude by saying I love this body and I love my \ncolleagues. I\n\n[[Page S1691]]\n\njust hope we can open the door to understanding each side a little bit \nbetter than we do.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the recent bad \nbehavior of Iran and some important steps that have been taken by the \nadministration to push back on their support for terrorism, for illegal \nactions, and for their support for disorder in the Middle East but to \nalso sound the alarm that this series of steady actions continues to \nraise the specter that Iran has an expanding reach in the region and \nposes a greater and greater threat to our allies and, in particular, \nour vital ally, Israel.\n  Just over a year ago, leading world powers came together in support \nof a framework for blocking Iran's path to developing a nuclear weapon. \nThat framework ultimately became the JCPOA, or the Joint Comprehensive \nPlan of Action. In the months since that agreement took effect, Iran \nhas taken steps to significantly restrain its nuclear program. That is \ntrue. They filled with concrete the core of their reactor at Arak. They \nshipped out of the country 98 percent of their accumulated stockpile of \nenriched uranium, and they have allowed searching inspections by the \nIAEA. Those are all good steps. Yet the Iran regime continues to engage \nin dangerous actions outside the nuclear agreement, including ongoing \nhuman rights abuses, support for terrorism in the Middle East, and its \nrepeated illegal ballistic missile tests. All of those are ongoing \nreminders to us that America's security and the security of our allies \ndemand constant vigilance and close scrutiny of Iran's actions.\n  Since last September, I have regularly called upon my congressional \ncolleagues, the Obama administration, and our European allies to be \nwary of Iran's intentions and to continue to seek ways to effectively \npush back on its bad behavior.\n  The international community and the United States possess three major \nnonmilitary tools to lawfully counter Iran's continued bad behavior: \nfinancial sanctions, criminal charges, and weapons seizures. So let me \nfirst offer a number of examples of how each of these tools have \nrecently been put to work.\n  First, financial sanctions. On March 24, the Treasury Department \nimposed new sanction designations on a number of entities and \nindividuals who have supported Iran's ballistic missile program and on \nan Iranian airline, Mahan Air, which provides support services--\ntransportation--to the Quds Force, an elite Iranian military corps \ndesignated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. Treasury Department.\n  On this floor in early March, I called for the United States and our \nEuropean allies to further punish Mahan Air by eliminating the \nairline's access to international markets and airports. Since then, the \nTreasury Department has taken action against two companies, one based \nin the United Kingdom, another in the United Arab Emirates, that have \nprovided financial and materiel support to Mahan Air.\n  I commend the Obama administration for effectively deploying another \ntool in our diplomatic toolkit--criminal charges. On March 21, the \nJustice Department unsealed charges against three individuals who \nallegedly acted on behalf of the Iranian Government and associated \nentities to engage in hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions \nbarred by U.S. sanctions. These three Iranian individuals stand accused \nof illegally laundering the proceeds of these transactions and \ndefrauding the banks to which the transactions were processed.\n\n  Two days later, on March 23, a consultant to Iran's mission to the \nUnited Nations was also charged with violating U.S. law. The seven \ncharges levied against this individual include conspiracy to evade U.S. \nsanctions against Iran, money laundering, and arranging false tax \nreturns.\n  Then the following day, March 24, the Justice Department unsealed an \nindictment of seven Iranian ``experienced computer hackers'' who led a \ncoordinated campaign of cyber attacks from 2011 to 2013 that targeted \n46 U.S. banks and a dam in Upstate New York in Rye. Unsurprisingly, the \nseven individuals charged have been linked to the Iranian Revolutionary \nGuard Corps, the IRGC, the hardline conservative military force \ncommitted to the preservation of the radical revolutionary Iranian \nregime.\n  Just yesterday, the Justice Department announced that the United \nStates negotiated the extradition from Indonesia of a Singaporean man \nconspiring to send U.S. equipment to Iran--equipment later found in \nunexploded roadside bombs in Iraq.\n  These various criminal charges demonstrate to Iran and the world that \nresponsible members of the international community seek to resolve \ndisputes through international norms and institutions or accepted ways \nof conduct, not provocative missile tests and ongoing violations of \nsanctions.\n  In addition, the fact that each of these indictments occurred after \nthe implementation of the nuclear deal--while Iran did fulfill the \nletter of its commitments under the agreement--these ongoing violations \ndemonstrate that the United States can continue to counter Iran's bad \nbehavior and regional aggression without undermining the ongoing \nimplementation and enforcement of the JCPOA.\n  That brings us to the third tool in our arsenal: weapons seizures. On \nMonday, the U.S. Navy announced that the previous week, the USS Sirocco \nand USS Gravely intercepted a vessel in the Arabian Sea that contained \nan illicit Iranian arms shipment to the Houthi rebels in Yemen. After \nboarding the ship, American sailors confiscated 1,500 AK-47s, 200 \nrocket-propelled grenade launchers, and 21 .50-caliber machine guns, \nincluding the various weapons pictured in this photograph I have in the \nChamber. This marks the third successful interdiction of illicit arms \nin the Arabian Sea since late February. On March 20, a French Naval \ndestroyer seized nearly 2,000 AK-47s, 64 sniper rifles, nine anti-tank \nmissiles, and much more. That followed an interdiction a month earlier, \non February 27, in which an Australian naval crew intercepted another \nshipment off the coast of Oman that contained 1,900 AK-47s, 100 grenade \nlaunchers, 49 machine guns, and other illicit arms, headed to Yemen by \nway of Somalia. All of these interdictions were done with coordination \nand support of the United States.\n  These interdictions are not just military exercises. They prevent \nweapons from falling into the hands of dangerous terrorists or Houthi \nrebels. Just as importantly, these actions send a strong signal to Iran \nthat the international community continues to refuse to tolerate Iran's \ndestabilizing actions and its support for terrorism.\n  The picture to my right shows an Australian vessel, the crew from the \nHMAS Darwin, part of a U.S.-led, multinational coalition intercepting \nand boarding a dhow that held a shipment of illicit arms, likely \nintended for the Houthi rebels of Yemen. The conflict in Yemen pits the \nYemeni government stacked by a military coalition led by Saudi Arabia \nagainst the Houthis, a group allied with a former President and the \nradical Iranian regime.\n  Iran's support for the Houthis has devastated Yemen and the Yemeni \npeople. Over a year of fighting has led to more than 6,000 deaths, \nincluding thousands of civilians, and more than 30,000 injuries. The \nhuman suffering has been dramatic. According to the World Health \nOrganization, more than 21 million people--more than 80 percent of \nYemen's population--today require humanitarian aid. Instead of aid, \nIran sends weapons. These are not the actions of a responsible member \nof the international community. These are not the actions of a \ngovernment the U.S. can trust. As the United Arab Emirates' Ambassador \nto the United States, Yousef Al Otabia, recently wrote in the Wall \nStreet Journal, ``The international community must intensify its \nactions to check Iran's strategic ambitions.''\n  While I am pleased at recent actions by the U.S. Navy and our key \nallies from Europe and around the world in the region off the Arabian \nSea, I think there is more that we can and should do. That is why in \nthe months to come,\n\n[[Page S1692]]\n\ninstead of talking about giving Iranians access to U.S. dollar \ntransactions, I think the U.S. should lead coordinated international \nefforts to enforce existing sanctions and seize the illicit arms \nshipments through which Iran continues to fan violence, terror, and \ninstability--not just in Yemen, but in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and the \nbroader Middle East.\n  The imposition of further sanctions, the levying of criminal charges, \nand the successful interdiction of weapons all show that the \ninternational community has an array of tools to push back against \nIran. But just having the tools is not enough. We must continue to take \naction, and when multilateral mechanisms fail, Congress should work on \na bipartisan basis to see what new tools or authorities we can give the \nadministration to further crack down on Iran unilaterally.\n  Lest we need another reminder that Iran remains unwilling to meet the \nobligations required of a responsible member of the international \ncommunity, on March 30, their Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei claimed \nthat ballistic missiles are central to Iran's future--despite Iran's \ncommitments under U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231.\n  The Obama administration should continue to designate bad actors for \nsanctions, pursue criminal charges where appropriate, and seek \naccountability for Iran's ballistic missile tests in the U.N. Security \nCouncil.\n  We must continue to work hand-in-hand with our international partners \nto interdict arms shipments to Hezbollah, to the Houthis in Yemen, and \nto the murderous Assad regime in Syria. We must not accommodate Iran in \nany way, given its continued ballistic missile launches, its repeated \nhuman rights abuses, and its continued support for terrorism.\n  I remain concerned about the message sent by rumors of allowing \noffshore financial institutions to access U.S. dollars for foreign \ncurrency trades in support of so-called legitimate business with Iran. \nWe must keep in mind that both our words and our deeds send a strong \nsignal to Iran, to our European allies, and our vital ally, Israel.\n  In the months and years to come, we must make clear to Iran not just \nthat we will not waiver in enforcing the terms of the JCPOA, but also \nthat our commitment to a successful nuclear agreement will not prevent \nus from taking action when Iran's bad behavior warrants it.\n  With that, I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to talk a little about the Court and \nthe vacancy on the Court.\n  First of all, I want to express my shared concern with my good friend \nfrom Delaware about what is happening in Iran and how we are reacting \nto what is happening in Iran and how much we need to be focused on that \ncountry, still understood to be the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism in \nthe world and designated by the current administration and current \nsecurity agencies that it is bad. I am pleased to see that topic is one \nof the things we are talking about today.\n\n\n                  Filling of the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. President, the Supreme Court has gotten a lot of attention since \nthe unfortunate loss of Justice Scalia. When I was home a few days ago, \nin at least one meeting when this question came up, somebody said: \nWell, the Constitution says that the President is supposed to nominate \nsomebody and the Senate is supposed to have hearings.\n  Well, I am not a lawyer. I have been a history teacher, and some days \nthat is better than being a lawyer. In fact, I have argued that most \ndays it might be better than being a lawyer. But when that came up, I \nsaid that is not what the Constitution says at all. It is easy to talk \nabout what the Constitution says, but that is not what the Constitution \nsays. The Constitution says the President will nominate someone to \nserve on the Court, and the Senate will give its advice and consent. \nThis is a 50-50 obligation, a two-part puzzle that has to come together \nbefore this happens.\n  Understand that the people at the Constitutional Convention thought \nabout doing it differently than that. They thought about doing it so \nthat the President would nominate, and if no one in the Senate objected \nor the majority of the Senate didn't object, then the nominee would \njust serve. They decided not to do that. What they decided to do was to \nhave both things happen in order for someone to serve.\n  Early on, it was clear that there were no hearings about who would be \non the Court. There was no Judiciary Committee, and there were no \nhearings to be held. As a rule, either someone was confirmed or often, \nwhen they weren't confirmed, the Senate just didn't deal with the \nnomination because their part of the necessary things that had to come \ntogether wasn't ready to come together.\n  What the Senate has to decide when there is a nomination to the \nSupreme Court is this: Is this the right time for this vacancy to be \nfilled, and then is this the right person?\n  In election years, the Senate for most of the history of the country \nhas decided it wasn't the right time. The last time a vacancy was \nfilled in an election year was March of 1988, but that was a vacancy \nthat occurred in the middle of 1987. Then the Senate, with President \nReagan, went through hearings for Judge Bork, and they looked at Judge \nGinsburg--not the Justice Ginsburg that is currently on the Court, but \nanother Judge Ginsburg--and, eventually, 9 months or so later, Justice \nKennedy was put on the Court. That wasn't a vacancy that occurred in an \nelection year. It took 9 months to fill a vacancy that occurred in the \nyear before the election year.\n  The job of the Senate has always been to decide if this was the right \ntime to do it. The last time a vacancy that was created in an election \nyear was filled was 1932. The last time a vacancy was filled in a \nprevious election year when the House, Senate, and Presidency were of \ndifferent parties was 1888. In 1968, President Johnson tried to move \nAbe Fortas from Justice on the Supreme Court to the Chief Justice, and \nDemocrats in control of the Senate would not let the President fill \nthat vacancy in an election year.\n  The idea that there is anything extraordinary going on here--the case \nhas been made over and over again by our friends on the other side and \neven by the Vice President himself that filling a vacancy in an \nelection year is just something the Senate should be very thoughtful \nabout. If you follow what Vice President Biden said or what Senator \nSchumer said or what Senator Reid said, what they were saying is: Don't \nfill a vacancy in a Presidential election year. They were right.\n  They were right because we are now 7 months from the Presidential \nelection. One of the things people ought to be thinking about is what \nhappens when whoever is elected President puts someone on the Supreme \nCourt for life. This is an appointment that if the person determines \nthat they are going to serve for the entire rest of their life, they \ncan.\n  Justice Scalia, whose death created this vacancy, was put on the \nCourt by Ronald Reagan and served more than a quarter of a century \nafter Ronald Reagan left the Presidency. He was put on the court by \nRonald Reagan and served more than 12 years after Ronald Reagan died. \nThis is a long shadow or a long ray of sunlight, however you want to \nlook at it, that goes out way beyond the life of this President.\n  You can make the argument that, well, we had a Presidential election \nalready, and why couldn't that election that was held in 2012--why \nwouldn't that determine--why wouldn't that be good enough? Well, No. 1, \nit was held in 2012, and following the election that was held in 2014, \nthe American people sent a Republican Senate. The most recent election \nof those two parts it takes to fill this vacancy produced a Republican \nSenate that is at least 50 percent of this determination of who goes on \nthe Court. We can wait.\n  It is not unusual in the history of the country for the Court to have \nan even number. In fact, the first Court had six people. Is there \nanything in the Constitution about the size of the Court? No. The \nConstitution creates a Supreme Court and other courts as the Congress \ndetermines necessary.\n  Originally, there were six Justices on the Court, mostly because that \nis how many circuits the original Congress thought were needed. Those \nSupreme Court Justices each served as a circuit judge in the six \ncircuits in the country.\n\n[[Page S1693]]\n\nSo you actually had something we don't see now, where a Supreme Court \nJustice would sit on an appeals case of a case where that same person \nhad been the original circuit judge, the lower appeal before the Court.\n  There was no thought that the Court was going to be a legislative \nbody, no idea that you would have to worry about a tie-breaker because \nthese six people were supposed to figure out what the Constitution and \nthe law said and reach the conclusion that six good lawyers would \nreach. Very often, in the next 100 years, the Court had an even number. \nIt had a changing number that changed with some frequency, but it \nwasn't seen that the Court couldn't function if somehow there were \nfewer than nine Justices. In fact, there have been at least 15 times \nsince World War II when there were eight Justices. The longest Court \nthat had 8 Justices was 13 months. When Justice Fortas resigned in May \nof 1969, the Democrats in the Senate didn't fill that vacancy until \nJune of 1970--13 months, 8 Justices. No one has come forward talking \nabout what great devastation was done to the country while we were \nwaiting to get the right person for the country--at least what the \nSenate at the time thought was the right person for the country to \nserve for the rest of their working lifetime, which has generally been \nthe standard.\n  When Justices are split, they always have the opportunity to just \ndefer to the lower court and say: Well, there is an appeals court \ndecision here. We can't decide it better than the appeals court did, so \nthat becomes the decision.\n  They also can say: This is complicated enough. You might have \ndiffering views of two different courts of appeals. We need to rehear \nthis at a later date.\n  That also would not be unusual.\n  While only one time in the 20th century have we had a vacancy of over \n300 days, there have been 10 times when the Court had vacancies above \n200 days, 300 days in the life of the Court. Of the 36 people who have \nbeen nominated to the Court who didn't get on the Court under the \nCongress they were nominated, 25 of them didn't have a vote.\n  We are not plowing any new ground. We are not coming up with any new \nlegal philosophy. In fact, we are looking at what the Senate is \nsupposed to do.\n  I think the President of the United States has done exactly what he \nshould do. There is a vacancy, and the President's job is to nominate \nsomebody to fill that vacancy, but often that nominee has not been put \non the Court or not been put on the Court by that Congress at that \ntime.\n  I can speculate that the only good reason for that--certainly in \nrecent years--has been the argument that people need to have a voice in \nthis decision. This is a decision that in all likelihood will outlast \nthe next Presidency. Even if the next Presidency is a two-term \nPresidency, the person who goes on the Court--more likely than not--\nwill serve beyond the time that this President is elected.\n  When John Tyler was President, he nominated nine people. He made nine \nnominations of people who didn't get on the Court. By the time he left \nthe Presidency, I think there were multiple vacancies on the Court \nbecause the Senate was not prepared to confirm the people he nominated. \nProbably their excuse at the time was he was the first Vice President \nto become President, so maybe they wondered, well, maybe this is not \nsomeone who gets the deference of a President, and Presidents in their \nlast year have never received much deference.\n  This is a lifetime appointment. These are important cases. As an \nexample, just look at the cases that are before the Court now. There is \na case on appeal from a Texas Circuit Court where the President--as \nmany of us said at the time, the Court says the President's amnesty \nExecutive decision was way beyond the power of the President. If the \nPresident wants to change immigration laws, he has to come to the \nCongress and change the law.\n  As much as--maybe more--than this President would like to do it, \nPresidents don't have the authority to change the law by themselves. \nThey can do a lot of things with the law, but the one thing they cannot \ndo is change the law. The Texas Court of Appeals said you can't change \nthe law. The Texas Circuit Court said you can't change the law, and we \nwill see what the Supreme Court says about that. If they are tied, \nunless they decide to rehear it, the result will be they cannot change \nthe law. Executive amnesty doesn't work, and you are not going to be \nallowed to make it work.\n  The administration is suing a number of religious entities. One is \nthe Little Sisters of the Poor. The lawsuit is that they are trying to \nforce those entities--Little Sisters of the Poor is an example--to have \nhealth insurance coverage that violates their faith principles. As I \nunderstand it, the purpose of the Little Sisters of the Poor, the order \nof the Little Sisters of the Poor, is something such as this: We are \nhere to serve elderly people without means, no matter what their faith \nis, as if they were Jesus Christ. It doesn't sound like a bad thing for \nsomebody to be willing to do, a Christian organization to serve elderly \npeople without means no matter what their faith is--as if they came to \nthe door and they were Jesus Christ. That is what their order says.\n  Would the United States of America be irreparably harmed if the \ngovernment allowed the Little Sisters of the Poor to have health \ninsurance that met with their faith principles? I don't think so.\n  Would the country be harmed in a significant way if we decide it is \nthe overwhelming purpose of the government to make you do things for no \nparticular reason at all that violates your faith principles? The first \nfreedom in the First Amendment is freedom of religion. I don't think \nthat is by accident. Those are the kinds of cases the Court decides.\n  In a regulatory case that they just heard a few days ago, the \nargument appeared to be with a company in Minnesota that grows peat \nmoss. The EPA is saying we have the authority to regulate navigable \nwaters, and so we are going to get involved in your peat moss farm, \nbecause even though it is 120 miles from any navigable waters, the \nwater from your peat moss farm could run into other water that could \nrun into other water that 120 miles away would run into navigable \nwaters. Look right here in the Clean Air Act. It says we have the \nability to regulate navigable waters.\n  No reasonable person would believe that is what ``navigable waters'' \nmeans, but that is the kind of thing we ask the Supreme Court to do. It \nis not just what the Court will do in the next 7 months. Even if \nsomehow a nominee began the process right now, I think the average has \nbeen about 54 days. That is the 9 months it took to get to Judge \nKennedy and less than that it took to get to somebody else. By the time \nyou are through the 54 days, you are through most of the arguing period \nfor this Court anyway, and you are not supposed to participate in the \ndecision if you didn't hear the argument.\n  This is a lifetime appointment to the Court. This is an appointment \nthat has to be nominated by the President and approved by the Senate. \nThey both have to agree, before it is over, that this is the right \nperson at the right time.\n  I think the history of these nominations and the common sense of \nAmericans would lead them to believe that the American people deserve \nto be heard on a decision that has this much impact and lasts this \nlong.\n  While I am not on the Judiciary Committee, I certainly am supportive \nof the determination that the chairman and others on this committee \nhave made. There will be time to deal with this lifetime appointment \nwhen the American people have had a chance to weigh in one more time 7 \nmonths or so from today.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to address the question \nof the ongoing vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. I listened with great \ninterest to the remarks of my friend and colleague from the State of \nMissouri, and I think we have reached a different conclusion about how \nand when the American people should have their say in the question of \nthe filling of this vacancy.\n  In my view, vacancies on the Supreme Court of the United States have \nconsequences, and vacancies that go on for a great length of time have \neven bigger consequences. I don't believe there has been a vacancy that \nhas\n\n[[Page S1694]]\n\nlasted a year since roughly the time of the Civil War. Although we \ndon't know this today, we don't know how long this vacancy may last.\n  My concern is that in the absence of a willingness to meet with the \nPresident's nominee--to hold hearings and to proceed to a vote--should \nthat position remain firm on the part of my colleagues on the other \nside, we are likely looking at a year-long vacancy.\n  I certainly agree with my colleague, my friend from Missouri, that \nthe Supreme Court plays an absolutely central role in our \nconstitutional order. As he recited at length, the cases decided are of \ngreat significance. I bring to my colleague's attention that in recent \nweeks, on March 22 and March 29, the Court handed down tied decisions \nin two central cases. These four decisions are not just a waste of \njudicial resources, they fail to provide clarity to the litigants, the \nAmerican people, and leave lower courts without a controlling \nprecedent.\n  In the 3 weeks since President Obama did his job under the \nConstitution and nominated Chief Judge Merrick Garland to fill the \nvacancy created by the untimely passing of Justice Scalia, we have \nalready seen these consequences of the Senate's refusal to engage \nproactively in advice and consent and consider this nomination.\n  Much has been made of what was said on this floor by my predecessor \nin this seat, the now-Vice President, then-chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, former Senator Joe Biden. I just wish to draw my \ncolleague's attention to the entire remarks made by Senator Biden. His \nentire remarks include a section near the end where he said that if the \nPresident--there was not then a vacancy on the Supreme Court--would \nconsult with the Senate and moderate in his choice and advance a \nconsensus candidate, that candidate might well be deserving of it, \nmight well win then-Senator Biden's support, as had been the case in \nseveral other nominations.\n  I will simply put to my friend and my colleague that President Obama \nhas advanced for our consideration a nomination in Chief Judge Garland \nwho is genuinely qualified and who has a long record in his 19 years on \nthe DC Circuit of rendering decisions that put him right in the center \nof the American judiciary.\n  I very much look forward to having the opportunity to meet with him \nin person tomorrow. I think it is important that all of us give the \ndeference and respect to the President's constitutional role implicit \nin our being willing to meet with his nominee. Frankly, I have profound \nquestions about whether advice and consent by this body can be given by \nrefusing to hold hearings and refusing to take a vote.\n  My Republican colleagues, friends, have asserted that the American \npeople should have a voice in the selection of the next Supreme Court \nJustice, and I agree. I think the best way for the American people to \nexercise that voice is for this body to do its job, for the Senate \nJudiciary Committee to conduct full, fair, and open hearings, and to \nallow Judge Garland to answer searching questions of the sort that many \nof us are asking him privately, but then we should ask publicly and \nthen have a vote--a vote by the people's representatives in this body.\n  That is the purpose of this Senate. There has been an election for \nPresident, the President has done his job under the Constitution, and \nwe have a nominee. This is a fully constituted Senate--some of us in \nour last year of service, some in our sixth, and some in our first or \nsecond. We can be the appropriate channel of the people's voice \nfollowing an open hearing, and we should cast a vote. We should not \nleave this Supreme Court with a vacancy that lasts months and months, \nmaybe as long as a year.\n  Every term the Supreme Court receives over 7,000 petitions for \ncertiorari. The Supreme Court hears a carefully chosen fraction of \nthose cases, weighing constitutional principles and legal issues that \nare dividing the circuit courts. It is a sacred duty, a central duty in \nour constitutional order for the Supreme Court to be rendering \nimportant and meaningful decisions. Why would we delay the filling of \nthis vacancy on the Supreme Court a full year? I can't see the value in \nthat position. I understand many of my colleagues have cited precedent, \nhave cited history, and have reached different conclusions than me.\n  I simply hope the 16 of my Republican colleagues who have expressed a \nwillingness to meet with Judge Garland will continue to grow and that \nmore of my colleagues will meet with him and then consider carefully \nwhat the consequences are for our role in advice and consent, not just \nfor this vacancy but for the many more that may follow in the decades \nto come.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, I come to the floor \nevery week or so to share the stories of those victims who have been \nlost to the epidemic of gun violence that is plaguing this Nation. The \nnews covers the episodes of mass shootings, such as those that happened \nin my State in Sandy Hook, but, of course, on average there are 80 \npeople who are killed in episodes of gun violence every day. \nApproximately 50 or so of those are suicides, the remaining 30 are in \nones and twos and threes and fours and fives all across the country.\n  I think the data alone is overwhelming, and I am not sure why the \nnumbers alone have not caused us to act. There are a variety of ways \nthat we could step up and act. We could do something about illegal guns \non the street, we could fix our broken mental health care system, and \nwe could give law enforcement more power so they could track illegal \nguns and criminals. But we don't do any of that. We remain silent and \ncomplicit even with this rash of murder.\n  The data hasn't moved this Congress, and so my hope is that the \nstories of those who have been lost and the families they have left \nbehind might move this place to action. So today I will focus on those \nvictims of gun homicides who were at the hands of their domestic \npartner. Of those 30 or so people who are killed by guns that are not \nsuicides, an alarming percentage of them every single day are killed by \nsomeone they know--a husband or a spouse or a boyfriend. It is usually \nsomeone who is very close to them. They often leave notes. Oftentimes \nthey have notified the police that they were in danger, but somehow \nthat loved one still managed to find a way to get their hands on a \nfirearm and to commit the heinous act of murder.\n  On February 27 of this year in Woodbridge, VA, which is only a short \ndrive away from where we sit today, Crystal Hamilton was killed. \nCrystal's friends described her as kind, humble, and energetic--a \nwonderful person. She actually spent her time working with wounded \nsoldiers returning from Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  One of her friends said:\n\n       She was so beautiful. She dressed to the nines and loved \n     her high heels. She didn't need any makeup.\n\n  She had an 11-year-old son who is now left without a mother. She was \nsupposed to be going out one Saturday night for a girls' night with a \ngroup of her friends, but after arguing all day with her husband, she \nfinally called 911. She was really upset and feeling gravely in danger, \nand it is believed that at some point between when she called 911 and \nwhen the police arrived, her husband fatally shot her.\n  A neighbor said that she saw the 11-year-old running away and looking \nback at the house as he ran down the street. She said:\n\n       He ran so fast I can't even imagine how scared he must have \n     been. It broke my heart.\n\n  About a month later, on March 29--just about 2 weeks ago--Ruby \nStiglmeier was shot and killed in what was believed to have been a \nmurder-suicide by her boyfriend. Ruby was a dental hygienist in a small \nfirm in Orchard Park, NY. She worked there for 20 years. Her coworkers \nsaid that her patients absolutely loved Ruby. Ruby was friendly, \noutgoing, athletic, and loved life. Her coworkers said that Ruby had \nbeen a rock for her family after the recent deaths of both of her\n\n[[Page S1695]]\n\nparents. Her boyfriend shot her three times before turning the gun on \nhimself. They had been dating on and off for about 2 years.\n  Just last week, Christina Fisher, 34 years old, was killed in \nLeesburg, VA. She was the proud mother of three young children, a \nteenage daughter and two young boys. She was shot multiple times and \nkilled inside her home on Saturday evening, April 2, by her ex-\nboyfriend during a domestic dispute. Her 15-year-old daughter was home \nat the time of the altercation and promptly called 911, but by the time \nshe got to the hospital, it was too late.\n  Her friends remembered Christina much in the same way as the previous \nvictims. They said:\n\n       [Christina] was so sweet, so caring . . . she was a great \n     mom. She did everything she could for her kids.\n\n  Christina leaves behind her teenage daughter and two young boys.\n  This is just a sample of three people in the last 3 months who have \nbeen killed in episodes of gun homicides by their boyfriend, domestic \npartner, or husband. We should just know that there is something \nhappening in the United States that isn't happening anywhere else in \nthe world. As a woman, you are about 10 times more likely to die in an \nepisode of domestic violence by your husband or boyfriend than you are \nin any other OECD country. It is hard not to read the difference as \nanything other than a difference in gun laws--a difference in the \nnumber of guns that are available to people who would decide to murder \ntheir spouse. Why? Because there is no evidence that men are less \nviolent in any of these other countries. There is no evidence that \nthese countries spend any more money on mental health. In fact, the \nUnited States, on average, likely spends more. But there is nothing \ndifferent about the United States other than the number of guns that we \nhave and the relatively loose gun laws that create this tragic outlier \nstatus.\n\n  The data on a State-by-State basis backs up the idea that there is \nsomething about our gun laws that tells us the story of women being in \ndanger and being killed by their spouse. What we know is that in States \nthat do require a background check for every handgun that is sold, \nthere are 38 percent fewer women who are shot to death by an intimate \npartner. We can't get around that fact. In States that are universal in \ntheir application of background checks, there are 38 percent fewer \nwomen shot by their intimate partner. You can't argue about that. There \nare States that are universal in their applicability of background \nchecks and there are States that are not. The data on women murdered by \ntheir husbands with guns is publicly available. It is not a 5, 10, 20, \nor 25 percent difference. It is a 38-percent difference.\n  Women's lives could be saved if we required people to go through \nbackground checks. Why is that? Well, because there have been 250,000 \ngun sales that have been blocked to domestic abusers since the National \nInstant Criminal Background Check System was started. These are people \nwho were convicted of domestic abuse crimes and known to be domestic \nabusers, walked into a gun store, tried to buy a gun, and were stopped \nfrom doing so because of the Federal law.\n  Now, that is just the number of people who walked into the store and \nhad the audacity to try to buy a gun even though they knew they had \nbeen convicted of domestic abuse. Again, that number is 250,000. \nObviously there are 10 times that number who never walked into the gun \ndealership because they knew they weren't going to be able to buy the \nweapon. So guess where they went. They went online or to gun shows. In \n2012 alone it is estimated that 6.6 million guns were exchanged in \nprivate transfers without a criminal background check. In just 1 year \nalone, over 6 million guns were transferred without the purchaser \nhaving to prove that they weren't a domestic abuser or that they hadn't \ncommitted murder in the past with a weapon. It is easy to buy guns at \ngun shows or online, and so that is why 90 percent of Americans believe \nthat we should have universal background checks--because it works and \nbecause increasingly people who want to buy guns and use them for \nmalevolent purposes are able to do so outside of the criminal \nbackground check system.\n  The numbers are not small, and 38 percent fewer women die in States \nthat do universal background checks. The States that have decided to \nfill the loophole that we, as a Congress, have created have 38 percent \nfewer women die from gunshot wounds. We have blood on our hands because \nif we just got together and closed that loophole, the data tells us \nthere would be fewer deaths.\n  Let me close by suggesting a couple of other ways that we could try \nto address this epidemic of domestic abuse and gun homicide perpetuated \nby intimate partners. Let me first do so by telling the story of Lori \nJackson, who was 32 years old when she died in 2014 in Oxford, CT.\n  Lori and her husband Scott had a long and difficult history together. \nAll of her friends knew about the difficulty that the two of them were \nhaving. It finally caused Lori to go and submit an application for a \ntemporary restraining order. Scott had become that violent. In the \napplication she wrote:\n\n       Scott yelled in my face . . . and got very angry. I felt \n     threatened and told him I didn't feel safe and was going to \n     leave with the twins.\n\n  She had 18-month-old twins.\n  She said:\n\n       He then told me I wasn't going anywhere and grabbed my \n     right thumb and twisted my wrist.\n\n  That happened while the two children were in her arms.\n  She said:\n\n       He acts out violently and I am afraid for my kids and \n     myself.\n\n  Judge Robert Malone ordered Scott to stay away from his wife and the \ntwo 18-month-old twins. But because there is a loophole in the law that \nallows you to buy and own guns while you have a temporary restraining \norder--not when you have a permanent restraining order--one day before \nthat temporary restraining order was going to become permanent, Scott \nshot Lori Jackson Gellatly four times in the head and torso with a .38-\ncaliber handgun. So today her two little twins have no mother, their \nfather is in jail, and the twins will grow up only hearing stories \nabout her. Why? Because we can't pass a bill that says when you have a \ntemporary restraining order against you, you shouldn't be able to buy a \ngun. During that moment of terror for the domestic spouse, the police \nshould be able to go in and see if you have weapons that you might use \nin that immediate moment of anger. We could come together on that. We \ncould come together on simply saying that while you have a temporary \nrestraining order, you can't buy guns. You are on the list of \nprohibited purchasers during a restraining order period of time. If we \nhad done that prior to 2014, Lori Jackson might be alive today.\n  Let's take the case of Jennifer Magnano. She was killed in \nTerryville, CT, in 2007. She was in the process of trying to end her \nmarriage to her husband Scott, who was a controlling and abusive \nhusband. Scott and Jennifer had two children, and Jennifer had an older \ndaughter who had been sexually abused by Scott for about 3 years.\n  On April 14, 2007, while he was taking a shower, she finally escaped. \nAfter the end of their time together, Scott became so angry that he \ncame back to their house and murdered her. She was always posting \ninspirational sayings on to Web sites. She was a really positive \nperson, but that couldn't stop her husband from murdering her.\n  Now, Scott had a protective order that was permanent. So he was \nactually prohibited from purchasing a weapon, but he walked into a gun \nstore and asked to see two handguns. He was handed weapons and the \nammunition for each of them, and despite being the only customer in the \nstore, he was left alone. He saw an opportunity, and so he walked out \nof the store with the handguns and the ammunition and went straight to \nkill his wife. Now, the store didn't report the stolen weapons for 3 \ndays. By that time, it was too late. Had they monitored the weapons so \nthey couldn't have been taken out of the store or reported the stolen \nweapons, it is possible Jennifer might be still alive today.\n\n  Well, the administrator of Jennifer's estate filed a lawsuit against \nthe retailer bringing claims regarding their inability to secure the \nweapons and their complete inability to notify local law enforcement \nthat somebody, who they themselves said looked like a suspicious \ncustomer, stole weapons from the store. The judge dismissed that\n\n[[Page S1696]]\n\nlawsuit, saying a statute Congress passed giving gunmakers and dealers \nvirtual immunity for their actions ``goes directly to the heart of the \njurisdiction here.'' Congress was clear these cases must be dismissed. \nCongress has granted gunmakers and gun dealers almost complete immunity \nfrom lawsuits that would hold them liable for irresponsibly selling \nweapons or irresponsibly making unsafe weapons.\n  The fact is, the gun industry is held to a standard that no other \nproduct maker is held to. They are granted an immunity that is carved \nout from the broader products liability law. In fact, the maker of a \ntoy gun is held to a higher standard of liability than a maker of a \nreal gun. This Congress passed that statute simply because the gun \nindustry asked for it and because they knew they were liable for making \nguns that were intentionally unsafe because they knew there were \ndealers that were conducting their activities in an irresponsible \nmanner.\n  So for the Magnano family, they don't even get to bring their case to \ncourt. They don't even get to litigate this claim simply because \nCongress has given a level of immunity to the gun industry that they \ngive to no other industry. If we were to repeal that law, it would be \nanother way to address this epidemic of gun violence that plagues this \ncountry and specifically women who have the great misfortune of being \nthe subject of domestic abuse.\n  I am going to continue to come down to the floor and tell these \nstories. I hope there are ways we can come together. I understand we \nmight not be able to pass a background checks amendment between now and \nthe end of the year, but we could close that domestic violence \nloophole. We could put more resources into the mental health system. We \ncould give more resources to law enforcement. There has to be an answer \nto the thousands of women who are being killed all across this country \nby domestic abusers and 80 individuals a day who are being killed by \nguns all across the United States of America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield back.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be on the Senate floor as \nwe begin the debate and discussion of legislation that I think is \ncritical to certainly my home State of Kansas and important and \nvaluable to the rest of the Nation as well. Kansas is known as an \naviation State. Wichita, KS, is known as the air capital of the world, \nand one would expect a Senator from Kansas to be especially supportive \nof things that improve the opportunity for aviation, and that is \ncertainly true.\n  We care about the jobs that are in our State as a result of general \naviation manufacturing, as a result of aviation manufacturing for large \ncommercial airlines, and it matters. The FAA is an important component \nof the environment in our State as a driver of our State's economy, but \nI also point out that I am a strong supporter of general aviation and \nreauthorization of the FAA as a result of representing a very rural \nState. Kansas is made up of a number of larger communities, but small \ncities and towns dot our State. Those local airports and the ability to \nconnect with those communities as a result of general aviation--the \nability to fly to visit somebody but perhaps more importantly the \nability for a business to be in a community, a small rural community--\nexist in part because of those general aviation airports and those \nplanes and pilots. So in communities across our State, we are able to \nhave manufacturing and service industries that probably otherwise, in \nthe absence of an airport and aviation, would have to be located in \nlarger cities in Kansas or elsewhere.\n  GA and FAA reauthorization is important to every Kansan, regardless \nof whether they are a factory line worker or engineer in Wichita and \nSouth Central Kansas or whether they are a hospital, a manufacturing \nbusiness, or a service located in a small community in our State.\n  I am pleased the Senate is beginning to do its work on the FAA \nreauthorization. I serve on the Committee on Commerce responsible for \nthis product, and I am pleased the chairman and ranking member have \nworked closely together to get us to this point today in a bill that I \nhope--I assume subject to some amendments--I hope this bill then passes \nwith strong support across both sides of the aisle.\n  This FAA Reauthorization Act of 2016 will strengthen the industry by \nimproving the FAA's process for certifying aircraft. Again, in that \nmanufacturing sector in our State, one of the things that would be of \ngreat value is to have a process by which an improvement, a \ndevelopment, the manufacturing process, the product we manufacture is \nmore readily and more quickly, more efficiently certified by the \nFederal Aviation Administration, making certain that those \ncertifications allow those airplane manufacturers to compete in the \nglobal marketplace.\n  This bill also addresses the Pilot's Bill of Rights. I see I have \nbeen joined on the Senate floor by the Senator from Oklahoma, the \nchampion of this issue. We are pleased it is in this bill, and it \nreforms, among other things, the third-class medical certificate \nprocess for general aviation pilots--something that has been long \noverdue and something the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, has \nchampioned and continues to champion. Just this week, he called me \nasking for assistance as we make certain that this bill advances and \nthe House approves language that is included in this bill.\n  Another essential piece of this bill text, S. 2549, is the TSA \nFairness Act. This is a bipartisan piece of legislation that was \noriginally introduced by Senator Merkley and Senator Barrasso. The \nlanguage provides protection for some of our small airports that have \ncommercial air service. Generally, it is possible that air service is \nthere, that small commercial airline flight is there because of the \nEssential Air Service Program, but in order for Essential Air Service \nto work and to meet the needs of a community and the traveling public, \nwe need to make certain the TSA, the Transportation Security \nAdministration, provides the necessary screeners and screening \nequipment that you would find in a larger airport.\n  We want to make certain our rural communities that have commercial \nservice--often flying to Denver International Airport--are screened \nbefore they enter the plane to fly to DIA, and this legislation \nincludes language that would enhance that circumstance.\n  I am also encouraged by the efforts in this bill to address the \nrapidly evolving circumstance we face with unmanned aerial vehicles. \nThat industry is moving forward, again another Kansas industry that \nmatters greatly. This legislation moves the ball forward for an \nenvironment where businesses, universities, and countless others can \ntap into the potential and the vast economic benefits of UASs, while \nmaintaining high safety standards we would expect in the aviation \nworld.\n  I know my colleagues remember--I remember well--the 23 short-term FAA \nreauthorizations that have occurred leading up to the 2012 FAA \nreauthorization bill. It is hugely detrimental to our aviation system \nto have to tolerate, to have to figure out how to abide by these short-\nterm extensions that eliminate the opportunity for long-term planning \nand create great uncertainty. I am pleased we are headed down the path \nof a longer term, more permanent FAA Reauthorization Act represented by \nthis legislation, this act of 2016.\n  I would ask my colleagues to work, all of us together, to make sure \nthe end product is something we can be proud of. We certainly start in \na position in which that is the case.\n  Again, I commend Mr. Thune, the Senator from South Dakota, for his \nleadership and working with the Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, \ngetting us to this point today. This is an important piece of \nlegislation for our country, its economy, and our citizens, and matters \ngreatly to the folks back in Kansas.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S1697]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent to \nbe recognized as in morning business to use as much time as I shall \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I want to comment that I have dramatically \nshortened my presentation, as I was crossing off things from my list \nthat have already been more eloquently expressed by my friend from \nKansas, and I think it shows. He brought out a point I think is \nsignificant; that the first of the year we were able to pass the \nhighway bill, which is a major piece of legislation. It is the first \ntime since 1998 we were able to get that reauthorization bill, and it \nwas because of the interim period of time we had the short-term fixes \nthat the Senator from Kansas was talking about. Those are expensive, \nand you can't do major overhauls, improvements, and modernization \nunless you have an authorization bill, and this covers a lot of areas.\n  I want to repeat one thing the Senator from Kansas stated, and that \nis in reference to Senators Thune and Nelson. Any time you--and I would \nsay this to all of the members of the Commerce Committee--any time you \nget a major piece of legislation that covers a lot of stuff, there is \nalways a lot of confusion and some opposition, although not as much \nopposition to this as we had anticipated would be taking place.\n  So there are areas I want to visit that I have a special interest in. \nOne is the certification process for general aviation pilots. I know \nthis was mentioned by Senator Moran, but this is something that is very \nsignificant. I want to cover it in perhaps a little bit more detail, \nalong with the other areas and an amendment we have. I am getting a lot \nof Democratic support on my amendment, amending the use of drones, the \nallowable use of drones.\n  First of all, on the Pilot's Bill of Rights, I refresh everyone's \nmemory that the first Pilot's Bill of Rights was something we passed in \n2012. It was one that for the first time took care of a problem that \nhad been out there. The only group of people in America who did not \nhave the opportunity of the protections, the legal protections in our \njurisprudence system, was general aviation pilots and other pilots \nbecause it allowed the FAA to come in and make all kinds of accusations \nwithout giving people the benefit of the evidence that was being used \nagainst them. We passed a good bill called the Pilot's Bill of Rights.\n  Last year, in Oshkosh--Oshkosh is the largest general aviation event \nof the year. It is one that involves hundreds of thousands of people \nand actually thousands of aircraft on the field. I say to the Presiding \nOfficer, I can remember this was the 37th annual convention that I have \nattended and flown in, in the last 37 years, so I am very familiar with \nthis. Of course, when I got there, they were interested in the \nsuccesses that were in the Pilot's Bill of Rights, but there are some \nthings that weren't in there that should have been in there. So we had \na session with people--I mean, there are people from all 50 States and \ncountries around the world, and so one of the areas of concern has been \nabout the medical certification process. It is called a third-class \nmedical. A third-class medical is something that goes into a lot of \nthings that are not necessary and sometimes deter the safety factor \nthat is built into medical certification. So we reformed that system.\n\n  By the way, I have to say that we have already passed this bill in \nthe Senate. The last thing we did before breaking for Christmas, 10 \nminutes before we recessed, was to pass a freestanding bill that is \nworded exactly the same way that is in this bill. This is a backup. \nSince that got bogged down in the House for a period of time, we \nthought we would put this in here just to make sure that one way or \nanother this does become a reality. It is singularly the greatest \nconcern for large organizations, including the Experimental Aircraft \nAssociation and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the AOPA.\n  We put a system in there that provides--first of all, the pilots will \nstill have to do some of the elements of what was considered to be a \nthird-class medical. A third-class medical--10 years ago we repealed \nthat, or reformed it, for pilots of very small aircraft, the light \naircraft. In fact, there hasn't been one injury or death in the last 10 \nyears that could be related to anything, any change that was made in \nthat system. So this just allows the other pilots to have the same \nbenefits the pilots did in the small aircraft.\n  Pilots still have to complete an online medical education course. \nPilots are going to have to maintain verification that they have seen a \ndoctor concerning anything that might impair their ability to safely \nfly an airplane. Pilots have to complete a comprehensive medical review \ninitially by the FAA. So those safeguards are built in.\n  The Pilot's Bill of Rights 2 increases its due process protections \nestablished for pilots in the original Pilot's Bill of Rights. The \noriginal Pilot's Bill of Rights--since I have been active in aviation \nfor over 60 years, it was only natural that when problems came up, \npeople would contact me as opposed to their own Senators, in many \ncases. I was concerned and always tried to help people. But until those \nabuses occurred to me, and I realized all of a sudden that I was at \nrisk of losing a pilot certificate and didn't have the means to defend \nmyself--that is when this whole effort started.\n  Well, this was carried out in the reforms that we intended to put in \nthe first bill that were not really strong enough to get the FAA to \ncomply with, which we have in this bill. One of those is called NOTAMs, \nNotices to Airmen.\n  By the way, when I talk about this, this doesn't mean a lot to a lot \nof other people, but there are 590,000 single-issue general aviation \npilots in America to whom it means a lot. So these guys are all very \nmuch concerned about it, and they are all anxious for this to become a \nreality.\n  A Notice to Airmen is something that is required and has been \nrequired for a long period of time so that people will know--if you are \ngoing to make a flight from airport A to airport B, if there is any \nproblem at that airport where you are going to land in terms of work on \nthe runway or in terms of lights being out or new towers being erected \nor something like that, they have NOTAMs, which are Notices to Airmen. \nSo this is going to carry into reality the reform that we intended to \ndo in 2012.\n  It also ensures that pilots are going to have access to the flight \ndata, such as air traffic communication tapes and that type of thing. \nSo it is good. I know it doesn't mean a lot to a lot of other people, \nbut it sure does to 509,000 people.\n  The contract towers--this is a major program. It is kind of \ninteresting. We established a program of contract towers intended to \nreach areas that didn't really have the unique, normal necessity of \ninformation and assistance that we would have in normal towers, and the \ntowers do a great job. And I am now talking about the regular towers, \nbut the contract towers have also done a good job.\n  In 2013 the Obama administration targeted our Nation's air traffic \ncontrol towers as an unnecessary mechanism to make the public feel the \npain of nondefense budget cuts. Well, that was back during \nsequestration time, and at that time they were going to close all of \nthe contract towers. They were saying that these towers don't--one of \nthe arguments they used is that they don't have the traffic that many \nother towers have. Well, I suggest to my colleagues that in my State of \nOklahoma, we have a number of great universities and colleges, and the \ntwo largest are Oklahoma State University and Oklahoma University. They \nare located in Stillwater, OK, and Norman, OK. I can tell my colleagues \nright now that if they had been successful in closing down those two \ncontract towers, on football days, when we have literally hundreds of \nairplanes coming in, all converging at about the same time, it would \nhave been a life-threatening event. We now have been able to maintain \nthose contract towers in a cost-sharing program that has been very \nsuccessful in the past, and that is in this bill also.\n  Aircraft certification is an issue some of us are very concerned \nabout. The Oklahoma aerospace industry is a vital and growing component \nof the State's economy. It is responsible for billions of dollars of \neconomic output and employs thousands of people. The aerospace industry \nin Oklahoma includes commercial, military, and general aviation \nmanufacturing, testing\n\n[[Page S1698]]\n\nand maintenance activities, as well as a vibrant and cutting-edge \nculture of research and development that is located in my State of \nOklahoma. Both of our major universities are an important part of this.\n\n  With this in mind, I applaud the bill's inclusion of reforms to the \nFAA's process for certifying general aviation aircraft and aviation \nproducts such as engines and avionics, removing government redtape that \nis so prevalent that we are all so sensitive to and aware of.\n  The bill also ensures that the FAA maintains strong engagement with \nindustry stakeholders, so the FAA's safety oversight and certification \nprocess includes performance-based objectives and tracks performance-\nbased metrics. This is key to eliminating bureaucratic delays and \nhaving increased accountability between the FAA and the aviation \ncommunity for type certificate resolution or the installation of \nsafety-enhancing technology on small general aviation aircraft.\n  Now, I have an amendment. The Senator from Kansas was talking about \nsome of the uses and restrictions and the expansion of the use of the \nUAVs. We are talking about drones now. Drones sometimes have a bad \nreputation, and normally it is not well-founded. But there are some \nareas where there were restrictions in the use of drones, which we \nare--I have an amendment that will allow drones to be used in areas \nwhere it does make sense. I already have several Democratic supporters \nand cosponsors of this amendment, including Senator Whitehouse and \nSenator Heitkamp and Senator Booker, who are all very enthused about \nthis.\n  It would direct the FAA to establish rules to allow critical \ninfrastructure owners and operators to use unmanned aircraft systems to \ncarry out federally mandated patrols of an area, and that could be a \npipeline or anything else that is currently being patrolled, some by \nfoot and some by aircraft, and this would allow unmanned aircraft to do \nthat same thing. It is a safety thing because some of these patrols \nhave to take place in bad weather and sometimes risk is involved. But \nif you don't have a person in the airplane--an unmanned plane--then \nthis is an ideal use for it. It does establish a pathway for critical \ninfrastructure operators to use the airspace under the FAA guidelines. \nIt is still under FAA guidelines, but nonetheless it is an opportunity \nto use it.\n  Today, critical infrastructure owners and operators are required to \ncomply with significant requirements to monitor facilities and assets, \nwhich can stretch thousands of miles. This is something to which I \nthink there should not be any opposition. We haven't had anyone whom I \nhave asked to be a cosponsor deny us so far, and I don't anticipate \nthat we will have a problem.\n  The amendment is supported by a wide array of stakeholders, including \nthe National Rural Electric Cooperative, the American Public Power \nAssociation, Edison Electric Institute, CTIA--The Wireless Association, \nthe American Gas Association, the Interstate Natural Gas Association of \nAmerica, the American Petroleum Institute, and I could go on and on. So \nfar, there is neither organized nor just normal opposition, as one \nwould normally find, so it is very popular. No one that I know of is \nagainst it. This is an amendment I will be offering as soon as we start \nworking on amendments. This amendment will make this bill an even \nbetter bill.\n  Again, I applaud all the work that has been done by the members of \nthe Commerce Committee and particularly by the chairman and the ranking \nmember, Senators Thune and Nelson, in getting this done. We are getting \ninto an area where we are really being productive in this body, and I \nam very proud to be a part of it.\n  We need to keep our eyes open on this. I would encourage any Members \nwho have amendments they want to be included in this to come to the \nfloor with their amendments and do what I am doing right now so that we \ncan get in the queue, we can get started and get this done. I don't \nknow when we are anticipating finishing this bill, but I don't see any \nreason why we can't do it, if everyone gets amendments done, by the end \nof next week.\n  With that, I will yield the floor. I think we have several speakers \nlined up who are going to be here.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an amendment \nwhich Senator Toomey and I are working on, amendment No. 3458. I will \nhave some remarks about this amendment, as will my colleague from \nPennsylvania, Senator Toomey.\n  We know that since 9/11, we have made a good deal of progress on \nairline security, but we know there are still a number of commonsense \nsteps we can take to bolster security at our airports and on our \nairplanes. We also know that since 9/11, there have been 15 hijacking \nattempts around the world, and we know that terrorists still aim to \nrepeat those actions and improve on their deadly tactics. It is also a \nconcern that Federal programs designed to increase aviation security, \nsuch as the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program--the acronym being \nFFDO--to train and arm pilots, continue to experience drastic cuts and \nreduced budgets.\n  After 9/11, Congress mandated the installation of reinforced cockpit \ndoors, and the FAA regulations stated that the reinforced cockpit doors \nshould remain locked while closed. However, pilots and flight \nattendants must open the door frequently for a variety of reasons, all \nof them reasons we understand, whether it is to use the restroom, get a \nmeal, or rest times for pilots on international flights when they are \nnot in the cockpit. So we know they have to open that door on a regular \nbasis. Simulations have shown that when the door of the cockpit is \nopen, the cockpit can, in fact, be breached and the plane can be \nhijacked--by one estimate, in less than 4 seconds.\n  A voluntary airline industry movement toward adopting secondary \nbarriers--meaning a barrier other than the actual cockpit door--began \nin 2003, but a commitment to deploying these devices has waned \nsignificantly since the year 2010.\n  Senator Toomey and I have submitted an amendment that would close a \ngaping hole in our airline aviation security systems, thus achieving \nwhat Congress intended when it mandated installation of the fortress \ndoor after 9/11. The amendment we are working on together is named \nafter a Bucks County, PA, resident, Captain Victor Saracini, who \npiloted United Flight 175 when it was hijacked by terrorists and flown \ninto the World Trade Center. The amendment would require that each new \ncommercial aircraft install a barrier other than the cockpit door to \nprevent access to the flight deck of an aircraft.\n  A secondary cockpit barrier is a lightweight wire mesh gate installed \nbetween the passenger cabin and the cockpit door that is locked into \nplace and blocks access to the flight deck. While the cockpit doors are \ncurrently reinforced, secondary barriers provide significantly more \nsecurity to airline companies, their employees, the pilots, and, of \ncourse, more security for passengers as well.\n  A 2007 study concluded that the secondary barrier dramatically \nimproves the effectiveness of the other onboard security measures \ncurrently in place and also works as a stand-alone security layer and \nis the most cost-effective, efficient, and safest way to protect the \ncockpit.\n  There is no way to fully and completely pay tribute to the \nextraordinary courage of Captain Saracini and the others who were lost \non that tragic day. He gave the full measure of his life--as Lincoln \nsaid in another context, the last full measure of devotion to his \ncountry. He also, of course, gave the full measure not only for his \nNation but for his wife Ellen and his family. Ellen, whom I have come \nto know, and others have worked tirelessly in the years since to \nincrease airline safety for other pilots, passengers, and the airlines \nthemselves.\n  I am urging our colleagues in the Senate to adopt this amendment to \ncontinue to strengthen and secure our Nation's airspace and to further \nimprove airline safety.\n\n[[Page S1699]]\n\n  I look forward to hearing Senator Toomey's remarks, and I am grateful \nto be working with him on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to thank Senator Casey for his great work on this. We have \nbeen partnering on getting this accomplished for some time now. This is \nthe opportunity to do it. This is the right legislative vehicle. This \nis the right bill. This is the FAA reauthorization bill. This is \nexactly where we ought to be taking a commonsense step toward making \ncommercial aircraft safer. It is as simple as that.\n  I am hoping that very soon we will adopt the motion to proceed so \nthat we are on the bill. We have already filed this amendment. As soon \nas we can, we will bring it up so that it is pending, so that we can \nadopt this amendment.\n  This passed the House Transportation Committee unanimously. I don't \nknow why it wouldn't have the same outcome here. I want us to get on \nthis bill, I want to offer this amendment, and I want to get on with \nthis because Senator Casey is exactly right. In the immediate aftermath \nof that appalling attack on September 11, Congress passed legislation \nto require that the cabin door be reinforced, become a stronger \nbarrier, and that is exactly what happened. It is a terrific barrier. \nIt is very hard to see how anyone could break down the cabin door and \naccess the cockpit when that door is closed. The problem is that the \ndoor is not always closed. As Senator Casey pointed out, it is \nnecessarily opened from time to time during a flight. This creates the \nthreat. It creates the opportunity for a terrorist who is so inclined \nto rush that open door. A very well reinforced door is useless when \nopen, but that is the risk.\n  That isn't just our assessment; the FAA has acknowledged the very \nserious nature of this threat. Let me quote from their April 2015 \nadvisory. The FAA said:\n\n       On long fights, as a matter of necessity, crewmembers must \n     open the flight deck door to access lavatory facilities, to \n     transfer meals to flightcrew members, or to switch crew \n     positions for crew rest purposes. The opening and closing of \n     the flight deck door (referred to as ``door transition'') \n     reduces the protective anti-intrusion/anti-penetration \n     benefits of the reinforced door. . . . During this door \n     transition, the flight deck is vulnerable.\n\n  This is not some theory; this is an objective fact. It is observed by \nthe FAA advisory. The 9/11 Commission also observed that terrorists \nwere very keyed in to the notion that the best time to strike would be \nwhen the door was open. That was at a time when the primary door was \nnot as reinforced as it is now. The opening of the door clearly creates \nthe opportunity for terrorists. This threat is real. It persists. There \nhave been attempts to breach cockpits since 9/11. There have been \nsuccessful attempts, including the successful hijacking of a Turkish \nAirlines flight in 2006.\n  We know that the secondary barrier Senator Casey and I are proposing \nwould be extremely effective. It is low cost, it is lightweight, and it \nis not intrusive. It is not deployed at all except immediately prior to \nopening the primary door. This is just a commonsense solution. It will \nprovide a significant upgrade in the safety of these aircraft.\n  We have an amendment. It has been filed, and as soon as we can, we \nwould like to make this pending. I would urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment. Let's get this adopted. Let's pass the FAA \nreauthorization bill and get it to the President.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Commerce Committee for all their hard work on this FAA \nreauthorization bill. The Commerce Committee has done very hard work on \nit. I am especially pleased the committee included a provision that \ndirectly affects my home State and the city in which I live, Phoenix, \nAZ.\n  Since September of 2014, residents in Arizona around the Phoenix Sky \nHarbor International Airport have had their daily lives impacted by \nchanges to flight paths. These changes were made without formal \nnotification to the airport or community engagement before the changes \nwere implemented.\n  These flight changes in Phoenix were made as part of the Federal \nAviation Administration's ongoing implementation of NextGen. I support \nthe aims of NextGen to improve the safety and efficiency of air travel \nand modernize our Nation's air space. We will all benefit from the \nimprovements that come from NextGen, and this provision is not intended \nto undermine those efforts or diminish the efficiencies that have \nalready been achieved through NextGen.\n  However, the experience my constituents have gone through in Arizona \ndemonstrates that improvements need to be made to the process \nsurrounding the implementation of NextGen. The airport and affected \ncommunity must be part of the process before these changes are made.\n  It is important that those on the ground--the individuals who have \ntheir daily lives impacted the most by this process--have an \nopportunity to be heard. Input from local stakeholders is necessary to \nensure that community planning and noise mitigation efforts that have \nbeen underway for decades are now taken into full account.\n  The language in this bill would require the FAA to review certain \npast decisions and take steps to mitigate impacts when flight path \nchanges have a significant impact on affected communities, and that is \ncertainly the case in my home city of Phoenix, AZ.\n  Importantly, this provision would also require the FAA to notify and \nconsult with those communities before making significant changes to \nflight paths moving forward, as has happened, which has caused so much \ndifficulty and so many ill effects on the citizens of Phoenix, AZ--\nindeed, the entire valley.\n  The FAA has acknowledged the need to improve community outreach and \nis undertaking efforts to update their community outreach manual, but \nmore needs to be done to guarantee this outreach takes place.\n  The Senate had previously agreed unanimously to this language as an \namendment to the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development \nappropriations bill. However, that bill did not advance in the Senate. \nAlso, the FAA reauthorization bill that passed the House Transportation \nand Infrastructure Committee earlier this year also included similar \nlanguage at the request of myself and my colleague Senator Flake.\n  This legislation is necessary to create a long-awaited, much needed \nopportunity for residents around Phoenix Sky Harbor International \nAirport negatively impacted by flight noise to have their voices heard \nby the FAA. It is important that the process surrounding changes to \nflight paths include the local officials, airport representatives, and \nresidents--most of all, residents--who know the issues best, both \naround Sky Harbor and in communities across the country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I also thank my colleague Senator Flake for working hard on this \nreauthorization and this provision that is in this bill. He and I both \nhave been contacted by literally thousands of our fellow citizens and \nthe people we represent in Phoenix, AZ, concerning the noise problems \naround Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. It didn't have to \nhappen this way. I hope the FAA will go back and meet with the people \nand hear the complaints, hear their problems, and fix them.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Flake for his hard work on this issue. \nAgain, I appreciate the Commerce Committee and its chairman and ranking \nmember for including this language in this legislation that is so \nimportant to our community.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words on this subject, \nand I thank the senior Senator from Arizona for all the work he has put \ninto this. As he has mentioned, we have heard from thousands of \nresidents in the Phoenix area who have been impacted.\n  This language is important because in September of 2014, the FAA \ninstituted new flight path changes for Phoenix Sky Harbor International \nAirport without adequately engaging the community and the stakeholders. \nThese flight paths, as Senator McCain said,\n\n[[Page S1700]]\n\nhave greatly impacted residents in the surrounding areas. We have heard \nfrom them with concerns about both the noise and the frequency of these \nflights.\n  Section 5002 of the FAA reauthorization bill would simply approve the \nFAA's process for instituting new flight paths. The fact that this \nlanguage is retroactive is especially important because of what we have \nmentioned. Communities in Phoenix have already been negatively impacted \nby these recent flight path changes.\n  This language would create a process to review those changes and to \nrequire the FAA to consult with airports and to determine steps to \nmitigate the negative effects, including the consideration of new or \nalternative flight paths. Going forward, this language would ensure \nthat communities and airports have the opportunity to fully engage with \nthe FAA before these flight paths changes are made.\n  Again, I commend Chairman Thune and Ranking Member Nelson for \nincluding this critical language. I hope that it is supported. We have \nsupport for this amendment.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Federal Employees\n\n                              John Wagner\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to the \nsignificant contributions public servants make to our Nation every day.\n  Since 2010, I have tried to come to the Senate floor on a fairly \nregular basis to recognize exemplary Federal employees. This is a \ntradition started by my friend Senator Ted Kaufman from Delaware when \nhe was here for a few years--somebody who, as much as anybody in this \nbody, having served as a staff member for so long, recognized the \nenormous value that people who work for our Federal Government provide \nto our national purpose and to making sure we get things done.\n  Earlier this week, I met with some of these outstanding public \nservants. Convened under the umbrella of the Performance Improvement \nCouncil, I had a discussion with individuals participating in the \nLeaders Delivery Network and the White House Leadership Development \nProgram fellowships. These senior administration officials, who are \nworking--oftentimes in obscurity--to improve government performance, \ncome together on a regular basis to collaborate and share best \npractices.\n  Oftentimes on this floor, we talk about costs and budget issues. One \nchallenge I think we don't spend enough time on is oversight. The fact \nis, there are many folks within the Federal Government who are focusing \non improving government performance and making sure that we at the end \nof that also save resources.\n  In the spirit of the work of the PIC, with which I met earlier this \nweek, I am pleased to honor one exceptional Federal employee today who \nhappens to be a Virginian--John Wagner.\n  As Deputy Assistant Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection, Mr. Wagner conceived, developed, and implemented two \ngroundbreaking programs that overhauled the way American citizens and a \ngrowing number of foreign travelers enter the United States.\n  At the time, CBP was facing the need for heightened security--\nobviously, something that continues--while contending with an increase \nin the number of international travelers, which resulted in long wait \ntimes for arriving passengers, a surge in missed flight connections, \nand strained personnel capacity.\n  Mr. Wagner's innovative solutions to making our century-old process \nwork more effectively and efficiently are now familiar to millions of \ntravelers worldwide: the Global Entry Trusted Traveler Program and the \nkiosk-based Automated Passport Control Program.\n  As somebody who participates in the Global Entry Trusted Traveler \nProgram, it has obviously sped my transit through many international \nairports. Global Entry saves travelers time and ensures a high level of \nsecurity by employing a screening process that includes background \nchecks, personal interviews, and fingerprinting. Approved travelers \nthen bypass the regular immigration control lanes and proceed to the \nautomated, biometrics-based, self-service kiosks that validate \npassports, verify fingerprints, and perform database queries. This \nback-end security allows approved travelers to quickly clear through \nCustoms without the need for an interview with a Customs officer. \nGlobal Entry is now offered at 48 U.S. airports, including Dulles \nInternational Airport in my State of Virginia.\n  In addition to streamlining the international arrivals process, the \nprogram has resulted in saving over 287,000 working hours and reducing \nthe average wait time for members 84 percent when compared to travelers \nnot enrolled in the program.\n  Mr. Wagner's other brainchild has shown similar results. The kiosk-\nbased Automated Passport Control Program automates the entry processes \nfor those with U.S. passports and travelers from a number of foreign \ncountries. This automation allows CBP officers to focus solely on \nquestioning the individual and observing his or her behavioral \nresponses, rather than getting bogged down with administrative \nprocedures. The automated kiosks have resulted in decreases in average \nwait times for travelers and efficiencies in allocating human \nresources.\n  Mr. Wagner described his work best, saying that ``it has contributed \nto the national security of the country, helped promote travel and \ntourism that benefits the economy, and delivered a public service that \nhas been well received.''\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Mr. Wagner and \ngovernment employees at all levels for their willingness to shake up \nthe status quo and their commitment to providing exceptional service to \nAmericans across the country.\n  Today the Presiding Officer and I were at a budget hearing where, as \nformer business members, we sometimes feel like our heads will explode \nin terms of our ability to get an appropriate audit of Federal spending \nand Federal programs. We talked about different processes, like the \nDATA Act, where we try to get more transparency. We have to do all \nthis, but we also have to recognize and celebrate Federal employees \nwho, at the work level, are coming up with great innovative programs, \nsuch as Mr. Wagner has done.\n  So while we may disagree on many items in terms of how we get to \nultimate policy issues--the Presiding Officer has had a very successful \ncareer in business--we know, as former businesspersons, that oftentimes \nsome of the best ideas come from the workforce, and we need to do more \nto celebrate individuals like Mr. Wagner who come forth with good ideas \nthat have been implemented on a cost-effective basis and that save \ntime, save money, and increase national security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Filling The Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, in 1988--almost 30 years ago--when Justice \nKennedy was elected to the Supreme Court, President Reagan said: \n``Every day that passes with a Supreme Court below full strength \nimpairs the people's business in that crucially important body.'' \nPresident Reagan realized in 1988, during the last year of his \nPresidency, what President Obama realizes in 2016, the last year of his \nPresidency: that an eight-person Supreme Court runs counter to our \nnational interest and runs counter, frankly, to the intent of our \nFounders, especially as we modernized the Supreme Court.\n  There is a reason the Supreme Court--I believe for 150 years or \nsomething like that--has had an odd number of Justices, and that is so \nthey can\n\n[[Page S1701]]\n\nmake decisions. Since Justice Scalia's death, we have seen the Supreme \nCourt deadlock a couple of times, and when the Supreme Court deadlocks, \nit is as if the cases weren't even heard. It also means that if there \nare two different appellate cases that contradict one another, the \nSupreme Court would rule, as a referee would, to decide on the law of \nthe land. When there is a vote of 4 to 4, it is as if there were no \nSupreme Court decision at all, and as a result, we have conflicting \nlaws in different parts of the country. So you can live under one set \nof rules in Ohio and live a few miles away in Pittsburgh under another \nset of rules. As a result, this prolonged vacancy is damaging to our \ncountry's highest Court.\n  Fifty cases remain on the docket for this term, and the Supreme Court \nis going to likely set a record for most tied votes. The 50 cases are \nfor this term right now. When the Court meets again--according to \nSenator McConnell, it will be before Judge Garland is considered and \nbrought up for a vote, if he is ever brought up for a vote--there will \nbe another whole set of issues Judge Garland will not be able to rule \non.\n  We are really sentencing ourselves as a nation to a potential 4-to-4 \nvote on case after case after case, week after week after week, month \nafter month after month, through two Supreme Court calendar years, for \nwant of a better term. No term since 1990 has included more than two \ntied votes--a benchmark the Court has now hit in a single week. It \nmeans we have no national standard on important issues, and it \ndiminishes the important role the Supreme Court plays in our country. \nIt is part of a pattern that is damaging the judiciary. Last year the \nSenate confirmed just 11 Federal judges--the fewest in any year since \n1960. It is the fewest in almost six decades.\n  Chief Judge Garland's qualifications are without question. The \nPresident really did reach across party lines--reaching into the center \naisle, perhaps--in choosing Judge Garland. He picked somebody who is \nsignificantly older as a nominee, which is something most Presidents \ndon't want to do. They want to pick somebody in his or her forties or \nearly fifties so they have--at least mathematically--the opportunity to \nserve more years. He picked somebody who had Republican support in the \npast and has had glowing things said about him by people like the \nformer judiciary Republican chairman, Senator Hatch. His qualifications \nare without question, but in the end, the Senate has said they don't \nwant to do their job.\n  The last time there was a vacancy on the Supreme Court for more than \na year was during the Civil War, and it was because we were in a civil \nwar. The last time a Republican Senate ratified or confirmed a \nDemocratic Presidential nominee on the Supreme Court was 1895.\n  This is a Senate that needs to do its job. When I hear Senator \nMcConnell say he doesn't care and will not do anything until the next \nelection, well, we had an election. President Obama was elected to a 4-\nyear term--not a 3-year term and not three-fifths of a term but a 4-\nyear term. He is doing his job. The Constitution says that the \nPresident shall nominate and the Senate shall advise and consent.\n  The Senate needs to meet with this nominee--and I will meet with \nJudge Garland tomorrow--the Senate needs to have hearings on Judge \nGarland, and the Senate then needs to bring him to a vote.\n  Of the eight Supreme Court Justices sitting on the Court today, the \naverage time was 66 days to confirm that Justice. This President still \nhas close to 300 days left in his term. There is plenty of time to do \nthat. Pure and simple, the Senate needs to do its job. It is incredible \nto the country, and it is incredible to all of us who really love this \ninstitution and think our government should work--and does work most of \nthe time--that Senators are so dug in that most of my Republican \ncolleagues will not even meet with Judge Garland. None of them, except \nfor a couple of courageous exceptions, called for hearings. I believe \nonly one or two said we should vote on his confirmation. The country \ndoesn't understand why Republicans are failing to do their jobs. It is \nimportant, election year or not, that the Congress do its job.\n\n\n                           The Steel Industry\n\n  Mr. President, for generations our steelworkers and manufacturers \nhave made the steel that built this country. Manufacturers are the \ncornerstone of our economy. We know that every dollar invested in \nmanufacturing adds an additional $1.48 to the economy, but our steel \nindustry is being left behind. Years of outsourcing and years of \nillegal dumping--dumping means foreign competitors will sell steel into \nthe United States below the cost of production so it is just impossible \nto compete on price or quality with them--have taken their toll on our \ncompanies and our workers.\n  I want to read a letter I got this year from a group of Ohio \nsteelworkers. I want to read one that I chose to read from this. Thomas \nKelling wrote:\n\n       As of January 11, 2016, there are 12,000 steelworkers laid \n     off. I am one of them. When you include other manufacturers \n     that deal with steel--aluminum, refractory, etc.--there are \n     35,000 men and women out of work.\n       Thousands of immigrants came to this country looking for \n     work years ago, and the steel industry supplied them with \n     work. Without the steel industry, the country would not be \n     what it is today. Every building, car, motorcycle, bridge, \n     and so on is made of steel.\n       The steel industry has taken a big hit because of illegal \n     dumping by China, Korea, India, and Italy, among others. \n     These countries subsidize their companies--\n\n  I would add--he didn't say this in the letter--sometimes these \ncompanies are State owned and subsidized by the State.\n\n       These countries subsidize their companies so they are able \n     to sell steel at a much lower cost, which in turn causes the \n     U.S. steel industry to decline--hurting thousands of \n     families, and the economy in general.\n\n  Mr. Kelling is right. It is time for us to stand up for American \nsteel manufacturers and workers who play by the rules but drown under a \nsea of illegal, subsidized imports. Far too many politicians seem \ncontent to throw up their hands and write off the industry and say: \nWell, that is an old industry. We can buy our steel from somewhere \nelse. They seem to assume that because it is a tough problem, because \nit is complicated, it is not even worth trying to fix. Imagine if we \nhad said that about the auto industry. I know what this body did. I \nknow there was a lot of Republican opposition. Some Republicans like \nSenator Voinovich, my colleague from Ohio back then, were supportive. \nMost of my Republican colleagues tried to block the Bush \nadministration--a fellow Republican. Then with the Obama \nadministration, they really dug in in opposition to the auto rescue.\n  We know what happened. Chrysler posted 7 percent gains in sales last \nyear. GM and Ford were not far behind with 5 percent. More vehicles \nwere sold in 2015 than at any time in American history. When that \nnumber had dropped close to 10 million, it was back up to 16 million \nvehicles. That is a lot of autoworker jobs in Ohio at Chrysler, Ford, \nGM, and Honda. It is also a lot of autoworkers' supply chain jobs--some \nunion, some not, some autoworker union, some other unions, some \nnonunion, but thousands of jobs in the supply chain making glass and \ntires and all kinds of hubcaps and metal tops--hard tops for the \nChrysler, whatever they are--in gear shifts and transmissions and \nengines in plants all over Ohio.\n  So don't tell me we can't save the steel industry. Don't tell workers \nlike Thomas Kelling it isn't worth saving. There are concrete steps to \nenforce a level playing field. We enacted a law last year to make it \neasier to petition our government when foreign producers are cheating \non the rules. We know this happens all too often, especially in this \nindustry, because so many countries around the world have their own \nsteel industry. Some don't even use much of the steel they make but \nknow they have a country--us--where they can dump the steel. This law \nis only as strong as its enforcement.\n  The Commerce Department needs to apply so-called adverse facts \navailable, or AFA, in trade cases where a foreign company is not \ncooperating. If we don't apply adverse facts when it is warranted, we \nallow countries and companies that are cheating to get away with \nviolating the law at the expense of our companies, at the expense of \nworkers in Lorain, Niles, Youngstown, and Middletown--all over our \nState and all over our country.\n  Second, we need to fully fund the Office of Enforcement and \nCompliance. This office investigates charges of illegal subsidies and \ndumping by foreign\n\n[[Page S1702]]\n\nproducers. There are so many violations, this office is overwhelmed. \nTrade investigations are lengthy. They are difficult. They are labor \nintensive. We are a Nation of laws. We enforce laws. We enforce rules. \nWe follow laws. We follow the rules so that we can play fair on trade \ncases, but that takes time and expertise, and that is why we need to \nfund the Office of Enforcement and Compliance.\n\n  Third, the administration needs to do everything in its power to \naddress global overcapacity, particularly from China. It is the single \nbiggest challenge facing our domestic steel industry. China has excess \nsteelmaking capacity of 300 million metric tons. Was does that mean? \nThey can make 300 million metric tons more than they use in their \ncountry. What does that mean? That means they are looking for a market, \nand they are willing to subsidize their steel production to dump their \nsteel into Ohio, into Detroit, in auto plants, and dump their steel \nwhere we build roads, bridges, and appliances.\n  Last year, China exported more steel than the total tonnage of steel \nproduced by U.S. manufacturers. Think of that. Chinese capacity in \nsteelmaking is about the same as the rest of the world combined. As I \nsaid, China exported more steel last year than the total tonnage of \nsteel produced by U.S. manufacturers. No wonder our companies face such \nserious challenges. China is the single biggest contributor in excess \ncapacity, but the problem is spreading elsewhere. The Chinese have \ncommitted to reducing steel production, but have failed to follow \nthrough.\n  Our steel industry has done the right thing. Our industry \nrestructured to a sustainable model a decade ago--competitive, smart, \nproductive--but it is now under threat again from Chinese imports. We \nhave to file complaints and petitions against this unfair competition. \nThese cases take too long.\n  To stop the flood of cheap illegal imports once and for all, we need \na permanent shutdown of production in countries where the steel \nindustry is not driven by the market. Let me give you an example. South \nKorea was making something called oil country tubular goods, OCTG. \nThese are pipes made for drilling, for fracking, for drilling for oil \nand gas. It makes sense, right? Except South Korea didn't have a \ndomestic industry. They used not one of these steel pipes that they \nmanufacture. What were they doing? They were selling them under cost to \nthe United States. They basically created an industry to make steel, to \ndump that steel in the United States and keep their workers going at \nthe expense of our companies and our workers. We won trade cases \nagainst them, but it often took long, and by the time we won these \ncases, a lot of damage was done to those companies and those workers.\n  Finally, renegotiate the auto rules of origin, the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership. These provisions determine how much of a car is made in \nthese 12 countries of the Trans-Pacific Partnership regions. \nUnfortunately, the TPP rules of origin are even weaker than they were \nin the North American Free Trade Agreement. What does that mean? That \nmeans only 40 percent of an auto sold in a TPP country needs to be made \nin TPP countries. So what that means is that more than 50 percent of \nthe components for a newly made car can come from China sold into the \nUnited States or Mexico or Canada or any of the 12 countries with no \ntariffs. The whole point of the Trans-Pacific Partnership is to \nstrengthen the auto supply chain and strengthen these countries' \neconomies, but the way our negotiators did it was to drop the \npercentage components--the so-called rules of origin--from 60-some \npercent to 40-some percent so China could backdoor.\n  Think about this: 35,000 women and men out of work--35,000 families \nhave been forced to have terrible conversations around the kitchen \ntable. They have to sell their house. Maybe they are going to get \nforeclosed on because they are not working. They have to cut back on \nsports at the local school because, frankly, of a State government in \nour State that underfunds schools. If kids want to play sports--no \nmatter if they are low-income kids--they have to pay for it. There was \nnothing like that when I was growing up, but it is a different world. \nWe have a State government that doesn't respond in so many ways to the \nconcerns of young parents that they have to come up with money. They \ncan't do that now. They have lost their jobs. All of this impacts \nfamilies.\n  The bad news doesn't stop with family layoffs. These conversations \ndon't stop with mom and dad getting laid off. They lead to mom having \nto take a second job at night and to selling a car to save the house \nfrom being foreclosed.\n  Mr. Kelling writes: ``The livelihood of thousands are counting on \nyou.'' I ask my colleagues to think about what that means. That doesn't \njust mean their income and job; it is so much more important than that. \nIt is the ability to put food on the table, send their kids to college, \nand save something for retirement. It is the difference between a \nthriving community and a dying community.\n  We can't stand by and watch communities turn to ghost towns because \nforeign competitors don't play by the rules. It means we have to take \naction that levels the playing field and holds our trading partners \naccountable. If the administration doesn't take bold, decisive action \nsoon, we will get thousands more letters, as do more and more of my \ncolleagues who also get these letters. Thousands more workers like \nThomas are going to lose their livelihoods, and our country will be \nworse off because of that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget \nscorekeeping report for April 2016. The report compares current law \nlevels of spending and revenues with the amounts provided in the \nconference report to accompany S. Con. Res. 11, the budget resolution \nfor fiscal year 2016. This information is necessary for the Senate \nBudget Committee to determine whether budget points of order lie \nagainst pending legislation. It has been prepared by the Republican \nstaff of the Senate Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget \nOffice, CBO, pursuant to section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget \nAct, CBA.\n  This is the third scorekeeping report for this calendar year but the \nseventh report I have made since adoption of the fiscal year 2016 \nbudget resolution on May 5, 2015. My last filing can be found in the \nCongressional Record on February 24, 2016. The information contained in \nthis report is current through April 4, 2016.\n  Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee \nis below or exceeds its allocation under the budget resolution. This \ninformation is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant to \nsection 302 of the CBA. Over the fiscal year 2016-2025 period, which is \nthe entire period covered by S. Con. Res. 11, Senate authorizing \ncommittees have spent $147.9 billion more than the budget resolution \ncalls for.\n  Table 2 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This \ninformation is used to determine points of order related to the \nspending caps found in section 312 and section 314 of the CBA. On \nDecember 18, 2015, the President signed H.R. 2029, the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act, 2016, P.L. 114-113, into law. This bill provided \nregular appropriations equal to the levels set in the Bipartisan Budget \nAct of 2015, P.L. 114-74, specifically $548.1 billion in budget \nauthority for defense accounts, revised security category, and $518.5 \nbillion in budget authority for nondefense accounts, revised \nnonsecurity category.\n  Table 3 gives the amount by which the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations is below or exceeds its allocation for Overseas \nContingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism, OCO/GWOT, spending. \nThis separate allocation for OCO/GWOT was established in section 3102 \nof S. Con. Res. 11 and is enforced using section 302 of the CBA. The \nconsolidated appropriations bill included $73.7 billion in budget \nauthority and $32.1 billion in outlays for OCO/GWOT in fiscal year \n2016. This level is equal to the revised OCO/GWOT levels that I filed \nin the Record on December 18, 2015.\n  The budget resolution established two new points of order limiting \nthe use of changes in mandatory programs in appropriations bills, \nCHIMPS. Tables 4 and 5 show compliance with fiscal year 2016 limits for \noverall CHIMPS and the Crime Victims Fund CHIMP, respectively. This \ninformation is used for determining points of order under section 3103 \nand section 3104, respectively. Enacted CHIMPS are under both the \nbroader CHIMPS limit, $1.3 billion less, and the Crime Victims Fund \nlimit, $1.8 billion less.\n  In addition to the tables provided by the Senate Budget Committee \nRepublican staff, I am submitting additional tables from CBO that I \nwill use for enforcement of budget levels agreed to by the Congress.\n  For fiscal year 2016, CBO estimates that current law levels are \n$138.9 billion and $103.6 billion above the budget resolution levels \nfor budget authority and outlays, respectively. Revenues are $155.2 \nbillion below the level assumed in the budget resolution. Finally, \nSocial Security outlays are at the levels assumed in the budget \nresolution for fiscal year 2016, while Social Security revenues are $23 \nmillion below assumed levels for the budget year.\n  CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate's \npay-as-you-go rule. The Senate's pay-as-you-go scorecard currently \nshows deficit reduction of $20.4 billion over the fiscal year 2015-2020 \nperiod and $95.7 billion over the fiscal year 2015-2025 period. Over \nthe initial 6-year period, Congress has enacted legislation that would \nincrease revenues by $17 billion and decrease outlays by $3.3 billion. \nOver the 11-year period, Congress has enacted legislation that would \nincrease revenues by $36.8 billion and decrease outlays by $59 billion. \nThe Senate's pay-as-you-go rule is enforced by section 201 of S. Con. \nRes. 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution.\n  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n TABLE 1.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE\n                   (+) OR

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the many years of \nproductive community partnership fostered by the cooperation of four \norganizations--the National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of \nMayors, the American City Planning Directors' Council, and the American \nCity Quality Foundation--in their administration of the American City \nQuality Month every April since its establishment in 1988.\n  Thanks to the collaboration of both public and private partners \nconnected through this program, communities across the Nation are \nbolstered each April by a combination of public meetings, educational \nopportunities for students, and public announcements, all\n\n[[Page S1706]]\n\ndedicated to the betterment of urban areas. By advocating for improved \ncity planning, decisionmaking, design, development, management, and \naction, the program brings attention to the need for revitalization and \nupkeep of metropolitan spaces.\n  With the U.S. population expected to hit nearly 350 million by 2026 \nand almost 400 million by 2050, the sustainability of American cities, \nwhich contain 80.7 percent of the U.S. total population according to \nthe 2010 census, is paramount to accommodating an ever-expanding \ncitizenry.\n  The focus of the program lies not only with large cities like Boston \nand New York, but also with smaller ones like Portland and Augusta, ME. \nThese small cities are growing and developing into economic powerhouses \nattractive to both skilled workers and middle-class families. Ensuring \nthe preservation of productive relationships, infrastructure, and \nenvironmental well-being in Maine's growing urban spaces is a crucial \npiece of the success not only for these cities, but for the entire \nState. American City Quality Month inspires the dialogue and \npartnerships necessary for sustainable growth and revitalization.\n  I thank the organizers of American City Quality Month for ensuring \nthat American cities of all sizes continue to promote the welfare of \nthis generation and those to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/06/senate-section/article/S1706-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      101ST ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE WYOMING STATE SOCIETY, NSDAR\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to pay special tribute and recognize \nthe good work that the Wyoming State Society of the Daughters of the \nAmerican Revolution is doing in my home State. This is their 101st \nannual conference, and the fact that the organization has not only \ncontinued to exist, but has grown stronger over the years, is proof of \ntheir determination to keep the spirit of the American Revolution \nalive. Thanks to them, our respect and our admiration for the heroes of \nthose days has remained strong and continues to grow stronger.\n  On October 11, 1890, a group of concerned citizens banded together to \ncreate the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution. Their \nintent was to protect and preserve the principles and values upon which \nour Nation was founded. They knew that their ancestors were part of a \nvery special time in our history and sharing their stories would raise \nour awareness of the blessings we had received from our citizenship.\n  Over the years the organization has grown in strength and numbers as \nthe national society now includes 177,000 members all over the world \nwho continue to embrace and promote the American dream and our American \nway of life.\n  In Wyoming the State society has 11 chapters with hundreds of members \nstatewide.\n  The Daughters of the American Revolution is such a special \norganization in part because of its qualification for membership. Any \nwoman 18 years or older can join if it can be shown that she is a \ndirect descendent of one of our Nation's patriots from the days of the \nAmerican Revolution.\n  Each member of the DAR knows that the best way to honor their \nfamily's contribution to the beginnings of our Nation is to promote a \ngreater awareness and appreciation of what it means to be an American \ncitizen. That means getting more and more involved every day in helping \nto make their community stronger and more committed to making the world \na better place to live.\n  The Daughters of the American Revolution continues to make a \ndifference, and we can be proud of the results they continue to \nachieve. The members of the DAR have taken their inspiration from our \npast, and it has encouraged and guided them to work together to build a \nbetter future for our Nation and all our people.\n  I thank them for the good work they do.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/06/senate-section/article/S1706-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING DR. JOE MEDICINE CROW\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nremarks that will be read on my behalf at the funeral of Dr. Joe \nMedicine Crow today be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Today I wish to honor Dr. Joe Medicine Crow, a Presidential \n     Medal of Freedom winner for his contributions to the culture, \n     history, and security of the United States, who passed away \n     on April 3, 2016.\n       On behalf of all Montanans and all Americans, I would like \n     to thank Dr. Medicine Crow for his service and contributions \n     to the nation.\n       It is my privilege to share Dr. Medicine Crow's story for \n     the official Senate Record.\n       Thank you for inviting me to share a few words today to \n     honor the life and legacy of Dr. Joe Medicine Crow. I'm sorry \n     I cannot be with you in person.\n       I remember when I first met Dr. Joe Medicine Crow, I was \n     immediately inspired. His words resonated deep into the souls \n     of those he touched.\n       In 2008, I had the great honor of nominating Dr. Joe \n     Medicine Crow for one of the highest awards given by the \n     United States--the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Honorees \n     are selected for their exemplary contributions to their \n     country's culture, history, and security. I nominated Joe \n     Medicine Crow because he embodied all of these things.\n       During World War II, he accomplished the four remarkable \n     war deeds that make a traditional Crow War Chief. His bravery \n     is the kind you read about only in stories. He fought in \n     hand-to-hand combat, and led troops into enemy territory to \n     capture 50 enemy horses.\n       And he accomplished these feats for the country that he \n     loved, as so many Native Americans did during World War II, \n     even though their treatment on the home front left much to be \n     desired.\n       But Joe Medicine Crow's achievements for his people went \n     far beyond bravery on the field of battle.\n       His commitment to education was unmatched and paved the way \n     for generations of Native Americans to achieve their dream.\n       We are fortunate, in Montana, to have many reminders of the \n     land and the people who came before us. Joe wasn't just a \n     reminder, he was a shining example. Montanans will be telling \n     the story of Medicine Crow for generations. And Americans \n     across the country will have his work to thank for preserving \n     the rich history, language, and vibrant culture of the Crow \n     Nation.\n       Joe received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from \n     President Barack Obama on August 12, 2009, and joined a short \n     and prestigious list of Montanans to receive this honor. His \n     actions and accomplishments ensure that his legacy will \n     reflect the life he lived.\n       Joe was a remarkable Montanan. He was a soldier, scholar, \n     and historian, but above all he was a fierce advocate for \n     Native American families. He embodied the warrior spirit of \n     the Crow people, and was a fierce example of America's \n     highest ideals. I'm honored to lend my praise and remembrance \n     of Dr. Joe Medicine Crow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/06/senate-section/article/S1706-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1706-S1707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SHERRY DAVICH\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak about a \ntopic that is bittersweet for me. I am here to share my gratitude for a \nperson who I not only consider an adviser and an exemplary public \nservant, but a friend and confidant for over 40 years--our director of \nconstituent services, Sherry Davich, who retired from the Senate.\n  I met Sherry back when we were both admittedly younger, after she \nworked on Jimmy Carter's Presidential campaign and I was running for \nthe Florida House of Representatives. Sherry was finishing her \nbachelor's degree at Florida State University and had an undeniable \ncuriosity and a nose for politics. After Carter became President and I \nwas in the Florida House, I convinced her to intern in our office, and \nthe rest is history. Forty years--wow, that is real public service.\n  Sherry has been unwavering in her service to the people of our \ncountry and of Florida as I have served in the House and Senate, as \nwell as State treasurer and insurance commissioner. During her 15 years \nin the Senate, she has overseen over 350,000 constituent cases ranging \nfrom veterans not receiving their benefits, working with folks impacted \nby the BP oil spill, reuniting families as they navigate the \nimmigration process, and of course, the lost passports and visa \nassistance.\n  She has touched the lives of so many of our constituents as their \nchief advocate. She has also been a part of my family. Actually Sherry \nand her husband, David, started to see each other as a ``Nelson \nCongressional Couple,'' both working in the DC office years ago. Grace \nand I think of Sherry, David, and their son Will, who was an intern in \nour office, as family. We are so thankful for her commitment, her \nloyalty, and her friendship.\n\n[[Page S1707]]\n\n  Sherry has left a lasting mark on our family, our office family, and \nthe folks she has served. She will be missed, and I am grateful to her \nbeyond words.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/06/senate-section/article/S1707-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               DEERFIELD'S 250TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Deerfield, \nNH--a town in Rockingham County that is celebrating the 250th \nanniversary of its founding. I am proud to join citizens across the \nGranite State in recognizing this special milestone.\n  Deerfield was originally part of the town of Nottingham until \nresidents petitioned to become a separate town by requesting the \nColonial Governor ``set us off a distinct parish.'' Permission was \ngranted, and Deerfield was incorporated in 1766 by Colonial Governor \nBenning Wentworth. Major John Simpson, a native of Deerfield, is \nnotoriously known for firing the first shot at the Battle of Bunker \nHill without permission from his commanding officers.\n  Founded with a strong background in agriculture, the town was once \ncleared of most of its forest in order to farm the land and is home to \nthe oldest family fair in New England--the annual Deerfield Fair. \nDeerfield was also shaped by a steadfast commitment to education, and \nby the mid-19th century, the town had 13 school buildings, one within \nwalking distance of almost every child in town. The town became a \nprosperous center as it lay on the road between larger hubs such as \nPortsmouth, Exeter, and Concord. In the 20th century, as the \nagricultural economy began to fade, Deerfield's forests slowly \nreturned, and the population began to decrease.\n  Today Deerfield has a population of over 4,000 residents and is proud \nof its 250-year history. The residents have created a vibrant civic and \nsocial community, which serves our State and Nation well. The town \nexemplifies the motto, ``Deerfield, a place to call home since 1766.'' \nDeerfield has greatly contributed to the life and spirit of New \nHampshire. I am pleased to extend my warm wishes to the people of \nDeerfield as they celebrate this very special occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/06/senate-section/article/S1707-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO UTAH'S VIETNAM VETERANS AND THEIR SPOUSES\n\n Mr. LEE. Mr. President, on this special occasion, I would like \nto thank each and every one of Utah's more than 47,000 Vietnam \nveterans, as well as their spouses, for their service to our great \nState and this exceptional Nation. You answered the call of duty at a \ntime of national need, and your courage is an inspiration to us all.\n  Over the next several weeks, friends, neighbors, and families will \ngather in communities across our great State to hold special \ncommemorative ceremonies in honor of the men and women who served in \nthe Vietnam war. But the people of Utah understand that our veterans \ndeserve our gratitude and support, not just on special occasions, but \nevery day.\n  Utah's communities, businesses, and public institutions are committed \nto ensuring that Utah is a place where veterans have the resources and \nsupport they need to lead fulfilling lives and achieve a high standard \nof living, whether they have just returned to civilian life or have \nbeen out of the service for 50 years.\n  In Salt Lake City, Provo, and St. George, the Beehive State has three \nof the best veterans centers in the Nation that provide critical mental \nhealth and counseling services to veterans and their families. And the \npeople at the Utah Department of Veterans and Military Affairs, the \nhost of today's commemorative ceremony, are faithful, tireless \nadvocates of Utah's veterans. The work of Utah's VMA and the brave \nveterans they represent is one of the reasons why I am so proud to call \nUtah home.\n  May God bless the veterans of Utah, and may God bless these United \nStates of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/06/senate-section/article/S1707-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING SIMMONS-PINCKNEY MIDDLE SCHOOL\n\n Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I congratulate Simmons-Pinckney \nMiddle School in Charleston on a successful first year and thank \neveryone who has helped make the school a part of our community.\n  Simmons-Pinckney's significance lies in its name. It was designed to \nhonor State senator and civil rights leader, Reverend Clementa \nPinckney, and a legendary blacksmith from Daniel Island, Mr. Philip \nSimmons. Reverend Pinckney was a servant of the people in the truest \nsense of the word and pastor at Mother Emanuel AME Church--where he \nlost his life while serving his ministry last June.\n  Mr. Philip Simmons's beautiful ironwork is not only displayed \nthroughout Charleston, but in the South Carolina State Museum, \nSmithsonian Museum, and all around the world. These two men symbolize \nwhat I believe schools should promote, dedication and a commitment to \nleading our State and country to a brighter future.\n  Last year, Simmons-Pinckney Middle School opened to serve two \npurposes, and that is to remember the lives and legacies of these two \namazing men and to ensure that each student receives the education they \ndeserve. I am proud to welcome Simmons-Pinckney to the community as the \nnewest middle school of the Charleston County School District.\n  Congratulations again to Simmons-Pinckney Middle School on a \nsuccessful first year, and I wish the students and teachers more \nproductive years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/06/senate-section/article/S1707-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1707-S1710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-4910.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of\n\n[[Page S1711]]\n\n     Michigan urging the President of the United States and the \n     United States Congress to explore and support policies that \n     will lead to the establishment of facilities within the \n     United States for the reprocessing and recycling of spent \n     nuclear fuel; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 220\n\n       Whereas, The federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 \n     called for the United States Department of Energy to begin \n     collecting spent nuclear waste and develop a long-term plan \n     for storage of the material. In 2002, Congress approved Yucca \n     Mountain in Nevada as the location to allow the Department of \n     Energy to establish a safe repository for high-level spent \n     nuclear waste; and\n       Whereas, In 2010, the Department of Energy halted the \n     project at Yucca Mountain when the construction authorization \n     process was in progress, despite the Nuclear Waste Fund \n     receiving more than $30 billion in revenue from electric \n     customers throughout the United Slates in order to construct \n     the facility and store the spent fuel; and\n       Whereas, The Argonne National Laboratory has developed a \n     high-temperature method of recycling spent nuclear waste into \n     fuel, known as pyrochemical processing. This process allows \n     100 times more of the energy in uranium ore to be used to \n     produce electricity compared to current commercial reactors; \n     and\n       Whereas, Extending the productive life of uranium ore \n     through pyrochemical processing ensures almost inexhaustible \n     supplies of low-cost uranium resources for the generation of \n     electricity, minimizes the risk that used fuel could be \n     stolen and used to produce weapons, and reduces the amount of \n     nuclear waste and the time it must be isolated by almost \n     1,000 times; and\n       Whereas, Advanced non-light water reactors currently under \n     development in the United States and internationally have the \n     potential to utilize used fuel from existing reactors as \n     fuel, but according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, \n     there are no reprocessing facilities currently operating \n     within the United States; and\n       Whereas, The federal government's inability to adequately \n     store or reprocess almost 100,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel \n     has adversely affected the residents of the state of \n     Michigan. Michigan has paid more than $800 million into the \n     Nuclear Waste Fund since 1983, but the federal government has \n     failed to use it to permanently store nuclear waste in a way \n     that serves the public: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the \n     President and Congress of the United States to explore and \n     support policies that will lead to the establishment of \n     facilities within the United States for the reprocessing and \n     recycling of spent nuclear fuel; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-139. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of New Mexico supporting the passage of the Dine \n     College Act of 2015; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n                        Senate Joint Memorial 15\n\n       Whereas, the State of New Mexico and the Navajo Nation \n     maintain a government-to-government relationship, and the \n     Navajo people residing in the State are citizens of both New \n     Mexico and the Navajo Nation; and\n       Whereas, in 1968, the Navajo Nation established Navajo \n     Community College, which later became Dine College, to \n     provide access to higher education to the Navajo people; and\n       Whereas, Dine College's New Mexico Flagship Campus is \n     located in Shiprock, and there is a Community Campus Center \n     in Crownpoint; and\n       Whereas, Dine College has dual credit agreements with \n     school districts and schools in New Mexico, including the \n     Central Consolidated School District, Gallup-McKinley County \n     School District, Magdalena Municipal School District, Navajo \n     Preparatory School, Shiprock Alternative School, Inc., \n     Wingate High School and the Alamo Navajo Community School; \n     and\n       Whereas, the State of New Mexico provides support to Dine \n     College through its Higher Education Department by way of \n     higher education capital outlay projects, the tribal college \n     dual credit funding program and high school equivalency \n     credential program grants; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress passed the Navajo \n     Community College Act of 1971, the Navajo Community College \n     Assistance Act of 1978 and the Navajo Nation Higher Education \n     Act of 2008, which collectively provide for maintenance, \n     operation and construction funding for Dine College; and\n       Whereas, Representative Ann Kirkpatrick from Arizona \n     introduced the Dine College Act of 2015 ``to fulfill the \n     United States Government's Trust responsibility to serve the \n     higher education needs of the Navajo people and to clarify, \n     unify, and modernize prior Dine College Legislation'', and \n     Dine College has asked Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona to \n     introduce a Senate Companion Bill: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Legislature of the State of New Mexico, \n     That the State of New Mexico stand in support of the passage \n     of the Dine College Act of 2015 and urge the New Mexico \n     Congressional Delegation to work to ensure its passage into \n     Federal Law; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this memorial be transmitted to \n     the Secretary of Higher Education, the Governor, the New \n     Mexico Congressional Delegation, the Speaker of the United \n     States House of Representatives, the President of the United \n     States Senate and the President of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-140.

FACILITY OUTAGE CONTINGENCY PLANS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On September 26, 2014, an Administration contract \n     employee deliberately started a fire that destroyed critical \n     equipment at the Administration's Chicago Air Route Traffic \n     Control Center (referred to in this section as the ``Chicago \n     Center'') in Aurora, Illinois.\n       (2) As a result of the damage, Chicago Center was unable to \n     control air traffic for more than 2 weeks, thousands of \n     flights were delayed or cancelled into and out of O'Hare \n     International Airport and Midway Airport in Chicago, and \n     aviation stakeholders and airlines reportedly lost over \n     $350,000,000.\n       (3) According to the Office of the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Transportation, the fire at Chicago Center \n     demonstrated that the Administration's contingency plans for \n     the Chicago Center and the airspace it controls do not ensure \n     redundancy and resiliency for sustained operations.\n       (4) Further, the Inspector General found that Chicago \n     Center incident highlighted the limited flexibility and lack \n     of resiliency in critical elements of the Administration's \n     current air traffic control infrastructure, including limited \n     communication capacity and the inability to easily transfer \n     control of airspace and flight plans.\n       (b) Comprehensive Contingency Plan.--Not later than 180 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Administrator shall update the Administration's comprehensive \n     contingency plan to address potential air traffic facility \n     outages that could have a major impact on operation of the \n     national airspace system.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the date the plan \n     is updated under subsection (b), the Administrator shall \n     submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report on \n     the update, including any recommendations for ensuring air \n     traffic facility outages do not have a major impact on \n     operation of the national airspace system.\n\n     SEC. 4105. ADS-B MANDATE ASSESSMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Administration's ADS-B program is expected to be \n     the centerpiece of the NextGen effort at the Administration, \n     but the satellite-based system faces uncertainty and \n     controversy.\n       (2) In May 2010, the Administration published a final rule \n     that mandated airspace users be equipped with ADS-B Out \n     avionics by January 1, 2020.\n       (3) Subsequently, in April 2015, the Administration \n     announced completion of the ADS-B ground-based radio \n     infrastructure. However, the ADS-B program faces considerable \n     uncertainty and unanswered questions about whether or not the \n     2020 mandate is still meaningful.\n       (4) In 2014, the Office of the Inspector General found that \n     while ADS-B is providing benefits where radar is limited or \n     nonexistent in places such as the Gulf of Mexico, the system \n     is providing only limited initial services to pilots and air \n     traffic controllers in domestic airspace.\n       (5) The Office of the Inspector General also found, in \n     2014, that all elements of the system, such as avionics, the \n     ground infrastructure, and controller automation systems, had \n     not yet been tested in combination to determine if the \n     overall system can be used in congested airspace and perform \n     as well as existing radar, much less allow aircraft to fly \n     closer together. This is referred to as ``end-to-end \n     testing.''\n       (6) When this report was issued, commercial and general \n     aviation stakeholders voiced serious concerns that equipping \n     with new avionics for the 2020 mandate will be difficult due \n     to the cost and limited availability of avionics, and \n     capacity of certified repair stations to install avionics.\n       (b) Assessment.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Transportation shall assess--\n       (1) Administration and industry readiness to meet the ADS-B \n     mandate by 2020;\n       (2) changes to ADS-B program since May 2010; and\n       (3) additional options to comply with the mandate and \n     consequences, both for individual system users and for the \n     overall safety and efficiency of the national airspace \n     system, for noncompliance.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the date the \n     assessment under subsection (b) is complete, the Inspector \n     General of the Department of Transportation shall submit to \n     the appropriate committees of Congress a report on the \n     progress made toward meeting the ADS-B mandate by 2020, \n     including any recommendations of the Inspector General to \n     carry out such mandate.\n\n     SEC. 4106. NEXTGEN INTEROPERABILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--To implement a more effective \n     international strategy for achieving NextGen interoperability \n     with foreign countries, the Administrator shall take the \n     following actions:\n       (1) Conduct a gap analysis to identify potential risks to \n     NextGen interoperability with other Air Navigation Service \n     Providers and establish a schedule for periodically \n     reevaluating such risks.\n       (2) Develop a plan that identifies and documents actions \n     the Administrator will undertake to mitigate such risks, \n     using information from the gap analysis as a basis for making \n     management decisions about how to allocate resources for such \n     actions.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress a report on the analysis \n     conducted under paragraph (1) of subsection (a) and on the \n     actions the Administrator has taken under paragraph (2) of \n     such subsection.\n\n     SEC. 4107. NEXTGEN TRANSITION MANAGEMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator shall--\n       (1) identify and analyze technical and operational maturity \n     gaps in NextGen transition and implementation plans; and\n       (2) develop a plan to mitigate the gaps identified in \n     paragraph (1).\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress a report on the actions \n     taken to carry out the plan required by subsection (a)(2).\n\n     SEC. 4108.

CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE FACILITIES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Carbon \n     Capture Improvement Act of 2016''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Capture and long-term storage of carbon dioxide from \n     coal, natural gas, and biomass-fired power plants, as well as \n     from industrial sectors such as oil refining and production \n     of fertilizer, cement, and ethanol, can help protect the \n     environment while improving the economy and national security \n     of the United States.\n       (2) The United States is a world leader in the field of \n     carbon dioxide capture and long-term storage, as well as the \n     beneficial use of carbon dioxide in enhanced oil recovery \n     operations, with many manufacturers and\n\n[[Page S1760]]\n\n     licensors of carbon dioxide capture technology based in the \n     United States.\n       (3) While the prospects for large-scale carbon capture in \n     the United States are promising, costs remain relatively \n     high. Lowering the financing costs for carbon dioxide capture \n     projects would accelerate the deployment of this technology, \n     and if the captured carbon dioxide is subsequently sold for \n     industrial use, such as for use in enhanced oil recovery \n     operations, the economic prospects are further improved.\n       (4) Since 1968, tax-exempt private activity bonds have been \n     used to provide access to lower-cost financing for private \n     businesses that are purchasing new capital equipment for \n     certain specified environmental facilities, including \n     facilities that reduce, recycle, or dispose of waste, \n     pollutants, and hazardous substances.\n       (5) Allowing tax-exempt financing for the purchase of \n     capital equipment that is used to capture carbon dioxide will \n     reduce the costs of developing carbon dioxide capture \n     projects, accelerate their deployment, and, in conjunction \n     with carbon dioxide utilization and long-term storage, help \n     the United States meet critical environmental, economic, and \n     national security goals.\n       (c) Carbon Dioxide Capture Facilities.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 142 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 is amended--\n       (A) in subsection (a)--\n       (i) in paragraph (14), by striking ``or'' at the end,\n       (ii) in paragraph (15), by striking the

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Airport Security \n     Enhancement and Oversight Act''.\n\n     SEC. _102. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A number of recent airport security breaches in the \n     United States have involved the use of Secure Identification \n     Display Area (referred to in this section as ``SIDA'') \n     badges, the credentials used by airport and airline workers \n     to access the secure areas of an airport.\n       (2) In December 2014, a Delta ramp agent at Hartsfield-\n     Jackson Atlanta International Airport was charged with using \n     his SIDA badge to bypass airport security checkpoints and \n     facilitate an interstate gun smuggling operation over a \n     number of months via commercial aircraft.\n       (3) In January 2015, an Atlanta-based Aviation Safety \n     Inspector of the Federal Aviation Administration used his \n     SIDA badge to bypass airport security checkpoints and \n     transport a firearm in his carry-on luggage.\n       (4) In February 2015, a local news investigation found that \n     over 1,000 SIDA badges at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta \n     International Airport were lost or missing.\n       (5) In March 2015, and again in May 2015, Transportation \n     Security Administration contractors were indicted for \n     participating in a drug smuggling ring using luggage passed \n     through the secure area of the San Francisco International \n     Airport.\n       (6) The Administration has indicated that it does not \n     maintain a list of lost or missing SIDA badges, and instead \n     relies on airport operators to track airport worker \n     credentials.\n       (7) The Administration rarely uses its enforcement \n     authority to fine airport operators that reach a certain \n     threshold of missing SIDA badges.\n       (8) In April 2015, the Aviation Security Advisory Committee \n     issued 28 recommendations for improvements to airport access \n     control.\n       (9) In June 2015, the Inspector General of the Department \n     of Homeland Security reported that the Administration did not \n     have all relevant information regarding 73 airport workers \n     who had records in United States intelligence-related \n     databases because the Administration was not authorized to \n     receive all terrorism-related information under current \n     interagency watchlisting policy.\n       (10) The Inspector General also found that the \n     Administration did not have appropriate checks in place to \n     reject incomplete or inaccurate airport worker employment \n     investigations, including criminal history record checks and \n     work authorization verifications, and had limited oversight \n     over the airport operators that the Administration relies on \n     to perform criminal history and work authorization checks for \n     airport workers.\n       (11) There is growing concern about the potential insider \n     threat at airports in light of recent terrorist activities.\n\n     SEC. _103.
