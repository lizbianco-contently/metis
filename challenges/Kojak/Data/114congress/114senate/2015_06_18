Mr. President, I don't know another way to describe what I \nheard this morning in my morning briefing and then the news accounts of \nthis sickening revelation of what took place in South Carolina last \nnight.\n  Think about this. The sanctity of a house of worship was violated as \na gunman opened fire in the historically Black Emanuel AME Church in \nCharleston, SC.\n  We know now at least nine people are dead, and others, of course, are \nhurt. I don't know how to describe it. This individual was like a wolf \nin sheep's clothing. He sat among the congregation for a substantial \namount of time before he pulled out a weapon and started firing at \npeople. The thought of people who were in a house of worship being \ngunned down as they gathered to pray is heart-wrenching, devastating, \nand is the ultimate act of cowardice and hatred.\n  As our good Chaplain said, our hearts go out to the families and \nfriends of the people who were gunned down in that church. It is hard \nto even comprehend anything so awful. So, on behalf of the Senate \nfamily, we send our support and our sympathy.\n  We hope Charleston law enforcement are able to capture this murderer, \nand the perpetrator be swiftly apprehended and brought to justice.\n  Mr. President, I had some remarks I was going to give, but they could \nbe deemed partisan in nature and I can give them some other time. I \ndon't feel it would be appropriate for me now to talk about these \nthings that are definitely inappropriate today with this pall hanging \nover our country.\n  Based upon that, I would ask that the Presiding Officer announce the \nbusiness of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/senate-section/article/S4255-6", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there has been a great deal of discussion \nthis week, and there will be, I am sure, over the next few days, about \nPope Francis's comments in his encyclical issued this morning on the \nissue of climate change and on the issue of the preservation of the \nenvironment. Some of the reaction has been that the Pope should stay \naway from science and stick to morality and theology. I am here this \nmorning to say I believe that is exactly what he is doing. He is \nsticking to morality and theology, and that is why he has made the \nstatement that he has.\n  I have always viewed this issue in fundamentally an ethical and moral \ncontext. There has been a lot of talk, discussion, and debate in \ncommittees and on this floor about the science, which I think is \nirrefutable--the science of climate change, the science of the \nincreasing load of CO2 in the atmosphere, the most we have \never had in some 3 million years, and the impact it will have. I have \ntalked about the practical impact it will have on the lobster \npopulation in Maine and on the shellfish, on our forests, on moose in \nNew Hampshire, on water-edged cities and communities all over this \ncountry. All of those practical and scientific things we have talked \nabout at great length on this floor. The only thing I would say is that \nI am convinced the science is irrefutable that, A, something is \nhappening; B, it is detrimental to the future of the world; and, C, \nwe--people--are largely responsible for it.\n  Fundamentally, this is a moral and ethical issue. It has always \noccurred to me in two moral and ethical contexts. One is that I don't \nunderstand what right several generations of people on this Earth have \nto use up a finite resource that was created over millions of years. It \ntook 3 or 4 million years to create the oil and gas that is underneath \nour Earth. How do we have the right to use it all up in 200 or 300 \nyears? That assumes we are the only people who will ever occupy this \nplanet. Indeed, I don't believe that is the case. Obviously, it is not \nthe case. There are generations that will come after us--6, 7, 8, 10 \ngenerations of people who will come after us. Why do we have the right \nto use resources that the Earth created for all of time?\n  One of the fundamental premises of the Old Testament is, of course, \nthe Ten Commandments. One of the basic Ten Commandments is ``Thou shalt \nnot steal.'' I believe we are stealing resources from future \ngenerations by simply using them up in our lifetimes. That is moral and \nethical issue No. 1.\n  The second ethical issue is the fundamental ethical and moral \nprinciple of stewardship. The first line of the Bible says: ``In the \nbeginning God created the heaven and the earth.'' God created--God \ncreated--the heaven and the Earth. We have a responsibility to steward, \nto take care of the creation that God gave us.\n  There are some very interesting Biblical references early in the \nBible, in Leviticus, the third Book of the Bible, about this concept of \nstewardship. One is in Leviticus 25. The Lord said to Moses: ``The land \nmust never be sold on a permanent basis, for the land belongs to me.'' \nThis is God speaking: The land belongs to me. ``You are only foreigners \nand tenant farmers working for me.''\n  That is the concept of a long-term stewardship--that we don't own the \nland. Yes, we have deeds and we think we own it, and we can pass it on \nto our children, but we don't own the planet, and we have a \nresponsibility to pass that resource on to our children in good shape \nand not destroy it.\n  Another interesting provision in Leviticus--and I hope it is OK to \nmake notations in the Lord's Book because that is what I did. In \nLeviticus 25, Moses is told a very interesting thing about how to take \ncare of the land. God talked about a Sabbath for the land, just as He \ntalked about a Sabbath for people--a day of rest. ``For six years you \nmay plant your fields and prune your vineyards and harvest your crops, \nbut during the seventh year the land must have a Sabbath year of \ncomplete rest.''\n  Very interesting--the land must have a Sabbath. It is the Lord's \nSabbath. Do not plant your fields or prune your vineyards during that \nyear.\n  And then later on in Verse 32, God tells Moses what will happen if \nyou don't observe that rule. In other words, if you just keep planting \nand abusing the land, He said--this is again quoting God here in \nLeviticus 25: ``Your land will become desolate.'' There is an \ninteresting observation. God said:\n\n       Your land will become desolate, and your cities will lie in \n     ruins. Then at last the land will enjoy its neglected Sabbath \n     years as it lies desolate while you are in exile in the land \n     of your enemies. Then the land will finally rest and enjoy \n     the Sabbaths it missed.\n\n  The concept is we have an obligation to the land, to the Earth that \nhas been given to us.\n  Then, we skip all the way from the beginning of the Old Testament to \nthe end of the New Testament to the Book of Revelations, and there is a \nkind of admonition, I think, for all of us in terms of our stewardship \nof the Earth.\n  In Revelations 11:18, the Chapter says: ``But your wrath came, and \nthe time for the dead to be judged, and for rewarding your servants . . \n. and for destroying the destroyers of the earth.''\n  That is something we ought to take very seriously; that the time will \ncome for the destroying of the destroyers of the Earth. This is all \nabout morality, theology, and ethics. This is about simply taking care \nof the asset the Good Lord gave us--whatever Name you give to the Good \nLord. It is the Earth we have been given. It is the only Earth we have. \nIt is the only home we have, and we simply can't destroy it. Yet in \nGenesis it says man is given dominion over the waters, the Earth, and \nthe animals. But that doesn't mean we are entitled to destroy it. It \nmeans we have to steward it, we have to conserve it. That is really \nwhat this discussion is all about. This is about ethics. This is about \nmorality. It is about theology, as I have demonstrated.\n  Now, I want to go from the Good Book to another way to state this. In \nMaine we have what is called the Maine rototiller rule. It is all you \nneed to know about environmental stewardship: If you borrow your \nneighbor's rototiller to clean up your garden in the spring, the \nprinciple is you always return it in as good shape as you got it, with \na full tank of gas. That is environmental stewardship. We don't own \nthis planet. We have it on loan. Therefore, we have a responsibility to \npass it on to our children and grandchildren and countless generations \nahead of us in as good of shape as we got it and maybe with a full tank \nof gas. And that means we just can't willy-nilly act like there are no \nconsequences for our actions, that we can befoul the air and the land \nand the water for our convenience, for our aggrandizement, for our \nmaterial comfort. We have to think about other people. That is of \ncourse the fundamental principle of every religion in the world: ``Do \nunto others as you would have them do unto you.'' I would submit that \n``others'' includes not only those of us here or those of us in America \nor those of us around the world but those of us who haven't been born \nyet.\n\n[[Page S4257]]\n\nWe have an obligation to ``do unto others as we would have them do unto \nus.''\n  So I welcome the Pope's words this week as a valuable voice in an \nimportant discussion. I realize we will have differences about how to \nsolve this problem. We will have differences about the exact dimensions \nof it. We will have differences about what the resolution should be and \nthe technology we should use and how we should get there and \ntransitions and all those kinds of things. That is perfectly \nlegitimate. But, fundamentally, we have to think of this as a moral and \nethical issue--as a moral and ethical issue--the obligations we owe to \nother people in this country, to other people in the world who have no \nvoice in the use of the resources that are being taken away from them, \nand particularly to the people whom we don't yet know who are going to \nfollow us on this wonderful home we have been given to steward, to \npreserve, to use but to pass on in as good or better shape than we \nfound it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, Pope Francis released a historic \nencyclical--a message to the world to preserve the planet from climate \nchange and environmental degradation. In giving us his message to \nprotect what he calls ``our common home,'' Pope Francis has also given \nus a common goal--we must act now to stop climate change.\n  Pope Francis's encyclical calls all people of conscience to examine \nour own lives, our relationships to people and the planet, and our duty \nto take action. The Pope's message is clear: Mankind created the \nproblem of climate change and now mankind must solve it.\n  Pope Francis delivered this message to the world, but the world needs \nAmerica to lead.\n  As the wealthiest Nation in the world and one of its largest \npollution emitters, it is our economic and moral responsibility to act \nnow. There is time to avoid the worst effects of climate change, but we \nmust act now.\n  Global temperatures are warming, glaciers are melting, sea levels are \nrising, extreme downpours and weather events are increasing, the ocean \nis becoming more acidic. Last year was the warmest year ever recorded, \nand it is the poorest and the most vulnerable in developing nations who \nhave suffered the most from the developed world's pollution. By \nreducing U.S. carbon pollution, the United States can be a leader, not \na laggard, in answering Pope Francis's call.\n  Climate change deniers may be the doubting Thomases of the 21st \ncentury, but there is no doubting the science anymore when national \nacademies of sciences across the globe, including the Vatican's, all \nagree that burning fossil fuels is changing the Earth's climate.\n  So to all of the critics of Pope Francis's message, let's stop \ndenying the science and let's start deploying the solutions. Let's \ndeploy more wind and solar energy and renew tax breaks for these \nprojects. Let's make our cars and trucks even more fuel efficient. \nLet's fully implement and defend President Obama's Clean Power Plan \nthat will reduce carbon pollution from America's powerplants.\n  The United States can be the leader in the clean energy revolution to \nreduce the pollution imperiling this planet, and then we can partner \nwith other nations to share this technology and protect the most \nvulnerable. The United States has the technological imperative to lead \non clean energy. We have the economic imperative to engage in massive \njob creation that will make it possible to save all of creation. We \nhave the moral responsibility to protect our planet for future \ngenerations.\n  The Pope has given us the guidance--the moral guidance--in his \nencyclical, and we know, ultimately, science and technology will be the \nanswer to our prayers. But the leadership must begin here. This cannot \nhappen without leadership from the U.S. Senate, from the United States \nof America. If we want to see more solar and wind deployed in our \ncountry, then we must put the tax credits on the books that incentivize \nthe private sector and individuals across the country to deploy it.\n  Last year, there were 5,000 new megawatts of solar installed in the \nUnited States. That is twice as much as has been deployed in the whole \nhistory of the United States up until 5 years ago. This year, there is \ngoing to be 7,500 new megawatts of solar installed in the United \nStates. That is triple the whole history of the United States up until \n5 years ago. Next year, there is going to be 10,000 new megawatts of \nsolar installed in the United States. That is four times as much as had \never been deployed in the whole history of our country cumulatively. So \nthis is a revolution that is absolutely helping to transform the way in \nwhich we generate electricity in the United States.\n  The same thing is true for wind. Wind is expanding at the same exact \npace, in terms of generating sources of electricity from a place that \nhas always been there, using God's energy in order to provide \nelectricity for American homes and businesses.\n  What is happening in both areas? Well, the Republican Senate has \nallowed the wind tax breaks to already expire. Already they have \nexpired. The solar tax breaks expire at the end of next year. We have \nno agreement, no signal that this Senate is sending to the investors \nand solar consumers across the country that solar will be given any \nincentives past the end of next year.\n  Similarly, we have seen a dramatic increase in the fuel economy \nstandards of the vehicles which we drive. In fact, much of the problem \nwe have in finding a source of revenues for a robust transportation \nbill comes from the fact that people are now consuming less gasoline in \ntheir much more fuel-efficient cars since President Obama took the \nauthority--by the way, which this Senate gave to him in 2007--to \ndramatically increase the fuel economy standards for those vehicles. We \nhave to go all the way up to the 54.5 miles per gallon which the \nPresident has proposed. That will dramatically reduce greenhouse gases.\n  And we must ensure that the President's clean power rules, which he \nis going to promulgate within the next month, stay on the books. There \nare already those in the Senate who are saying they are going to try to \nvitiate, to overturn, to make impossible the implementation of those \npowerplant rules which will keep the greenhouse gases coming out of \ncoal-burning plants--especially across our country--to a minimum, to \nreduce by 30 percent the amount of greenhouse gases, carbon, that comes \nout of powerplants generating electricity in our country by the year \n2030. We can do this. We are a technological power. The Pope, the \nworld, they look to us.\n  They say to us: President Kennedy challenged the Nation to put a man \non the Moon in 8 years in order to say to the Soviet Union that we \nwould not allow them to dominate outer space, and in 8 years our \ncountry invented new metals, invented new propulsion systems, returned \nthat crew from the Moon safely. And we, with our American flag, said we \nare going to use outer space for peaceful purposes. Well, the flag that \nflew on the Moon is now in the Capitol. That is the return on \ninvestment in science and technology in the United States to help the \nrest of the world ensure that outer space would be used for peaceful \npurposes.\n  The rest of the world expects us to be able to invent new \ntechnologies, new batteries, solar, wind, geothermal, energy \nefficiency, vehicles, metals that\n\n[[Page S4258]]\n\nwill dramatically reduce the amount of pollution we are sending up into \nthe world but simultaneously spread these technologies across the \nplanet.\n  In the 1990s, we invented new digital technologies. It was first just \na very plain phone, but no one had one in their pocket until 1995 and \n1996 because the phone was the size of a brick and it cost 50 cents a \nminute. No one had one. It was too expensive. But then this Congress \nmoved over 200 megahertz of spectrum. It incentivized the private \nsector to begin to move. Within 3 years, everyone had one of these \nphones in their pocket. Within another 8 years, it moved to a \nsmartphone because we had begun the revolution. Where was the \nsmartphone invented? Right here in the United States.\n  Let's take Africa, for example. Twenty years ago did anyone believe \nthat 700 million people in Africa would have a wireless device in their \npocket? No. Why do they? Because the United States invented--the United \nStates put the policies on the books that generated this revolution. \nThey skipped telephone poles. They went right to wireless, right to \ncell phone towers. We did that. We gave the leadership.\n  That is leading to a lot of economic development in Africa and in \ncontinents around this world. We have to do the same thing in energy \ntechnology. They can envision a day where they bypass having to put \nwires down the street for electricity as well and solar panels could be \non their roofs, providing electricity to power their cell phones, their \nrefrigerators, their stoves, their air-conditioning.\n  We can do this. We have the capacity to do it, but we have to set our \nmind to doing it because there is an economic incentive for us. Oh, \nyes, there is a national security incentive for us. Oh, yes, we can \ntell the Middle East we don't need their oil anymore than we need their \nsand. We are going to provide our own power, and we are going to give \nother countries in the world the capacity to produce their own power. \nBut we can do it as well because it is a moral imperative, because \nGod's Earth, his creation is, in fact, now in jeopardy.\n  We have to be the leaders. We have to answer this moral cause. We \ncannot say we can't do it. We can't say we can't invent our way out of \nthis potential catastrophe for the entire planet. The Pope is calling \nupon us to be the world's leader, morally and economically. We can do \nit.\n  Today is an important day, I think a watershed moment. I am a \nCatholic. The Pope is a Jesuit who is trained as a chemist. For those \nwho say the Pope has no business talking about climate, he is a \nchemist. There are many people who say: Well, I don't have a view on \nclimate because I am not a scientist.\n  The Pope is a scientist. He has looked at the evidence. He has asked \nthe Vatican academy of arts and sciences to study this issue. They have \ncome back with their conclusions. Man is creating the problem and \nmankind now must solve the problem, but it is those who have created \nthe pollution that the greatest responsibility falls.\n  You cannot preach temperance from a barstool. You cannot tell people \nto reduce what they are doing--smoking or drinking or engaging in \ndangerous activities--if you, too, are engaging in them. The leadership \nmust come from this Chamber. The leadership must come from the United \nStates of America. Pope Francis's message must resonate throughout this \nChamber in the months and years ahead. If we do it, we will have been \ndoing--as President Kennedy said in his inaugural address--truly God's \nwork here on Earth.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/senate-section/article/S4258-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1735) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2016 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I hope we are in the final hours of a 2\\1/\n2\\-week consideration of the Defense authorization bill. Not all \namendments were debated and not as many were reported yet. We still \nhave hopes that there could be a managers' package, which is composed \nof agreed-upon amendments by both sides, equally divided by both sides \nof the aisle, both Republican and Democratic. There are some important \namendments, so I hope we are able to get approval of at least some of \nthem prior to the votes that I believe will be scheduled for this \nafternoon in order to conclude debate and consideration of the Defense \nauthorization act.\n  As we enter the final throes--and there are Members on the other side \nof the aisle and maybe even on this side of the aisle who are deeply \nconcerned about the OCO funding for this authorization--I repeat again \nto my colleagues, I don't like the use of OCO. I would like to follow \nthe advice of every one of our military leaders who say that continued \nsequestration puts the lives of the men and women who are serving in \nthe military in greater danger. I am not sure we have a greater \nobligation than to do everything possible to prevent the lives of our \nmen and women serving in uniform from being put in greater danger. To \nget hung up on the method of funding, which many will use as a \nrationale for opposing this bill, seems to me an upside down set of \npriorities--badly upside down.\n  If we don't fund, if we don't authorize, if we don't make possible \nfor us to equip and train and retain the finest military force in the \nworld, why is it a higher priority to object to the method of funding? \nAs I said, in a perfect world, I would argue vigorously--and have \ncontinued to--about the harmful effects of sequestration.\n  I am not talking about a political opinion. I am talking about the \nview of the uniformed leaders of our Nation who have the respect and \nadmiration of all of us. They are telling us that if we continue \nsequestration, which would be the effect of not including the \nadditional funding of the overseas contingency operations, then \nobviously in this world that becomes more and more dangerous as we \nspeak--and I continue to quote probably the most respected man in \nAmerica, in many respects, Henry Kissinger, who testified before our \ncommittee that he has never seen more crises around the world since \nWorld War II, as is the case today.\n  I would entreat my colleagues who may be contemplating voting against \nthis legislation on the grounds that the funding is a disqualifying \nfactor--it is a troubling factor and it is troubling to me--but \nshouldn't we care more about the men and women who are serving in the \nmilitary than the problem you might have with a certain process that \nwas followed in order to get there? I would think not.\n  If you look at the world in 2011, when the unthinkable happened; that \nis, that sequestration automatically kicked in because both sides were \nunable to agree on a process that would reduce the deficit and put us \non a path to a balanced budget. Everyone said sequestration will not \nhappen because they will come to an agreement. Obviously, sequestration \ndid happen. But if you look at the world in the year of 2011, when \nsequestration kicked in, and the world today, I think--I think--there \nis a compelling argument that national security and national defense is \nfar more important than it was then. Because of a series of events that \nbegan in 2011--including an incredibly misguided decision by the \nPresident of the United States to withdraw all forces from Iraq, which \nthen, inevitably, as some of us predicted, led to the situation as it \nexists today--the world is now and the Middle East is now literally on \nfire.\n  What are the results of the misguided policies and the commitment on \nthe\n\n[[Page S4259]]\n\npart of the President to get us out of wars? The President ignored one \nreality; that is, that we may get Americans out of wars, but that \ndoesn't mean the wars are over. What we have seen is the spread of \nISIS. We have seen Iran on the move in nations throughout the region, \nincluding the latest information we have that Iran is supplying weapons \nto the Taliban in Afghanistan, not to mention Yemen, Syria, Iraq, and \nLebanon, where they are basically in control. Our Sunni Arab--Middle \nEastern Arab nations are now going their own way because they have no \nconfidence in the United States.\n  What has been the result? All you have to do is pick up this \nmorning's copy of the Washington Post. ``Refugee crisis hits tipping \npoint. U.N. ranks 2014 as worst year on record, cites dire need for \naid.''\n\n       London--The number of people uprooted from their homes by \n     war and persecution in 2014 was larger than in any year since \n     detailed record-keeping began, according to a comprehensive \n     report released early Thursday by the U.N. refugee agency \n     that will add to the evidence of a global exodus unlike any \n     in modern times.\n       Just a year after the number of refugees, asylum-seekers \n     and people forced to flee within their own countries \n     surpassed 50 million for the first time since World War II, \n     it surged to nearly 60 million in 2014--``a nation of the \n     displaced'' that is roughly equal to the population of the \n     United Kingdom.\n       The rapidly escalating figures reflect a world of renewed \n     conflict, with wars in the Middle East, Africa, Asia and \n     Europe driving families and individuals from their homes in \n     desperate flights for safety. But the systems for managing \n     those flows are breaking down, with countries and aid \n     agencies unable to handle the strain as an average of nearly \n     45,000 people a day join the ranks of the displaced.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to understand two things: One, a lot of these \nthings didn't have to happen. The absence of American leadership and \ninvolvement is largely responsible for a great deal of this. Second of \nall, it is of vital importance, in my view, given the situation \nthroughout the world, that we pass the Defense authorization bill, \nreconcile our differences with the legislation with the House and the \nadministration, and take into account that this is probably the \ngreatest piece of reform legislation in recent history, perhaps in the \nlast 30 years, since the then-well-known Goldwater-Nichols Act was \npassed.\n  In Reuters today, it says: ``World's displaced hits record high of 60 \nmillion, half of them children.''\n  Of the 60 million people who are displaced, half of them are \nchildren. They are the ones who always suffer the most.\n  The article says:\n\n     . . . at the end of last year, the highest ever recorded \n     number, the U.N. refugee agency said on Thursday.\n       More than half the displaced from crises including Syria, \n     Afghanistan and Somalia were children, UNHCR said in its \n     Annual Global Trends Report.\n       In 2014, an average of 42,500 people became refugees, \n     asylum seekers, or internally displaced every day, \n     representing a four-fold increase in just four years.\n\n  In 4 years, there was a fourfold increase in the number of refugees. \nAgain, that is not an accident.\n\n       ``We are witnessing a paradigm change, an unchecked slide \n     into an era in which the scale of global forced displacement \n     as well as the response required is now clearly dwarfing \n     anything seen before,'' said U.N. High Commissioner for \n     Refugees Antonio Guterres in a statement.\n       UNHCR said Syria, where conflict has raged since 2011, was \n     the world's biggest source of internally displaced people and \n     refugees.\n       There were 7.6 million displaced people in Syria by the end \n     of last year and almost 4 million Syrian refugees, mainly \n     living in the neighboring countries of Lebanon, Jordan and \n     Turkey.\n\n  For the information of my colleagues, there are now more Syrian \nchildren in school in Lebanon than there are Lebanese children in \nschool in Lebanon.\n\n       UNHCR said there were 38.2 million displaced by conflict \n     within national borders, almost five million more than a year \n     before, with wars in Ukraine, South Sudan, Nigeria, Central \n     African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo \n     swelling the figures.\n       It also noted that more than 1.6 million people sought \n     political asylum in a foreign country last year, a jump of \n     more than 50 percent compared to the previous year--largely \n     due to the 270,000 Ukrainians who submitted asylum claims in \n     Russia.\n       While many conflicts have erupted or reignited in the past \n     five years, few have been conclusively resolved. Just 126,800 \n     refugees were able to return home in 2014, the lowest number \n     in 31 years, UNHCR said.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, I have been to refugee camps, and I have seen \nthe suffering and pain and the hopelessness there. I was taken around \nby a teacher at a refugee camp where there were about 175,000 people, \nas I recall, in Jordan, and there were a large number of children \naround in this camp.\n  The teacher said to me: Senator McCain, do you see all of these \nchildren here?\n  I said: Yes, I do.\n  She said: They believe you Americans have abandoned them, and when \nthey grow up, they are going to take revenge on you.\n  My friends, we are sowing the wind, and we will reap the whirlwind. \nIt is time that the United States assumed again a leadership role in \nthe world.\n  Now many of the critics who call me ``Defense Hawk'' McCain--I am not \nsure why the opponents are not called ``Defense Doves,'' fill in the \nblank--seem to believe I am advocating that a large number of American \ntroops be dispatched to the region. I am not, but I am saying we should \nlisten to the successful military leaders who succeeded in the surge in \nIraq and to a large degree succeeded in Afghanistan. I am speaking of \nGeneral Petraeus, General Keane, and Admiral McRaven. There are a \nnumber of people, both military and civilian, we should listen to. Ryan \nCrocker, to me, is the most respected member of the diplomatic corps I \nhave ever seen. Those people ought to be brought together and asked for \ntheir views to see if we can develop a strategy--a strategy, by the \nway, which the President of the United States just a few days ago \nstated is nonexistent. They should be called, and we need to develop a \nstrategy. There is no strategy. If we had a strategy--and these numbers \nof a record high of the world's displaced of 60 million people, half of \nthem children--perhaps we could turn this situation around.\n  No one believes we are winning in the struggle against ISIS. We are \nat the negotiating table in various luxuriant hotels and resorts in \nEurope, negotiating with the Iranians over a nuclear deal while they \nare moving and controlling four nations, and the latest, of course, is \nthat they are supplying weapons to the Taliban.\n  We need to have a strategy that is inclusive, and we need to draw on \nthe experience and knowledge from some of the most respected men we \nhave in this country with a military, political, diplomatic, and \neconomic background and come up with a strategy.\n  I will tell my colleagues there is no good answer. There is the least \nof bad options. But we have to exercise an option rather than run in \nplace for the next year and a half until we have a new President of the \nUnited States.\n  This legislation is not going to solve those problems. This \nlegislation has certain policy implications. This legislation does not \nachieve the goals I was just speaking about. But this legislation does \ndo the things we need to do--we, as the people's elected \nrepresentatives whose first obligation is the defense of this Nation. \nThis legislation addresses many issues that will make our defense \nestablishment more responsive, more responsible, more efficient, and \nmost of all will provide the equipment and the capabilities for the men \nand women who are serving in the military, many of them still in harm's \nway, so that they can defend this Nation. Anybody who believes ISIS \nwould be content to remain in the Middle East and not export that \nterror to the United States of America has not listened to the Director \nof the CIA, the head of the FBI, and every other military expert. ISIS \nis bent on harming America.\n  When Mr. Baghdadi left Camp Bucca, where he spent 4 years--Mr. \nBaghdadi, obviously, as we know, is the leader of ISIS. He spent 4 \nyears at Camp Bucca in Iraq. When he left, he said: I will see you in \nNew York. Mr. Baghdadi wasn't kidding. ISIS is bent on attacking us. \nCan they destroy us? No. But the ability of ISIS to be able to launch \nsome attacks on the United States of America grows every time there are \nthousands of young men and some young women who go to Syria and Iraq \nand are radicalized even more and return, sooner or later, to the \ncountry from which they came.\n  I ask that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle put aside the \nsmaller\n\n[[Page S4260]]\n\ndifferences we have. And there are differences with my colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle concerning, for example, the sage-grouse and a \nnumber of other provisions in this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to put aside those differences--and in the view \nof many, there are significant differences--and vote in favor of this \nlegislation and send a message that at least on the issue of defending \nthe Nation, we will provide the men and women who are putting their \nlives on the line on our behalf the best possible capabilities we can \npossibly provide for them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article entitled \n``Refugee crisis hits tipping point'' in the Washington Post this \nmorning be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 18, 2015]\n\n                   Refugee Crisis Hits Tipping Point\n\n                            (By Griff Witte)\n\n       London.--The number of people uprooted from their homes by \n     war and persecution in 2014 was larger than in any year since \n     detailed record-keeping began, according to a comprehensive \n     report released early Thursday by the U.N. refugee agency \n     that will add to the evidence of a global exodus unlike any \n     in modern times.\n       Just a year after the number of refugees, asylum-seekers \n     and people forced to flee within their own countries \n     surpassed 50 million for the first time since World War II, \n     it surged to nearly 60 million in 2014--``a nation of the \n     displaced'' that is roughly equal to the population of the \n     United Kingdom.\n       The rapidly escalating figures reflect a world of renewed \n     conflict, with wars in the Middle East, Africa, Asia and \n     Europe driving families and individuals from their homes in \n     desperate flights for safety. But the systems for managing \n     those flows are breaking down, with countries and aid \n     agencies unable to handle the strain as an average of nearly \n     45,000 people a day join the ranks of those either on the \n     move or stranded far from home.\n       ``We are witnessing a paradigm change, an unchecked slide \n     into an era in which the scale of global forced displacement \n     as well as the response required is now clearly dwarfing \n     anything seen before,'' U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees \n     Antonio Guterres said in a statement. ``It is terrifying that \n     on the one hand there is more and more impunity for those \n     starting conflicts, and on the other there is seeming utter \n     inability of the international community to work together to \n     stop wars and build and preserve peace.''\n       The annual report on global trends in displacement, issued \n     by the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, or \n     UNHCR, offers perhaps the most authoritative look at who is \n     being uprooted by conflict, where they come from and where \n     they go. The agency, created in 1950 to support Europeans \n     displaced by World War II, said the figures for 2014 were \n     higher than it has ever recorded.\n       The overall number, which does not include those displaced \n     by natural disasters or economic migrants in search of a \n     better life, had been relatively stable, at around 40 \n     million, since the start of the 21st century.\n       But it abruptly shot up in 2013, and the pace accelerated \n     last year. Although the report does not cover 2015, there is \n     no indication that the trajectory has changed.\n       The four-year-old war in Syria has been the single biggest \n     driver of the surging numbers. Last year, 1 in 5 displaced \n     persons worldwide was Syrian. The country in 2014 became the \n     planet's largest source of refugees, displacing Afghanistan, \n     which had held that dubious distinction for three decades.\n       The impact of a Syrian population on the move has been felt \n     across the Middle East. Neighboring Turkey now hosts more \n     refugees than any other nation, knocking Pakistan to No. 2. \n     Lebanon has the world's highest concentration, at nearly a \n     quarter of those living in the tiny Mediterranean nation.\n       The vast majority of refugees last year were hosted by poor \n     countries that can least afford the added strain. Nearly 9 \n     out of 10 refugees were living in the developing world--a \n     figure that hit a two-decade high.\n       Meanwhile, with nations across the developing world either \n     at war or in crisis, some of the world's wealthiest nations \n     have focused on how to beat back the rising tide of those \n     seeking escape.\n       France and Austria have stepped up police checks at \n     crossings with Italy, leaving migrants to camp out at train \n     stations in Rome and Milan. Hungary on Wednesday announced \n     plans to build a 12-foot fence along its border with Serbia. \n     Nations across Europe have balked at proposals to more \n     equitably share the burden of asylum-seekers while rushing to \n     approve plans to blow up smuggler ships in the Mediterranean.\n       The tough response has been largely due to political \n     pressure among populations hostile to the influx of migrants. \n     But it prompted Pope Francis on Wednesday to suggest that \n     those ``who close the door'' to migrants seeking protection \n     should ask forgiveness from God.\n       The UNHCR and other aid groups have pleaded for more \n     assistance to keep pace with the ever-growing numbers, but to \n     little avail.\n       ``There's a real risk that we're seeing the unraveling of \n     the refugee regime that was created in the aftermath of the \n     Second World War on the basis of cooperation and \n     reciprocity,'' said Alexander Betts, director of the Refugee \n     Studies Center at Oxford University.\n       Betts said that unlike during other conflicts, including \n     those in Southeast Asia, the Balkans and Central America, \n     governments are not stepping up to offer assistance \n     commensurate with the scale of a problem that now touches \n     virtually every corner of the globe.\n       ``This isn't a regional problem,'' he said. ``It's a global \n     challenge.''\n       The UNHCR's report identifies at least 15 wars across three \n     continents that have either erupted or reignited in the past \n     five years, and that together have forced millions to abandon \n     their homes. A total of 13.9 million people were displaced in \n     2014 alone.\n       About a third of those were in sub-Saharan Africa, where \n     wars in the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Somalia, \n     Nigeria and Congo all flared. Somalia alone is the source of \n     more than a million refugees, the world's third-highest \n     total.\n       Europe experienced the biggest proportional increase in \n     displaced persons last year, with a staggering 51 percent \n     increase over 2013.\n       While much of that was due to Syrian refugees streaming \n     into Turkey, it also reflected the 219,000 people who entered \n     the continent via the perilous journey across the \n     Mediterranean. And as Russian-backed rebels brought war back \n     to European soil, more than 800,000 people were left \n     internally displaced in Ukraine. About 200,000 Ukrainians \n     applied for asylum in Russia.\n       Worldwide, the number of internally displaced people vastly \n     outstripped the number of refugees. Once people fled their \n     home countries, they had little hope of returning. Just \n     126,800 refugees went back to their home countries in 2014 \n     out of a global refugee population of 14.4 million. That \n     marked the lowest level of return since 1983.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would note for my colleagues the \npresence of General Dunford, Commandant of the Marine Corps, a great \ncombat leader and leader of our military and considered to be the next \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a man we all admire a great \ndeal.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Tragedy at Emanuel AME Church\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, like many have said here today, I would \nlike to express my deepest condolences to the victims of the shooting \nat Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, SC, last \nnight. This was a senseless act of violence. My thoughts and prayers \nare with the victims, their families, and all affected by this horrible \ntragedy.\n  I know we all hope the perpetrator is swiftly brought to justice. I \npray for the safety of the entire Charleston community. This was an act \nof senseless violence, to be sure. But as I understand it, the \nperpetrator saved one woman and told her: ``I want you to tell everyone \nwhat happened here.'' That is beyond sinister. That is evil. That evil \nmust be stopped and must be dealt with.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  What I would like to talk about now is the Supreme Court's critical \nruling on the most recent review of the Affordable Care Act--ObamaCare. \nIt is important to highlight many of the ways this law is negatively \nimpacting our health care system as a whole, my constituents in Kansas, \nthe Presiding Officer's constituents in her neighboring State of \nNebraska--all over the country.\n  Trying to list all of the problems with this law is nearly \nimpossible. Perhaps the best way is to review the promises of the \nPresident of the United States. The crafting of this law was supposed \nto follow his promise of being the most transparent administration in\n\n[[Page S4261]]\n\nhistory. The problem is that there has been a lack of transparency--not \nto mention the oversight of this law since it was originally being \ncrafted and throughout its implementation.\n  Despite hearing the contrary from our docs and nurses about practices \nand hospitals closing and premiums and copays increasing, the \nadministration continues to turn a blind eye. The administration \ncontinually moves the goal posts to which they measure success and have \nclaimed victory.\n  In 2012, the Congressional Budget Office projected there would be 14 \nmillion people enrolled in exchange plans this year. Then late last \nyear, the administration back-pedaled on its projections for the second \nyear of enrollment, moving the goal posts. The most recent data out of \nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the infamous CMS, shows \nthat when you look at how many individuals had effectual coverage or \nactually paid their first month's premium and continued to have an \nactive policy, that number is 10 million. Madam President, that is \nnearly 30 percent below the 2012 enrollment projections--30 percent. \nThat is not transparency. That is not victory.\n\n  So why is this number lower? Why aren't folks signing up? First, we \nhad a Web site that crashed and that didn't work. Then Americans tried \nto shop around and view the policies available to them. But as it turns \nout, the law didn't lower premiums for the average family by $2,500--\nremember that promise--as the President promised. This didn't happen. \nPremiums are increasing.\n  The President also promised you could keep your same health care plan \nand your doctor. We have known for some time that is just not true. It \ndidn't happen.\n  Yet just last week the President responded to questions regarding his \nsignature law--his legacy law, if you will--at a press conference \nfollowing the G-7 summit. He said: ``The thing is working.'' Now, one \nmight add that the ``thing'' is a pretty good term for the Affordable \nCare Act.\n  The President also said: ``I mean, part of what's bizarre about this \nwhole thing is we haven't had a lot of conversation about the horrors \nof ObamaCare because none of them have really come to pass.''\n  Really?\n  President Obama concluded: ``It hasn't had an adverse effect on \npeople who already had health insurance.''\n  Well, I am not sure what data has been presented to the President or \nwhich American family he has been listening to, but it is certainly not \nthe reality that I have experienced and that Kansans are experiencing. \nThe real-life threats of this law we hear from Kansans back home have \nnot stopped. They are increasing.\n  A small business owner in Cummings, KS, called my office to inform me \nhis premium this year went up over $500 a month--more than double last \nyear's.\n  Eddy, in Spring Hill, says his premium has doubled and his deductible \nhas doubled. He is being forced to choose between running his company \nand buying health insurance. He says he can't do both.\n  Let's go back to the President's comments about this ``thing'' having \nno adverse effect. Just a couple of weeks ago his own administration \npublished the proposed double-digit--double-digit--premium increases \nfor 2016--next year. The plans on the list affect more than 6 million \npeople across the country and are seeking an average increase of 21 \npercent.\n  The Kansas Insurance Department tells us that premiums for some \nindividual and small group health care plans are likely to increase by \nas much as 38 percent.\n  According to the administration's list, 14 insurance plans are \nseeking premium increases above 10 percent for next year. That covers \n100,000 Kansans. When you look at just two insurance plans, those two \ninsurance plans have increases of 28 and 38 percent. Perhaps the \nPresident does not categorize these 100,000 Kansans as being adversely \naffected by this ``thing.''\n  Simply put, premiums will continue to spiral upward if we do not act. \nFacts and reality are really very stubborn things. Even ObamaCare's \nchief architect, Jonathan Gruber--we all remember Jonathan Gruber--was \nquoted last year as saying if ``you made it explicit that healthy \npeople pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed. Lack \nof transparency is a huge political advantage.'' So said Mr. Gruber.\n  Still quoting Mr. Gruber: ``And basically, call it the stupidity of \nthe American voter or whatever, but basically that really was really, \nreally critical for the thing to pass.'' That is his quote.\n  Those comments belittle the American people and try to rationalize \nwhy, when you have an agenda, the government should not be transparent. \nThe President and proponents of ObamaCare all said publicly this was \nthe first step to nationalized health insurance. That certainly has \nbecome transparent.\n  Now, not only are individuals adversely affected in terms of their \nown insurance coverage, but also due to the law's mandate on employers, \nmany are seeing the law's negative repercussions at their jobs. The \nlaw's employer mandate hinders job creation and growth. Its new \ndefinition of full-time employment at 30 hours a week has been a real \nproblem. According to one estimate, 2.6 million workers--2.6 million \nworkers--could potentially have their hours and therefore their \npaychecks reduced as a result of this provision.\n  Most concerning is that this new definition of full-time employment \nhits low-wage earners who work in the service industries. Of the \nindividuals at risk, about half work in retail and half in restaurants. \nIf these folks were previously working the traditional 40 hours per \nweek, you are not just taking 10 hours from them, but you are reducing \ntheir paycheck by 25 percent a week. That is why they work in two \ndifferent jobs. That is a very noticeable adverse effect.\n  The concerns I have outlined today are only a few of the many reasons \nwhy we need to repeal this law, both the individual and employer \nmandates. We need to fix health care. Everybody knows that. But we \ndon't need to fix ObamaCare. We need to give peace of mind to the \nfamilies hurt by ObamaCare.\n  Now, no one is saying go back to the system we had before. We need \nreforms to our health care system every day. ObamaCare is costing \nmillions of dollars. But with this law--what the President has called \n``this thing''--we may have mandated greater coverage for all but not \naccess to care and at a cost that is unaffordable. Let me repeat that. \nWe may have mandated greater coverage for all--if that was the goal of \nmy friends across the aisle--but not access to care and at a cost that \nis unaffordable. That is not a health care plan.\n  Perhaps some can afford the rising premiums, but can you actually go \nsee your doctor and receive treatment or is your deductible too high? \nAnd is your doctor still available to you? Will your doctor spend at \nleast 5 minutes with you--5 minutes with you--or more time filling out \nforms or electronic medical records? And are those records secure?\n  Any day now the Supreme Court will hand down its decision in King v. \nBurwell. This is the case that will determine the legality of the \nadministration's regulation extending health insurance subsidies to \npeople in States that use the Federal insurance exchange. And we will \nsee--we will see--if the Court decides that the law should be \nimplemented as written by this Congress--with all of us on this side of \nthe aisle voting no--or implemented as interpreted by the \nadministration.\n  This is similarly troubling for Kansas, where we have a federally \nfacilitated exchange. If these tax subsidies go away, 77,000 Kansans \nand millions of Americans, will be affected. These individuals would be \nconfronted with ObamaCare's true cost--true cost--and would face much \nhigher premiums, with only the administration to blame for recklessly \noffering tens of billions of dollars in subsidies they had no authority \nto offer, if the Court rules that way.\n  A ruling against the administration would also free many of these \nKansans from the individual mandate penalty if that coverage is too \nexpensive for them and they, therefore, would qualify for an \naffordability exemption.\n  The employer mandate penalties would also be unenforceable. Employers \ncan then add employees above the 50 threshold without fear of penalty \nand increase workers' hours to more than 30 hours per week.\n\n[[Page S4262]]\n\n  If the Court invalidates the subsidies, we will be ready. We will be \nready on this side of the aisle with our solutions to help mitigate the \npain for those individuals harmed by the administration and provide \nStates greater flexibility and build a bridge away from ObamaCare.\n  However the Court rules, I know that I and everybody on this side of \nthe aisle will continue fighting to repeal this harmful law and replace \nit with true health care reforms that lower costs, lift the burden on \nour job creators, and restore the all-important relationship between a \ndoctor and a patient.\n  The test to fix health care, not ObamaCare, is coming soon. Let's fix \nhealth care.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            Vote Explanation\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, on June 4, I was not present to vote on \nSenator Jeanne Shaheen's amendment to the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for FY 2016, amendment No. 1494 to H.R. 1735. I would \nhave voted against this measure.\n  Madam President, as well, had I been present for the vote on \namendment No. 1889, I would have voted no on this amendment. I do not \nsupport telegraphing to the enemy what interrogation techniques we will \nor won't use and denying future Commanders in Chief and intelligence \nprofessionals important tools for protecting the American people and \nthe U.S. homeland.\n\n\n Maritime Partner Capacity Building Efforts in the Asia-Pacific Region\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, in the interests of moving the defense \nbill forward I withdraw my amendments, Nos. 2038 and 2056.\n  These amendments were intended address a set of issues where I share \na concern with the chairman and ranking member of the Armed Services \nCommittee that the U.S. needs to make additional concerted effort and \nprovide additional focus to our maritime partner capacity building \nefforts in the Asia-Pacific region. Indeed, the chairman included a \nsignificant provision in this bill for a South China Sea initiative \nwhich I support. My efforts were intended to compliment the work of the \nchairman and assure that we have a fully articulated and whole-of-\ngovernment approach to this issue, with both the Department of Defense \nand the Department of State fully and appropriately engaged.\n  The chairman and I have had some positive discussions on this issue \nin recent days, and I have received his assurances that my concerns \nwill be addressed as this legislation moves forward. And I also intend \nto make sure that other aspects of this issue are addressed in \nlegislation that the Foreign Relations Committee will take up, and \nwhere I look to the chairman for his partnership and continued \nleadership on this issue.\n  With those assurances--and given the deep and shared commitment the \nchairman and I have on this issue--I do not see a need to press forward \nfor a vote on my amendments at this time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Maryland for his consideration. \nI can assure him that we share a common set of concerns and common set \nof goals on this issue. We have discussed a pathway forward that \naddresses the questions raised by his proposed amendments, and I look \nforward to working with him going forward. And I very much look forward \nto continuing to work with him on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise today to thank colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle for the debate and votes we will be casting today on \nthe National Defense Authorization Act. We have come together in a \nbipartisan fashion, and we have spent significant time in committee and \nnow on the floor to deal with countless provisions. This act is nothing \nif not detailed with countless provisions that are critical to the \ndefense of the Nation.\n  We have a long tradition of bipartisanship in this body on the NDAA. \nThe Senate passes an NDAA in one form or another every year, and that \ncan't be said about any other piece of legislation. I want to \ncongratulate the new chairman, Senator McCain, and the new ranking \nmember, Senator Reed, and I want to congratulate my colleagues who \nserve together on the committee, including our Presiding Officer, and \nalso all of our staff, both our personal staff and committee staff--I \nsee some committee staff here--because this is a significant amount of \nwork.\n  There are many important provisions in the NDAA that affect our \nnational security, and my Commonwealth of Virginia is deeply connected \nto the American military. In addition to grand items, the NDAA also \nexamines in some excruciating detail some very, very fine points.\n  Just to give a few examples, the NDAA includes a provision dealing \nwith storage facilities that are needed to help us combat rust on \nmilitary vehicles, the transmission systems that are used in some army \nland vehicles, the reflective markings and lights that are used on \nmilitary air fields, one particular military barracks that has sewage, \nmold, hot water, and rodent problems, and we even deal in the NDAA with \nsome details of West Point's football program--some of the athletic \nprograms at West Point.\n  But after all this minute analysis and debate and discussion over the \npast weeks, both in committee and on the floor, I do notice something a \nlittle bit strange. While Congress is very willing to debate and vote \non all things great and small concerning our military, there is one \nthing we don't want to debate or vote on--whether the United States \nshould be at war, whether we should be at war with ISIL. We will vote \non shipbuilding, we will vote on military pensions, we will vote on \nvehicle rust, and we will vote on barracks mold. But we don't want to \nvote on whether the Nation should be at war.\n  I proposed an amendment to the NDAA with Senator Flake and Senator \nManchin expressing the sense of the Senate that we should have an \nauthorization debate about whether we should be at war with ISIL, and \nthe amendment that I proposed was ruled nongermane--so barracks mold, \nyes; vehicle rust, yes; the athletic programs at West Point, yes; \nwhether we should be at war, nongermane to the Defense authorization \nact.\n  Interestingly, we even took a vote on the floor of the Senate in the \nNDAA about whether we should arm the Kurds in a war that Congress has \nnot authorized that we could debate and vote on; but whether we should \nbe at war we have not debated and voted upon.\n  So I went back and looked at article I of the Constitution. I found \nthat there is no requirement that Congress vote on barracks mold or \nrust prevention or military airfield lighting. Certainly we can and \nshould take up those matters because each of those matters--even if \nthey just affect one barracks or one airfield--is about the safety of \nour troops and military personnel. Of course we should take them up. \nBut there is nothing in the Constitution that requires that we take \nthem up and debate and vote on them. But we are required to debate and \nvote to authorize war. Article I, section 8, clearly declares that \nCongress shall have the power to declare war--not the President; \nCongress. Yet, on this item, on this large item, on this largest of \nitems, we are unwilling to debate and vote.\n  The war against ISIL is now in its 11th month; more than 3,500 U.S. \nairstrikes, more than 3,000 U.S. forces now in Iraq. U.S. \nservicemembers and American hostages have lost their lives in the \nbattle against ISIL. The cost of the war to the American taxpayer is \nnow more than $2.5 billion--an average cost of $9 million a day. The \nISIL threat is spreading, the mission expanding.\n  In response to ISIL advances in the Anbar Province, the \nadministration recently announced that an additional 450 trainers would \nbe deployed to train and support Iraqi security forces.\n  So my question as a strong supporter of the NDAA is a simple one: How \nmuch longer will we allow war to be waged without Congress even being \nwilling to have a debate about the strategy and scope of the mission? \nHow much longer will we keep asking servicemembers to risk their lives \nwithout Congress doing the basic job of authorizing this war?\n  U.S. airstrikes started on August 8--313 days ago. Let me put this in \na historic perspective. The 1-year anniversary of this war is \napproaching quickly. Congressional inaction on it is already of \nhistoric proportions.\n\n[[Page S4263]]\n\n  World War I: It took President Wilson 33 days to bring an \nauthorization to Congress. Congress acted in 4 days.\n  World War II: It took President Roosevelt 1 day to bring a request to \nCongress. Congress acted on the same day.\n  The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution: President Johnson brought a resolution \nto Congress within 3 days. Congress acted 5 days thereafter.\n  The invasion of Kuwait in gulf war 1: It took 160 days for the \nPresident to bring an authorization to Congress, but Congress acted \nwithin 4 days in approving an authorization.\n  The 9/11 attacks: President Bush came the same day to Congress. It \ntook 3 days for Congress to act.\n  In this war against ISIL, it took the President nearly 6 months to \nbring an authorization to Congress, and it is now more than 4 months \nsince that happened--313 days--and Congress has said virtually nothing.\n  I appreciate that Chairman Corker and Ranking Member Cardin have made \na recent commitment to discuss an ISIL authorization in the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, which is the committee of jurisdiction. I \nunderstand that. Senator Flake and I have introduced a bipartisan \nproposal to show that there is bipartisan support for this mission, and \nwe have been pushing to have the matter heard.\n  Yesterday, in a debate on the House floor, the chairman of the HASC \ncommittee stated plainly that it is time that we ``ought to have a real \nAUMF debate.''\n  So I am here to support the NDAA and the good work our chair and \nranking member and all the members have done. But I am here to point \nout that on day 313, if we are willing to deal with important, narrow, \nsmall issues, we should be finally willing to address the most \nimportant issue we have before us. I challenge my colleagues to do this \nand to bring the same amount of attention and bipartisanship to \ndebating whether we should send American troops to war as we are \nwilling to apply to barracks mold and vehicle rust.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, with the bill managers' permission, I \nask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I know the bill managers are working on \na final agreement, and I would defer to them at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SUPPORT FOR SECURITY OF AFGHAN WOMEN AND GIRLS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Through the sacrifice and dedication of members of the \n     Armed Forces, civilian personnel, and our Afghan partners as \n     well as the American people's generous investment, oppressive \n     Taliban rule has given way to a nascent democracy in \n     Afghanistan. It is in our national security interest to help \n     prevent Afghanistan from ever again becoming a safe haven and \n     training ground for international terrorism and to solidify \n     and preserve the gains our men and women in uniform fought so \n     hard to establish.\n       (2) The United States through its National Action Plan on \n     Women, Peace, and Security has made firm commitments to \n     support the human rights of the women and girls of \n     Afghanistan. The National Action Plan states that ``the \n     engagement and protection of women as agents of peace and \n     stability will be central to United States efforts to promote \n     security, prevent, respond to, and resolve conflict, and \n     rebuild societies''.\n       (3) As stated in the Department of Defense's October 2014 \n     Report on Progress Toward Security and Stability in \n     Afghanistan, the Department of Defense and the International \n     Security Assistance Force (ISAF) ``maintain a robust program \n     dedicated to improving the recruitment, retention, and \n     treatment of women in the Afghan National Security Forces \n     (ANSF), and to improving the status of Afghan women in \n     general''.\n       (4) According to the Department of Defense's October 2014 \n     Report on Progress Toward Security and Stability in \n     Afghanistan, the ``Afghan MoI showed significant support for \n     women in the MoI and is taking steps to protect and empower \n     female police and female MoI staff''. Although some positive \n     steps have been made, progress remains slow to reach the \n     MoI's goal of recruiting 10,000 women in the Afghan National \n     Police (ANP) in the next 10 years.\n       (5) According to Inclusive Security, women only make up \n     approximately 1 percent of the Afghan National Police. There \n     are about 2,200 women serving in the police force, fewer than \n     the goal of 5,000 women set by the Government of Afghanistan.\n       (6) According to the International Crisis Group, there are \n     not enough female police officers to staff all provincial \n     Family Response Units (FRUs). United Nations Assistance \n     Mission Afghanistan and the Office of the High Commissioner \n     for Refugees found that ``in the absence of Family Response \n     Units or visible women police officers, women victims almost \n     never approach police stations willingly, fearing they will \n     be arrested, their reputations stained or worse''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress on Promotion of Security of Afghan \n     Women.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is in the national security interests of the United \n     States to prevent Afghanistan from again becoming a safe \n     haven and training ground for international terrorism;\n       (2) as an important part of a strategy to achieve this \n     objective and to help Afghanistan achieve its full potential, \n     the United States Government should continue to regularly \n     press the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan \n     to commit to the meaningful inclusion of women in the \n     political, economic, and security transition process and to \n     ensure that women's concerns are fully reflected in relevant \n     negotiations;\n       (3) the United States Government and the Government of \n     Afghanistan should reaffirm their commitment to supporting \n     Afghan civil society, including women's organizations, as \n     agreed to during the meeting between the International \n     Community and the Government of Afghanistan on the Tokyo \n     Mutual Accountability Framework (TMAF) in July 2013;\n       (4) the United States Government should continue to support \n     and encourage efforts to recruit and retain women in the \n     Afghan National Security Forces, who are critical to the \n     success of NATO's Resolute Support Mission and future \n     Enduring Partnership mission; and\n       (5) the United States should bid on no less than one gender \n     advisor billet within the Resolute Support Mission Gender \n     Advisory Unit and continue to work with other countries to \n     ensure that the Resolute Support Mission Gender Advisory Unit \n     billets are fully staffed.\n       (c) Plan to Promote Security of Afghan Women.--\n\n[[Page S4269]]\n\n       (1) Reporting requirement.--The Secretary of Defense, in \n     conjunction with the Secretary of State, shall include in the \n     report required under section 1225 of the Carl Levin and \n     Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 2015 (Public Law 113-291;

and\n       (v) a plan to develop training for the ANA and the ANP to \n     increase awareness and responsiveness among ANA and ANP \n     personnel regarding the unique security challenges women \n     confront when serving in those forces.\n       (C) Enrollment and treatment.--The Secretary of Defense, in \n     cooperation with the Afghan Ministries of Defense and \n     Interior, shall seek to assist the Government of Afghanistan \n     in including as part of the plan developed under subparagraph \n     (A) the development and implementation of a plan to increase \n     the number of female members of the ANA and ANP and to \n     promote their equal treatment, including through such steps \n     as providing appropriate equipment, modifying facilities, and \n     ensuring literacy and gender awareness training for recruits.\n       (D) Allocation of funds.--\n       (i) In general.--Of the funds available to the Department \n     of Defense for the Afghan Security Forces Fund for Fiscal \n     Year 2016, no less than $10,000,000 should be used for the \n     recruitment, integration, retention, training, and treatment \n     of women in the ANSF as well as the recruitment, training, \n     and contracting of female security personnel for future \n     elections.\n       (ii) Types of programs and activities.--Such programs and \n     activities may include--\n\n       (I) efforts to recruit women into the ANSF, including the \n     special operations forces;\n       (II) programs and activities of the Afghan Ministry of \n     Defense Directorate of Human Rights and Gender Integration \n     and the Afghan Ministry of Interior Office of Human Rights, \n     Gender and Child Rights;\n       (III) development and dissemination of gender and human \n     rights educational and training materials and programs within \n     the Afghan Ministry of Defense and the Afghan Ministry of \n     Interior;\n       (IV) efforts to address harassment and violence against \n     women within the ANSF;\n       (V) improvements to infrastructure that address the \n     requirements of women serving in the ANSF, including \n     appropriate equipment for female security and police forces, \n     and transportation for policewomen to their station\n       (VI) support for ANP Family Response Units; and\n       (VII) security provisions for high-profile female police \n     and army officers.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2006\n\n(Purpose: Relating to the policies of the Department of Defense on the \n   travel of next of kin to participate in the dignified transfer of \n remains of members of the Armed Forces and civilian employees of the \n                Department of Defense who die overseas)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title VI , add the following:\n\n     SEC. 622.

Any activities carried out pursuant to such \n     authority shall be conducted in a manner that appropriately \n     protects sensitive information and United States and Israel \n     national security interests.\n       (2) Report.--The activities described in paragraph (1) and \n     subsection (d) may be carried out after the Secretary of \n     Defense submits to the appropriate committees of Congress a \n     report setting forth the following:\n       (A) A memorandum of agreement between the United States and \n     Israel regarding sharing of research and development costs \n     for the capabilities described in paragraph (1), and any \n     supporting documents.\n       (B) A certification that the memorandum of agreement--\n       (i) requires sharing of costs of projects, including in-\n     kind support, between the United States and Israel;\n       (ii) establishes a framework to negotiate the rights to any \n     intellectual property developed under the memorandum of \n     agreement; and\n       (iii) requires the United States Government to receive \n     quarterly reports on expenditure of funds, if any, by the \n     Government of Israel, including a description of what the \n     funds have been used for, when funds were expended, and an \n     identification of entities that expended the funds.\n       (d) Assistance in Connection With Program.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Defense is authorized to \n     provide procurement, maintenance, and sustainment assistance \n     to Israel in support of the anti-tunnel capabilities \n     research, development, test, and evaluation activities \n     authorized in subsection (c)(1).\n       (2) Report.--Assistance may not be provided under paragraph \n     (1) until 15 days after the Secretary submits to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress a report setting forth a \n     detailed description of the assistance to be provided.\n       (3) Matching contribution.--Assistance may not be provided \n     under this subsection unless the Government of Israel \n     contributes an amount not less than the amount of assistance \n     to be so provided to the program, project, or activity for \n     which the assistance is to be so provided.\n       (e) Quarterly Reports.--The Secretary of Defense shall \n     submit to the appropriate committees of Congress on a \n     quarterly basis a report that contains a copy of the most \n     recent quarterly report provided by the Government of Israel \n     to the Department of Defense pursuant to subsection \n     (c)(2)(B)(iii).\n       (f) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' \n     means--\n       (1) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations, the Committee on Homeland Security, and \n     the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate; and\n       (2) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Foreign Affairs, the Committee on Homeland Security, and the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives.\n       (g) Sunset.--The authority in this section to carry out \n     activities described in subsection (c), and to provide \n     assistance described in subsection (d), shall expire on the \n     date that is three years after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1916\n\n (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to designate a \nconstruction agent for certain construction projects by the Department \n                          of Veterans Affairs)\n\n       At the end of subtitle G of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1085. DESIGNATION OF CONSTRUCTION AGENT FOR CERTAIN \n                   CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS BY DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS \n                   AFFAIRS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     seek to enter into an agreement subject to subsections (b), \n     (c), and (e) of section 1535 of title 31, United States Code, \n     with the Army Corps of Engineers or another entity of the \n     Federal Government to serve, on a reimbursable basis, as the \n     construction agent on all construction projects of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs specifically authorized by \n     Congress after the date of the enactment of this Act that \n     involve a total expenditure of more than $100,000,000, \n     excluding any acquisition by exchange.\n       (b) Agreement.--Under the agreement entered into under \n     subsection (a), the construction agent shall provide design, \n     procurement, and construction management services for the \n     construction, alteration, and acquisition of facilities of \n     the Department.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all \npostcloture time on H.R. 1735 expire at 1:45 p.m. today, with the time \nequally divided between the managers or their designees for debate \nonly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I have asked the members of the \ncommittee to convene in the President's Room at 1:30 p.m., if they \nwould, because there is a portion of the bill, the annex, that needs to \nbe approved. We need a quorum for that so that we can move forward with \nthe final vote on the bill.\n  I also wish to thank all Members on both sides of the aisle for the \nconduct of this debate in consideration of a very large and very \ncomplex piece of legislation.\n  I especially thank my friend from Rhode Island, who has worked \ndiligently, along with his staff, to see that we arrive at this point. \nWe have a lot of other hurdles to go through, but without getting \nthrough this one, we couldn't have been prepared for those that are \nlaid before us before the President puts his signature on this most \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  I yield to my friend from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I, too, want to commend the chairman and \nhis staff for extraordinarily diligent, cooperative, and careful work. \nI am pleased to be here to support this block of amendments. As the \nchairman noted, we are on the verge of passage of the legislation. Then \nwe will be able to move forward and address other issues.\n  I thank the chairman for his cooperation and his great leadership.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                      Defense Appropriations Bill\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I congratulate the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee for this heroic effort, doing, \nas the chairman said, the most important business we can do as part of \nthe Federal Government; that is, keeping America safe and making sure \nwe keep our commitments to those who volunteer to serve, many in harm's \nway, to protect our liberties.\n  In a couple hours, we will vote to pass the Defense authorization \nbill, and that is an important bipartisan accomplishment. It is just \nanother step in a new Congress which has acted in a bipartisan way to \ndeal with a number of challenges confronting the country.\n  I am more optimistic today than I have been in a long time that the \nSenate is finally back to work and Congress is doing what the American \npeople who elected us sent us here to do, and that is to do their work \nand to represent them to the best of our ability, which is one reason \nwhy I have come to the floor to express some of my concerns at what we \nhave heard from the Democratic leadership about their intentions with \nregard to the next piece of legislation we turn to--the Defense \nappropriations bill. As we all know, the Democratic leader and some \nDemocrats in his caucus have threatened not to move forward on this \nDefense appropriations bill.\n  I want to talk about the consequences in the real world of holding up \nthis Defense appropriations bill and particularly how it will affect my \nhome State of Texas.\n  Obviously, the Defense appropriations bill will provide the military \nwith resources necessary to meet the significant demands they face and \nwe face as a country around the world but most basically to defend our \ncountry and to keep us safe.\n  This bill provides for training and readiness funds and makes sure \nour troops are well prepared to carry out any mission that might be \nassigned to them anywhere in the world.\n  The appropriations bill provides the money for critical modernization \nof our aircraft, ships, ground vehicles, and other equipment so that \nour troops can fight with the best cutting-edge weapons systems at our \ndisposal so they can accomplish their objective.\n  Perhaps most importantly, this legislation helps make sure our troops \nand military families enjoy a good quality of life. We have an all-\nvolunteer military, and the family members of those who wear the \nuniform serve no less than the ones who wear the uniform. So making \nsure the families of our military members enjoy a good quality of life \nis very important. We will never be able to repay our troops for all \nthey\n\n[[Page S4271]]\n\nhave given us, but we can at least provide appropriate benefits to \ntheir families to help make their lives a little easier.\n  This bill also includes funding to actually pay our troops their \nsalary and provides them a modest, well-deserved raise.\n  Like the Presiding Officer, I am proud of those who serve our Nation \nand our military and our home States. Nearly 120,000 Texans are serving \non Active Duty today, as well as more than 55,000 Guardsmen and \nReservists. We have 15 major military installations in Texas, which \nhave more than 168,000 Active and Reserve component servicemembers \nassigned to them. These world-class bases, posts, air stations, and \ndepots are critical facilities where our troops train for combat and \nlearn the skills they need in order to accomplish their mission and \nwhere we maintain essential military equipment. So when I consider the \npossibility that for a cynical political reason some might decide to \nblock this appropriations bill that actually literally pays the salary \nof the troops, I am very disappointed. I hope they will reconsider.\n  These resources we will vote on--starting this afternoon, we will \nstart that process--go to places such as Fort Bliss and Fort Hood, TX, \nhomes to the finest heavy ground combat units in the world.\n  Fort Bliss in El Paso sits on more than 1 million acres. It is an \nirreplaceable training range for our troops, and it is the Army's \nsecond largest installation by size. It is the proud home of the Army's \nfamed 1st Armored Division. And Fort Hood, which serves as home to both \nIII Corps and the storied 1st Cavalry Division, has more Army brigades \nthan any Army installation in the country.\n  When I think about Members of the Senate actually considering the \npossibility of blocking pay for our troops and support for our \nmilitary, I also think about bases such as Dyess Air Force Base in \nAbilene, TX. This key base is home to units that have deployed time and \ntime again in recent years in support of combat missions in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and elsewhere, including the 317th Airlift Group. Dyess is \nalso home to the 7th Bomb Wing, one of only two B-1 strategic bomber \nwings in the U.S. Air Force. The 7th has been the tip of the spear in \nthe fight against ISIL, conducting airstrikes against the terrorist \narmy in Iraq and in Syria.\n  We are also proud in my State to boast the Corpus Christi Army Depot, \nthe largest rotary wing repair facility in the world. When our Army \nhelicopters come back from battle, many of them are pretty beat up and \nbarely operable. They typically make a pit stop in Corpus Christi to \nmake sure our battle-tested warfighting equipment is ready for the next \nchallenge.\n  Between our naval air stations at Corpus Christi and Kingsville, \nTexas provides the proving ground and crucible for more than 1,000 new \nNavy and Marine aviators each year. Shortly after they leave Texas, \nthey find themselves in skies over Iraq or Syria or landing in rough \nseas, in near-zero visibility, on aircraft carriers bordering hostile \nshores around the globe. But these bases represent only a fraction of \nthe U.S. military presence in Texas. All of our military installations \nare integral to making sure our military is prepared, trained, healthy, \nand ready for action.\n\n  The Defense appropriations bill that some have threatened to \nfilibuster in order to extract a negotiation about more government \nspending makes sure that the servicemembers assigned to those bases and \ncountless others across our Nation have what they need.\n  We ask a lot of our men and women in uniform. The very least we can \ndo is pass legislation that provides for the training and equipment \nthey need in order to accomplish their mission and to ensure them the \nquality of life they and their families have so richly earned.\n  I find it very troubling and, indeed, dumbfounding that some of our \ncolleagues from across the aisle who have already voted overwhelmingly \nto move forward on the Defense authorization bill would today talk \nabout blocking the necessary appropriations bill to actually carry out \nthat policy that we will pass shortly in the Defense authorization \nbill.\n  I believe that to be consistent after such a big vote, as I \nanticipate we will have on the Defense authorization bill, any notion \nof blocking the appropriations bill that would actually pay for those \npolicies to be carried out should simply evaporate.\n  So I hope our colleagues across the aisle--many of whom have said \nthey actually support the policies behind this legislation--will defy \ntheir party's leadership and their misguided advice about blocking this \nlegislation in order to extract a negotiation on more government \nspending and will decide instead to move this legislation forward. The \nbrave men and women in Texas and throughout the country who are \nfighting on our behalf deserve nothing less. And I hope our colleagues \nwho are even considering for a moment the idea of blocking the funding \nthat would actually help pay our troops will reconsider and cast their \nvote in support of the troops and not cast their vote in favor of some \ncynical political strategy which will undermine our support for our \ntroops.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    3rd Anniversary of DACA Program\n\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Madam President, 3 years ago, President Obama announced \nthat DREAMers--young people who were brought to the United States as \nchildren--would have the opportunity to apply for temporary protection \nfrom deportation through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \nProgram or what has become known as DACA.\n  Today, more than 660,000 young people across this Nation have \nbenefitted from DACA, including more than 7,000 in my home State of New \nMexico. These are some of our brightest students and veterans who no \nlonger have to fear deportation. Not only do DREAMers want to earn an \neducation and work, they want to give back to their communities and \ntheir country. In fact, I would suggest that DREAMers don't know how to \nbe anything but American.\n  We hear again and again of the remarkable stories of immigrants \novercoming very difficult challenges in the genuine pursuit of a better \nlife. Across the country, there are DREAMers working to become doctors, \nscientists, lawyers, and engineers. They want to start businesses or \nteach in classrooms. They want to contribute to America's success.\n  I had the privilege of meeting these twin sisters who are pictured \nhere, Jazmin and Yazmin, earlier this year. They immigrated to the \nUnited States with their mother from Mexico when they were just 3 years \nold.\n  As students at Del Norte High School in Albuquerque, Jazmin and \nYazmin worked hard to earn good grades, and as juniors and seniors, \nthey took dual credit courses at Central New Mexico Community College.\n  Jazmin will graduate magna cum laude from the University of New \nMexico with a bachelor of business administration, concentrating in \nfinance. She earned an interdisciplinary studies distinction from the \nUniversity of New Mexico Honors College, and her sister Yazmin would go \non to graduate magna cum laude from the University of New Mexico with a \nbachelor of science in biology and Spanish, a minor in chemistry, and \ncompleted the University Honors Program. She received departmental \nsumma cum laude honors.\n  These two young women are working tirelessly to ensure they have a \nbetter future for themselves and their mother.\n  In August, Jazmin will begin her second year at the University of New \nMexico School of Law, and Yazmin will begin her first year at the \nUniversity of New Mexico School of Medicine.\n  Given their immigration status, the journey for Jazmin and Yazmin to \nget to where they are today was anything but easy. They have overcome \nmany hardships, including homelessness and hunger.\n  After their mother--who is a single mom--suffered a stroke, it was up \nto them to find work to support their family, cover her medical costs, \nand pay for their education. To this day, there is another heavy burden \nthese young women carry with them; it is\n\n[[Page S4272]]\n\nliving with the fear that at any moment their mother, whom they love \ndearly, will be deported because of her immigration status. Under these \ncircumstances, you have to ask what drives these two bright young women \nand what keeps them going, and it is simple: They want to give back to \ntheir communities.\n  Jazmin, who is currently a summer law clerk at New Mexico's Center on \nLaw and Poverty, wants to be a lawyer to ensure that every person has \nequal access to the law.\n  Yazmin, who is currently a medical assistant at the Casa de Salud \nMedical Office in the South Valley, wants to be a primary care \nphysician so she can help families gain access to quality health care.\n  This is who DREAMers are, and I think their stories are absolutely \ninspiring.\n  This young man's name is Cesar. He is 26 years old and a DACA \nrecipient.\n  Cesar and his family moved from Ciudad Juarez to Las Cruces, NM, when \nhe was in the fifth grade.\n  As a middle and high school student, he earned great grades, and \nthrough local scholarships he enrolled at New Mexico State University. \nHe earned a bachelor degree in biology, microbiology, and Spanish, not \nto mention minors in chemistry and biochemistry.\n  When he graduated from college in 2011, Cesar couldn't put his \ndegrees to work because of his immigration status. So instead of \nworking in the laboratory, he went to work as a landscaper.\n  When the President made his DACA announcement, Cesar immediately \napplied and was approved for deferred action. Because of DACA, Cesar \nwas able to work and earn an income to help pay for graduate school.\n  This year, Cesar earned his master's degree in biology and a minor in \nmolecular biology from New Mexico State University, where he focused \nhis research on bioinformatics.\n  Cesar makes it a point to get involved in the local community. He has \nvolunteered at La Casa and helped with the biology graduate \norganization. He said:\n\n       Once you start volunteering, you wish you had more time \n     because you love it so much. It can improve your outlook on \n     everything you're doing.\n\n  Cesar's dream is to become a doctor so he can work to help prevent \ndisease. Soon he will take a major step toward that goal. This coming \nschool year, Cesar will be a medical and Ph.D. student at Loyola \nUniversity in Chicago. ``DACA has changed my life,'' he said. ``Within \ntwo to three years, I went from working in landscaping to becoming a \nmedical student.''\n  The stories of Cesar, Jazmin, and Yazmin represent what makes this \ncountry great. They are inspiring, and there are hundreds of thousands \nof DREAMers like them across this country.\n  Immigrants make the United States a more prosperous nation. In New \nMexico, our State's remarkable history is rooted in our diversity, our \nhistory, and our culture, which has always been enriched by our \nimmigrant communities and their family members.\n  My own father is an immigrant who came to America from Nazi Germany \nin the 1930s, and I am sure many of us in this Chamber have immigrant \nroots in our own families which have contributed to America's success \nstory. We are not a country that kicks out our best and brightest \nstudents, and we are not a nation that tears families apart.\n  The current DACA Program is only a temporary solution. DACA \nrecipients have to renew every 2 years in order to maintain their \ndeferred status, but that is no way to live. It is unfair for these \nDREAMers to live their lives 2 years at a time. We desperately need \nrobust immigration reform.\n  Now, let's step back for a moment and remember that the Senate passed \na comprehensive, bipartisan immigration bill almost 2 years ago now. \nThat bill would have modernized our immigration system to meet the \nneeds of our economy, provided an accountable pathway to earned \ncitizenship for the undocumented workers currently living in the \nshadows, including making the DREAM Act the law of the land, and it \nwould have dramatically strengthened security at our borders. \nAccountable immigration reform received 68 votes in this body and \ndemonstrated the kind of legislation we can pass when we work together.\n  As a nation, we value the twin promises of freedom and opportunity. \nThose ideals are important no matter where you were born. However, too \nmany of my Republican colleagues don't see it that way. Several of them \nwant to rescind or even defund DACA and roll back the progress we have \nmade over the past 3 years.\n  Why would we end such a successful program? What I would say to those \nwho do this is come back to the table and work with us to pass \nimmigration reform. We need pragmatic solutions to fix our broken \nimmigration laws, and we need them now. Let's make the dream a reality \nafter all.\n\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmandatory quorum call under rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the \nSenate be waived with respect to the cloture vote on the motion to \nproceed to H.R. 2685.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Tragedy in Charleston\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I come to the floor to speak about \nthe terrible news out of Charleston, which is a true tragedy. That an \nevent such as this could occur at a house of worship makes it even \nworse.\n  It is always awful when one of these events takes place, but to have \nit happen at a house of worship makes it even worse. Churches should be \na place of refuge, a place where people feel safe and secure, a place \nof mercy, a place of compassion. The depth of loss these families must \nbe feeling is simply awful.\n  I want the American people to know the Senate is thinking of the \nfamilies today and the victims they loved. We are also thinking of the \nentire congregation at this historic church. We will continue to do so \nas more about this tragedy is learned in the hours and days to come.\n  Our hearts go out to the families who have been affected by this \nawful tragedy.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, after almost 3 weeks, we are completing \nconsideration of the fiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization \nAct. Again, I want to thank Senator McCain for what has largely been a \nbipartisan, serious consideration of issues important to the Department \nof Defense and to the national security of the United States. He has \nled the way, initially with a series of very thoughtful hearings with \nforeign policy experts setting the context for our debate.\n  Then we listened to our uniformed military leaders and our Defense \nDepartment officials. In the process of drafting the legislation, \nbefore it went to the subcommittees, there was a collaboration that was \ninspired by his commitment--which he has always demonstrated--to do \nwhat he thought was in the best interest of the men and women who wear \nthe uniform of the United States. His presence and his leadership, has, \nI think, brought us to this point where we are getting ready to \nconsider a major piece of legislation on behalf of the men and women of \nthe Armed Forces of the United States and of the country.\n  We have considered many issues. We were briefly sidetracked by the \ncyber amendment. We all understand that the cyber bill is absolutely \ncritical. In fact, I think it has to be addressed as soon as possible. \nThat is probably the next piece of business we should take up in this \nSenate. But it was brought up in a procedure--in an unexpected way, in \na way in which we could not give it the full consideration it deserves. \nSo, once again, I think we should commit ourselves as a Senate to\n\n[[Page S4273]]\n\nbringing up this bill as rapidly as possible--in fact, I would suggest \nit as the next major piece of legislation.\n  In the process of considering this National Defense Authorization \nAct, we brought a bill to the floor which had some very thoughtful and \nimportant provisions. Six hundred amendments were filed. We were able \nto consider many of them, both Republican and Democratic, either \nthrough votes on the floor in a very open process or through managers' \npackages which we put together and approved. We debated on very \nimportant issues--interrogation techniques, sexual assault in our \nmilitary, and U.S. policies in Iraq and elsewhere. I think these \ndebates and votes ensured that this authorization bill is better than \nit was when it left the committee.\n  There is, however, one overarching problem that remains with this \nbill, and it is one that I have persistently pointed to and \npersistently argued has to be corrected, and it is the fact that the \nbill is funded through the OCO accounts in a significant way, using an \nescape valve from the Budget Control Act, which OCO provides \nexclusively for defense, with some minor deviations for other some \nnational security programs and other agencies, but essentially this is \nthe defense funding mechanism. As a result, what we are confronted with \nis a bill that is over-reliant upon the overseas contingency account. \nIronically, it provides the same level of resources that the President \nasked for, but instead of putting it in the base budget, it grows OCO \nfrom roughly $50 billion to $90 billion, and that is all deficit \nspending. So this is not a way in which we are improving our fiscal \nsituation; we are just adding $40 billion of deficit spending.\n  The other aspect of this that is so critical is that if we adhere to \nthe Budget Control Act, we will not adequately fund other agencies, and \nmany of these other agencies are as vital to our national security as \nthe Department of Defense--the FBI, Homeland Security, and the State \nDepartment.\n  We have had speakers on floor talk about--rightfully so--this huge \nrefugee crisis we are seeing all through the Middle East because of the \ninstability in Iraq and Syria. Those refugees--when we try to help \nthem, that help is typically sent through the State Department, through \nUSAID, through those agencies, and they are still within the sequester \ncaps.\n  As a result, I was very pleased to offer both in the committee and on \nthe floor an amendment that would essentially say: Let's stop for a \nsecond. We have this $39 billion of additional OCO spending that we are \ngiving to the Department of Defense because it is not subject to BCA. \nBefore we do that, let's put a fence around it, to put it in colloquial \nterminology, let's just say that money is there because we recognize \nthat the needs of the Department of Defense are critical and they have \nto be fulfilled, but it is going to stay there until we fix the \nunderlying issue, in my view, and that is the BCA, the sequestration \nissues that affect the State Department and every other Department in \nthe government.\n  We had a very good debate. I am thankful to the chairman for \nencouraging that debate, allowing it to take place, and for it coming \nto a vote. We lost, 54 to 46. It had strong support on our side of the \naisle, but it was a fair and full debate and we lost. The result, \nthough, is that the problem remains. We are in a situation where, if we \ncontinue down this pathway, we will see the OCO account as an escape \nvalve for defense while everyone else is subject to sequestration. I \ndon't think that is good. I don't think it is good for defense. I \ncertainly don't think it is good for these other agencies, and it is \nnot good for our overall national security.\n  There are many who say: Don't worry about that. This is just an \nauthorization bill. The appropriations bill is where we will have the \nappropriate discussion and debate.\n  I think that is going to happen, but my view is that authorizations \nand appropriations are so closely related that we couldn't ignore one \nand we couldn't ignore this authorization.\n  So, again, I think we have to recognize that underpinning this \nauthorization, with all of its worthy programs, is this very difficult \nissue of overreliance on OCO funding.\n  Then there are some who say: Well, even so, it is a 1-year fix.\n  Well, I don't think that is the case at all. I think if we use these \ntypes of gimmicks--as some have called them--and accounting tricks \nonce, our tendency to use them again will be there. In fact, once we \nuse it once, it is easier to use it two, three, four, five times.\n  We have had this discussion on the floor, for example, interestingly \nenough, about how medical research in the Department of Defense went \nfrom $25 million or so in 1992 to $13 billion today. Well, the answer \nis easy. Back then, because we had similar--not identical--arrangements \nwhere we capped discretionary domestic spending but uncapped defense \nspending, people went to where--the chairman referred to the Willie \nSutton approach--the money was. It was defense. And it has grown and it \nhas grown. I think that is what is going to happen again if we take \nthis trajectory, this pathway, using OCO.\n  I sense that if we make tough decisions today, it will benefit us in \nthe long run. One of those tough decisions--and one I make very \nreluctantly--is to oppose this legislation. It is worthy legislation in \nmany respects. I think we have to fix this problem, and I think we have \nto fix it now. I have tried in my efforts to focus the attention on the \nneed to correct the BCA, the need to get us on a sustainable pathway \nwhere we do include within the base of the Department of Defense those \nfunds they need to operate and then OCO really is for overseas \ncontingency operations.\n  Let me conclude my comments by saying there has been tremendous \ncooperation and support. It starts with the chairman. I particularly \nwant to thank his staff director, Chris Brose, for his great work.\n  I thank my colleagues on the Democratic side: Liz King, Gary Leeling, \nCreighton Greene, Kirk McConnell, Bill Monahan, Mike Kuiken, John \nQuirk, Jon Clark, Jonathan Epstein, Arun Seraphin, Carolyn Chuhta, Mike \nNoblet, Ozge Guzelsu, Maggie McNamara, Jody Bennett, and, once again, \nmy staff director, Liz King.\n  I would like to thank the floor staff. I have come to appreciate more \nthan I ever knew how vital a role they play on both sides of the aisle, \nand I thank them for what they have done.\n  Finally, this bill has some extraordinarily good provisions in it. \nMany of them are tough, hard, path-breaking provisions that are there \nbecause the chairman decided he was going to go all in on many \ndifferent aspects, from acquisition, to troop support efforts, to \nincorporating provisions of the commission on pay and retirement, all \nof those things, and I commend him for that. It is just that I think I \nhave to stand and say we have to fix this issue with respect to the \nunderpinning fundamental budget approach which says: We will let BCA \nstand for every other agency, but we will be able to exploit, in a way, \nthis OCO exception, and we will use it. And I think that is not the \npath we want to pursue.\n  With that, and again with my thanks to the chairman, I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as we approach a final vote on the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, I take this opportunity to thank my \nfriend and colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed. Despite his lack \nof substantive education somewhere on the Hudson River, he has been \nthoughtful, bipartisan, and he has maintained that throughout the \nconsideration of this legislation.\n  We worked together through hundreds of amendments in markup and \nhundreds more during the past 2 weeks, and obviously we have some \ndifferences from time to time. Senator Reed has never stopped searching \nfor common ground and consensus, and so this legislation would not be \nwhat it is without his leadership and his cooperation.\n  I would just remind my friend, however, that the title of this \nlegislation is ``to authorize appropriations''--not to appropriate but \nto authorize appropriations. That is the task of the Appropriations \nCommittee. So the OCO issue, which he and I are largely in agreement \non, should have been repeal of sequestration. That is an issue which \nshould be addressed where the authority lies--in appropriations, not in \nauthorization. We can't increase or decrease a single penny of \nauthorization except what was given to us through the Budget Committee \nprocess, which\n\n[[Page S4274]]\n\nwas votes and decisions made on this floor on the budget.\n  So I say with respect and friendship, if there is a problem here, it \nis not with the authorization. We don't spend a penny. We authorize the \nexpenditure of money. And that is an issue that my friend from Rhode \nIsland and I disagree on, but it did not prohibit him, me, our staffs, \nand members of the committee on both sides of the aisle from working on \na piece of legislation that, in my view, which is clearly subjective, \nis a reform bill--a reform bill, working together, that is almost \nunprecedented, at least in the last 30 years when you look at the \nextent and the nature of the reforms in this legislation.\n  I thank the majority leader, Senator McConnell, for his commitment to \nresuming regular order. Under Senator McConnell's leadership, the \nSenate has been able to take up this critical national security \nlegislation on time, allowing for thoughtful consideration of \namendments. This is how the Senate should operate--regular order, on \ntime, giving our military the certainty they need to plan and execute \ntheir missions.\n  For 53 consecutive years, Congress has passed a National Defense \nAuthorization Act. That is testimony to the vital importance of this \nlegislation, which provides the necessary funding and authorities for \nour military to defend the Nation.\n  But perhaps at no time in the last half century has this legislation \never been so critical. Over the past few months, the Senate Armed \nServices Committee has received testimony from many of America's most \nrespected statesmen, thinkers, and former military commanders. These \nleaders had a common warning, and that warning is clear: America is \nfacing the most diverse and complex array of crises since the Second \nWorld War.\n  I won't go into all the different events that have taken place that \nauthenticate that assertion by the most respected leaders who served \nunder both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n  We have faced challenges before. We marshalled our power--both soft \nand hard power--to defend the rules-based national order that is the \nfoundation of our prosperity and security. We have deterred aggression, \ndefended allies, defeated adversaries, and built peace through \nstrength. As we look at our challenges today, the question being asked \nall over the world by both friend and foe alike and the question we \nmust answer now is, Are we equal to those challenges again?\n  There is only so much one piece of legislation can do to answer that \nquestion, but the National Defense Authorization Act before the Senate \ntoday is a strong first step toward rising to the challenge of an \nincreasingly dangerous world. This is an ambitious piece of \nlegislation, but in the times we live, we cannot afford business as \nusual in the Department of Defense. To prepare our military to confront \nour present and future national security challenges, we must champion \nthe cause of defense reform, rigorously root out Pentagon waste, and \ninvest in modernization and next-generation technologies to maintain \nour military technological advantage. That is what this legislation is \nall about. It is a reform bill. It tackles acquisition reform, \nheadquarters and management reform, military retirement reform, and \npersonnel reform.\n  The bill authorizes every dollar of the President's budget request of \n$612 billion but focuses these resources more directly on our \nwarfighters. The Committee on Armed Services identified $10 billion of \nexcess and unnecessary spending in the budget request, and we \nreinvested those savings in the military capabilities our troops need \nto succeed. We did all of this while upholding our commitments to our \nservicemembers, retirees, and their families.\n\n  My friends, America's military technological advantage is eroding--\nand eroding fast. One of the primary causes of this is a broken Defense \nAcquisition System that takes too long, costs too much, and wastes \nbillions of dollars--often on weapons programs that never become \noperational and with no one ever being held responsible. That is why \nthis legislation includes the most sweeping acquisition reforms in a \ngeneration. We put the services back into the acquisition process, \ncreate new mechanisms to ensure accountability for results, streamline \nregulation, and open the defense acquisition process to our Nation's \ninnovators.\n  This bill advances unprecedented reforms to our military retirement \nsystem. Under the current 70-year-old system, 83 percent of \nservicemembers leave the service without any retirement assets. This \nsystem excludes the vast majority of current servicemembers who will \nnot complete 20 years of uniformed service, including many veterans of \nthe wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The NDAA creates a modernized \nretirement system and extends retirement benefits to the vast majority \nof servicemembers through a new plan, offering more value and choice. \nUnder this new plan, 75 percent of servicemembers would get retirement \nbenefits. This reform is estimated to save $15 billion a year in the \nout years.\n  In addition to retirement reform, the NDAA focuses on improving the \nquality of life of our military servicemembers, retirees, and their \nfamilies. It authorizes a 1.3-percent pay raise for members of the \nuniformed services at the grade of O-6 and below. The bill authorizes \n$30 million in support for schools serving military dependent children, \nincluding those with severe disabilities. It includes many provisions \nto improve the military health system and TRICARE. The NDAA allows a \nTRICARE beneficiary up to four urgent care visits without making them \nget a preauthorization and requires the Department of Defense to focus \nmore on health care quality, patient safety, and beneficiary \nsatisfaction by making them publish health outcome measures on their \nWeb sites.\n  The NDAA builds on military justice reforms of the past few years to \nprevent and respond to military sexual assault. It contains a number of \nprovisions aimed at strengthening the authorities of Special Victims' \nCounsel to provide services to victims of sexual assault. The \nlegislation also enhances confidential reporting options for victims of \nsexual assault and increases access to timely disclosure of certain \nmaterials and information in connection with the prosecution of \noffenses.\n  On management reform, the NDAA ensures the Department of Defense and \nthe military services are using precious defense dollars to fulfill \ntheir missions and defend the Nation, not expand their bloated staffs. \nWhile staff at Army Headquarters increased 60 percent over the past \ndecade, the Army is now cutting brigade combat teams. The Air Force \nevaded mandated cuts to Headquarters personnel by creating two new \nHeadquarters entities, while at the same time complaining it had \ninsufficient personnel to maintain combat aircraft. The NDAA directs \ntargeted reductions in Headquarters and administrative staff that would \ngenerate $1.7 billion in savings in just the next fiscal year.\n  With these savings and billions more identified, this bill invests in \nproviding critical military capabilities for our warfighters and \nmeeting the unfunded priorities of our service chiefs and combatant \ncommanders.\n  Even as challenges to maritime security increase in the Middle East \nand the Western Pacific and pressures on our shipbuilding budget \nincrease, the Navy remains well below its fleet size requirement of 306 \nships. The NDAA directs savings identified in the budget request to \naccelerate Navy modernization and shipbuilding, to mitigate impacts of \nthe Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine replacement, and to grow the \nNavy to meet rising threats.\n  As adversaries seek to counter and thwart American military power, \nthe NDAA looks to the future and invests in the technologies that will \nmaintain America's military technological superiority. It provides $400 \nmillion in additional funding to support the so-called third offset \nstrategy to outpace our emerging adversaries.\n  The NDAA details robust assistance to our allies and partners as they \nconfront urgent challenges. The legislation authorizes nearly $3.8 \nbillion in support of the Afghan National Security Forces.\n  After an overwhelming bipartisan vote on an amendment offered by \nSenator Feinstein and myself, the NDAA reaffirms the prohibition on \ntorture and ensures that every U.S. Government agency always applies \nthe same effective, humane interrogation standards as the U.S. \nmilitary. Past interrogation policies compromised our values, stained \nour national honor, and\n\n[[Page S4275]]\n\ndid little practical good. This legislation provides greater assurances \nthat never again will the United States follow that dark path of \nsacrificing our values for our short-term security needs. I thank \nSenator Feinstein for her hard work on this vitally important issue.\n  Finally, this legislation contains a bipartisan compromise on how to \naddress the challenge of the detention facility of Guantanamo Bay. \nPresident Obama has said from day one of his Presidency that he wants \nto close Guantanamo. But 6\\1/2\\ years into his Presidency, the \nadministration has never provided a plan to do so. This legislation \nrequires the administration to submit that plan. We are simply asking \nthe executive branch to explain where it will hold those set for trial, \nhow it will continue to detain dangerous terrorists pursuant to the \nlaws of war, and how it will mitigate the risks of moving this \npopulation.\n  If the administration can provide answers to these basic questions to \nthe satisfaction of the American people and their elected \nrepresentatives, then congressional restrictions on the movement of \nthese detainees will be lifted and the plan can be implemented. If the \nCongress does not approve the plan, nothing would change. The ban on \ndomestic transfers would stay in force, and the certification standards \nfor foreign transfers included in the NDAA would remain.\n  My friends, America has reached a key inflection point. The rules-\nbased international order, which has been anchored by U.S. hard power \nfor seven decades, is being seriously stressed, and with it the \nfoundation of our security and prosperity. It does not have to be this \nway. We can choose a better future for ourselves, make the right \ndecisions now, and set our Nation on a better course.\n  That is what this legislation is all about--living up to our \nconstitutional duty to provide for the common defense, increasing the \neffectiveness of our military, and restoring America's global \nleadership. This legislation is a small step towards accomplishing \nthese goals, but it is an important step we can take right now, \ntogether. We owe the brave men and women in uniform nothing less.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, all postcloture time is expired.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand the Democratic leader \nwould like to make some remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. To respond to the majority leader, I have nothing to say \nuntil I hear what he has to say.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, America asks a lot of the men and women \nof its voluntary military force: to undertake dangerous missions in \nfar-off lands, to spend months and years away from their families, and \nalways to sacrifice so that we might live in freedom.\n  These brave men and women do it all without reservation. They ask \nprecious little in return, save for the resources they need to do the \njob and the support they need to look after their families. It is the \nleast we can do, to provide for them. We just voted 71 to 25 for a bill \nthat promises a lot of things for our men and women.\n  It would be very cruel indeed for any Senator who just made that \npromise to turn around now and block the rest of us from fulfilling the \npledge to our troops. Passing the legislation before us is a way to \nfulfill the promise we just made, 71 to 25. That is why nearly every \nDemocrat voted to pass it in committee, 27 to 3. That is why Democrats \nhave hailed this bill as a win-win-win and a victory for each of their \nStates.\n  They know it gives President Obama the same level of funding he asked \nfor. They know it adheres to a bipartisan spending level that both \nparties agreed to, that President Obama signed into law, and that \nPresident Obama campaigned on in the last Presidential election.\n  Now our friends face a choice.\n  Option 1: Allow the promise just made to our troops to be fulfilled \nby voting for a bill they can't stop praising.\n  Option 2: Break the promise they just made by killing a bill they \nclaim to love, all in the service of some unrelated and completely \nincomprehensible partisan plan.\n  It is the road of bipartisanship and support for our troops that \nbrought us this far. We shouldn't let partisan politics trip us up now. \nWe don't have to--not if commonsense Democrats continue to prioritize \npay raises and medical care for our troops over some unrelated gambit \nto funnel more cash to bureaucracies such as the IRS and the EPA.\n  I will just leave my colleagues with something one of our Democratic \nfriends said of men and women in the military. Here is what he had to \nsay: ``Just as we called on them to protect us, they are calling on us \nto provide them with the resources they need. . . .''\n  They are. Senators just promised they would, 71 to 25. They just made \nthe promise. So now they shouldn't block us from fulfilling that \npromise by preventing us from getting on the Defense appropriations \nmeasure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the bill that just passed the Senate, the \nDefense authorization bill, has 52 Republicans voting to fix \nsequestration. Only 2 voted against it. We are all in favor of fixing \nthe sequester.\n  My friend, the Republican leader, is talking in a dreamland.\n  Ash Carter, the Secretary of Defense, is a very good man. We are so \nfortunate\n\n[[Page S4276]]\n\nthat he has dedicated his life to public service. He is a scientist and \nhas worked for the defense establishment for a while in public service. \nHe, the Secretary of Defense, says this bill my friend talks about is a \nbad bill. It doesn't help the military. This funny funding that is in \nthis bill is not good. The chairman of the Armed Services Committee was \non the floor this morning talking about that.\n  It is important that we solve the sequester problem. It is not good, \nbut we cannot, and we should not, fix one part of our government and \nnot the other part.\n  We support the Pentagon. We support the troops. Of course we do. But \nas the Secretary of Defense has so implored us, don't do this to the \nmilitary. To have a secure nation involves more than the people in the \narmed services. The people in the armed services, while their families \nare at home, want them to be protected as they travel to an airport. \nThe TSA needs to be funded, the FBI needs to be funded, the Drug \nEnforcement Administration needs to be funded, Homeland Security needs \nto be funded, and in the process, we need to fund education properly. \nWe need to fund research for health. We need to make sure the National \nInstitutes of Health are not whacked again with sequestration the way \nthey were the first time. They lost $1.6 billion. They have never \nrecovered from that. They have never gotten their money back. Do we \nwant to give them another sequestration? Of course we don't.\n  We have until this fiscal year ends in the fall to work this out, and \nthat is what we should do. We are legislators. I agree with the 52 \nRepublicans who said we should fix sequestration, but this bill only \nfixes sequestration for the Department of Defense.\n  Let's sit down and do what we, as legislators, are supposed to do. \nLegislation is the art of compromise. We are not going to get \neverything we want, but the Republicans shouldn't get everything they \nwant, and we should not fund this government by using funny money for \ndefense and using the really unfunny money on the rest of the \ngovernment. It is unfair, and above all the Republican Party, which \nused to stand for fiscal responsibility, should get fiscally \nresponsible and help us work this out.\n  We are ready and willing at any time to sit down and work through \nthis, and we need to start that now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as the Democratic leader reminded me, \non a virtually daily basis for 8 years, the majority leader always gets \nthe last word.\n  Here is the issue, I say to my friends on the other side: You just \nvoted for the troops. And now you are going to vote against them? Are \nyou going to vote against the troops right after you voted for the \ntroops? That is the fundamental question before us in deciding whether \nto go to the Defense appropriations measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know my friend gets the last word, and I \nam looking forward to his last word. However, the logic of my friend is \nillogical. We stand on our record, and we will continue in that \nfashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to H.R. 2685, an act making appropriations for the \n     Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September \n     30, 2016, and for other purposes.\n         Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, James Lankford, Roger F. \n           Wicker, John Barrasso, Thom Tillis, Steve Daines, Tom \n           Cotton, Kelly Ayotte, Lindsey Graham, John McCain, John \n           Thune, Jerry Moran, Richard C.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a constituent \nof mine. Ilse is a 23-year-old graduate of the University of Washington \nwho works at the Seattle Children's Hospital and is studying to become \na nurse. She has faced a lot of challenges in her 23 years, not the \nleast of which was being diagnosed with cancer when she was a teenager, \ngoing through treatment, and working to put herself through college.\n  And if the outstanding costs of cancer treatment weren't difficult \nenough for her, Ilse was brought to the United States by her mother \nwhen she was 6 months old as an undocumented immigrant, which makes \nnavigating our health care system even harder.\n\n[[Page S4277]]\n\n  Ilse persevered through her cancer treatment. She worked her way \nthrough high school with an impressive list of extracurriculars and \nwent on to earn a scholarship that eventually got her to the front \nsteps of her dream school, the University of Washington.\n  When I met Ilse in 2013, she told me that after 15 years of waiting \nfor her petition to obtain a visa, she lost the opportunity to obtain \nlegal residency when she turned 21 years old. But thanks to the \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, she had a \nsecond chance. She said she doesn't know where she would be now without \nthat second chance. She told me that DACA opened doors that were \npreviously closed to her. And thanks to the increased certainty DACA \nbrought and the amazing work ethic she has, Ilse was able to find jobs \nthat helped pave her way through school.\n  Today she is able to continue to pursue her dream of helping others \nas a nurse and building a life in Washington State, her home.\n  I am pleased to report that Ilse has now been cancer free for over 14 \nyears. So while I rise to talk about Ilse, I also wish to celebrate \nDACA.\n  Three years ago this week, Americans celebrated a historic step \nforward in protecting young, undocumented immigrants known as DREAMers, \npeople such as Ilse. When DACA was enacted, the national dialogue on \nimmigration policy forever changed. The administration announced that \nAmerica is not a place that will deport someone who plays by the rules \nbut through no fault of their own is an undocumented immigrant, someone \nwho has known no other home than the United States, someone who is an \nAmerican in all but name. This was a major step toward changing the \nlives of so many immigrant families.\n  During the past 3 years, more than 600,000 young immigrants have \nbenefited from deferred action. In my home State of Washington, almost \n15,000 DREAMers have been able to receive the stability and peace of \nmind that DACA brought.\n  Too often in this debate, it is difficult for some people to \nunderstand that millions of undocumented families in our country are \nalready an important part of our community. Immigrants--documented or \nnot--work hard. They send their children to schools throughout this \ncountry. They pay their taxes, and they help weave the fabric of our \nsociety. In all but name, they are Americans, and America would not be \nthe same without them.\n  Despite the steps this administration has taken, only legislation \nfrom Congress can solve the underlying problem of a very broken \nimmigration system.\n  So I am here today to say I stand ready to work with my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to achieve that. Until Congress truly passes \ncomprehensive immigration reform, I am going to continue working each \nday to help the families and businesses--people such as Ilse--that are \ntrapped by a broken system.\n  We must never forget the past and the fact that our Nation has long \noffered generations of immigrants a chance to achieve their dreams. \nIlse is no different.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/senate-section/article/S4277-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. SULLIVAN.

Mr. President, as I mentioned, we passed the NDAA this \nafternoon after almost 3 weeks of debate, and I do wish to extend \ncongratulations to the leadership, particularly to the chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, Senator McCain, and the ranking \nmember, Senator Reed, who did such an outstanding job of working in a \nbipartisan fashion on this bill.\n  In many ways, this bill is about something that is so critical to \nAmerican foreign policy and national security interests. What is that? \nIt is credibility, the credibility of the United States. In many ways \nit is the coin of the realm in international security--how our friends, \nhow our allies, and how our adversaries view American credibility, \nparticularly in the realm of national security, international affairs, \nand foreign policy. They pay close attention to what we are doing on \nthis floor, in the White House, and overseas--credibility.\n  Unfortunately, as many are aware, both at home and certainly \noverseas, we are rapidly losing credibility around the world. In fact, \nmuch of the world is puzzled. What is happening to American credibility \nin terms of foreign policy? We used to be the shining city on the hill, \na beacon of strength, a beacon of freedom. Countries that wanted to do \nus harm didn't because they feared us. Our allies respected and trusted \nus. But, unfortunately, that is starting to change. It is changing. Red \nlines have been crossed with no consequences in places such as Syria, \nUkraine, Russia, and in the Iranian negotiations. Many say American \ncredibility has declined. Some say American credibility overseas is in \nshambles. Nations that once counted on us as friends, as allies, are \nhaving a harder time trusting the United States and in some ways are \neven suspicious of our motives and our policies.\n  So it is a critical, critical issue. How do we, as a country, regain \ncredibility in the world. It is something that everybody in this body \nand everybody in the Federal Government should be focused on.\n  The NDAA bill that we just passed, the National Defense Authorization \nAct, is a way to start regaining credibility for our country, and we \ndid that this afternoon. A very strong bipartisan majority in the \nSenate, 71 Senators, voted to pass this very important bill. It is one \nof the most important bills that we are going to vote on all year.\n  This is an important signal. U.S. foreign policy--our national \nsecurity is strongest when we act in a bipartisan manner, as we did on \nthe Senate floor today, and when the executive and legislative branches \nare working together on foreign policy and national security issues. \nThat is what this bill does.\n  In many ways, this bill does pretty much exactly what the President \nhas asked in a whole host of areas regarding the military. For example, \nit funds the Department of Defense at the levels requested by the \nPresident. And again I congratulate Chairman McCain and Ranking Member \nReed for many of the key programs, many of the key reforms, and such a \npowerful bill that got through this body.\n  This bill also strongly endorses one of the President's signature \nforeign policy issues--the rebalance of our military focus to the Asia \nPacific. There are many provisions in the NDAA that support this \nrebalanced strategy. Most Members--Republicans and Democrats--of this \nbody are supportive of the President's rebalance strategy.\n  There is even a directive in the bill from the Congress to the \nDepartment of Defense and our military leaders that states: ``In order \nto properly implement the U.S. rebalance policy, United States forces \nunder operational control of the U.S. Pacific Command should be \nincreased''--increased, not decreased. That is strong language. That is \nsupporting the President's rebalance. The Department of Defense needs \nto heed this language from Congress, and of course we will be keeping a \nclose eye on whether they do.\n\n[[Page S4278]]\n\n  So the NDAA just passed on the floor helps--it can help and it will \nhelp restore America's credibility in the world. But it would be \nanother blow to our credibility--to U.S. credibility globally--if, \nafter all the hard work that has gone into this bill, after the strong \nbipartisan support this bill achieved, the President would then decide \nto veto the NDAA. What would the world think of that? What would the \nworld think of our commitment to our troops with a bill that strongly \npassed in the House and Senate to fund the U.S. military, to set \npolicies that support the President's policies, if the President then \nvetoed the bill? This would further undermine U.S. credibility in the \nworld right at a moment when the Congress is trying to be supportive \nand rebuild this credibility.\n  After today's vote, after passing the NDAA, it is not clear that \nMembers of this body are going to move forward to actually appropriate \nthe money to fund the military. Think about that. The NDAA passes with \nstrong bipartisan support out of the Committee on Armed Services and \nstrong bipartisan support on the Senate floor this afternoon and the \nPresident of the United States vetoes it. That is not going to help \nAmerica's credibility.\n  Now we are moving to Defense appropriations, again with strong \nbipartisan support out of the Committee on Appropriations. Yet we are \nhearing rumors that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nnot going to fund the military, that they are going to filibuster this \nbill.\n  Playing politics with the funding of our defense, the funding of our \nmen and women in uniform, is not going to help enhance America's \ncredibility anywhere. I think Members are going to have a hard time \nexplaining votes that don't look to fund the men and women who so \ncourageously defend us day in and day out here and abroad. It just \ndoesn't make sense. We have to recognize that these actions that are \nbeing taken on the floor and in the White House are not only being \nwatched by Americans, they are being watched by our allies and our \nadversaries overseas.\n  Another way to start to restore America's credibility in the world \nand to support the President and the White House's rebalance strategy \nin the Asia Pacific is to pass trade promotion authority next week. We \nhave all talked about that. We debated that here on the floor for many \nweeks. It will help increase jobs. It will make sure that we, the \nUnited States, are setting the rules of the road for international \ntrade in the Asia Pacific and not China. But it also goes to America's \ncredibility.\n  I had the honor of traveling a couple of weeks ago with Chairman \nMcCain, Ranking Member Reed, and the Senator from Iowa, Mrs. Ernst, to \nVietnam and Singapore. We met with the Prime Minister of Singapore. All \nthe discussion was on American engagement in the Asia Pacific. They \nwant us there. They want us leading. But the consensus was that if we \ncan't move forward on TPA, it would be disastrous for our credibility.\n  So, again, the world is watching. We cannot afford to lose U.S. \ncredibility in another region of the world. I am hopeful that next \nweek, as this bill comes to the floor of the Senate, we will once again \nvote to pass trade promotion authority because that goes to not only \nhelping spur economic growth and greater job growth in our own country, \nbut it goes to America's leadership and credibility in the world.\n  Finally, I want to talk about another area of the world where U.S. \ncredibility is at stake, and that is the Arctic. Fortunately, Congress \nhas begun to recognize this fact. In the bill we just debated and \npassed on the floor today, the NDAA, there is an important provision \nabout the national security of the United States in the Arctic. It is \nnow up to the administration and the Department of Defense to start to \nfocus on this very important area of the United States but also the \nworld.\n  Nobody spoke more eloquently and compellingly about peace through \nstrength and about our country's credibility in the world than former \nPresident Ronald Reagan. President Reagan's philosophy to win the Cold \nWar was simple. As he put it, ``We maintain the peace through our \nstrength; weakness only invites aggression.''\n  The important thing President Reagan did was he matched his rhetoric \nwith credible actions. Under President Reagan, we strengthened our NATO \nallies, strengthened our military, provided strong funding for the men \nand women who defend us, modernized our strategic defense systems, and \ncountered potential Soviet threats throughout the world.\n  As a result of this credible policy that people and countries around \nthe world believed whether they were our allies or adversaries, the \nefforts of the Soviet Union to build an empire based on aggression were \nthwarted and the Soviet Union itself ended up collapsing.\n  Today, the Soviet Union no longer exists, but make no mistake--the \nimperialist dreams of expansion that have dominated much of Russian \nhistory since the days of the czars is still alive. Today's Russia is \nagain a threat to its neighbors and to the peace of the world. Think \nabout Russia's unlawful military aggression in the Ukraine. But that is \nnot all. There are other vital areas of the world in which Russia is \nnow taking new actions that should concern us. One of these areas is \nthe Arctic.\n  We don't hear much about the Arctic from the mainstream media. That \nis largely because it is hard to get reporters and television cameras \nout to the Arctic. But America is an Arctic nation. We are an Arctic \nnation because of my State, the great State of Alaska. And there is \nmuch at stake in the Arctic--new transportation routes, huge \nopportunities for energy. As a recent column in the Wall Street Journal \npointed out, ``No wonder Moscow has been racing to reopen old Soviet \nbases on its territory across the Arctic and develop new ones.''\n  The signs are everywhere that Russia is making a new push into the \nArctic. Let me provide a few examples. Earlier this year, the Russian \nmilitary held 5 days of Arctic war exercises that included close to \n40,000 troops, 50 surface ships, 13 submarines, and 110 aircraft. The \nchairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dempsey, said recently \nthat the Russians are increasing their military forces by six combat \nbrigades, four of which will be stationed in the Arctic. President \nPutin has said he wants to build at least 13 new airfields, and they \nare starting in the Arctic. They are establishing a new Arctic command, \nwith several new icebreakers to add to their robust fleet.\n  In the paper just today, there was another report of the Russians \nplanning yet another large-scale exercise in the Arctic involving two \nArctic brigades.\n  Just last week, in a study called ``America in the Arctic,'' CSIS \ntalked about what the Russians are doing. The article said:\n\n       Recent actions taken by Russia do not instill confidence \n     that the Arctic will be exempt from recent geopolitical \n     tensions. The Kremlin continues to hold unannounced military \n     exercises in the Arctic, which engage significant numbers of \n     forces . . . and simulate the use of nuclear weapons. \n     Moscow's authorization of the use of military force to \n     protect Russian interests in the Arctic . . . the planned \n     reopening of over 50 Soviet-era bases along Russia's Arctic \n     coastline, and Russia's recently Unified Arctic Command, as \n     well as Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin's \n     pronouncement that ``the Arctic is Russia's Mecca,'' have all \n     raised serious questions regarding Russia's intent in the \n     Arctic.\n\n  I want to put this in perspective with a map. This shows the new push \nby the Russians into the Arctic. It shows the new airfields, the new \nbases. If we look at the map here, we see red on these different spots. \nThese red spots are the new or existing Russian bases and airfields in \nthe Arctic. The three blue spots on this map are the U.S. presence--a \nsmall airfield and radar station in Greenland and Alaska. America's \nArctic. Two combat brigades in the great State of Alaska.\n  Our U.S. military commanders are starting to wake up to the fact that \nthe red is clearly expanding on this map, and it is concerning them. \nEven Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said just 2 months ago:\n\n       The Arctic is going to be a major area of importance to the \n     United States, both strategically and economically in the \n     future--it's fair to say that we're late to the recognition \n     of that.\n\n  We are late. So what are we doing? The Russians have Arctic \nexercises, new airfields, a new Arctic command, and four new Arctic \ncombat brigades, according to our own Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff. What are we doing? The Department of Defense has\n\n[[Page S4279]]\n\na 13-page Arctic strategy. That is it--13 pages. That is what the \nUnited States of America has--the greatest military force in the world \nright now--as this is happening. We have this.\n  I want to talk about credibility. This is not credible. This is not \ncredible. Worse--much worse--the Department of Defense is thinking \nabout removing one or maybe two brigade combat teams from America's \nArctic.\n  Let me repeat that. As the Russians are building up everywhere, we \nare looking at possibly removing the BCTs right here--these two blue \ndots--one or two, gone. That is not credible. These are the only U.S. \nsoldiers in the Arctic. They are Arctic-tough soldiers, cold-weather \ntrained. This is the only Arctic airborne brigade in the United States. \nThis is the only airborne brigade in the entire Asia-Pacific, right \nhere, Fort Richardson, Alaska. These soldiers, thousands of them, are \ncapable, well-trained, tough U.S. soldiers, and they are the only ones \ncapable of protecting our country's interests in the Arctic, as that \npart of the world becomes more and more an area that Russia becomes \ninterested in.\n  So we have this, 13 pages. We have announced we are seriously \ncontemplating removing these forces from the Arctic. Let me just say, \nVladimir Putin must surely be smiling somewhere in Moscow as he makes \nthese moves and he hears that the Department of Defense is thinking \nabout removing our only Arctic forces out of the Arctic. This is not \ncredible.\n  We are not only showing a lack of credibility, removing Army troops \nfrom the Arctic, removing them from Alaska, will show the world \nweakness. As President Reagan noted, weakness is provocative. We can be \nassured of that.\n  This strategy defies logic. Importantly, it also defies the direction \nof the U.S. Senate and the NDAA, which we just passed by large \nbipartisan numbers. As I mentioned at the outset, the bill we just \npassed states that the Department of Defense should increase troops in \nthe Asia-Pacific region--increase troops--under the command of the \nPACOM commander, which includes these troops right here.\n  Fortunately, as I said, there are also provisions in the NDAA to \nstart making sure our country wakes up to the security interests we \nhave in the Arctic. The bill we just passed on the floor provides an \nimportant first step toward ensuring that the Arctic remains a \npeaceful, stable, and prosperous place.\n  The NDAA requires our military to lay out a specific strategy--not \njust 13 pages--in the Arctic region that protects our interests there. \nIt requires the Secretary of Defense to update the Congress on the U.S. \nmilitary strategy in the Arctic region, and, importantly, requires a \nmilitary operations plan for the protection of our security interests \nin this important region of the world.\n  The Department of Defense, the U.S. Army, should not even contemplate \nmoving one single soldier out of America's Arctic until all of this has \nbeen completed, and they should look hard at this bill--that we hope \nthe President will not veto--with regard to the direction of the \nCongress on the importance of increasing U.S. military forces in the \nAsia-Pacific to add credibility to our rebalanced strategy. That means \nkeeping appropriate troop levels in appropriate places--like the Asia-\nPacific, like the Arctic, and like Alaska--as required by the bill that \nwe just passed by an overwhelming majority.\n  Alaska is the northern anchor of the Pacific rebalance. It is the \ngateway to the Arctic. It is what makes America an Arctic nation. It is \nour only Arctic State, and it probably is the single greatest \nrepository of untapped energy resources that will power our Nation's \nfuture. That is why, in the words of Gen. Billy Mitchell--the father of \nthe U.S. Air Force--it is the most strategic place in the world.\n  We need a strong rebalanced strategy that is credible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

BURWELL DECISION\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I was so glad to see Senator Stabenow down \non the floor a week ago talking about a pretty simple issue, which is \nthe tax increase that is going to occur to 6.4 million Americans if the \nSupreme Court rules this week, next week, for the plaintiffs in the \ncase of King v. Burwell. We wanted to come down to the floor and \naccentuate this message so people all around this country know what is \nat stake.\n  What is at stake is 6.5 million people losing their health insurance. \nThat maybe gets the headlines. But the way in which people get \naffordable health insurance under the Affordable Care Act is by tax \ncredits. So the immediate effect of a reversal of subsidies for Federal \nexchange States is that 6.5 million Americans are going to have their \ntaxes dramatically increased by thousands of dollars if this body \nrefuses to act in the face of a Supreme Court finding for the \nplaintiffs.\n  So we wanted to come down to the floor just to talk a little bit \nabout what the stakes are for people's tax bills and how this is going \nto be a gut punch for millions of American families if the Supreme \nCourt rules the way we hope they don't.\n  I think it is, first of all, important to say at the outset that most \nof us who have followed the Affordable Care Act and its legal \ninterpretation think this is a sham of a case. This is a political \nattack on the Affordable Care Act masked as a legal case.\n  There is absolutely no question that the Affordable Care Act is built \nin a way to deliver subsidies to both State exchanges and Federal \nexchanges. I will not go into all the details as to why that is the \nclear case. But though we are talking about what might happen if King \nv. Burwell comes down for the plaintiffs, many of us think that would \nbe an absolutely ludicrous legal result, one that would be a stunning \nact of judicial overreach, essentially a political substitution of the \nCourt for the legislature. But I want to talk about a couple case \nstudies and then turn the floor over to my colleagues.\n  I have come down and talked about people from Connecticut. I talked \nabout Christina, a small business owner from Stratford; Susie, a two-\ntime breast cancer survivor from North Canaan, CT; and Sean and Emilie, \ntwo freelancers from Weston. All of these people have gotten tax \ncredits through the Affordable Care Act, and it has allowed them to \nhave a lower tax bill but also get insurance. Many of them, it was the \nfirst time in their lives or in recent history that they have been able \nto afford insurance. But there are stories all over the country that \nare parallel to the stories from Connecticut I have been telling on the \nfloor of the Senate over the course of the last year.\n  For instance, there are 832,000 Texans who are receiving an average \ntax credit of $247 a month. If the Supreme Court strips away these tax \ncredits, those 800,000 people in Texas are going to see a tax increase \nof around $3,000. People like Aurora, a 26-year-old from Houston, got \nhealth insurance coverage through Texas's Federal marketplace. She \nworks at a small nonprofit where she helps her LGBT peers get the \ncoverage they need. She is saving $1,500 a year getting insurance she \nwould have never been able to afford. She says, quite simply:\n\n       I wouldn't be able to afford my policy otherwise. It has \n     really helped me be able to get my well person exam and other \n     preventions screenings that I'd not had in years.\n\n  She is one of 832,000 people in Texas who are going to have their \ntaxes increased, their insurance stolen away.\n  I am a big New York Giants fan, so I get to watch a lot of games in \nwhich the Giants are playing in this stadium, which is, as Cowboy fans \nknow it, AT Stadium. You could fill AT Stadium 10 different times. \nThis is a huge stadium. People see the giant jumbotron on the roof of \nthis stadium.\n\n[[Page S4280]]\n\nYou could fill AT Stadium 10 times with the number of people in Texas \nalone who could lose their health care and lose their tax cut--$3,000, \non average, per person a year in Texas--if King v. Burwell is decided \nin favor of the plaintiffs.\n  But I will tell another story of a young woman named Celia. She is a \nself-employed Pilates instructor in Florida. Since 2005, she hasn't \nbeen able to find health care coverage. Since 2005, she has been \nuninsured. Now, she has been lucky because she didn't get really sick \nduring that time, but she only had a $900-a-month plan that she could \nfind. That was the cheapest. With the Affordable Care Act, Celia \nfinally has insurance. Celia is able to finally sign up for a health \ninsurance plan that has meant something to her because last year she \nhad a minor accident in her home. She had to go to the emergency room. \nWith her insurance, she received a bill of $57. She said, ``I couldn't \nhave even imagined what that would have cost me out-of-pocket--more \nthan I could ever afford.'' This year, Celia has reenrolled in another \nsilver plan, and for around $200 a month she knows that she is going to \nbe covered if she gets sick or if she has another minor accident.\n  In Florida--we think this is a lot of people, 832,000. In Florida, \nthere are 1.3 million people who are receiving health care tax credits \nright now. Now, I root for the University of Connecticut Huskies, and \nso we don't necessarily get to play in stadiums this big when you are \nplaying out of the American Athletic Conference. But everybody in \nFlorida knows The Swamp, and you could fill The Swamp 15 times over \nwith the 1.3 million people who could lose their health care tax \ncredit. Those are more people than attend Gator football games on an \nannual basis. Those are more people than attend Gator football games \nover a 2-year period of time. So 1.3 million people are going to lose \ntheir coverage in Florida alone.\n  So let's call a spade a spade. This is about health care. It is about \nour belief that for people who are working hard and playing by the \nrules, they should have a shot at being healthy, but it is also about \nkeeping people's tax bills low. If we ever contemplated a bill on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate that raised 1.3 million people's taxes in \nFlorida by an average of $3,500, my friends from the Republican side of \nthe aisle--our friends would be screaming bloody murder that this was \nan unjustifiable, unconscionable, unworkable tax increase on the \nAmerican people. But there is largely silence or temporary fixes and \npatches that are proposed.\n  So I am glad to join my colleagues to talk about what this means.\n  Now, I am from Connecticut and we have a State exchange. We have a \nState exchange. Conventional wisdom is that those of us who have State \nexchanges are going to be protected because we will continue to get \nsubsidies. But this is going to be a death spiral nationally. We have \nno idea how this will actually play out. When you have all of these \nsubsidies ripped away with the insurance reforms still baked in, even \nin States such as Connecticut, where you have a State exchange, we are \nnot immune. Nobody is immune. The primary victims here are going to be \nthe people in States such as Florida and Texas, as I mentioned. But \nthis is going to be a national catastrophe.\n\n  We hope we don't ever have to have a conversation on the floor of the \nSenate as to how to fix this. But we better be clear ahead of time as \nto what the implications are.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I know my colleague will seek recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first I want to thank my friend from \nConnecticut, not only for those very powerful words but for his ongoing \nadvocacy and leadership in the whole realm of health care and the \nimportance of something as basic as being able to take the kids to the \ndoctor, to make sure that you have the health care and the affordable \nhealth insurance that you need. I want to thank Senator Murphy, and I \nalso want to thank Senator Baldwin as well, my partner and neighbor \nfrom Wisconsin. Senator Baldwin is also a champion as it relates to \nquality, affordable health care for every American. Both of them are \nvery important voices and leaders on what we call the HELP Committee. I \nam their partner on the other committee that does the financing of \nhealth care, which is, in fact, the Finance Committee.\n  As the ranking Democrat--the lead Democrat--on the Health Care \nSubcommittee and someone deeply involved through the Finance Committee \nas we were putting together the Affordable Care Act, I think it is \nappropriate for me to be able to talk about legislative intent. That is \nwhat I want to do for a moment. We knew that in putting together a way \nfor everyone to be able to purchase affordable health insurance and \nindicating the expectation that we would, it had to be affordable.\n  I worked very hard to make sure that we had a tax credit system that \nwould essentially lower people's taxes so they could take those funds \nand be able to use those to be able to afford health insurance. In \nfact, at the time, Senator Baucus, the chairman of the committee, would \nrazz me and call me ``Senator Affordability'' in all the meetings.\n  We spent a lot of time focusing on how to make sure health insurance \nwas affordable. What is happening, as Senator Murphy said, is that if \nthe Supreme Court sides with the Republican position, 6.4 million \nAmericans are going to see tax credits go away and their taxes go up. \nThe worst part is that their taxes are going to go up and their health \ncare is going to go down. It is not a good deal for anybody.\n  Unfortunately, one of those States is my State of Michigan.\n  But let me talk a little bit more, first, about the broad picture, \nbecause we are looking at $1.7 billion in tax increases to people all \nover America if the Supreme Court sides with the Republican position. \nBasically, somehow we would have to say it is rational that Members \nfrom all of these States actually voted for a system that didn't help \ntheir own people, which makes absolutely no sense.\n  I can't believe anybody would do that. People wouldn't do that. \nBasically, we are saying that Members of Congress said that people in \nMassachusetts, where there is a State exchange, can have a tax cut, but \nif you live in Oklahoma you can't. Or if you live in the District of \nColumbia, right here, you can have a tax cut, but if you live in \nLouisiana, you can't. Or if you live in New York, you can have a tax \ncut, but if you live in Texas, you can't.\n  We can go right around looking at some of the numbers. I will not go \nthrough all of the charts that I did last week. I am very grateful for \nSenator Murphy for pointing out two very important States.\n  Let me talk about my State of Michigan. I happen to be a baseball \nfan. I am a big Detroit Tigers fan. When we look at Comerica Park in \nDetroit, it is a beautiful stadium. Mr. President, we welcome you to \ncome and watch a game and get our folks engaged in what they do best at \nwinning games. The fact of the matter is that you would have to fill up \nComerica Park five times--that is what it would take--to get the number \nof people who are going to lose their health care tax credits if the \nSupreme Court sides with the Republican position--228,388 people.\n  A couple of other States: In Illinois, 232,371 people will see their \ntaxes go up. In New Jersey, 172,000-plus will see their taxes go up. In \nOhio, another State right down from the great State of Michigan, \n161,011 people will see their taxes go up. Finally, in Pennsylvania, it \nis 348,823 people.\n  When we look at all of this, all of the States together, 6.4 million \npeople are going to see tax increases. It makes no sense that people \nwho represent these States would have voted for a system that raises \ntaxes on their people and doesn't give them the health care they need \nwhile other people, in fact, see lower taxes--tax credits that allow \nthem to pay for their health care and get affordable health care. It \nmakes absolutely no sense.\n  Let me also say this. When we look at the Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee in the Senate, the former distinguished chairman, Senator Max \nBaucus from Montana, all the time we were debating the Affordable Care \nAct, it was clear that Montana had absolutely no plan to set up their \nown exchange. They indicated that. In order for the Court to side with \nRepublicans, we would have to somehow believe that Senator Baucus would \nwrite a health\n\n[[Page S4281]]\n\ncare bill with tax cuts for other States and not his own State of \nMontana, which I can assure you he did not do. The same can be said for \nmyself.\n  The legislative intent is absolutely clear on this. What the Court is \ndeciding, in my opinion, is something that I can't believe they are \neven bringing in front of the U.S. Supreme Court because on the face of \nit, it makes no sense. Unfortunately, depending on how they rule, \nmillions of Americans--millions of Americans--will see their taxes go \nup and their health care go away.\n  The intent is very real. It is very clear in the Affordable Care Act. \nTitle I, page 1: Quality, affordable health care for all Americans. \nWhat was true 5 years ago when we wrote this bill is true today: The \nright to get the tax cuts has nothing to do with the State in which you \nlive. If you are in America, then you deserve the opportunity to \nreceive tax cuts that will make your health care affordable, whether \nyou get your plan on an exchange run by the State or through \nhealthcare.gov.\n  This is about moms and dads in Michigan and across the country being \nable to go to bed at night without having to say a prayer that says: \nPlease, God, don't let the kids get sick because what am I going to do? \nThe Affordable Care Act has provided an answer and the peace of mind \nfor millions of Americans. We certainly hope that the Supreme Court \nwill not take that away.\n  I would now like to yield the floor to the great Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/senate-section/article/S4281-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRAGEDY AT EMANUEL AME CHURCH\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN.

The victims and their families \nand the entire community are in my thoughts and prayers in the wake of \nthis unspeakable hate crime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/senate-section/article/S4281-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4281-S4282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. My colleagues and I gathered here on the floor today to \nshare some good news--something we unfortunately don't get to hear \nquite enough on the Senate floor. I am here today with Senators Murphy \nand Stabenow to talk about how the Affordable Care Act is working to \nstrengthen and improve the economic security and the health security of \nour families all across the United States.\n  Before the Affordable Care Act, over 50 million Americans were \nuninsured, and seniors paid higher out-of-pocket costs for their \nprescription drugs. Insurance companies wrote their own rules and \njacked up premiums. They denied coverage to people with preexisting \nhealth conditions. And in too many cases they dropped your coverage \nbecause you got sick, got older or had a baby.\n  Making the Affordable Care Act the law of the land marked a critical \nturning point that was essential to stopping these predatory practices \nand to giving our families the quality, affordable health care they \ndeserve and they need. Now the story has changed.\n  As my colleagues have noted, we have seen a historic reduction in the \nnumber of uninsured since Congress passed the Affordable Care Act in \n2010. Thanks to the law, over 16 million previously uninsured Americans \nhave received health coverage. This year more than 10 million \nindividuals have an affordable, quality health plan through the law's \nnew health care marketplaces. Nearly 8.7 million people are benefiting \nfrom the health insurance cost assistance provided under the new law.\n  I want to make it clear that the law's important benefits are making \na real difference in my home State of Wisconsin. In Wisconsin, over \n180,000 people have a quality insurance plan through our Federally \nfacilitated Affordable Care Act marketplace.\n  More than 90 percent of these Wisconsinites are receiving support to \nmake their coverage more affordable. More importantly, the insurance \ncompanies don't get to make their own rules anymore.\n  Because of the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies can no longer \ndeny coverage to the more than 2 million Wisconsinites who have some \ntype of preexisting health condition. Insurance companies can no longer \ncharge copays or deductibles for critical preventative services such as \ncontraception or cancer screenings for over 1 million Wisconsin women. \nThanks to the new law, 89,000 Wisconsin seniors on Medicare will see \ntheir prescription drug doughnut hole closed by 2022. In the meantime, \nthese same seniors on average have saved $913 each on prescription \ndrugs.\n  I could continue on to share more numbers that prove that the ACA is \nworking for our families in Wisconsin and in States across the country. \nBut the real proof, the real story is about the faces and the people \nbehind these numbers. It is about real people, real Wisconsinites, who \nare realizing the benefits of this law every day--real Wisconsinites \nsuch as Doug from Colgate, WI. At age 62, Doug was worried about \nbecoming uninsured. He and his wife had been insured through her \nemployer, but she was about to apply for Medicare. Fortunately, Doug \nwas able find an affordable health plan on the Affordable Care Act \nmarketplace. He did not have to lie awake at night worrying about being \ndenied coverage due to his recent heart surgery or another preexisting \ncondition.\n  There are real Wisconsinites such as Kim of West Allis. Kim runs a \nsmall costume shop. She lost Medicaid coverage when her son turned 18 \nyears old. She went without medical care because she could not afford \nit, even though Kim's doctor had found an indication of cancer during a \nhysterectomy. But then she signed up for the affordable coverage on the \nAffordable Care Act's marketplace that costs only $79 a month. And when \nshe renewed her coverage this year, her premium dropped to $20 a month. \nWithout this coverage and the premium tax credits, she wouldn't have \nbeen able to afford the extra checkups she needed to keep track of the \npossibility of the cancer emerging.\n\n  Joelisa is a real Wisconsinite. She is a community health worker. \nJoelisa lost her health insurance when she switched jobs but was able \nto quickly find a new plan through the ACA marketplace. The plan cost \nonly $87 per month with premium tax credits--a tremendous tax savings \nfrom her $500 monthly premiums through her previous job. Joelisa's \nhealth care coverage helps her manage several chronic conditions, \nincluding a metabolic syndrome that carries a high risk of progressing \nto diabetes, and it also makes sure that her daughter gets \nimmunizations and stays as healthy as possible.\n  One part of this story has not changed, and that part is that our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle don't want the Affordable \nCare Act to work. In fact, they continue to root for its failure. They \ndon't want you to know about Joelisa's lower health insurance premiums \nor about Kim's affordable plan that is helping her prevent cancer.\n  Regrettably, what they do want is crystal clear. They want to repeal \nthe law and turn back the clock to the days when only the healthy and \nwealthy could afford the luxury of quality health insurance. Since its \npassage, Republicans have spent countless days trying to repeal the \nAffordable Care Act by any and all means. They have tried to repeal the \nlaw in Congress by voting over 50 times--that is 5-0--to repeal all or \nparts of the Affordable Care Act. They have also tried to repeal the \nlaw by advancing politically motivated lawsuits, including the most \nrecent one that would rob millions of Americans of the health insurance \nthey have today. In Wisconsin alone, this would mean that over 160,000 \nhard-working Americans would see their taxes increase if they were \nstripped of their health insurance subsidies. That is enough to fill \nhistoric Lambeau Field twice. It is one thing to say the numbers, it is \nanother thing to imagine the number of Wisconsinites that affects.\n  It is not only Wisconsin families who would be impacted by this \ndevastation but also families in our neighboring States--neighboring \nStates with Federal exchanges--such as Michigan, Illinois, and Iowa.\n  Republicans have tried to say they have an answer, but their answer \nis really nothing more than another tired\n\n[[Page S4282]]\n\nattempt to dismantle and repeal the Affordable Care Act. One of these \nproposals was put forth by a Republican colleague from my home State of \nWisconsin. It would eliminate the health insurance subsidies in all \nStates, including the federally facilitated and State-run marketplaces. \nHis proposal would rob over 166,000 Wisconsin constituents of their \npremium support. His plan would attack the health care security of Kim \nand Joelisa. According to the American Academy of Actuaries, it would \nexpand the ranks of the uninsured and raise premiums.\n  Naturally, his proposal would hand over the reins to the insurance \ncompanies and allow them the freedom to take us back to the days when \nthey offered bare-bones plans without essential health care coverage. \nIn Wisconsin, this means going back to the days when there were no--\nnone, zip, zero--individual health care plans in the entire State that \noffered maternity coverage for families. We cannot go back, we must not \ngo back, and we will not go back.\n  We know the Affordable Care Act is providing access, affordability, \nand quality in the State of Wisconsin. We also know that in the United \nStates of America, health care should be a right guaranteed to all and \nnot just a privilege reserved for the few. That is what we have fought \nfor, and that is what we are going to continue to fight for as we move \nthe Affordable Care Act forward.\n  I wish to once again thank my colleagues, Senator Stabenow and \nSenator Murphy, for joining me on the floor this afternoon.\n  We have a case that is about to be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. \nThere has been effort after effort in the Congress of the United States \nto repeal or defund all or part of the Affordable Care Act, but it is \nproviding lifesaving coverage and good news for Wisconsinites and \npeople across America.\n  I yield back my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for up to 1 hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, I believe we are moving to a very \nimportant debate in the next week as the Senate moves forward with \nlegislation passed by the House of Representatives today that would \nadvance trade promotion authority. Trade promotion authority is a \ndelegation by the U.S. Congress to the President of the United States, \nthe Chief Executive--power that Congress has--authorizing and directing \nthat the President go forward to negotiate a trade agreement. This \ntrade agreement would then be brought back to the Congress and, through \nlegislation, would be implemented. But the trade agreement would never \nbe subject to full evaluation, full debate under the normal processes \nof Congress, nor would it be subject to any amendment. Indeed, if the \ntrade promotion authority passes the Senate--maybe next week--this \nlegislation, this trade agreement would be fast-tracked. That is why \nthey call it a fast-track agreement.\n  The fast-track would mean that the treaty--they call it ``agreement'' \nto avoid the fact that a treaty requires a two-thirds vote--that this \ntrade agreement would be brought up so that Congress--it would be on \nthe floor for 20 hours, it would be subject to no amendment, and it \nwould be voted on, up or down. It would be filed, for example, at 4 \no'clock on a Monday afternoon and voted on final passage the next day \nat noon. That is the kind of situation we are faced with.\n  Fast-track has been used for a number of years, a number of times, \nbut it has always been focused on trade--what the tariff rates might be \nbetween trading partners, details of trade agreements and definitions \nand those kinds of things. But this agreement is far more extensive. It \nis more extensive in the size and the scope of the trade agreement, the \nnumber of nations, and the fact that it would cover--if the Atlantic \nagreement is also approved--75 percent of the world's economy.\n  But even more significant to me is that it creates something that is \na nontrading entity, a commission, a transpacific international \ncommission. This commission will meet regularly. It will be created by \nlegislation with certain rules. But according to the Trade \nRepresentative who is negotiating in advance of this legislation on \nbehalf of President Obama and who is advocating for it, it will be a \nliving agreement. That means the entity itself, the commission, will \nthen be entitled to make the TPP say different things, eliminate \nprovisions it does not like, and add provisions it does like. In fact, \nthe commission is required to meet regularly and to hear advice for \nchanges from outside groups and from inside committees of the \ncommission so that they can update the situation to change \ncircumstances.\n  It is a breathtaking event. It says it is designed to promote the \ninternational movement of people, services, and products--basically the \nsame language used to start the European Union. In fact, I have \nreferred to it as a nascent European Union. I do not think that is far \noff base.\n  So we will have 12 Pacific nations come together in this agreement. \nWell, the trade agreement, I would suggest, colleagues, is not that big \nof a deal--a part of it. We have free-trade agreements with big \nnations, such as Canada, Australia, Mexico, Chile. The negotiations--\nreally have an impact with two nations of significance: Japan and \nVietnam. Why we can't negotiate trade agreements with them in a \nbilateral fashion? I don't know. Why do we have to create a \ntransnational union, an institution that has the power, as I will \nexplain, to impact the laws of the United States of America? It is not \nnecessary.\n  I voted for--it has not worked as well as we were told it would work, \nbut I voted for the last bilateral agreement with South Korea. South \nKorea, like Japan, is our good friend. We do not have any fundamental \ndisagreements with them. They are part of the civilized world and so \nforth. But they have a different view of trade than we have. They are \nmercantile. They have to be approached and considered in a different \nway. They just approach trade differently. They believe manufacturing \nand exports mean power. An actual study has shown not too long ago that \nmercantilism has enhanced their power. A nation with trading deficits \nlike the United States has had their power diminished as their trade \ndeficits have accrued.\n\n  So some of our colleagues reject mercantilism. It is not healthy to \ntrade for sure. We would like to see it go away. But it is our trading \npartner's policy. We have to deal with that reality when we negotiate \nagreements.\n  So what I will say, colleagues, is that this is a significant event. \nI see no reason that when we are attempting to create a trade \nagreement, it can't be like South Korea in 2012. Why do we have to \ncreate an entirely new transnational union with the power where each \nnation has one vote? The Sultan of Brunei--Brunei is one of the \ncountries, one of the 12--the Sultan of Brunei gets one vote, and the \nPresident of the United States gets one vote it appears, although from \nmy reading of the document it is difficult to fully understand what \nthey mean.\n  I would say, at the most fundamental level, this Congress should not \nfast-track any transnational union of which we are a part until we \nunderstand every word in it, we know exactly what it means, and the \nPresident can answer. I have asked questions. I have asked him what it \nmeans--the living agreement language--in a letter. No answer. I asked \nthe President of the United States: Do you contend this agreement will \nreduce the big trade deficit we have or will it increase the trade \ndeficit? They don't answer. The only thing advocates for this treaty \nsay is that it will advance or enhance employment in the exporting \nindustry. That is the only statement they have made. Why are they being \ncareful about that? I have listened to them. No one has ever said much \nmore than that.\n  Well, in 2011, the President of the United States asserted, when he \nwas promoting the trade agreement with South Korea--this was his \nstatement:\n\n\n[[Page S4283]]\n\n\n       We don't simply want to be an economy that consumes other \n     country's goods. We want to be building and exporting the \n     goods that create jobs here in America . . .\n\n  Well, I agree with that. I think we do need to focus on that. We have \na sustained trade deficit, we have a sustained decline in American \nmanufacturing, and we have seen the wages of America's middle class \ndecline for over a decade--since 2000. We have not had increases in \nwages but a decline in wages. Part of that is because of a decline in \nmanufacturing, which is where higher wages are paid.\n  So this is what the President said with regard to the Korea Free \nTrade Agreement in his announcement back in 2011: ``I'm interested in \nagreements that increase jobs and exports for the American people.''\n  Well, I am, too. Well, what do we know about the Korea trade \nagreement? Did it work? President Obama said this at that announcement. \nI hate to recall what he said, but this is what the promise was when he \nmade this announcement. This is the President's statement that he \npersonally delivered: ``In short, the tariff reductions in this \nagreement alone are expected to boost annual exports of American goods \nby up to $11 billion.'' Annual exports would be increased by $11 \nbillion: ``This would advance my goal of doubling U.S. exports over the \nnext 5 years.''\n  So what happened after the trade agreement was signed? We have had \nless than $1 billion in 3 years in export increases to South Korea. \nThey have had a $12 billion increase in imports to the United States, \nvirtually doubling the trade deficit that was already large between our \ncountries.\n  This is a chart which shows how that worked. This black line is when \nthe treaty was signed. This is the trade deficit we have been running \nwith South Korea. This is zero. These are the deficits we have been \nrunning. Then when the treaty was signed--the agreement was signed--we \nhad a marked decline in exports. I wish it were not so. I voted for it. \nI bought into free trade and drank the free trade Kool-Aid. But did it \nwork? I have to say it hasn't worked yet. The reason? Mr. Clyde \nPrestowitz, who was a trade negotiator for President Reagan with the \nPacific and with Japan in the 1980s, said: They have nontariff \nbarriers. They have a mercantilist philosophy, and their philosophy is \nto buy the least possible from abroad, make everything they can \npossibly make at home, and export as much as possible, creating jobs in \ntheir country, creating surpluses in trade, creating wealth, they \nbelieve, and also creating power.\n  So I am concerned about this. I would just contend that we do not \nneed to be listening to Pollyannaish promises that these trade \nagreements are going to be so great for working Americans. They have \nnot been doing so well, in my opinion.\n  In fact, Mr. Prestowitz, whom I just mentioned, wrote a book on \ntrade. In January of this year, he wrote an op-ed for the Los Angeles \nTimes in which he said this. Instead of saying that we are going to \nhave a $10 billion increase annually in exports, let's look at the \nfacts. This is Mr. Prestowitz:\n\n       Over the last 35 years, the U.S. has brought China into the \n     World Trade Organization and concluded many free-trade \n     agreements, including one with South Korea three years ago. \n     In advance of each, U.S. leaders promised the deals would \n     create high-paying jobs, reduce the trade deficit, increase \n     [gross domestic product] and raise living standards. But none \n     of these came true. In fact, the U.S. non-oil trade deficit \n     continued to grow, millions of jobs are offshored and mean \n     household income has hardly risen since 2000. And economists \n     overwhelmingly agree that rising U.S. income inequality is \n     being driven in part by international trade.\n\n  That is President Reagan's adviser, a student of these issues who \nknows the Pacific well, who has written a book on trade and documents--\ncontrary to what some people say--that for the first 150 years of our \ncountry we had high tariffs on products imported.\n  Now, I believe we should eliminate tariffs. I believe we should move \nto trade, and I have supported that over the years. But I just have to \nsay I am less convinced that in a world where our partners aren't \noperating on the same policies we operate on, we have to be careful \nabout these agreements.\n  What our trading partners want, in substance, is access to the U.S. \nmarket, access so they can sell their products in the U.S. market and \nbring home wealth to their countries. That is their goal. It just is. \nThat is the way they approach life.\n  We want access to their markets. There is nothing wrong with that. \nThat is just what the world is about, and we are not negotiating very \neffectively.\n  So many of these countries have nontariff barriers that cause \ndifficult problems in trade. And we reduce our tariff barriers and we \nhave virtually no other barriers to the sale of foreign products in the \nUnited States, while we are not able to export competitive products \nabroad because of their nontariff barriers or even sometimes their \ntariff barriers.\n  I just wish to say at the beginning that I am not of the view that we \nhave to have a trade agreement passed this week and as part of it that \nwe have to pass some union with 12 countries each having one vote. I \ndon't see that has to be done.\n  If we don't sign a trade agreement that affects Japan or Vietnam \ntoday, what, is the world going to collapse? We have been getting along \nwithout it for decades, apparently, maybe since the beginning of the \nhistory of the Republic. So I would say let's slow down, and I say we \nhave to focus more effectively on what is good for America.\n  Fast-track is a decision by Congress to suspend several of its most \nbasic powers for 6 years, and any treaty that is created in the next 6 \nyears can take advantage of fast-track, be brought directly to the \nfloor, and be passed on a simple majority in the House and the Senate \nwithout an amendment.\n  One of my Republican colleagues said: Oh, well, we will have a \nRepublican President, and we can really put up some good trade bills. \nWho knows who is going to be elected President next year. Who knows if \nthe President, if he is a Republican, will send up a good trade bill. \nCongress has its duty to respond and study trade agreements and cast a \nknowledgeable vote on it. I don't think Congress, in this instance, \nshould give up its procedural processes for passing any important \nlegislation. I think a decision of the magnitude we are dealing with \ndeserves the most careful scrutiny.\n  This is not a trade agreement with one friend and ally, South Korea, \nit includes 12 nations in the Pacific. As soon as that is inked, we \nhave been told--and brought forward for passage in the Congress--and, \nhistorically, if we get trade promotion authority, the agreements that \nare presented have always passed. Once that is said and done, we will \nbegin to debate the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, \nTTIP. This transatlantic agreement, I suppose, will also have some sort \nof commission, a transatlantic union with powers that discipline and \nset rules outside the powers of the Congress.\n  Then there is going to be a services agreement that has already been \ntalked about. It has been leaked. Somebody leaked this. The other two \nare secret and cannot be seen by the American people.\n  So this services agreement has 10 pages on immigration. They are \ngoing to fast-track through changes in our immigration law. It is a \nvery serious matter. We have other issues out there like environmental \nlaw--that I will mention in a minute--that absolutely the President \nintends to advance through this trade agreement.\n  So those are three major treaties, and those treaties would impact 75 \npercent of the GDP of America, but that is not all. For the next 6 \nyears, any other treaty can be advanced in this same way. Presumably, \nthree or four countries could get together and agree on some \nenvironmental regulation, and it could be advanced as some trade \nagreement in a fast-track procedure through Congress.\n  So I think the burden of proof rests on the promoters of fast-track \nto demonstrate why three-fifths of the Senate shouldn't be required to \nagree, since this is so akin to a treaty, and/or advance this contrary \nto the proceedings of Congress.\n  Some of my colleagues have been saying that the trade promotion \nauthority, which the President is so desperately seeking--he has been \nhammering and bludgeoning his Members in the Senate and the House to \nget them to not vote their conscience but vote with what he wants--they \nsay we should pass it because it restricts the power of the President.\n\n[[Page S4284]]\n\n  Well, give me a break. If this were true, why would the President \nwant it? If he could do all he wants to do without Congress, why isn't \nhe doing it anyway? The entire purpose of fast-track is for Congress to \nsurrender its power to the executive branch for 6 years. Legislative \nconcessions include control over the content of the legislation. The \nPresident negotiates it, he brings it back, we can't amend it. He \ncontrols the content on it, the power to fully consider the legislation \non the floor. It is filed on one day and voted the next day. The power \nto keep debate open until Senate cloture is invoked--on any other \nlegislation, you have to get a cloture vote.\n  We couldn't get cloture on the Defense bill today. The Democrats \nrefused to give 60 votes to pass the bill that appropriates the funds \nto defend America, but the President would be able to bring up this \nbill with a simple majority and no ability for extended debate that the \nSenate is famous for, and there is the constitutional requirement that \na treaty receives a two-thirds vote.\n  When you are creating an international union, I mean, this crosses \nthe line. May be someone can technically say that somehow this is an \nagreement and not a treaty. I don't know, lawyers could perhaps \ndisagree, but Congress should assert its power.\n  We should say: Mr. President, we have seen you operate. We are not \ngoing to authorize you to enter into the creation of an international \nunion where you get to impose additional powers on us without creating \nit through the treaty process.\n  The legislation, finally, is not amendable, which is exceedingly \nunusual.\n  So without fast-track, Congress retains all its legislative powers. \nIndividual Members retain all their procedural tools, and every single \nline of trade text is publically available before any action is taken \nto grease the skids for its final passage. I think that is the \nimportant issue.\n  What about this union. What kind of powers is it that we are talking \nabout? I am of the belief that the President hasn't been a strong \nadvocate of trade. His supporters, many of them oppose this kind of \ntrade agreement. I am coming to believe the primary part of his \nunderstanding of the importance of this legislation, and why he is \nbreaking arms and heads over it, is the union, this international \ncommission that has powers that he believes will allow him to advance \nagendas. I don't say that conspiratorially. I will explain in a moment \nthat clearly seems to be one of the incentives this President has to \nadvance this legislation.\n  In a Ways and Means House document on a new Pacific union being \nformed by President Obama, a committee in the House hints at some of \nthis union's power, this international commission on trade:\n\n       If a proposed change to a trade agreement is contemplated \n     [by the TPP Commission] that would require a change in U.S. \n     law, all of TPA's congressional notification, consultation, \n     and transparency requirements would apply.\n\n  In other words, Ways and Means is intimating that this new secret \nPacific union would function like a third House of Congress, with \nlegislative primacy, the ability to advance legislation, sending \nchanges to the House and Senate under fast-track procedures--receiving \nless procedure, for example, than post office reform.\n  Further, this legislative fast-track, Ways and Means implies, is a \nchange in U.S. law, meaning that if this President or the next argues \nit is simply an Executive action, not a legal action, the Executive \nwould have a free hand to implement any agreement the Commission \ncreates without any approval of Congress.\n  Well, he said he wouldn't do that. Did you see where people who were \nunlawfully in the country were given a photo ID card by the President \nof the United States, were given a Social Security number, and it says \non the card ``work authorization,'' when the law says if you are in the \ncountry illegally you cannot have a Social Security number. He did \nthat.\n  He made a recess appointment in blatant violation of a definition of \nwhat a recess is. It took 2 or 3 years for the Congress to take it to \nthe Supreme Court, and in a unanimous 9-to-0 ruling, the Supreme Court \noverturned it.\n  So to say the President will not push his powers is naive indeed. How \ndo you stop it? Do you file a lawsuit to say the President shouldn't \nhave agreed to the Pacific Commission? Now a whole government \nbureaucracy is carrying out some global warming, some immigration, some \ntrade issues that Congress opposes.\n  Is a President capable of doing something like that, actually \ncarrying out ideas and policies that Congress doesn't approve of. \nAbsolutely. We have seen it time and again.\n  So this is not merely a loophole, it is a purposeful delegation of \ncongressional authority to the Executive and to an international body. \nWe should understand what we are doing. Not enough of our people have \nread some agreement and fully understand. The fast-track-implementing \nlegislation would have the ability to make these binding delegations \nbinding as a matter of law, it seems to me. Well, maybe not. It \nprobably wouldn't work that way. I don't think it works that way.\n  Look, that is why I wrote the President and I said: Mr. President, \nmake this part of the proposed TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership \npublic. Let's have the lawyers study it. You explain to us exactly what \nthese words mean--which he has refused to do. As a matter of fact, I \ndon't think the American people have fully grasped that this is not a \nnormal trade agreement but that it is the creation of an international \nentity.\n  Amendments to specify Congress retains exclusive legislative \nauthority and to actively prohibit foreign worker increases were \nblocked by the fast-track supporters. I offered legislation that would \nmake clear that the President couldn't alter the constitutionally \nexclusive power of Congress over immigration, and they refused to give \nus a vote. It is not in the bill. Why not?\n  I said: Well, we are not going to change immigration law.\n  Some administration underlings say that. They don't have the power to \nbind the President. They are not lawyers, perhaps. They don't know what \nthe words mean. The President of the United States hasn't said it \npublically, neither has his Trade Representative. He has come close, \nbut if you read his words, you will see that they were clever words, in \nmy opinion, with little meaning.\n  Fast-track supporters have tried to temper concerns about the \nformation of this transnational union and the subsequent Transatlantic \nTrade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, and the Trade in Services \nAgreement, TISA, that would be approved through fast-track by adding \nadditional negotiating objectives via a separate Customs bill.\n  However, negotiation objectives are, by design, not explicit or \nrealistically enforceable. They include such vague language as saying \nit must be the goal of the White House ``to ensure that trade \nagreements reflect and facilitate the increasingly interrelated, multi-\nsectoral nature of trade and investment activity.'' Those are the kinds \nof things in this language. That is not enforceable and has virtually \nno meaning.\n  One of the vague goals is ``to recognize the growing significance of \nthe Internet as a trading platform in international commerce.'' What \ndoes that mean?\n  Under the Ways and Means solution, TPP, TTIP, and TISA would \nestablish broad goals for labor mobility--immigration--allowing Ways \nand Means to say their negotiating objective, about requiring or \nobligating certain changes, had not been violated. And the President \nwould then implement those changes through Executive action or as a \nresult of fast-track where the laws have changed.\n  So, together, TPP, TTIP, and TISA--these three trade agreements which \nwe know are going to be advanced under fast-track--represent the goal \nof advancing the unrestricted global movement of goods and people and \nservices.\n  The European Commission--this is how they started, how they were \nformed. In explaining TISA--presumably the second major trade agreement \nthat would be submitted after the Pacific agreement and we move to \ntrade in services--this is how the European Commission explains what it \nmeans:\n\n       TISA is open to all WTO members who want to open up trade \n     in services. China and Uruguay have asked to join the talks. \n     The EU supports their applications--\n\n  The EU supports their applications because it wants as many countries \nas possible to join the agreement.\n\n[[Page S4285]]\n\n  TISA, of course, is the services agreement, and it will be worldwide. \nAnybody--even China--could be admitted to it. And the European Union \nCommission specifies that this services agreement, TISA, will be \nmodeled on the General Agreement on Trade in Services, GATS. This \nprovides insight into how TISA will affect U.S. immigration procedures.\n  When the United States became a member of the WTO in 1994, it signed \non to the GATS and committed to issue certain numbers of work visas \neach year, immigration visas. Congress's ability to control the U.S. \ntemporary entry programs has therefore been curtailed, as it would open \nup the United States to foreign lawsuits in an international tribunal.\n  In other words, they made an agreement on immigration visas under \nwork ideas as part of GATS in the WTO, and it violates and complicates \nour ability to enforce American immigration law. But if we enforce the \nlaw the way it is written, then we will get disciplined by the foreign \nbody. So when we sign up to a foreign body, we agree to rules. They say \nwe have to do this. So it is not being enforced.\n  So who wrote the law for the United States of America with regard to \nimmigration? Under the Constitution, it is Congress, but in reality, \nonce you join an international union, they have certain powers to \nenforce their will over the elected representatives, the accountable \nrepresentatives of the people of the United States, and some other \ngroup does it.\n  TISA--this services agreement--will, as the European Union suggests, \nrequire the United States to make additional legislative commitments on \na much larger scale. Do we understand that? When people are voting for \nthis trade agreement, this Pacific trade agreement, do we understand \nthat we are opening up a mechanism for the services agreement and for \nthe Atlantic agreement and perhaps another commission for the Atlantic? \nWill there be a commission set up under the TISA or TTIP bills? Do we \nknow? Do we want to give a fast-track to grease the skids for the \nPresident to negotiate such a thing as this? I think not.\n  The preamble to the South Korea Free Trade Agreement, for example, \nstates that a principal goal of the agreement is to ``create new \nemployment opportunities, and improve the general welfare . . . by \nliberalizing and expanding trade and investment between their \nterritories.''\n  In announcing that agreement, President Obama said:\n\n       Because we don't simply want to be an economy that consumes \n     other countries' goods. We want to be building and exporting \n     the goods that create jobs here in America and that keeps the \n     United States competitive in the 21st century.\n\n  That is what he said at that time.\n  So for too long the United States has entered into trade deals on the \npromise of economic bounty, only to see workers impoverished, \nindustries disappear, and manufacturing jobs decline. And we have been \non a steady decline in manufacturing jobs.\n\n  Mr. Dan DiMicco, one of the great CEOs in America and chairman \nemeritus of Nucor Steel, has written about these issues recently. He \nexplains that these deals haven't worked as they have been promised. \nThey haven't been, he says, free-trade deals at all. Instead, they have \nbeen ``unilateral trade disarmament,'' where we lower our barriers to \nforeign imports but they retain their barriers to our exports. Mr. \nDiMicco calls this the ``enablement of foreign mercantilism.''\n  So consider this in the context of automobiles. In May, the Wall \nStreet Journal--who is a free-trade entity for sure--published a news \nstory about how the American auto sector could be jeopardized by the \nTPP. The Wall Street Journal wrote:\n\n       In the transportation sector, led by cars, the TPP could \n     boost imports by an extra $30.8 billion by 2025, compared \n     with an exports gain to Japan of $7.8 billion, according to a \n     study co-written by Peter Petri, professor of international \n     finance at Brandeis University.\n\n  I think that is exactly accurate. We are not going to have an \nincrease in sales of automobiles in Japan. They have a 4 million \nautomobile surplus capacity. They want to hire their people and they \nwant to sell automobiles in Japan by producing automobiles in Japan, \nnot by importing them. They are mercantilists in their approach. They \nhave successfully resisted the penetration of their automobile market \nfor decades, and it is not going to happen under this agreement. It is \njust not. But if we reduce our little 2.5 percent tariff on automobile \nimports to America, this, on the Japanese, has some sort of balancing \neffect for their failure to allow their markets to be open, and we will \nincrease imports to the United States.\n  I am not condemning Japan. I am just saying that is how they operate, \nand we need to understand that and be more effective in defending \nAmerican interests.\n  So what we hear from the promoters of this deal is ``We believe this \ntrade deal will increase exports.'' Well, surely we will get some \nadditional ability to sell products abroad. Surely the President can \nhonestly say: If you sign the agreement with South Korea, well, we will \nhave increased exports to South Korea. And we did--$800 million instead \nof the $11 billion he promised. So we got a little increase, but they \ngot a $12 billion increase to the United States. And what did that do? \nThat diminished manufacturing in the United States.\n  Additionally, Clyde Prestowitz, who also served as trade negotiator \nunder President Clinton in addition to President Reagan, offered this \nwarning about the TPP:\n\n       Two intertwined elements pose a virtually insuperable \n     barrier to mass market auto imports in Japan. First, Japan's \n     capacity for vehicle production is 13 million. Annual \n     domestic sales are 4 million and exports are another 5 \n     million. That leaves 4 million vehicles equivalent of excess \n     capacity that constitutes a heavy cost burden on the Japanese \n     automobile industry. In the face of this, neither the \n     Japanese industry nor the Japanese Government will want to \n     make life easier for imports. The second structural element \n     is auto dealerships. By law U.S. dealers are independent of \n     the automakers and are free to sell any brand they wish. \n     Exporters to the United States thus find it easy to achieve \n     national distribution of their vehicles. Not so in Japan \n     where the automakers effectively control the dealers.\n\n  And that is the big automobile manufacturing companies. I don't think \nanybody will dispute that.\n  The essence of what he is saying is that we are really not going to \ngain market share in Japan, while they are going to gain market share \nin the United States. So that is why people would like to see tougher, \nmore vigorous negotiation of trade agreements.\n  Then there is the issue of currency manipulation. The President has \nmade clear that he has no intention of enforcing currency manipulation, \nwhich can easily dwarf the impact of tariffs. A former Federal Reserve \nChairman, a number of years ago--a great Chairman--said currency \nmanipulation can dwarf the impact of tariffs. By manipulating their \ncurrency, our trading partners can artificially raise the price of our \nexports while lowering the price of their imports. This improper \npractice has resulted in closed plants, shuttered factories, and the \nshifting of U.S. jobs and wealth overseas. And China is a huge player \nin that.\n  The middle class has shrunk 10 percentage points in the United States \nsince 1970, and real hourly wages are lower today than they were more \nthan four decades ago. That is hard to believe. The real hourly wages \nare lower than they were 40 years ago. The percentage of men age 25 to \n54 not working was less than 6 percent in the late 1960s; it has nearly \ntripled to 16.5 percent. The labor force participation rate for women--\nthe percentage of women in their working years who are actually \nworking--has fallen 3 full percentage points since 2009 alone.\n  We can't keep doing the same thing and expecting a different result. \nSo last month, I sent a letter to the President asking how he planned \nto use fast-track authority and what it would mean for American \nworkers. Those questions should not have been difficult to answer. \nThese negotiators should have been having that on the front of their \nnegotiating minds from the very beginning.\n  They have been working on this agreement for years. Not one of these \nquestions have been answered--not one. Nor have they been answered by \nanybody promoting fast-track. They won't answer these questions--the \nquestions about the trade pact, the text of which remains confidential, \nlocked downstairs in a secret room.\n\n[[Page S4286]]\n\n  This is a question I asked: Will it increase or reduce the trade \ndeficit, and by how much?\n  Shouldn't we know that? Shouldn't that be discussed? Shouldn't that \nbe the first thing we discuss? Is this going to help the U.S. economy?\n  No. 2, will it increase or reduce manufacturing employment and wages, \nincluding the auto sector, and accounting for jobs lost to imports?\n  No answer. Shouldn't we know that?\n  No. 3, will you make the ``living agreement'' section public and \nexplain fully the implications of the new global governance authority \nknown as the Trans-Pacific Partnership Commission?\n  Mr. President, shouldn't you tell us before we grease the skids to \npass a new international commission? Shouldn't we know what it is \nabout?\n  Congress should just say no on this, colleagues. We don't have to \nadvance fast-track. We ought to insist that at least this new \nCommission part be fully public. We want to study it before we agree to \ncommitting this great Nation to an entity that has very small nations \nwith the same vote as we have.\n  We asked: Will China be added to this Commission?\n  No answer. In fact, they have hinted they could be added, and \napparently the Commission can vote in new members without Congress \nvoting on it. That looks to me to be pretty clear, from my reading of \nit.\n  Will you pledge, we asked further, not to issue any Executive actions \nor enter into any future agreements impacting the flow of foreign \nworkers into the United States?\n  No answer. Not one of these questions has been answered. Yet they \nwant us to shut off debate, limit congressional procedural power, and \nadvance this legislation with no amendments. I don't see how anyone can \nsay Congress is not entitled to have at least these questions answered.\n  What about the American people? Shouldn't they know before their \nMembers vote on whether it is going to improve their job prospects or \nreduce their job prospects, whether a new factory will be opened in \nAlabama or New Hampshire or closed? So we need to know about this.\n  We must know what powers this Commission will have, and how the \nUnited States will be represented, how the votes will be counted, how \nthe Commission will impact immigration, environment or patent law, and \nhow Congress can deal with decisions of the Commission it doesn't like.\n  The TPP is the agreement sitting in the basement room that lawmakers \ncan go and read. It is the first secret fast-track agreement that would \nbe put into effect.\n  But the TPP is just the first of three colossal agreements. There are \ntwo more.\n  Under what rationale should we in Congress acquiesce to such profound \nchanges involving the global economy?\n  We will be talking about it in light of the rules of a new trade \nagreement--a new agreement that could impact 70 to 75 percent of the \nworld economy, and we haven't given it sufficient thought.\n  Fast-track is an affirmative decision by the Congress of the United \nStates to suspend several of Congress's most basic powers for the next \n6 years and to delegate those powers to the Executive. A decision of \nthis magnitude should only be based upon the most thorough debate, the \nmost complete evidence, and the most compelling data provided by \nproponents on the key questions at stake. A burden of proof rests on \nthe promoters of fast-track to compel three-fifths of the Senate to \nagree to give up these powers. Fast-track not only authorizes the \nPresident to enter the United States into Trans-Pacific Partnership but \ninto an unlimited group of agreements and partnerships in the future.\n  The President will sign these agreements before Congress votes on \nthem. He will then deliver implementing legislation to Congress that \noverrides previous law of the United States. This implementing \nlegislation cannot be amended, cannot be filibustered, cannot be \ndebated more than 20 hours, and cannot be subjected to the two-thirds \ntreaty vote in the Senate.\n  Well, I have been analyzing and thinking about this Commission--this \ntranspacific Union, it is fair to call it. This goes far beyond the \nnormal trade agreement. While it appears to give some respect to our \ndomestic law, this respect is undermined by the difference between the \ntrade agreement--the TPP--and the implementing legislation. While a \ntrade agreement alone may not trump U.S. law--although it could--the \nimplementing legislation necessary for the trade agreement would. \nIndeed, the implementing legislation is law. And as the last-passed law \nof the United States, it overrules any previous laws with which it \nmight conflict. Then it would appear that, by implementing the trade \nagreement, the trade agreement itself could have the impact of law.\n  So we pass a law that says: Mr. President, we agree with this treaty. \nNot a treaty--they call this an agreement. We agree with this \nagreement, Congress said, and the President implements it. Does it then \nbecome superior to any law in the United States? I think a good \nargument can be made that it does. We need to know that absolutely. \nCertainly, the implementing law states that the Congress agrees that \nthe United States will be bound by the obligations under the trade \nagreement. The President signs a trade agreement with 12 nations, and \nwhen we ratify that, we then say we agree. The United States is bound \nby these provisions. As part of the provisions we are bound by is a new \ncommission--one nation, one vote.\n  But there is a further danger. What happens if the Commission uses \nits living agreement powers--as it will--to alter the obligations under \nthe agreement? The Commission is empowered then to change its rules, \nclearly, by the powers given it. Is the United States bound by new \nrules that we never saw but are passed by the 12 nations?\n  What if President Obama or some other President has an agenda, and \nthey all get together and pass it? Is the United States bound by it? \nDoes Congress have no control over it?\n  Well, we don't sufficiently know. That is why we ought not to be fast \ntracking an international agreement until we have had it made public \nand it is studied by good lawyers who understand these things.\n  Is the United States bound by the new rules they have changed? Can \nthey add new members to the Commission? There are provisions about how \nnew members should be added in the document itself. Does it say the \nCongress has to vote to do that? Can China be admitted?\n  How about this. Can this new 12-nation body adopt environmental \nregulations or adopt liberal immigration laws? We have discussed these \nthings in Congress. Congress has rendered opinions and passed \nlegislation and rejected legislation. Can this Commission pass things \nthat impact and override the powers of Congress?\n  President Obama has said that climate change is one of his--actually, \nI think he said it is his highest--priority. His Trade Representative \nhas been open and frank about this. The Trade Representative has \nnegotiated this treaty. I am going to talk about that in a minute.\n  But some say: Jeff, you are wrong. But I don't think I am wrong. I \nthink the issues I raised are very real, and I believe the concerns I \nraised may in fact be what this new treaty requires. I believe this is \na plausible scenario.\n  But if you don't agree, bring the thing out, lay it out, bring \nlawyers in here, bring trade people, and explain every provision of it. \nBefore I am going to vote to fast-track it, count that down. Congress \nshould never fast-track any agreement for any transnational union that \nhas the power to bind this Nation.\n  Goodness gracious, every word should be studied, and all consequences \nunderstood. A vote for fast-track is a vote to erase valuable \nprocedural and substantive powers of Congress concerning a matter of \nutmost importance involving the very sovereignty of this Nation.\n  Without any doubt, the creation of this living Commission, with all \nits powers, will erode the power of the American people to directly \nelect or dismiss from office the people who impact their lives.\n  Do you remember that in England they woke up one morning and somebody \nin the European Union in Brussels had outlawed fox hunting? How did \nthis happen? They said: Well, it started just like this.\n  Well, you say: Jeff, this is an exaggeration. They wouldn't use the \nPacific\n\n[[Page S4287]]\n\nunion to advance political agendas outside of trade, tariffs, and those \nkinds of things. Well, let's look.\n  This is an article in the American Thinker, ``Fast Tracking an \nInternational EPA,'' by Howard Richman, Raymond Richman, and Jesse \nRichman. They are professors, I think, all three. But this is on the \nWeb site.\n  This is a statement by Mr. Froman, President Obama's Trade \nRepresentative. He laid out environmental protection as President \nObama's bottom line in trade negotiations--environmental protection. \nThis is a quote from the Trade Representative:\n\n       The United States' position on the environment in the \n     Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations is this: Environment \n     stewardship is a core American value, and we will insist on a \n     robust, fully enforceable environment chapter in the TPP or \n     we will not come to agreement.\n\n  If they reach an agreement on the environmental issues that Congress \nwon't pass, what happens then? The President signs off on it, votes for \nit, and then we will be disciplined by this Commission for failure to \nabide by the rules of the Commission.\n  His Trade Representative--I believe this is Mr. Froman--continues:\n\n       Our proposals in the TPP are centered around the \n     enforcement of environmental laws. . . .\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       Our proposals in the TPP are centered around the \n     enforcement of environmental laws, including those \n     implementing multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) in \n     TPP partner countries, and also around trailblazing, first-\n     ever conservation proposals that will raise standards across \n     the region. Furthermore, our proposals would enhance \n     international cooperation and create new opportunities for \n     public participation in environmental governance and \n     enforcement.\n\n  Well, that is a powerful statement. So there is no doubt that this \nPresident is intent on utilizing this agreement to drive his \nenvironmental agenda, whether the Congress or the American people agree \nwith it or not. He is not bringing it up to the floor of the Senate, \nbecause Democrats and Republicans have no intention of passing his \nenvironmental agenda. I am not worried. This is the President's top \nnegotiator on this trade agreement.\n  Mr. Joshua Meltzer at the Brookings Institute said this:\n\n       As a twenty-first-century trade agreement, the Trans-\n     Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) presents an important \n     opportunity to address a range of environment issues, from \n     illegal logging to climate change and to craft rules that \n     strike an appropriate balance between supporting open trade \n     and ensuring governments can respond to pressing \n     environmental issues.\n\n  Ensuring that governments respond to pressing environmental issues.\n  Who is going to ensure? Who has the power to ensure that the United \nStates meets some environmental standard somebody somewhere has set or \neven the President would like to see set? That is a serious matter. I \ndon't think we should treat it lightly.\n  I do believe that the American people are correct to be dubious about \nthis trade agreement. Polling data, as I understand it, clearly shows \nthat it is not supported by the American people. Yet forces are at \nwork, breaking arms and breaking hands and bludgeoning people into \nacquiescence to vote for this thing. It cleared the House by the \nnarrowest of margins. We had 62 votes when it passed through the \nSenate. They needed 60, and they got 62. The President was working, the \nRepublican leaders were working, the chamber of commerce was working, \nBig Business was working, money was working and wheeling and dealing, \nand pork projects were promised, I am sure, to get the votes to pass \nthis, to put it on a fast-track skid.\n  I am against it. I believe I am speaking on behalf of the working \npeople of the United States of America. I don't believe their interests \nare being properly considered. I am confident that if this agreement \ngoes into effect, the trade deficit we have with Japan and with Vietnam \nwill increase. Vietnam has 100 million people. We will not be much \ndifferent with places such as Canada or Australia or Mexico because we \nbasically have a free-trade agreement with them.\n  So it is not necessary that we create some 12-nation entity, some \ncommission. Why don't we just negotiate trade agreements that serve the \ninterests of the American people with Japan and Vietnam and ensure \nexactly that they comply with what they say, that their markets are \nopen to ours, as well as our markets are open to theirs? And we should \nhave some reasonable expectation that if we enter into this agreement, \nit will be good for American workers, not just Japanese workers or \nworkers in Vietnam.\n  I don't say we shouldn't have a trade agreement. I am saying let's be \nmore careful about it. Let's negotiate some trade agreements for a \nchange that advance the interests of the United States. We need to \nreduce our trade deficits, not increase them. They are weakening our \nGDP. The deficit subtracts from the current account trade deficit, \nsubtracts from our gross domestic product. It is not healthy for \nAmerica to have this kind of deficit.\n  One of the reports that was done lays out the argument that power \ncomes from this mercantilist approach. The Richmans' and the American \nThinker--I will quote a study, and it says this:\n\n       To see if mercantilism works--\n\n  This is the exporting drive of our trading partners and competitors--\n\n     [the Richmans'] conducted a statistical study of 11,623 \n     country-year observations for 186 countries from 1870 through \n     2007 using panel data models. The results: a strong \n     statistically-significant correlation between balance of \n     trade and national power. A favorable balance of trade is \n     associated with an increase in power (national material \n     capabilities), an unfavorable balance with a decrease.\n\n  This is what China believes to the core. This is what most of the \nAsian countries believe and act on. And apparently the Richmans' \nconclude--an objective study--that it is accurate. I don't know. But \nthose are the kinds of things we need to be careful about.\n  They have two scenarios they have laid out based on this scenario. \nThe first envisions 20 years of trade deficits at the rate of the trade \ndeficit we ran in 2007. The second scenario envisions balanced trade, \nwhere we don't have a trade deficit. Under trade deficit, their \ndefinition of ``national power'' declined 28 percent. So the national \npower declined 28 percent. Under a balanced trade, our national power \nremains basically stable, increasing by one-half of 1 percent. I think \nbalanced trade is certainly preferable. It is certainly preferable for \nworking Americans.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for your patience and allowing me to \nshare these remarks. It could be that I am wrong. Maybe trade deficits \nmake no difference. Maybe the loss of manufacturing is offset by the \nfact that we get cheaper goods. That is what some of our people in the \nUnited States say.\n  When somebody sends subsidized goods here and that closes the U.S. \nfactory and people can purchase their goods for below cost, we should \nsend those countries a thank-you note--no concern about the people who \ngot laid off and the jobs lost. I am not sure that model is now \nappropriate. Maybe it was 20 years ago.\n  I sort of believe that cheaper products was the ultimate goal and \nvoted that way, but I am reevaluating it. I think this country needs to \ngo through a serious evaluation of that, No. 1. Secondly, we \nabsolutely--colleagues, we absolutely should not fast-track a movement \nto the establishment of an international commission or international \nunion and maybe creating two more of them as part of two more trade \nagreements--the three trade agreements that will be part of fast-track \nif it passes. And, of course, any number of other trade agreements for \nthe next 6 years could be accelerated through this fast-track process, \nif it passes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/senate-section/article/S4287-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4287-S4290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HONORING VIETNAM VETERANS AND NORTH DAKOTA'S SOLDIERS WHO LOST THEIR \n                            LIVES IN VIETNAM\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I rise today to again speak about the \nNorth Dakotans who made the ultimate sacrifice while serving our \ncountry in the Vietnam war.\n  Since March, I have had the honor of learning from families about the \nlives\n\n[[Page S4288]]\n\nof their sons, brothers, husbands, fathers, and uncles who died during \nthe Vietnam war.\n  Before speaking about the 13 of the 198 North Dakota young men who \ndidn't return home from Vietnam, I want to first talk about Dan \nStenvold of Park River. Dan is a Vietnam veteran who survived the war.\n  While a student at Sargent Central High School, Dan thought about \njoining the military. After graduation, he felt he should grow up \nbefore going to college, and he enlisted in the Army. He was sent to \nVietnam and served three continuous tours of duty there. His records \ncount that he was in Vietnam for 802 days. After returning home from \nVietnam, Dan enrolled in college at North Dakota State School of \nScience in Wahpeton so he could fulfill his dream of playing college \nfootball. The combination of Dan's time in Vietnam and a football knee \ninjury made Dan feel old, and he left college. He then had a 33-year \ncareer with Polar Communications in Park River.\n  In 1999, the North Dakota Vietnam Veterans of America voted him as \ntheir State president, and he has served in that position for the last \n16 years. For the last 6 years, he has served on the National Board of \nVietnam Veterans of America. The national president asked him to run \nfor another 2-year term, and I wish Dan well in that upcoming election.\n  Dan also serves his community as a member of the DAV, AMVETS, VFW, \nand the American Legion, and he is currently in his third term as mayor \nof the city of Park River in North Dakota.\n  Dan is proud of his three wonderful children and seven grandchildren.\n  Agent Orange exposure education is one of his top priorities. He has \nseen his own family affected by the side effects of Agent Orange. Dan \nis grateful to the North Dakota State Legislature for once again \napproving funding for education and outreach related to Agent Orange \nexposure.\n  I thank Dan for his continuing service to our country.\n  And please, Dan, keep up your good work on behalf of the citizens of \nyour community and Vietnam veterans all across this country.\n\n\n                         Richard ``Rich'' Boehm\n\n  Richard ``Rich'' Boehm was born on June 23, 1951. He was from Mandan. \nHe served in the Army's 198th Infantry Brigade. Rich died on March 26, \n1971. He was 19 years old.\n  Rich was one of six children. All three boys served our country in \nthe military--Marvin and Clarence in the Army National Guard and Rich \nin the Army.\n  Rich served in Vietnam with Myron Johnson from Mandaree, and they \nbecame very close friends. Rich was engaged, and Myron was going to be \nhis best man.\n  Keith Nolan's book ``Sappers in the Wire: The Life and Death of \nFirebase Mary Ann'' includes details of the day Rich and Myron died. \nRich and Myron were in a foxhole together, ran for safety, and were \nboth shot in the back and killed.\n  Dennis Bollinger was assigned to escort Rich's body home, and his \nfamily knew Rich's family. Dennis continues to serve our State and my \ncommunity of Mandan as the current city of Mandan chief of police. \nRich's brother Marvin says he is grateful to Rich's squad leader who \ncontacted him from Texas and shared memories and photos of Rich during \nhis time in Vietnam.\n\n\n                             Larry Jacobson\n\n  Larry Jacobson was from Norma. He was born on March 15, 1949. He \nserved in the Army's 1st Aviation Brigade. Larry was 21 years old when \nhe died August 26, 1970.\n  He was the second of six children and grew up on his family's farm \nnear Norma. He attended grade school in Norma and high school in \nKenmare. His best friend in high school, Craig Livingston, remembers \nLarry as a shy person who never had an enemy.\n  Larry's older brother remembers the week Larry was killed in Vietnam. \nThe family had been in Fargo celebrating his sister's graduation from \nnursing school. They had planned to host a party at home, too, but when \nthey arrived home, there were a sergeant and captain waiting for them \nto deliver the news of Larry's death.\n  This year on Memorial Day weekend, a large memorial was dedicated at \nthe Mouse River Park honoring Renville County veterans. The memorial \nincludes Larry's photo, images of the soldier's cross, and a helicopter \nlike the one Larry was riding in when it was shot down and he was \nkilled.\n\n\n                               Carl Woods\n\n  Carl Woods was from Bottineau. He was born June 8, 1933. He served as \na Navy pilot. Carl was 32 years old when he died on September 28, 1965.\n  His father Monte also served our country during World War I, and six \nof the eight boys in Carl's family served in the military.\n  Carl was an honor student in high school and college in Bottineau, \nwhere he made the All-Conference Football team. He then chose to enlist \nin the Navy. He served our country as a Navy pilot for over 12 years, \nreaching the rank of lieutenant commander.\n  While serving in the Vietnam war, Carl's plane was hit by an anti-\naircraft missile. Instead of bailing out over North Vietnam, Carl \nmaneuvered the plane 40 miles to the Tonkin Gulf, where he died after \nhis parachute failed to open.\n  The family is grateful to Carl's wingman for sharing with them the \ndetails of Carl's service and extraordinary flight skills the day he \ndied.\n  In addition to his brother, Carl left behind his wife Elaine and \nthree children, Mark, Jennifer, and Kathryn.\n  Carl is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n  This summer, the Bottineau AMVETS Post 25 is going to rename \nthemselves the Carl J. Woods Memorial Post 25 in honor of Carl's \nservice and his sacrifice.\n\n\n                             Joel Ellington\n\n  Joel Ellington was from Rolette. He was born January 21, 1945. He \nserved in the Navy. Joel was 22 years old when he died on June 26, \n1967.\n  Joel was the oldest of three boys. They were 3 years apart in age. At \nRolette High School, Joel played in the band. Right after high school, \nJoel enlisted in the Navy. After serving 2 years, he returned home and \nworked in the local grocery store.\n  Due to the Vietnam war draft, Joel reenlisted in hopes that his \nbrothers, Dennis and Doyle, would not have to serve in Vietnam. Dennis \nsaid of Joel's reenlistment, ``I think he did that to try to protect \nme; he didn't think they'd take two brothers.''\n\n\n                             David Haegele\n\n  David Haegele was from Napoleon. He was born on September 28, 1948. \nHe served in the Army's 25th Infantry Division. David died February 28, \n1969. He was 20 years old.\n  He was the fifth of eight children and grew up on his family's dairy \nfarm. His brother Tim also served our country in the Marines.\n  David's family said that he was such a kind person and a hard worker. \nThey remember his jokes and how much he enjoyed playing fun pranks on \npeople.\n  David's letters home to his family requested three things he and his \nfellow soldiers desired most: Kool-Aid, baked goods, and dry socks.\n  His mother gave David's niece Veronica a box she filled with David's \nthings, such as the letters he mailed home from Vietnam and his wallet. \nShe said that Veronica would know what to do with them. About 3 months \nbefore David's mother passed away at age 95, Veronica finished David's \nscrapbook, and his mother thought it was perfect.\n\n\n                              Garry Klein\n\n  Garry Klein was born November 22, 1947. He served in the Marine \nCorps' Alpha Company, 1st Battalion, 9th Marines, 3rd Marine Division. \nGarry was 19 years old when he died on May 27, 1967.\n  He was third from the youngest of nine children. His sister Arlene \nsaid that Garry was an easygoing kid who was lighthearted and never \ncaused any trouble. She remembers the cartoons he liked to draw.\n  Garry chose to enlist in the Marines to serve his country. When he \nwent home during Christmastime on leave, he told Arlene and her \nchildren, ``I won't see you again, but you may see me.''\n  He died almost exactly 1 year after he graduated from high school.\n\n\n                            Randy Lee Hansen\n\n  Randy Lee Hansen was born October 23, 1948. He was from South Dakota, \nbut he was living in Williston when he enlisted. He served in the \nArmy's 1st Signal Brigade as a field radio repairer. Randy died on \nEaster Sunday, April 6, 1969. He was only 20 years old.\n\n[[Page S4289]]\n\n  Randy's brothers, Jim and Mike, served our country in the Navy. His \nstepbrother, Arthur, also served in the Army.\n  Randy's brother, Jim, remembers that Randy liked to fish. Jim \nbelieved Randy had some great stories from his time fishing, as many \nfishermen do.\n  While his brothers, step-brothers, step-sister, and mother remained \nin South Dakota, Randy attended Williston High School, where his father \nwas working in Williston as a bricklayer.\n  In 1966, Randy enlisted in the Army before he graduated from high \nschool. The product of a service-oriented family, Randy felt it was \nimportant that he serve his country.\n\n\n                              Fred Johnson\n\n  Fred Johnson was born on November 3, 1939. He grew up in Watford City \nand Leeds. He served in the Army's 1st Cavalry Division. Fred was 27 \nyears old when he died on January 20, 1967.\n  Fred's wife's name was Jacqueline, and they had one son and three \ndaughters. Their oldest child, Richard, said that Fred loved to hunt \nand fish. Fred's dad was a game warden and Fred would go to work with \nhis dad sometimes. They would bring home injured animals and nurse them \nback to health. Among the most memorable animals were a white owl, a \nbaby skunk that behaved like a pet cat, and a raccoon that he kept for \n6 years.\n  After high school, Fred joined the Army. He served for 7 years before \nhe was killed in action in Vietnam on his second tour of duty.\n  Fred's son, Richard, remembers going fishing with his dad often and \nfishing together the week before Fred left for Vietnam on his second \ntour of duty.\n  Fred's brother, Robert, said he took Fred to the airport before he \nreturned to Vietnam the last time. Fred was scared and didn't know if \nhe would be back again.\n  Fred died shortly thereafter when his vehicle hit a landmine.\n\n\n                             Lyle Johannes\n\n  Lyle Johannes was born June 25, 1949, and spent his high school years \nin Kulm. He served in the Army as a radio operator. Lyle died January \n29, 1970. He was 20 years old.\n  Lyle was the oldest of four children. His youngest sister, Sally, \nsaid that Lyle was a happy person who didn't get rattled by anything. \nHe loved a good joke and had lots of friends. Sally said, ``You'd never \nwant to turn your back on him because you never knew what he might \ndo!'' He was a daredevil who loved motorcycles, had a number of \nHondas--and crashes--over the years. He spent a lot of time hanging \nover the engine of a car. He would buy old cars and fix them up. He \nalso worked on the cars of elderly women who lived in town. After high \nschool, he attended a technical college in Denver for mechanics.\n  Lyle was glad to be in the Army serving in Vietnam. He kind of \n``adopted'' a young Vietnamese boy. The boy really liked blue jeans and \na turtleneck sweater, so Lyle asked his mom to send them for him. She \nsaid she sent them as well as other things, but for packing material \nshe put popcorn in Lyle's packages. When the packages arrived, the \nsoldiers would eat the stale popcorn because they were so happy to have \nsomething from home.\n  Lyle was accidentally killed by friendly fire. Since his death, the \nfamily occasionally finds items someone leaves on Lyle's grave.\n  Lyle had shipped cashmere sweaters home for the family as Christmas \npresents in late 1969. The package arrived after his funeral in January \nof 1970.\n\n\n                              Eric Nadeau\n\n  Eric Nadeau was born November 12, 1948. He was from Grand Forks and \nwas a member of the Turtle Mountain band of Chippewa. He served in the \nArmy's 101st Airborne Division, the Screaming Eagles. Eric died May 26, \n1969, just days before his tour of duty was scheduled to end. He was 20 \nyears old.\n  He was the eldest child of his family and had three sisters. Eric's \nsisters remember how much he loved hunting game in the Turtle Mountains \nbefore he enlisted in the Army, and they think that is part of the \nreason why he joined the Armed Forces.\n  Everyone liked Eric. He had a circle of friends he grew up with, and \nif he was ever in town on break from the service, Eric and his best \nfriend Dale were inseparable. Wherever Dale was, one could find Eric, \nand vice versa.\n  His sister remembers a time when Eric came home and surprised their \nmother. She and her mother were playing bingo in the local church \nbasement. When he walked into the room, everything stopped, and \neveryone stood up and sang the National Anthem. Eric's mother was \nshocked and thrilled.\n  Eric died when his company was outnumbered and overrun. He jumped \nback in to save his crew members, and did save some, but was killed in \nthe process. Eric's sister thinks of Eric not only as her brother but \nher hero.\n\n\n                             Fred Jansonius\n\n  Fred Jansonius was born June 23, 1948. He was from Jamestown. He \nserved in the Army's 9th Infantry Division. Fred died February 2, 1968. \nHe was only 19 years old.\n  He was the oldest of four children. His sister, Claire, said that \nFred was a gentle soul and that his younger siblings looked up to him. \nIn high school, Fred was a good student and enjoyed photography, golf, \nand tennis. After graduation, he attended Drake University and studied \njournalism.\n  One of his Drake professors told Fred's class, ``To be a good \njournalist, you really need to see the world.'' Fred's draft number was \nhigh, but he was deferred for being in college. So he quit college and \ntraveled to New York City to see part of the world while waiting to be \ndrafted.\n  Claire shared some of Fred's letters he wrote home to his family, \nwhich revealed a talent for writing and the wisdom of someone who had \ndefinitely seen his share of the world in his 19 years. Many of his \nletters included vivid descriptions of Fred's experiences in Vietnam, \nso you could imagine Fred sleeping in a cemetery, using a bag of \ngrenades for a pillow or his fellow soldiers drinking Coca-Colas and \nusing their imaginations to create their own entertainment.\n  After Fred was killed in Vietnam, his casket arrived in Jamestown on \nthe train. The same conductor who drove the train the day Fred left to \ngo to basic training was driving the train that delivered Fred's body \nback to Jamestown.\n  About a year ago, one of Fred's officers, Lee Moorman, was traveling \nthe United States visiting the graves of the soldiers he knew in \nVietnam. Lee told Fred's family that Fred liked to read and was well \nliked by everyone.\n\n\n                            Gregory Krueger\n\n  Gregory Krueger was born March 1, 1949. He was from Garrison. He \nserved in the Army's 173rd Airborne Division. Gregory died July 17, \n1970. He was 21 years old.\n  He was the oldest of three boys. His brother, Stephen, said that \nGregory was hard-working, responsible, and well-liked by everyone who \nknew him.\n  Stephen remembers that Gregory loved everything to do with the farm. \nHe had fond memories of working with Gregory, hauling many bales of hay \non Saturdays. Their brother, Fred, continues to farm that family farm \ntoday.\n  Gregory had a special relationship with a nearby farmer who trusted \nhim at a young age to run his farm equipment and to help on the farm. \nGregory hoped to eventually take over the neighbor's farm after \ncompleting his service in Vietnam.\n  The Heritage Park in Garrison is currently in the process of adding a \nstone memorial in memory of Gregory's service and his family's \nsacrifice.\n\n\n                            Richard Hovland\n\n  Richard Hovland was from Williston, and he was born August 12, 1946. \nHe served in the Army's 20th Engineer Brigade. Richard was 21 years old \nwhen he died on January 31, 1968.\n  He was one of four children and his family and friends called him \nRicky.\n  Growing up, Richard was active in the Boy Scouts. He played baseball \nand sang in the choir. His sister, Deanne, remembers his beautiful \nvoice and him singing country music in their living room with his \nfriend, Charles Hanson.\n  Deanne thought she and her brother were the coolest when he would \ndrop her off at school in his Chevy Impala. She looked up to Richard \nvery much. When he left for Vietnam, she was in junior high and was in \nawe about what he was going to do.\n  Deanne said Richard was a fun-loving and family-oriented man who was \nespecially kind and good with their brother, Duane, who had Down \nSyndrome. Richard always mentioned Duane in his letters he sent home \nfrom Vietnam.\n  After completing his service in Vietnam, Richard had plans to go to \ncollege\n\n[[Page S4290]]\n\nand become a farmer. Deanne has drawings that Richard made of the \nfarmhouse he wanted to build on the land he was picking out in the \nWilliston area. His parents Arlene and Oscar often said Richard wanted \nto farm and loved the land so much that he didn't realize his true \ncalling was becoming an architect.\n  These are just some of the stories of North Dakotans who sacrificed \ntheir lives on behalf of our country in Vietnam.\n  I have to say that every time I do this, I wonder who would they be \ntoday. Would they be standing here instead of me? But I do know the men \nand women in uniform who serve our country continue to serve when they \ntake off the uniform. I also know our country suffers a great loss any \ntime we lose a young man or a young woman in service of our country. \nThat loss must be remembered, it must be respected, and we can never \nforget.\n  In this anniversary and commemoration of the Vietnam war, it is so \nimportant that we spend our time talking about the sacrifices our \ncountry and our servicemen gave in Vietnam and continue to give through \nthe ravages of Agent Orange--the issue Dan worked so hard on. They \ncontinue to suffer the post-traumatic stress that was part of that \nservice, and they continue to overrepresent in the homeless populations \nand populations of people who continue to be troubled from the \nexperiences they suffered in Vietnam.\n  So today we celebrate these lives and we think about who they might \nhave been. We offer a very humble and grateful thank-you to all of the \nfamily members who have helped us with these memorials but who have \nexperienced this loss in a way we will never understand.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse).

I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum \nunder rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, following today's encouraging vote over \nin the House, I wish to update the Senate on where we stand with regard \nto trade.\n  First, a brief look back at how we got where we are today. Back in \nApril, the Finance Committee came together to advance four trade bills \non a big bipartisan vote. It was everyone's goal at that time to \nconsider all of those bills and to begin the process of passing this \nsignificant trade agenda, and it remains everybody's goal now. That is \na point that has been proven many times over.\n  When our Democratic colleagues insisted on tying TAA to TPA, it was \ndifficult for most on my side to swallow. Many in my conference opposed \nTAA. But with the larger goal in mind--and understanding that for my \nfriends on the other side, TAA has often ridden alongside TPA--we put \nthe two policies together. This was not an easy lift, but in the \ninterest of moving forward, we compromised.\n  The process was not easy. We had a few close calls. We even worked \nthrough a filibuster to address our colleagues' concerns, but all the \nhard work paid off. It eventually led to a good result at the end of \nlast month, a 62-to-37 vote in the Senate in favor of more \nopportunities for American paychecks, for American workers and farmers, \nand for the American economy.\n  Unfortunately, though, as we all know now, that was not to be the end \nof the Senate's role in the process. That is OK. Not every plan turns \nout perfectly every time, but the point is that you don't give up. The \nAmerican people didn't send us here to sulk but to work through tough \nproblems. So that is what we are going to do.\n  Here is what it is going to take: No. 1, working together toward the \nshared goal of a win for the American people; No. 2, trusting each \nother to get there. I think we can do that.\n  So here are the next steps. In the judgment of Members of both \nparties in the House and in the Senate, our best way forward now is to \nconsider TPA and TAA separately. That means TAA will come second after \nTPA, but the votes will be there to pass it--reluctantly, not happily, \nbut they will be there if it means getting something far more important \naccomplished for the American people.\n  To that end, I just filed cloture on the motion to concur with the \nHouse-passed TPA bill. I then filed cloture on the AGOA and preferences \nbill--with an amendment that adds to that bill TAA. This puts the \nSenate on a procedural glidepath to consider and then pass the TPA \nbill, the AGOA and preferences bill, and TAA. So assuming everyone has \na little faith and votes the same way they did just a few weeks ago, we \nwill be able to get all of those bills to the President soon.\n  I know there is a fourth bill, too, the Customs bill. Given the \ncomplex and thorny procedural processes at work on that bill, we will \nhave to turn to that one as soon as we are able--but we will turn to \nit. It will have to go to a conference committee and then return to the \nSenate floor, where it, too, will be passed and sent to the White \nHouse.\n  I know it is hard to do, but if we step back a few paces and recall \nwhat we were all asking for just a few weeks ago, we should be able to \ntake some\n\n[[Page S4292]]\n\nsatisfaction in all of this. It means that before July 4, the President \nwill have signed TPA, TAA, and the AGOA and preferences bill, and we \nwill be well on our way toward enactment of a robust Customs package. \nAll of that together would be quite an accomplishment. All it is going \nto take is some hard work, some faith in one another, and everybody \nvoting the same way the next time they voted the last time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/senate-section/article/S4292-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4292-S4293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BOB LAWSON\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to one of \nKentucky's greatest teachers, and a man who has served the public good \nand the law for 5 decades. My friend Professor Bob Lawson, who has \ntaught law at the University of Kentucky College of Law for 50 years, \nwill be retiring this July 1.\n  Over the course of his 50 years of teaching, Professor Lawson has \nbecome one of the most respected lawyers and teachers in the \nCommonwealth. He is also well known and admired for his work outside \nthe classroom as the author of much of the Commonwealth's penal code \nfor criminal offenses and its rules of courtroom evidence.\n  Professor Lawson was born in a small town in southwestern West \nVirginia, not far from the Kentucky border, in a coal community. \nEncouraged by his father to get an education and escape life in the \ncoal camps, he attended Berea College in Kentucky and then earned his \nlaw degree at UK in 1963.\n  In 1965, he was asked to teach law at UK, which he has done ever \nsince. His specialty is Kentucky criminal law and evidence law. In the \n1970s, he worked with the State legislature to rewrite Kentucky's penal \ncode, which was in need of an overhaul.\n  I would point out that of Professor Lawson's thousands of students, I \nwas one of them. Bob Lawson was one of my favorite professors, and I \nstill recall his teachings today. I am also proud to call him a friend \nover the years. UK has greatly benefitted from having him as a member \nof the faculty for all this time, and he will be sorely missed.\n  I want to thank Professor Bob Lawson for his five decades of service \nto the University of Kentucky and to the Commonwealth. For 50 years he \nled Kentucky's brightest young minds into the legal profession, and his \nmany thousands of students serve as a fitting tribute to his legacy. I \nwish him all the best as he retires from UK and begins a new stage in \nlife.\n  The Lexington Herald-Leader published an article detailing Professor \nLawson's life and career. I ask unanimous consent that the article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  After 50 Years at UK, Professor Who Wrote Much of Kentucky Law and \n                 Investigated UK Athletics Is Retiring\n\n                            (By John Cheves)\n\n       Robert Gene Lawson, who is retiring July 1, wrote much of \n     Kentucky law and taught thousands of the people who practice \n     it.\n       Lawson spent 50 years as a professor at the University of \n     Kentucky College of Law, and he was dean twice. Among his \n     students were U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, \n     Gov. Steve Beshear, U.S. Reps. Andy Barr and Ed Whitfield, \n     and most of the Kentucky Supreme Court.\n       ``It's been really interesting watching my students go on \n     in life,'' Lawson, 76, said Friday, sitting in a cluttered \n     campus office that showed no sign of getting packed up any \n     time soon. ``They've done important things and mostly have \n     done them well.''\n       Lawson built an equally large reputation for himself \n     outside the classroom. He authored the state's penal code for \n     criminal offenses and its rules of courtroom evidence. He \n     harangued the General Assembly, with what he considers \n     limited success, for packing the state's jails and prisons \n     with the mentally ill and the addicted. He led investigations \n     into ethics violations at the UK Athletics Department, which \n     didn't win him many friends, and into the nightmarish Beverly \n     Hills Supper Club fire in 1977 that killed 165 people in \n     northern Kentucky.\n       ``He was Kentucky law,'' said Allison Connelly, a onetime \n     Lawson student who later joined him on the law school \n     faculty. ``He has done so much, when you look at his lifetime \n     of work, to make Kentucky a better place.''\n       The son of a coal miner, Lawson was born in 1938 in a tiny \n     Logan County, W.Va., community almost entirely owned by \n     Island Creek Coal Co. His father urged him to escape the coal \n     camp through an education. He worked his way through tuition-\n     free Berea College and then earned a law degree at UK in \n     1963.\n       After two years of practicing law, which he enjoyed, Lawson \n     accepted an invitation in 1965 to teach at UK.\n       ``I never thought I'd stay here,'' he said. ``I thought I'd \n     try teaching for a little bit, see what it was like, and get \n     back into my law practice. But it was a wonderful experience \n     from day one--for one thing: being around all of these bright \n     young people.''\n       Lawson's specialty is Kentucky criminal law and evidence \n     law. He wrote the books on those subjects, books that occupy \n     the shelves of law libraries and judicial chambers. In the \n     1970s, he worked with the legislature to rewrite the state's \n     penal code, which was hugely disorganized at the time. ``We \n     had never reformed our criminal laws in Kentucky, so you had \n     offenses that had been added one by one over a period of, \n     what, 150 years, 180 years, and a lot of inconsistency in how \n     these offenses were treated,'' he said.\n       To Lawson's frustration, within a decade of his penal code \n     work, the national ``war on drugs'' and concern over urban \n     violence led politicians in Kentucky and elsewhere to enact \n     much tougher sentencing laws.\n       It's one thing to imprison a murderer for decades, but \n     these new laws put even minor criminals behind bars for long \n     stretches, Lawson said. For example: In dozens of Kentucky \n     cases Lawson researched, people were convicted of the felony \n     of ``drug trafficking within 1,000 yards of a school'' after \n     police caught them with a small personal stash of drugs in \n     their homes or cars several blocks from a school.\n       ``Bob Lawson's philosophy was always, `You lock up the \n     people who genuinely scare you because they're dangerous, \n     they're violent, and for the other people, you see if you \n     can't rehabilitate them and make them productive members of \n     society,' '' said Fayette Family Court Judge Kathy Stein, a \n     former chairwoman of the state House Judiciary Committee.\n       In 1974, the year Lawson's penal code changes took effect, \n     Kentucky spent $11 million housing about 3,000 inmates at two \n     prisons. This year, the state expects to spend about $500 \n     million to keep about 22,000 inmates in 12 prisons and dozens \n     of county jails that are paid to hold the state's felon \n     spillover.\n       The General Assembly's effort four years ago to cut the \n     inmate population--at Lawson's urging--has fallen short \n     ``because they aimed too low,'' he said. ``They tinkered; \n     they did too little.''\n       Some county jails are so overcrowded that state inmates who \n     are serving five to 10 years must sleep on the floor and \n     seldom leave their cells, he said. There is little education \n     or addiction treatment provided, so felons are no better off \n     when they're finally released, and in many cases, they're \n     probably harder than ever, he said.\n       ``We got mad at the people who were committing criminal \n     offenses, and we veered away from a philosophy of trying to \n     correct them, which originally had been the thrust of our \n     justice system,'' Lawson said. ``We jacked up the penalties \n     on everything. As a result, we've created this huge problem \n     of trying to pay for all of this. We're just making things \n     worse for ourselves than they were.''\n       One of Lawson's other crusades over the years was trying to \n     be a watchdog of UK's lucrative and popular sports programs. \n     At the request of various UK presidents, he led \n     investigations into possible ethics violations, including \n     cases that brought about the departures of basketball coach \n     Eddie Sutton in 1989 and athletics director Larry Ivy in \n     2002.\n       In 2002, as a member of the UK Athletics Administration's \n     board of directors, Lawson cast the sole dissenting vote \n     against hiring Mitch Barnhart as athletics director. Lawson \n     said he didn't object to Barnhart, but the $375,000-a-year \n     salary was ``ridiculous'' compared to the more modest sums \n     paid to other UK faculty and staff. (Barnhart remains in the \n     job and now makes $600,000 a year.)\n       Over the past 50 years, the UK Athletics Department evolved \n     into its own universe with its own rules, Lawson said.\n       ``They have become an independent entity, separate from the \n     rest of the university, which is a problem,'' he said. \n     ``Their budget is their budget. The athletics department \n     regards the money that comes in for athletics as their money, \n     not the university's money.\n       ``And I guess I have felt, watching it through the years, \n     that they sort of lost what I would consider to be a \n     reasonable connection of these students to the university as \n     compared to athletics. Let me just give you an example. When \n     I first came here, the basketball season was 20 games. It's \n     now 40. I have my doubts about how they can be a legitimate \n     college student when they've got that problem.''\n       Lawson said he also regrets the explosion in tuition costs \n     at UK and other state universities around the nation, largely \n     because of shrinking public support from state governments. \n     The next UK budget will get just eight percent of its revenue \n     from state appropriations, the smallest share ever.\n       ``I think everyone who is 50 years old and older--including \n     me--ought to be ashamed of themselves for what we're doing to \n     our young people, making an education all but unaffordable,'' \n     he said.\n       ``When Mitch McConnell and Steve Beshear were in my \n     classroom, I doubt they paid much more than $100 a semester \n     for\n\n[[Page S4293]]\n\n     their tuition. They went to school almost without any cost, \n     substantially free,'' Lawson said. ``A resident law student \n     next year will pay between $21,000 and $22,000 in tuition. \n     You can't work your way through school at that level. I have \n     students graduating with $100,000 or more in loan debts that \n     will affect them for the rest of their lives. Shame on us.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/senate-section/article/S4293-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 EGYPT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week Egyptian government investigators \nworking on behalf of a judge who is overseeing a 4-year-old case \nagainst international and Egyptian nongovernmental organizations, NGOs, \nvisited the main office of the Cairo Institute for Human Rights \nStudies, or CIHRS, and asked for registration and financial documents. \nThe investigators reportedly tried to pass off an informal search \nwarrant as legal cover, but CIHRS staff made clear they couldn't search \nthe office without an official one. The investigators left, but their \nmessage was clear: a new crackdown is on the way.\n  According to information I have received, CIHRS is the second \norganization to receive such a visit this year. The same investigators \npreviously visited another organization, the Egyptian Democratic \nAcademy, and looked into their activities and funding sources. Four \nmembers of the academy have since been banned from leaving Egypt.\n  Some Senators may remember this case: it is the same one that led to \nthe conviction of 43 foreign and Egyptian NGO workers, including 16 \nAmericans, in 2013. The fact that the Egyptian authorities have decided \nto resuscitate this old case against these NGOs shows that President \nAbdel Fattah al-Sisi's administration is confident that it can silence \ncritical voices with little international objection.\n  Since the 2011 revolution, the government has made several efforts to \nreplace a harsh 2002 law on associations--unevenly implemented under \nformer President Hosni Mubarak--with even more draconian regulations, \nincluding a draft law that would have given the government and security \nagencies effective veto power over NGO boards of directors, foreign \nfunding, and very existence. Although a new law has yet to be passed, \nthe authorities have previously raided or detained staff from respected \norganizations such as the Hisham Mubarak Law Center, Human Rights \nWatch, Amnesty International, and the Egyptian Center for Economic and \nSocial Rights.\n  I am deeply concerned with the reinvigoration of this 4-year-old case \nand the message it sends about Cairo's intent to restrict independent \nNGOs. I am similarly concerned with recent press reports alleging that \nthe authorities have disappeared a significant number of young people, \nsome of whom later died, in a coordinated campaign, activists say, to \nsilence dissent. Such actions, if true, are deplorable and are no way \nto effectively combat terrorism and related insecurity.\n  Support for a strong and flourishing independent civil society is a \ncritical part of any pluralistic society, but we are seeing the reverse \nin Egypt. As the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nthe Department of State and Foreign Operations which provides \nassistance for Egypt, I am dismayed by the al-Sisi government's \nrejection of basic freedoms, whether it is the right to express oneself \nor the right to assemble. Such repressive tactics are not likely to \ncontribute to greater security or stability in Egypt--instead they are \nlikely to do just the opposite.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/senate-section/article/S4293-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4293-S4294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n VOTES ON NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT AND MOTION TO PROCEED TO \n                       DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the honorable \nmen and women in Maryland--including the 28,939 men and women on Active \nDuty, the 6,223 in the National Guard, our Reservists, and our civilian \nemployees and contractors--who are serving our Nation.\n  When I go around the State to bases such as Walter Reed National \nMilitary Medical Center, Fort Meade, Fort Detrick, the U.S. Naval \nAcademy, and others, I see the people who put their lives on the line \nevery day to defend America.\n  I support you. I am fighting to make sure you and your families have \nthe resources you need, from equipment, to training, to fresh, healthy \nfood at our commissaries. That is why today I voted against the final \npassage of the National Defense Authorization Act and the motion to \nproceed to the Defense appropriations bill. My vote was not a vote \nagainst our national defense; it was a vote for our national defense. \nIt was a vote to end sequester and a vote for military readiness.\n  How will voting against a funding bill help end sequester? Because it \nbrings us to the table now--in June--to agree on how we are going to \nfund the vital programs that we all agree are necessary to protect our \nNation. Not in September. Not in November. Not when another funding \ndeadline looms or when there is a clock ticking until the government \nshuts down. We are going to address this now, so the Senate can do its \njob to support our troops, our military families, our veterans, and our \nnational security.\n  National security is more than the Department of Defense. We need \ndiplomacy around the world to prevent conflicts when we can and end \nthem once started. So we need our State Department. We need embassy \nsecurity to keep our Foreign Service safe--and that is not funded by \nthe Department of Defense.\n  Our law enforcement agencies here at home also protect our national \nsecurity. The FBI, tracking down ``lone wolf'' terrorists; the Coast \nGuard, protecting our coasts from smugglers and drug traffickers; \nCustoms and Border Patrol; the Drug Enforcement Administration; \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement--all standing sentry to protect \nAmerica. Yet none are funded by the Department of Defense.\n  Nation states and organized crime are infiltrating our cyber \nnetworks, and we need the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and \nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology to help us protect \ndot-com and dot-gov. Those key cyber warriors are not funded by the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Finally, we need troops ready for duty. Sadly, only one in four \nrecruits can pass muster, many for lack of education or lack of \nphysical fitness. We need great schools turning out great graduates \nready to work. We need childhood nutrition to feed them healthy meals \nthat build healthy bodies. But education and nutrition are not funded \nby the Department of Defense.\n  In order make the Department of Defense successful, we need to stop \nhollowing out America. This means making sure our other agencies have \nthe resources necessary to meet national security needs at home and \nabroad.\n  However, the Republican Budget uses two sets of rules--first, pretend \nfunding for basic, essential military operations--things that are \nsupposed to be in the base budget--taken from the Overseas Contingency \nOperations, OCO, account that was created for funding wars. This \ngimmick allows $38 billion of extra defense spending by evading the \nbudget caps. The second rule the Republicans are using is saying: We \nare going to apply the sequester budget constraints to the rest of the \nFederal agencies. That is not acceptable, but we can fix it.\n  We need to end sequester for defense, without gimmicks, and we need \nto end sequester for the rest of our agencies. We need to make sure \ndefense has the right resources, but we also need to make sure that the \nother agencies that protect our country and make it great and are not \nincluded in the Defense bill have the resources they need too. Today, I \nvoted no to moving to the Defense appropriations bill, but that no is \nmeant to speed up the process of getting a better outcome for our \ntroops and our country.\n  Many of my colleagues fail to mention that we in Congress can go \nthrough these motions: We can pass funding bills, go to conference, and \nsend them to the President's desk. But that will do no good if the \nPresident vetoes these bills, which he has said he will do if they \ninclude budget gimmicks.\n  I hope that after having this vote, our leadership will sit down and \nnegotiate a new budget deal, now in June. We need to have a real \nsolution for the budget constraints that impact all of\n\n[[Page S4294]]\n\nour Federal agencies, so that our Nation can be protected and the \ngovernment can serve the people. That is what the people deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/senate-section/article/S4294-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RECOGNIZING THE SIXTH BIENNIAL JAMAICAN DIASPORA CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, today, I want to take a moment to recognize \nthe important relationship between the United States and Jamaica and \nthe role Jamaican Americans play in promoting trade and development \nbetween our two nations.\n  The United States has a robust and important relationship with \nJamaica. President Obama's trip to Jamaica in April 2015 illustrated \nthat we see Jamaica as a key regional leader and that we have a strong \ninterest in strengthening our bilateral security relationship with \nJamaica.\n  The United States is Jamaica's leading partner in trade, chief source \nof foreign direct investment, FDI, and home to the largest Jamaican \ndiaspora in the world. The more than 1 million Jamaicans in the United \nStates make crucial contributions to the Jamaican economy through \nremittances and support for friends and family still in Jamaica. Proud \nJamaicans like Delaware's Lorraine Badley connect business leaders with \nopportunities for investment and trade, host ministers and other \nJamaican officials, and strengthen community connections in both \ncountries.\n  From Bob Marley, who first emigrated from Jamaica to my home State, \nto former NBA basketball player Patrick Ewing and former Secretary of \nState Collin Powell, first- and second-generation Jamaican Americans \nhave made significant and lasting contributions to our economy, sports, \nart, and political system.\n  The Jamaican Government recognizes the critical role Jamaicans living \nabroad play in Jamaica's economic advancement, and this week they are \nhosting the Sixth Biennial Jamaica Diaspora Conference in Montego Bay. \nThe conference brings together members of the Jamaican diaspora from \nthe United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and other countries to build \nconnections and boost diaspora investment in the Jamaican economy. I \nwould like to commend the Jamaican Government for their efforts to \ndiversify their economy and become a regional leader in trade and \ninvestment.\n  The Diaspora Conference taking place this week will leverage that \nsupport into targeted investments to grow Jamaica's infrastructure, \nports, and logistics capacity to make it the central hub for the \ntransport of goods between Latin America and the United States.\n  As the Jamaica Diaspora Conference draws to a close, the United \nStates looks forward to seeing new partnerships between the Jamaicans \nand the Jamaican diaspora emerge to further an economic development \nagenda that will result in mutual growth and benefit both our \ncountries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/senate-section/article/S4294-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SISTER MARGARITA BREWER\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a 2015 Northern \nKentucky University Lincoln Award recipient, my friend and a community \nleader, Sister Margarita M. Brewer.\n  Sister Margarita has dedicated her life to serving the Latino \ncommunity in Greater Cincinnati. Originally from Panama, Sister \nMargarita has taken an active role in programs assisting the \nunderserved in her local community as well as in Central America.\n  Sister Margarita founded the English Language Learning--ELL--\nFoundation, Inc., in 2003 and continues to serve as its president, \nworking with Cincinnati public schools to help English language \nlearners become successful in their academic lives while fostering \ntheir cultural identities.\n  I had the privilege of being one of Sister Margarita's ELL tutors \nwhile serving in the House of Representatives. I had to stop tutoring \nwhen I was appointed U.S. Trade Representative, but during my time as a \ntutor, I had the chance to see her good work in action. More recently, \nmy wife Jane has worked as an ELL tutor and shares my admiration for \nSister Margarita and her service. Jane was honored to receive the \nEnglish Language Learning Foundation Tutor of the Year Award in 2014.\n  In collaboration with Latino Programs and Services' English Language \nLearners Program at Northern Kentucky University, she also helped \ndevelop NKY's Fun with Science Camp, exposing students to all fields of \nscience through hands-on learning activities.\n  Additionally, Sister Margarita has been involved with the Crossroad \nHealth Center, Family Service of Cincinnati, and Christian Community \nHealth Services.\n  I join the community in congratulating Sister Margarita, who has \nserved the people of Greater Cincinnati and Ohio with distinction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/senate-section/article/S4294-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish to honor Lincoln University \nof Jefferson City, MO, on the 125th anniversary of the signing of the \nSecond Morrill Act of 1890, which provided Lincoln University and many \nother historically Black colleges and universities with land-grant \ninstitution status. Lincoln University has provided student-centered, \npost secondary education opportunities to countless students from a \nvariety of backgrounds for more than a century.\n  On January 14, 1866, Lincoln University, at the time called the \nLincoln Institute, was founded by soldiers and officers of the 62nd \nUnited States Colored Infantry, following their service in the Civil \nWar. After its incorporation and the establishment of its board of \ntrustees, the institution opened its doors to the first class in its \nhistory on September 17, 1866. Lincoln Institute moved to its current \ncampus in 1871, where it would eventually gain land-grant university \nstatus under the Second Morrill Act of 1890.\n  Since then, Lincoln University, which changed its name from the \nLincoln Institute in 1921, has continued to provide a wide variety of \neducational specializations with over 50 bachelor's degree programs \nalong with master's degree programs in education, business, and the \nsocial sciences. Outside of its well-known, grant-funded research \nprograms, Lincoln has also distinguished itself with its popular \nnursing program and state-of-the-art aquaculture facilities.\n  Lincoln University is an outstanding and diverse educational \ninstitution that continues to impact future generations by looking \nforward without ever forgetting its roots.

I am proud to honor this chamber that gives so much \nsupport to local businesses and continues to fight to grow the capital \ncity's economy and job market.\n  Growing up in Carson City and spending a lot of time working in my \ndad's automotive shop, I learned the importance of a day's work and \nwhat it took for my father to keep his business. No doubt, Carson \nCity's businesses--small and large--play an important role in our \nState's growth.\n  It is through the hard work of the Carson City Chamber of Commerce \nthat the business community continues to strive and maintain a high \nquality of life for Carson City residents. Even when Nevada's economy \ntook a difficult turn, the Carson City Chamber of Commerce was there \nevery step of the way to lift local businesses back up. It helped \nowners adapt to an adverse economic climate through innovation, \ncreativity, and ingenuity. To say this chamber has had a positive \nimpact on Northern Nevada would be an understatement. The strong \nfoundation it has built will be felt for years to come.\n  Aside from helping local businesses expand and thrive, the Carson \nCity Chamber of Commerce also offers Carson City's entrepreneurs \nnetworking opportunities, social functions, and educational programs. \nIt is highly involved throughout the community, gathering volunteers to \nclean and revamp areas across the city, as well as supporting the \nsheriff and district attorney's offices. The chamber has 11 directors \nand 5 committee executives, all\n\n[[Page S4295]]\n\ndedicated to making Nevada's capital the best it can be. I am thankful \nfor their leadership and for the great things they are doing for \nbusinesses in Northern Nevada.\n  For the past 70 years, the Carson City Chamber of Commerce has \ndemonstrated professionalism, commitment to excellence, and true \ndedication to Nevada.

It \ngives me great pleasure to recognize Mr. Wright for both his bravery \nand his accomplishments during his time with the U.S. Army.\n  On March 24, 2010, Mr. Wright, who was serving in Afghanistan, led \nand acted as security for a squad of engineers and explosive ordnance \ndisposal team members working to diminish improvised explosive devices, \nIEDs. Soldiers from Wright's squad noticed three bystanders, one of \nwhom threw a grenade, landing between Mr. Wright and another sergeant. \nMr. Wright quickly responded by picking up the grenade and throwing it \naway from his group, ultimately saving the lives of those around him. \nHis lifesaving actions were heroic and selfless and remain invaluable \nto this country.\n  I extend my deepest gratitude to Mr. Wright for his courageous \ncontributions to the United States of America and to freedom-loving \nnations around the world. His service to his country and his bravery \nearn him a place among the outstanding men and women who have valiantly \ndefended our nation.\n  His commitment to helping those around him, as well as serving the \ncountry, demonstrates his unwavering selfless character. His actions \nrepresent only the greatest of Nevada's values, including a sense of \ncommunity and an obligation to help others.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I recognize \nthat Congress has a responsibility not only to honor these brave \nindividuals who serve our Nation but also to ensure they are cared for \nwhen they return home. I remain committed to upholding this promise for \nour veterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout the Nation. \nMr. Wright's sacrifice warrants only the greatest respect and care in \nreturn.\n  Mr. Wright continues to serve his community and now lives in Lovelock \nwith his wife and three children. He retired from the U.S. Army nearly \n4 years ago and earned a degree in environmental science from American \nMilitary University.

Mr. President, small businesses are often vital in \ndriving rural economies. The success of these entities provides crucial \njob creation and economic opportunity--especially among low-income and \nminority populations. This week I am proud to recognize Delta Fuel of \nFerriday, LA, as Small Business of the Week.\n  In 1977, a small bulk fuel distributor serving ranchers and farmers \nwas founded in the heart of the Louisiana and Mississippi Delta region. \nToday, Delta Fuel has grown to employ over 65 workers between their \neight operations--7 in Louisiana and 1 in Mississippi--serving a cross-\nsection of the agriculture, construction, aviation, marine, government, \nmanufacturing, automotive, emergency response, and trucking industries \nwith a variety of fuels, lubes, tanks, trailers, oil stations, and lube \nequipment. In a State known for its robust energy and natural resource \nindustries, Delta Fuel's reputation for dependability, reliability, and \nexceptional service standards has helped it become one of the fastest \ngrowing distributors in the southeast.\n  In rural east Louisiana, Clint Vegas, president of Delta Fuel, has \nled the company to exponential growth, earning the company numerous \nrecognitions as one of the most successful Hispanic-owned businesses in \nthe United States. Vegas' business skills have led to crucial job \ncreation for the region. Delta Fuel's success can be attributed in part \nto their being located in a Historically Underutilized Business Zone, \nor HUBZone. The Small Business Administration's HUBZone program was \ncreated to spur economic activity in economically disadvantaged areas--\nhelping small businesses in urban and rural communities gain \npreferential access to government contracting opportunities.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 1608. A bill to protect the safety of the national airspace system \nfrom the hazardous operation of consumer drones, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Consumer \nDrone Safety Act.\n  In recent years, privately-operated unmanned aircraft have grown in \npopularity and capability. In many ways, this is brand new technology.\n  It is worrisome that these new drones, which are capable of flying \nthousands of feet in the air and at speeds in excess of 30 miles per \nhour, are available commercially to completely untrained consumers.\n  This combination of advanced new technology and broad availability \nhas resulted in a rising number of reports of dangerous operations and \nnarrowly avoided mid-air collisions between drones and passenger \nplanes.\n  Our airports, pilots and travelers deserve meaningful safety \nprotections, as do the people on the ground, in our stadiums and on our \nhighways.\n  If we don't act, it's only a matter of time before we have a tragedy \non our hands.\n  The Consumer Drone Safety Act would put in place common-sense safety \nprecautions to minimize the risk of disaster.\n  As with any new technology, drones have attracted significant \ninterest and have promising commercial uses, including package \ndelivery, search and rescue, pipeline inspection, and agriculture.\n  I agree that the possibilities for this technology are promising, if \nproperly managed. That is why I support research to make sure that the \ntechnology is safe and can be used in ways that respect people's \nprivacy.\n  But there is no question that the technology comes with great risks, \nand its potential will never be developed if there is a big aircraft \ndisaster.\n  What if, for example, a drone accidentally flew into a jet engine and \nbrought down a commercial airliner? What if an airliner, having been \nhit by a drone on approach to a major airport like JFK or LAX, crashes \nin an urban area?\n  Safety must come first.\n  In the last year, unlawful drone use has proliferated and it's clear \nthat there is a high risk to public safety.\n  In July of 2014, following an expose by Craig Whitlock of the \nWashington Post, I wrote to the Federal Aviation Administration asking \nfor data about drone flights and accidents.\n  What I received from the FAA was--simply put--startling, and it \nreally crystallized for me the magnitude of the problem we face.\n  In nine months last year, from March through November, there were \napproximately 25 incidents where a drone nearly collided in midair with \na manned aircraft, sometimes requiring evasive action.\n  In this time period, there were more than 190 incident reports. Since \nJuly 1, at least one incident per day was reported to the FAA. For \nexample: On May 29, 2014, two aircraft on approach to LAX reported a \n``trash can sized'' unmanned aircraft at 6,500 feet above ground level.\n  On June 29, 2014, an airplane on descent to Dulles Airport reported a \nnear midair collision with a drone that flew within 50 feet of the \nplane at 2,800 feet above ground level.\n  On September 8, 2014, three separate airplanes reported ``a very \nclose call'' with a drone on descent to LaGuardia airport at 1,900 feet \nabove ground level.\n  On October 12, 2014, an aircraft near Tinker Air Force Base in \nOklahoma reported taking evasive action at 4,800 feet above ground \nlevel to avoid a drone that came between 10 to 20 feet of the plane.\n  On February 8, 2015, a Southwest passenger jet on its way to land at \nLAX and reported that a small red drone flew ``right over the top'' of \nthe plane at 4,000 feet above ground level.\n  These close calls are absolutely unacceptable. It is not just \nairplanes and airports that are at risk. For example, the general \nmanager of the Golden Gate Bridge reports that drones routinely fly \nover traffic on the bridge. One drone recently crashed onto the bridge \nroadway.\n  Drones equipped with cameras have also flown by the bridge in areas \nwhere photography is not permitted for security reasons, which is \nalarming.\n  The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection--CAL FIRE--\nis also growing increasingly concerned about the unsafe use of drones. \nIt reports that during last year's fire season, there were numerous \nincidents involving drones.\n  For example, in September, one of its helicopters, which was \nresponding to the Pasqualie fire, had to brake in midair to avoid \ncolliding with a recreational drone just 10 feet ahead of it.\n  In May, several drones were filming an active firefight in order to \npost videos online. If local police hadn't been able to identify the \noperators and convince them to stop, CAL FIRE believes it might have \nhad to shut down its aerial firefighting operations for the Poinsettia \nand Cocos fires to avoid the risk of collision.\n  As far back as 2012, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, has \nissued\n\n[[Page S4301]]\n\nwarnings about obstacles to the safe operation of drones, which include \nthe fact that many drones cannot ``detect, sense and avoid'' other \naircraft or objects in the airspace.\n  Drones are also plagued by a phenomenon known as ``lost link''--in \nwhich the remote connection between the pilot on the ground and the \naircraft is simply lost, resulting in a loss of command and control of \nthe aircraft.\n  The GAO's report also noted that many drones ``currently use \nunprotected radio spectrum and, like any other wireless technology, \nremain vulnerable to unintentional or intentional interference.''\n  GAO continued: ``This remains a key security and safety vulnerability \nbecause, in contrast to a manned aircraft in which the pilot has direct \nphysical control of the aircraft, interruption of radio transmissions \ncan sever the UAS's only means of control.''\n  Even the operators of consumer drones often know that their \noperations can be dangerous. Let me just read to you from one commenter \non Amazon's page for a popular consumer drone:\n\n       It just kept climbing as it disappeared into the clouds. I \n     lost visual, and was sure I'd never see my Phantom again. . . \n     . From calculations based on DJI's web site that it climbs [6 \n     meters per second, which means it attained an altitude . . . \n     somewhere between 5,000 and 7,000 feet. I didn't realize \n     until I got video back.\n\n  The commentator continued: ``This is `not' good, though, since until \nI saw the video, I didn't realize I was in controlled airspace. Do \n`not' do this.''\n  This comment, to me, is really emblematic of what is happening. \nConsumers with no training, certification, or instruction are buying \nhighly-capable drones with few technological safeguards.\n  There are precautions we can take to reduce the risk of a \ncatastrophic accident.\n  For example, after a consumer drone crashed on the White House lawn \nin January 2015, the manufacturer voluntarily released a firmware \nupdate to prevent flights near Washington, D.C.\n  The update was easy for consumers and commonsense. However, the FAA \nhas no authority to require all manufacturers to follow suit, or to \nspecify other areas that deserve similar protection.\n  Another easy precaution is education of drone operators. For example, \nthe FAA has partnered with the Academy of Model Aeronautics, the \nAssociation for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, and the Small \nUAV Coalition to develop an educational campaign called ``Know Before \nYou Fly.''\n  This campaign includes sensible advice about staying under 400 feet \nin elevation, keeping the drone within range of eyesight, flying sober, \nand staying away from pedestrians, vehicles, and airports.\n  However, the FAA can't require manufacturers to print this type of \ninformation and include it in the box for consumers when they buy a new \ndrone.\n  FAA needs the authority to require these basic safety precautions.\n  The Consumer Drone Safety Act calls for sensible new safety \nregulations in how drones are manufactured and used.\n  These new safety regulations apply only to consumer drones: civil \nunmanned aircraft that are manufactured for commercial distribution and \nthat are equipped with an automatic stabilization system or are capable \nof providing a video signal allowing operations beyond the visual line \nof sight of the operator.\n  Notably, this definition does not override Section 336 of the FAA \nModernization and Reform Act of 2012, which means that model aircraft \nflown for recreational purposes would continue to be subject to the \nsafety guidelines of a community-based organization rather than to \noperational regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  The bill has operational requirements\n  The Consumer Drone Safety Act directs the FAA to clearly lay out what \nis acceptable for consumer drones that are operated outside the \nprogramming of a community-based organization, detailing when, where, \nand under what conditions drones can be operated. This includes how \nhigh, how close to airports or stadiums, and under what weather \nconditions a drone may be flown.\n  The bill has manufacturer requirements.\n  Any drone advanced enough to fly autonomously should also be equipped \nwith advanced safety features, including geo-fencing.\n  But FAA does not currently have authority to require even the most \nbasic safety precautions like providing educational materials.\n  The Consumer Drone Safety Act authorizes FAA to set meaningful safety \nrequirements for manufacturers. These may include geo-fencing to govern \nthe altitude and location of flights, a transponder or other method for \npilots and air traffic control to detect and identify the drones, \ncollision-avoidance software, and precautions for the loss of a \ncommunications link, anti-tampering safeguards, and educational \nmaterials.\n  The bill also requires manufactures to update existing consumer \ndrones to meet these new requirements when feasible.\n  The bill would allow FAA to exempt particular types of consumer \ndrones from any requirement that is technologically infeasible or cost-\nprohibitive if other precautions enable safe operations.\n  The Consumer Drone Safety Act is straightforward, balanced, and \nnecessary. For the first time, it would allow the FAA to proactively \nrespond to the increasing use and capabilities of consumer drones by \nrequiring sensible precautions to protect the safety of our nation's \nairports and hospital helipads, stadiums and fairgrounds, bridges, \nelectrical infrastructure, highways, and city sidewalks.\n  Congress must not wait for a tragedy before taking action. I \nencourage my colleagues to join me in this legislation to ensure that \nconsumer drones are built and operated safely.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Casey, Mr. Whitehouse, \n        and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 1609. A bill to provide support for the development of middle \nschool career exploration programs linked to career and technical \neducation programs of study; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, as the labor market of the 21st century \ncontinues to transform, it will be critical to ensure that American \nworkers are equipped with the skills and expertise needed to meet the \nvariety of demands in the global marketplace It is critical that we \ncontinue to reform and update our education system to ensure that \nAmerica's students are prepared for cutting-edge careers. Today, many \nstudents enter high school and postsecondary education with little \nknowledge of the careers available to them outside of traditional \npathways. Research has found that few middle school students have a \nlack of understanding of how what they are learning in school relates \nto careers. With college costs continuing to rise, it is critical that \nstudents have exposure to the wide range of available work and career \nchoices early in their academic careers so that, by the time they enter \nhigh school, they are more informed about future paths and what they \nneed to do to pursue them.\n  Career and technical education, CTE, programs play a pivotal role in \npreparing students for America's job market, and are proven to help \nstudents explore their own strengths and preferences, and match up with \npotential future careers. However, a lack of Federal investment in \nmiddle school CTE programming often means students have to wait until \nhigh school for this exposure.\n  Middle school is a critical time when students explore their own \nstrengths, likes, and dislikes, and begin to form long-term career \ngoals. Studies have found that middle school students who participate \nin career and technical education development programs that promote \ncareer exploration skills are able to make more informed career \ndecisions by increasing knowledge of career options and career pathways \nthat match their interests. Additionally, these programs play a \npositive role in engaging students in the classroom and on their \nacademic success.\n  I am proud to introduce the Middle School Technical Education Program \nAct, which establishes a pilot program for middle schools to partner \nwith postsecondary institutions and local businesses to develop and \nimplement\n\n[[Page S4302]]\n\ncareer and technical exploration programs. This legislation will \nprovide support for middle schools to create career and technical \neducation programs that will provide students with introductory \ncourses, hands-on learning, or afterschool programs. Career guidance \nand academic counseling is vital to ensuring that our students \nunderstand the educational requirements for high-growth, in-demand \ncareer fields. Many times students receive this information too late in \ntheir academic careers.\n  We need to work to improve middle school education to prepare \nstudents for cutting-edge careers and expose students to the variety of \ncareer pathways. This legislation also requires that programs helps \nstudents draft a high school graduation plan that demonstrates what \ncourses would prepare them for a given career field. If we provide \nyouth with applied career exploration opportunities, they will be more \ninformed about future paths and what they need to do to pursue them. I \nam hopeful this bill will help highlight current shortcomings in middle \nschools, and instigate further discussion on the importance of \neducating youth early on the multitude of educational and career \npathways.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 1610. A bill to eliminate racial profiling by law enforcement \nofficers, promote accountability for State and local law enforcement \nagencies, reenfranchise citizens, eliminate sentencing disparities, and \npromote re-entry and employment programs, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I have introduced legislation along with \nSenator Cardin called the Building And Lifting Trust In order to \nMultiply Opportunities and Racial Equity, or the BALTIMORE Act.\n  The people of Sandtown-Winchester, the people of Baltimore, and all \nAmericans need to know they have a government on their side. Right now \nthere is a trust gap between the people and the police department.\n  Baltimore is my hometown. I have lived there all my life. But what \nhappened in Baltimore earlier this year could have happened anywhere, \nin anyone's hometown. I don't want to see this happen anywhere else. \nWhere there is broken trust, we must rebuild it. And where there is \nlost hope, we must restore it.\n  That is why I joined Senator Cardin in introducing the BALTIMORE Act. \nThis bill is a package of reforms intended to reestablish a sense of \ntrust between communities and the police departments that protect them.\n  First, the bill would ban discriminatory profiling by State and local \nlaw enforcement based on race, ethnicity, religion, or national origin. \nThe bill makes sure that if police departments are receiving Federal \nfunding, they are also adopting practices to cease the use of \ndiscriminatory profiling. It holds police departments accountable by \nrequiring them to share officer training information, including how \nofficers are trained in the use of force, racial and ethnic bias, de-\nescalating conflicts, and constructive engagement with the public. It \nalso authorizes a grant program to assist local law enforcement \nagencies in purchasing body-worn cameras.\n  We need to look at how our sentencing laws contribute to racial \ndisparity in our justice system. That is why this bill would reclassify \nspecific, low-level, non-violent drug possession felonies as \nmisdemeanors. The bill also eliminates the distinction between crack \nand powder cocaine.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes $200 million annually for the Department \nof Labor's Reentry Employment Opportunities Program through the \nWorkforce Investment Opportunity Act. This is important funding to give \npeople a hand up--not a hand out. It also encourages the White House to \n``ban the box'' in the Federal contracting process. This would allow \nemployers to eliminate questions about criminal convictions on initial \njob applications.\n  Baltimore has begun to heal. We will come together as a community and \na city to rebuild. But I do not want to see another great American \nhometown follow in Baltimore's footsteps. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DAINES:\n  S. 1625.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution to \nmark World Refugee Day, June 20, and to address the growing global \ncrisis of people forcibly displaced by persecution or conflict.\n  According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, for \nthe first time since World War II, over 60 million people have been \nforced from their homes and displaced in their own countries or forced \nto flee abroad. Last year alone, 14 million people were uprooted by \nviolence and persecution, most escaping conflicts in Syria, Iraq, South \nSudan, Ukraine, Burma, and Afghanistan. There are more and more \nprotracted crises, and the result is an exponential increase in \nhumanitarian needs.\n  The worldwide displacement from wars, conflict, and persecution in \n2014 was the highest level recorded and accelerating fast, escalating \nto 60 million last year from 51.2 million in 2013, and a dramatic \nincrease from the 37.5 million of a decade ago. We are on course to \nover double the number of refugees worldwide.\n  The increase since 2013 was the highest ever seen in a single year.\n  Syria is still the world's largest producer of internally displaced \npersons at 7.6 million and refugees at nearly 4 million.\n  The 60 million that I previously mentioned can be broken down to 20 \nmillion refugees, over 38 million internally displaced persons, and 1.8 \nmillion asylum seekers.\n  The magnitude of the Syrian disaster is perhaps the most shocking. \nAfter 4 years of conflict, the situation is increasingly desperate for \nboth the refugees and the host countries such as Jordan, Lebanon, \nTurkey, and northern Iraq. Since 2011, 4 million people have fled \nSyria. The futures of over 3 million Syrian children have been stolen \nbecause they have no access to education. Over 2 million Syrian women \nare in the neighboring countries trying to survive. Dangerous coping \nmechanisms are on the rise. More and more families are forced to send \ntheir children to work or marry off their young daughters. In the tiny \ncountry of Lebanon alone, there are over 300,000 Syrian refugee \nchildren who have no access to school.\n  It is hard to comprehend the demographic, economic, and social impact \nof millions of refugees in Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey. The number of \nrefugees in Lebanon will be equivalent to 88 million new refugees \narriving in the United States. Turkey has already spent $6 billion in \ndirect assistance for refugees in its care. At the same time, many \ncountries in the West have been extraordinarily reluctant to admit the \nmost vulnerable Syrians as refugees. While contributing generously to \nhumanitarian funding, the United States has only accepted about 900 \nSyrian refugees. Because Syrians are finding it increasingly difficult \nto find safety, they are being forced to move further afield. Since \nJanuary, over 100,000 people, mostly from Syria, have crossed the \nMediterranean in boats in search of protection in Europe--an extremely \ndangerous journey.\n  We know that the Syrian humanitarian disaster, which has destabilized \nan entire region, is not the accidental byproduct of conflict. It is \ninstead one result of a strategy pursued by the Assad regime. The \nUnited Nations Commission of Inquiry in Syria has documented that the \nAssad regime intentionally engages in the indiscriminate bombardment of \nhomes, hospitals, schools, and water and electrical facilities in order \nto terrorize the civilian population. ISIL and al-Nusra have also \nshelled areas with high concentrations of civilians.\n  In Syria's neighbor next door, Iraq, the number of people requiring \nhumanitarian assistance has grown to 8.2 million people. Three million \npeople have been forced from their homes. Half of the displaced are \nchildren.\n  To the south, in Yemen, there is a grave and escalating humanitarian \ncrisis. The country was particularly vulnerable even before this \nconflict. Now civilians throughout the country are facing alarming \nlevels of suffering and violence. Over 1 million have been forced from \ntheir homes and are now living in empty schools and other public \nbuildings or along highways.\n\n  We are also witnessing religious and ethnic persecution become part \nof the violent conflict that has pushed millions of people out of the \nregions of Sub-Saharan Africa. The unfolding human tragedy in South \nSudan, which is perhaps the most frustrating to me, never should have \nhappened. The violence engulfing that small country is entirely manmade \nand wholly the responsibility of the President and opposition leader \nand their affiliate militias and armed groups.\n  Each leader refuses to prioritize the well-being of his own people \nand instead continues to seek military advantage, violating multiple \nceasefire agreements and refusing to meet numerous deadlines for \nreaching a peace deal. It is hard to overstate the gravity of \nconditions in South Sudan. I fear there is no end in sight to the \nsuffering of the people there.\n  The 18-month conflict in South Sudan has already killed an estimated \n50,000 people and has displaced over 2 million more, including one-half \nmillion who fled to neighboring countries and over 120,000 sheltering \nin United Nations peacekeeping bases across the country. A nationwide \nfamine was averted in 2014, thanks largely to the assistance from \ninternational community.\n  But the World Food Programme recently warned that 4.6 million people, \nnearly half the population, will need food aid by the end of this \nmonth. Conditions in the country of Sudan are hardly better for those \naffected by the continuing conflict in Darfur. Attacks on U.N. \npeacekeepers are on the rise in Darfur. Military offenses by the \nKhartoum have caused well over 50,000 people to flee their homes this \nyear. The Khartoum has also expelled international nongovernmental \norganizations, NGOs, and is trying its best to drive out the U.N. \npeacekeeping mission in Darfur. This number does not include the \nhundreds of thousands of people who have fled the violence in the South \nKordofan and Blue Nile states. But there has been little information \nabout conditions in government-held areas in both of these states, as \nSudan has not allowed human rights investigators access.\n  In northeastern Nigeria, 1.5 million people have fled their homes due \nto attacks by the terrorist group Boko Haram. Boko Haram is estimated \nto have killed over 12,000 people, kidnapped thousands, including 276 \ngirls\n\n[[Page S4304]]\n\nfrom the Chibok School whose whereabouts remain unknown.\n  Over 74,000 Nigerians are refugees in Cameroon, another 100,000 \nrefugees are in the area. The global refugee trends are indeed \nalarming. The international assistance being provided is not keeping \npace with the scale of the problem. For example, almost halfway through \n2015, the United Nation's humanitarian appeal for Syria is only 20 \npercent funded. Yet, in the spirit of World Refugee Day, we must \nredouble our efforts to prevent conflicts that force families to flee \ntheir homes, villages, and cities. We must also then create the \nconditions to get these refugees safely back home.\n  First, we need to ask ourselves hard questions about how we can \nincrease the effectiveness of the assistance we provide. Most refugees \nlive in urban areas, not in traditional refugee camps. Refugees who \nlive in cities face unique vulnerabilities, which must change how \ninternational assistance is now being given. Moreover, protracted \ncrises are the new normal. Seventy-five percent of the world refugees \nare caught in long-term crisis situations, with many refugees displaced \nfor an average of 17 years. We need to use our humanitarian and \ndevelopment dollars more skillfully so we are providing durable \nsolutions to chronic vulnerabilities.\n  Second, the international community must get serious about protecting \nthe most vulnerable refugees: women and children. Women are facing \nhorrible threats in conflicts across the globe, where rape and sexual \nassault are being used as weapons of war, and as vulnerable refugees \nthey continue to be targets of gender-based violence. Moreover, \nchildren now make up half of all refugees worldwide. We must do more to \nprotect them from sexual exploitation and abuse, recruitment as child \nsoldiers, and early marriages. The United Nations Population Fund, \nMercy Corps, the International Rescue Committee, and Catholic Relief \nServices know how to provide targeted support and protection to women \nand children refugees, but we in the international community must fund \nthem adequately to do the job.\n  Third, we must strengthen the capacity of U.N. peacekeeping. As David \nMiliband, former British Foreign Secretary, now head of the \nInternational Rescue Committee noted:\n\n       At a time of cuts in defense budgets, new and asymmetric \n     threats, and record numbers of people fleeing conflict, the \n     case of strengthened and more fairly shared UN peacekeeping \n     is overwhelming. Peacekeepers, properly resourced and led, \n     have never been more needed and the consequences of inaction \n     never more evident.\n\n  Finally, we must do more to hold accountable the leaders who are \nresponsible for mass humanitarian atrocities. The U.N. Commissioner for \nRefugees recently commented that he continues to be shocked by the \nindifference of those who carry the political responsibility for \nmillions of people being uprooted from their homes. They accept forced \ndisplacement, with an impact on individuals, on countries, communities, \nand entire regions, as normal collateral damage of the wars they lead.\n  They act with the conviction that humanitarian workers will come and \npick up the pieces. It is clear the international humanitarian \ncommunity can no longer stanch the human misery brought on by this \ncallous indifference and criminal leadership. The international \ncommunity must hold those responsible accountable, those who break all \nthe rules in pursuit of their war aims.\n  To that end, it was a grave mistake that between October 2011 and \nJuly 2012, Russia and China vetoed three Security Council resolutions \nwhich were designed to hold the Syrian Government to account for its \nmass atrocities. It was also unfortunate that Sudanese President Umar \nal-Bashir was allowed to depart South Africa earlier this week without \nbeing detained again, escaping an arrest warrant from the International \nCriminal Court, where he would be on trial for crimes against humanity \nin Darfur.\n  In closing, we must recognize that as these conflicts proliferate, no \ncorner of the world will be left unaffected. On World Refugee Day, we \nrecognize that every person fleeing his or her home deserves compassion \nand help and to live in safety and dignity. We must recommit to work \nsmarter and harder to assist the world's most vulnerable people.\n  Next year on this day, I want to stand before the Senate again and \nspeak of the progress we have made and the lives we have saved by our \ncollective efforts. History will judge us accordingly if we fail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/senate-section/article/S4304-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4304-S4306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WORLD REFUGEE DAY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the United States has long been a safe and \nwelcoming home for those fleeing persecution around the world. The \nrefugees and asylum seekers who join our communities help to create new \nbusinesses, build more vibrant neighborhoods, and enrich us all. They \nare also a reminder of our history as a nation of immigrants and our \nAmerican values of generosity and compassion. Saturday marks World \nRefugee Day, and to honor it we must renew our commitment to the ideal \nof America as a beacon of hope for so many who face human rights abuses \nabroad.\n  Millions of refugees remain displaced and warehoused in refugee camps \nin Eastern Africa, Southeast Asia, and other parts of the world. \nOngoing political struggles and military conflicts in the Middle East \nand North Africa are dislocating large populations. Too many are \nwithout their families or safe places to find refuge. Some, though far \ntoo few, have been able to flee and rebuild their lives.\n  Peter Keny, one of the ``Lost Boys'' of South Sudan, is one of those \ninspiring refugees who escaped a civil war in his home country and has \nrebuilt his life in my home State of Vermont. He is just one of \nthousands of refugees Vermonters have welcomed over the years. Peter \nwas 19 when he came to Burlington in 2001, and in the years since he \nhas learned English, completed high school, and is earning a college \ndegree. In describing his voyage to the United States and ultimately to \nVermont, Peter told ``The Burlington Free Press'' that arriving here \n``was like a dream come true.'' I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record the article, ``A Found Man Returns to South Sudan.''\n  I am proud of Vermont's long history of supporting refugees by \nopening its communities, schools, and homes to those in need. It is not \nalways easy, but it is a powerful example of our belief in the most \nbasic ideals of human dignity and hope, and our commitment to \nresponding to the suffering of others. We are fortunate to have \nremarkable organizations like the Vermont Refugee Resettlement Program \nleading the effort with its decades of experience and award-winning \nvolunteer program, and the tremendous legal advocacy provided by the \nVermont Immigration and Asylum Advocates. The hard work of these and \nother organizations and the daily welcoming gestures of Vermonters all \nover the State have made Vermont a role model for the rest of the \ncountry.\n  On this year's World Refugee Day, it is also important to acknowledge \nthat there is more that we as a country can and must do. I remain \ndeeply concerned about the administration's expanded family detention \npolicy. The women and children it is placing in prolonged detention \nhave fled extreme violence and persecution in Central America. They \ncome seeking refuge from three of the most dangerous countries in the \nworld, countries where women and girls face shocking rates of domestic \nand sexual violence and murder. Here in the United States, we recently \ncelebrated the 20th anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act, a \nlaw we hold out as an example of our commitment to take these crimes \nseriously and to protect all victims. The ongoing detention of asylum-\nseeking mothers and children who have made credible claims that they \nhave been victims of these very same crimes is unacceptable. I again \nurge the administration to end the misguided policy of family \ndetention.\n  We must also do more to address the humanitarian crisis in Syria. \nAlmost 4 million Syrians are officially recognized as refugees by the \nUN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The vast majority of these \nare women and children, including hundreds of thousands of children \nunder the age of 5. The United States traditionally accepts at least 50 \npercent of resettlement cases from UNHCR. However, we\n\n[[Page S4305]]\n\nhave accepted only approximately 700 refugees since the beginning of \nthe Syrian conflict, an unacceptably low number.\n  Congress also plays an important role. Soon I will reintroduce the \nRefugee Protection Act to improve protections for refugees and asylum \nseekers and provide additional support and improvement to the national \nresettlement program and groups such as the Vermont Refugee \nResettlement Program. This bill, which I have long championed with \nRepresentative Zoe Lofgren, reaffirms the commitments made in ratifying \nthe 1951 Refugee Convention, and will help to restore the United States \nto its rightful role as a safe and welcoming home for those suffering \nfrom persecution around the world.\n  As we pause to take stock on World Refugee Day, let each of us \nreflect on what this great country means to those escaping persecution. \nLet us now and always live by and burnish the light of Lady Liberty's \ntorch, our eternal beacon of hope to those struggling to breathe free.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, June 7, 2015]\n\n                   A Found Man Returns to South Sudan\n\n                           (By Zach Despart)\n\n       Peter Keny sat on the side of the road in late December as \n     the sun disappeared behind the acacia trees. He had traveled \n     more than 7,000 miles from Burlington, only to be stranded \n     just north of the South Sudanese capital of Juba.\n       The taxi he hired an hour earlier had broken down, and he \n     was still 50 miles south of his destination, his native \n     village of Kalthok. The driver walked back to Juba five hours \n     earlier and had yet to return.\n       Keny took another delay in stride, as he had waited to \n     return home since fleeing his country's civil war 25 years \n     earlier. That decade-long journey, forged in tragedy and \n     perseverance, took Keny on a dangerous trek through the \n     Sudanese bush to a series of refugee camps and, finally, to a \n     new start in America.\n       For most of his life, Keny has straddled two worlds. Each \n     day he reconciles his life of opportunity in the United \n     States with a longing for his war-torn homeland. For years, \n     Keny balanced work to put himself through school and to save \n     for a trip to Kalthok, the village of his brief childhood and \n     keeper of the only memories of his parents.\n       Exhausted from two flights and a 12-hour bus ride from \n     Uganda, Keny tried to imagine what the reunion would be like. \n     As he peered through darkness toward Kalthok, he wondered if \n     anyone would remember him.\n\n\n                             A child of war\n\n       Keny was born in Kalthok in 1982, the youngest of four \n     sons. He lived with his mother and father, who like many in \n     the village were sorghum farmers. The Kenys belonged to the \n     Dinka tribe, the largest ethnic group in southern Sudan.\n       In November 1989, farmers had finished the annual harvest \n     as the wet season came to a close. One afternoon, 6-year-old \n     Keny and a group of boys played on the banks of the White \n     Nile north of Kalthok, as they often did when little else \n     occupied their time. Around five o'clock, the boys heard \n     gunfire and saw smoke in the village's direction. They rushed \n     toward home but were intercepted by a villager who told them \n     returning was unsafe. The boys, some of whom were Keny's \n     cousins, hid along a riverbank that night. Keny would never \n     again see his parents.\n       For most of the past 60 years, Sudan has been engulfed in \n     civil war. By 1989, the Second Sudanese Civil War already had \n     raged for six years. When war ended in 2005, 1 million to 2 \n     million people were dead and another 2 million were \n     displaced. Many of those killed or displaced were from the \n     Dinka tribe.\n       As a child Keny knew about the war, but until that day in \n     1989, fighting had never come to Kalthok.\n       ``We were all the way to the south of the country, and the \n     government militia did not have a problem with the local \n     people,'' Keny recalled in a recent interview in Burlington. \n     ``There was no tension.''\n       Unable to return to their village, Keny and his friends \n     faced a harrowing journey. The morning after the attack on \n     Kalthok, the boys crossed the river and joined a larger group \n     of refugees who were walking east, away from the fighting. \n     They walked each day until their legs could carry them no \n     farther. Each time the boys stopped to rest, they feared lion \n     attacks and roaming militias, which abducted children to use \n     as soldiers. Keny was shoeless and without a change of \n     clothing. He thought only of how to survive another day.\n       ``The worry was, `Are you going to make it to the next \n     town?' '' he recalled. ``You focused on living to the next \n     day, and that's all. There was nothing else you could do.''\n       The Sudanese government was able to distribute grain to \n     fleeing refugees. Keny and others received two cups each, \n     which they made last as long as they could. Keny had nowhere \n     to put the grain, so he wrapped it carefully in his shirt. \n     When the grain ran out, the boys foraged for wild fruit and \n     berries whenever they stopped to rest.\n       Keny said he was among an estimated 20,000 ``Lost Boys of \n     Sudan''--children separated from their parents during the \n     war. As many as half died of disease and starvation during \n     the journey to refugee camps.\n       After traveling several hundred miles over three months, \n     Keny crossed from Sudan into Ethiopia and settled with others \n     at Dimma, a refugee camp established by the Ethiopian \n     government in 1986 to handle an enormous influx of Sudanese \n     refugees.\n       Keny remained at Dimma for about a year, until spring 1991, \n     when rebels overthrew Ethiopia's government in a coup. The \n     boys fled back across the border and camped near the Sudanese \n     community of Pakok until 1992, when the United Nations moved \n     thousands of refugees to the newly opened Kakuma refugee camp \n     in Kenya. Keny would live there for nine years.\n       At the Kakuma camp, Keny learned English and went to school \n     daily. He said U.N. staff members encouraged the boys to \n     settle into a routine. But he could not stop thinking about \n     his family. Keny said some of the Lost Boys tried to find \n     their way back to their villages, but he judged the trip back \n     to Kalthok too dangerous. Refugees at Kakuma relied on new \n     arrivals and wounded soldiers seeking care at the U.N. \n     hospital for news about the war.\n       ``The hope was that I would see someone from my village, so \n     I might ask the situation of my family,'' Keny said. ``But no \n     one ever showed up. It was very difficult for me. I never \n     knew whether someone was still there or not.''\n       Keny received a surprise in 1998, when his oldest brother, \n     Riak, found him at the Kakuma camp. Riak had joined the \n     Sudanese army and had been granted a one-month leave. The \n     brothers had not seen each other in nine years.\n       ``It was one of the best days of my life, after going all \n     that time without seeing my family,'' Keny said.\n       But the reunion was bittersweet. Riak brought news Keny had \n     long feared: Their parents and brother were killed in the \n     war, and remaining brother had died of disease. Keny was \n     devastated, but relieved finally to know the fate of his \n     family. Riak tried to lift his spirits.\n       ``He was like, `Look, this is what it is. Someone has to \n     die for someone to live. If we all had to die, and you lived, \n     that's the best we can do,' '' Keny recalled his brother \n     saying.\n       Riak and Peter spent several weeks together, until the \n     soldier's leave expired and he returned to war. Keny never \n     again saw his brother. Riak died in 2006 after he succumbed \n     to injuries received years earlier.\n\n\n                         A new life in America\n\n       In 2001, when he was 19, Keny moved to the U.S. through the \n     federal Office of Refugee Resettlement. He had several cities \n     to choose among, but he picked Burlington because his cousin \n     Abraham Awolich already had settled there. Five others from \n     the Kakuma camp came with him.\n       For the first time in his life, Keny thought about his \n     future.\n       ``It was like a dream that had come true,'' he said. ``I \n     felt like this is the moment, if I don't have my parents, \n     maybe in the future I'll be able to meet my extended family. \n     Maybe I would be able to do something that my family would \n     remember me.''\n       In the U.S., Keny became proficient in English, earned a \n     high school degree and dreamed of attending college.\n       Now 32, Keny lives in a small apartment on Front Street in \n     Burlington with three other Lost Boys who immigrated to the \n     U.S. He works as a janitor for the University of Vermont, \n     where he cleans the athletic complex from 10 p.m. to 6:30 \n     a.m., five days a week. When school is in session, he attends \n     classes during the day, where he is a decade older than his \n     peers. In the next year and a half, he hopes to complete a \n     degree in community development and applied economics.\n       Keny is able to cram in only a few hours of sleep before \n     walking uphill to class, but he said he must work to afford \n     tuition if he ever hopes to find a better-paying job.\n       ``It's about being willing,'' he said, sitting on the front \n     porch of his home. ``If I don't do it, I will be stuck here. \n     I just tell myself I have to do it. Otherwise I don't have \n     options.''\n       Ever since moving to the U.S., Keny always hoped return to \n     visit Kalthok. He was able to contact several uncles by \n     telephone in 2002 and remained in touch with relatives \n     regularly. He secured a travel visa in 2006 but was unable to \n     use it, because a trip would have interrupted his studies at \n     community college.\n       ``The biggest fact was that I was struggling with my \n     education,'' Keny said. ``Every time I'd say, `If I go home \n     while I'm trying to complete this process, I might fall \n     behind.' ''\n       While studying, Keny kept abreast of news back home.\n       In 2005, civil war ended with a peace agreement that many \n     Sudanese hoped finally would put an end to violence that had \n     torn apart the country for half a century. In 2011, southern \n     Sudanese voted overwhelmingly to break off from the north to \n     form a new nation, South Sudan. The fragile peace collapsed \n     two years later, when South Sudan plunged into civil war. \n     Keny said Kalthok has so far been spared heavy violence, but \n     the community is inundated with refugees again fleeing to the \n     east.\n\n[[Page S4306]]\n\n       Finally, in 2014, Keny acquired a new visa and was able to \n     raise enough money for the costly trip, which required a \n     stopover in Europe.\n\n\n                         Return to South Sudan\n\n       Even after dusk in December, the air was still humid. \n     Keny's driver returned around 7 p.m. with tools, but couldn't \n     fix the car. Keny planned to spend the night on the side of \n     the road and at dawn walk back to Juba. He lay down in the \n     brush, careful not to wrinkle the dress shirt and slacks he \n     had put on for the reunion.\n       Keny was comforted that he at least had company: Some of \n     his cousins, who met him at the bus station in Juba, agreed \n     to wait until another ride could be arranged.\n       Around midnight, Keny's fortunes turned. A Somali trader \n     came upon him and agreed to drive him to Kalthok. As he \n     braced himself for potholes that shook the vehicle, Keny \n     tried to piece together fragmented memories of his youth.\n       ``Will I remember anyone in the village? Will I remember \n     the places I used to know? Is life still the same as when I \n     left? All those questions were on my mind,'' Keny said.\n       Although the trip was only 55 miles, the roads were in such \n     poor condition that Keny arrived in Kalthok at 5 a.m. It was \n     Christmas morning. He was exhausted and hoped to find \n     somewhere to sleep, but he found the entire village had \n     stayed up waiting for him in the church.\n       ``They were singing and dancing and praying for us, because \n     they heard we had car trouble,'' Keny said.\n       At 8 a.m., Kalthok's villagers held a welcome ceremony. \n     Keny said he recognized only a few faces, his maternal and \n     paternal uncles. But all the village elders remembered him.\n       ``They said, `You look just like you did when you left,' '' \n     he recalled. ``There was a lot of emotional reaction. They \n     talked about my family, my mom and my dad.''\n       Keny stood at the front of the sanctuary to greet the \n     hundreds of villagers who came to see him. After daybreak \n     they took him around Kalthok, but Keny couldn't pick out any \n     landmarks.\n       He asked his cousins to take him to a lake with a waterfall \n     he remembered from childhood. From there he looked back \n     toward the village, and memories came back to him. He was \n     able to point out his uncles' houses.\n       ``They said, `Yes, you now know. You recognize this place,' \n     '' Keny said.\n       Instead of having Keny stay in one of his uncles' homes, \n     villagers arranged for him to sleep in the church. Each \n     evening for the three weeks he was in Kalthok, villagers set \n     up tents and slept outside the church to be closer to their \n     returned son. Keny said many were surprised he came back \n     after settling into a prosperous life in the U.S.\n       ``They thought I would never go back, because I don't have \n     a living parent anymore,'' Keny said. ``But they still \n     believe I belong to the village.''\n       Keny had another reason to return to Kalthok, beside \n     visiting relatives. He wanted to ensure success of the local \n     clinic the Sudan Development Foundation, a Burlington \n     nonprofit, helped fund. The clinic is vital to Kalthok, Keny \n     said. In South Sudan, some villages are more than 100 miles \n     from a hospital. South Sudan's infrastructure is so poor this \n     can mean several days of traveling on foot.\n       Keny returned to Vermont in mid-January. He said leaving \n     his uncles and cousins was difficult, but his visa expired \n     after 30 days.\n\n\n                         Straddling two worlds\n\n       The son of Kalthok said he is unsure if he will ever move \n     back to South Sudan. Keny wants to help Kalthok and keep the \n     clinic operational. He worries war will come again to the \n     village.\n       ``I see myself living in two worlds, here and South \n     Sudan,'' he said. ``I want to help my people in any form they \n     need. If I ever get married, maybe I would bring my wife \n     over.''\n       Keny talks to his uncles regularly. A consequence of war, \n     inflation has made staple goods too expensive for many \n     villagers. A drought has raised the prospect of crop failure.\n       ``This month they are supposed to cultivate, but there is \n     no rain,'' he said, referring to May.\n       Keny wants to help his countrymen and -women in Vermont. \n     More than 150 Sudanese have resettled in Burlington since the \n     late 1990s, and many have started families here. Keny said \n     the small community rents out local halls and churches to \n     meet and celebrate holidays such as South Sudan's \n     Independence Day.\n       Keny hopes to help lease or purchase a permanent home to \n     aid local Sudanese in preserving their culture. He said \n     parents are concerned children will forget tribal languages \n     when they speak English outside the home.\n       Keny reflects on what his life would have been like if he \n     never had the opportunity to immigrate to the United States. \n     If he stayed in South Sudan, Keny believes he likely would \n     have been killed in the war or conscripted into the army. He \n     said he feels blessed to have been given the chance to start \n     a new life here, because so many Sudanese never had that \n     option.\n       ``It gave me the chance to look at the world differently,'' \n     he said. ``I have people who support me, and even though I do \n     not yet have a college degree, I feel I've learned enough to \n     help myself and help my people.''\n       Keny often thinks of his brothers and parents. In their \n     memory, he wants to make the most of opportunities he now \n     has.\n       ``You have this feeling that for the rest of your life, \n     you're going to be living knowing that you don't have someone \n     you'd be taking care of,'' he said. ``I just want to make \n     sure I live a better life, and live it in a peaceful way.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/18/senate-section/article/S4306-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 205--CONGRATULATING THE CHICAGO BLACKHAWKS ON WINNING \n                          THE 2015 STANLEY CUP\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Kirk) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Since its enactment, the African Growth and Opportunity \n     Act has been the centerpiece of trade relations between the \n     United States and sub-Saharan Africa and has enhanced trade, \n     investment, job creation, and democratic institutions \n     throughout Africa.\n       (2) Trade and investment, as facilitated by the African \n     Growth and Opportunity Act, promote economic growth, \n     development, poverty reduction, democracy, the rule of law, \n     and stability in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (3) Trade between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa \n     has more than tripled since the enactment of the African \n     Growth and Opportunity Act in 2000, and United States direct \n     investment in sub-Saharan Africa has grown almost sixfold.\n       (4) It is in the interest of the United States to engage \n     and compete in emerging markets in sub-Saharan African \n     countries, to boost trade and investment between the United \n     States and sub-Saharan African countries, and to renew and \n     strengthen the African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n       (5) The long-term economic security of the United States is \n     enhanced by strong economic and political ties with the \n     fastest-growing economies in the world, many of which are in \n     sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (6) It is a goal of the United States to further integrate \n     sub-Saharan African countries into the global economy, \n     stimulate economic development in Africa, and diversify \n     sources of growth in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (7) To that end, implementation of the Agreement on Trade \n     Facilitation of the World Trade Organization would strengthen \n     regional integration efforts in sub-Saharan Africa and \n     contribute to economic growth in the region.\n       (8) The elimination of barriers to trade and investment in \n     sub-Saharan Africa, including high tariffs, forced \n     localization requirements, restrictions on investment, and \n     customs barriers, will create opportunities for workers, \n     businesses, farmers, and ranchers in the United States and \n     sub-Saharan African countries.\n       (9) The elimination of such barriers will improve \n     utilization of the African Growth and Opportunity Act and \n     strengthen regional and global integration, accelerate \n     economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa, and enhance the trade \n     relationship between the United States and sub-Saharan \n     Africa.\n\n     SEC. 103.
